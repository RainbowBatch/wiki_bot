1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Work up a little bit about Alex

3
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:22,272
City Orchestra

4
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,576
Yeah yeah

5
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:30,464
Over the weekend

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,864
New pro wrestling Guerrilla wrestling.

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,400
Hell yeah

8
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,424
We were in the balcony

9
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:46,336
Okay I was just going to be the balcony like speeding in the balcony

10
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:52,992
IP section

11
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:59,392
Like all the wrestlers the locker room was up in the balcony it was absurd

12
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:01,696
Felt

13
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,512
Yes cuz everyone is going nuts for stuff in like

14
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:05,792
Are you like

15
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:10,912
The biggest response I had two things would just go

16
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,544
I'm not the guy I'm not the type because

17
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,104
And I wasn't

18
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:26,016
Falling out of that balcony

19
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:26,784
Tag team

20
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:30,112
Little bit of a little bit of a surprise appearance

21
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,392
They showed up

22
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,720
It's big as The Young Turks

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,768
Bigger bigger

24
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:46,240
They showed up and beat the s*** out of

25
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,544
What I'm talking about when we talk about it

26
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,944
They were trying to set up a match for their upcoming

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,272
Kicked in the van. Givens of piledrivers

28
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:03,136
Call metaphor for America right there

29
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,976
Philharmonic you can come up with

30
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,000
That's disappointing

31
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:12,352
Play was great lot of

32
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,888
People kicking each other in the face

33
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,936
Doing weird flip

34
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:19,264
Those could not be more diametrically opposed

35
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,336
Do you want to go to the symphony orchestra tonight

36
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:28,736
Cozy professional wrestling

37
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,808
This dude was like

38
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,536
It was

39
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:47,424
Really f***** up

40
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,472
Get Madeline

41
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:54,592
It's really hard to tell if it was fake or not I couldn't really like

42
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,664
I didn't respond like oh haha

43
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
Might be incredible

44
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:05,600
Totally absolutely

45
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136
That level of awareness

46
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:13,536
I was told from reputable sources

47
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,352
It was nuts

48
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,632

Look up button so Sports

73
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,751
Appreciative

74
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,543
Jordans

75
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:06,175
We are going over I'm sorry

76
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,991
It is another saying yes

77
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,295
Okay

78
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,879
Feelings and suspicions

79
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:21,023
We're going to start moving a little faster 100%

80
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,047
Intended

81
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,839
To do present-day episode 4

82
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,911
Good bit of Alex's shows

83
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,703
Couple days worth

84
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,007
And I'm not going to cover it

85
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
I'm just not

86
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,359
I'm not getting engaged with I'm not defending myself

87
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,431
Do you know who deserves an explanation

88
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,503
One of the reasons that I refused.

89
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,551
Maybe

90
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,367
If you want to play some basketball game

91
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:51,999
I'm sorry a lot of the episodes that I've been listening to end up like I start listen to him

92
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:56,095
Later I'll realize you still talking about the same thing

93
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
Had a lot of

94
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,655
Covering

95
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:02,239
Is trying to perpetuate the idea that all hate crimes are

96
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,775
They're fake because

97
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,639
Of the jumpy squat

98
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,039
Dealing with the present

99
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,575
Stop at least

100
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
This last week

101
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,367
Especially

102
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,183
Incredibly difficult to figure out an angle on

103
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,231
Because quite frankly

104
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,279
Know what's going on with that story

105
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,375
It's an incredibly confusing story every time there's an update it's like

106
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:40,127
Sending people text message giving them support or like food in money

107
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,943
Whatever you guys figure this out

108
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:48,575
Right right I'm torn in between two worlds of a lot of the details

109
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,111
The story

110
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,439
But that doesn't mean they're not true

111
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,487
On the other hand

112
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,255
I have

113
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,559
Zero trust of the Chicago Police Department

114
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,375
So I can't make heads or tails

115
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,167
Used to take a side on it and I

116
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
I can't

117
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,215
Deal with Alec

118
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
With that

119
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,383
Cuz I was I was wrestling

120
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,479
Figure out a way to likes to do an episode

121
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,807
Room for whatever the actual reporting on this is

122
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,343
Is got to come

123
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
So I was like

124
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,183
No I can go over tons of hate crime statistics

125
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,279
Do we have done that in the past.

126
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,607
Why don't I do a breakdown of

127
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:39,007
The 2017 Department of Justice report about the Chicago Police Department

128
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:49,503
Found it was unconstitutional on a math level

129
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,855
Those episodes

130
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
Frustrated

131
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,927
And like

132
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,719
What whatever

133
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,279
Whatever we can bring to that conversation

134
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,559
Is not now

135
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,119
It will be later when we know what the story is

136
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:11,263
On it now is irresponsible

137
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,311
And I think that one of the reasons

138
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,359
Wake up like we haven't been aware

139
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,919
Of the story

140
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,967
It would be wrong

141
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:27,135
It's one of those times where it's like I'm so grateful we don't do a new show because every part of this

142
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,207
Stories you see how shity

143
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,255
The media and everything really is

144
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:37,631
Everybody involved in this story is doing a job

145
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,423
There's a lot of jumping

146
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,471
To conclusions a lot of

147
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,751
A lot of people

148
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
Immediately

149
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:50,687
Sensationalize

150
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,735
Pong ball of Twitter

151
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,063
Actors bad faith argument

152
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:04,255
F****** ton

153
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,559
Black people

154
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,631
So I check in with the present Towers

155
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,679
So

156
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
Mercury facts

157
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
12

158
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,591
Because there's a

159
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,383
Clarity 280

160
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,919
Right

161
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:27,807
It makes it much more doable to understand

162
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,159
We're talking here about the 19th

163
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,975
December

164
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,559
Alex was pretty

165
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,607
Much clearer

166
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,399
That he is all about

167
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
To find a gun

168
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,983
On top of that

169
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,287
He was

170
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,567
Easing himself

171
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,615
Solidly saying

172
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,407
Daddy believed that the government

173
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,015
He's getting close to saying that victims were actually made

174
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,087
And the government killed them as

175
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,415
So here's where we start off on the 19th

176
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,439
Alex

177
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,535
But he likes to play with his staff member

178
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,031
Fractions

179
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
What

180
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,015
What

181
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
That's a headline

182
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
People talk

183
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,047
Like articles about

184
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,583
He do without

185
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,607
Before government

186
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,655
It's not important it's not as important as

187
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,727
The game of

188
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,287
I guarantee the government doing it

189
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:56,895
I'm pretty sure if you were to actually play that game by the rules that you said

190
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,735
You would all be at the very least on a watchlist

191
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,039
Also

192
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,343
It leads me to think that perhaps this

193
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,879
Lacks

194
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:13,023
Because if the thickest things they can pick up our things with a Google search

195
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,071
They aren't

196
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
What's a good boy

197
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,935
I think that speaks to a bad

198
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,263
So I started

199
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,615
The little bit

200
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:37,855
Furby saying that every government Department

201
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,975
With racist Furbies

202
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,559
I recognized

203
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,119
As I was editing the last episode that like

204
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,399
It really hurt us

205
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,935
Emotionally I think

206
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
Release Me

207
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,239
I started

208
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
10 minutes

209
00:11:55,775 --> 00:12:01,919
Of inconsequential

210
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,199
Threw that in there now

211
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,759
And that we talked to Jordan

212
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:12,159
It's more about hitting the ground with a

213
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:17,279
Little bit of momentum thrown out of a moving car

214
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:23,679
Instead you're giving us ice cream out of a moving car

215
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
Help

216
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:26,751
Soften it up

217
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
We find out

218
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,175
We've speculated that Alex

219
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
Cover

220
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,759
In order to make a day should claim

221
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:38,783
About Sandy

222
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:45,183
Maybe it is something like that

223
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,231
I think in this next clip Alex's

224
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,255
Has found his cover

225
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
But it's not

226
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,327
Some sort of external thing

227
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,143
It's an underling that he's going to

228
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,679
Under the bus

229
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,751
I don't know if he does but he probably should be smart

230
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,151
Eclipse

231
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:28,447
100

232
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,007
Christmas tree in Portland

233
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:53,791
So Alex is

234
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,583
He is not

235
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,911
Like it's my gut you think they did that

236
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,263
Right

237
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,311
The temperature

238
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:14,015
Who is Alex independently turn the corner please.

239
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,807
All it took was

240
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,599
This Rob dudik

241
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:23,999
But I said

242
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,047
Producing special report that Alex good point

243
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
Who is proof of things don't add up

244
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,143
The conspiracy angle that they decided to take

245
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,935
The idea of the second

246
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,007
Specifically the guy who's seen being arrested in the woods

247
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,567
Read Alex's describe

248
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,407
Number of people in the woods on December 14th

249
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,991
It kind of makes some sense if you look at the area around the school

250
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
Too far off

251
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,463
Most of the schools North North to Westside was Woods

252
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,999
As well as the east-southeast

253
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,071
With only one paved driveway leading to the school

254
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,631
Without Road obviously blocked off the woods

255
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
Preferable

256
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,471
Be there

257
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,311
Get better coverage than

258
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,847
And they were being allowed to

259
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,175
The police confronted them guns drawn questions

260
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,199
And release them

261
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,991
This isn't the case Alex's picking up

262
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,551
I just bring it up to highlight that there was a lot going on

263
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:24,671
What Alex is doing here is he's relying on the unreliability of first-hand account

264
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,487
In order to create the narrative that he wants

265
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,255
To deliver

266
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,839
In this case you combining two people into one story and possibly even

267
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,167
It's impossible

268
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935
It's just alter

269
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,983
See how report

270
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,543
You go too hard too early when you don't have any of the facts

271
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,311
Right

272
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,615
What are the things Alex's probably operating off

273
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,431
Is early reports about Chris band Fredonia

274
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,807
Chris was a parent who's on the way to the school to make the first grade

275
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,087
When he heard popping noise

276
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:03,327
He's five days away from retirement I'm amazed a little bit didn't get killed in

277
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:07,679
He tried to get into the school checking to see windows and doors before police approached him

278
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,471
Told him to get on the ground

279
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,823
He was detained briefly but was released and reunited with his daughter who is hiding in a

280
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,871
Another man who was

281
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:19,711
Detained briefly was described by a first-hand witness

282
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,503
The TV reporters on the scene

283
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,039
And here is the

284
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,343
Earlier

285
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,895
So this may come out of the woods

286
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:52,223
This man being described by this first-hand

287
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,855
It was being interviewed by police who determined to be an idiot

288
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,463
He saw flashing lights got really curious and decided to check out what was going on

289
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:07,839
But had nothing to do with the shooting long over by the time he was detained

290
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,423
Suck so hard

291
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,519
Oh my God Parents grieving children

292
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:21,663
Looking at you literally the worst situation that Curiosity could bring you to

293
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:28,063
Driving you never expect that's what you're going to walk home we're like trying to peek it

294
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:34,719
The over on the highway or whatever this was

295
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,791
High School

296
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,071
You could have been there would have been

297
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:45,471
High school kids walking in the woods looking for a thrown away p*** back one of them

298
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:52,127
It's crazy.

299
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,551
Which I think is a really good call

300
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:03,903
Really good call so we don't know who this guy is

301
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,279
He was dressed in camo pants

302
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,143
The story about this guy

303
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:19,007
Alex is going to the idea of a man of the woods from a different report

304
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,847
But in the chaos of the day and imprecise Reporting the came out of it

305
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,639
Benign

306
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,175
Became incredibly suspicious

307
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:31,039
The man who supposedly found in the policeman in plain clothes

308
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,063
Who is responding

309
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
Into the incident

310
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,367
There's a bit of confusion

311
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,903
Because he wasn't in uniform

312
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,463
He didn't run from the police or get arrested

313
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,231
People were just

314
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,303
Confused because of how it appeared 42 uniform

315
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
Cops

316
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,351
To be running with a non

317
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,119
Uniform

318
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:51,519
Right it made it look like a Chase of them were actually run together

319
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,543
Chase buddy

320
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,847
Ultimately there wasn't any

321
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,663
Disposed

322
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,223
The people in the woods ideas

323
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,015
And starts to Trickle

324
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:05,855
And this really highlights problems with Alex Jones does

325
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:10,719
He constructs the narratives out of the suspicions that our only reasonable because of the absence of

326
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,743
Information available

327
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:18,655
I could have a conversation with him now about the second shooter idea and how it's

328
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,423
December 19th

329
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,191
2012

330
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,239
If he asked me who was that guy

331
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,055
I can only respond with I don't know we'll see

332
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,079
Yeah some guy

333
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,639
Then that's where the propagandist has the ultimate advance

334
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,455
Their willingness to weaponize the unknown

335
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,551
Once all the information is out they can't control the narrative suit their purposes

336
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,855
So when there's a situation like this

337
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,647
It's of the utmost importance that they act

338
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,927
Important

339
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
Fast

340
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,975
And that time

341
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,279
One. The concrete is still wet

342
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,327
Thinking car whatever initials they want

343
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,375
Forever

344
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Concreteness event

345
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:54,751
Information that is solidified will make it impossible for them

346
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,543
Nice metaphor

347
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,847
If this brings into Focus

348
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,151
What I feel about Alex

349
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,943
2 coverage of jussie Smollett right now

350
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,759
You know he's playing with the uncertainty

351
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,087
Of the information

352
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,879
Did you now because of that

353
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,415
When there's more information

354
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,951
She won't have that advantage

355
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,975
No matter what

356
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:20,351
The story ends up being

357
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,119
Saying

358
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
I don't know

359
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,727
Oh man. There's no there's no way to tackle.

360
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:30,335
God it's so hard because you put yourself into that position

361
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,103
Can of like

362
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,895
Some random ass coincidence

363
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,455
And if the cops did release that guy's name

364
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
He might be

365
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
Dead by now

366
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,527
He's awake

367
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,063
Easily have been murdered

368
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,087
By one of the

369
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:45,439
By one of the people parents of the people

370
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,767
Possibilities

371
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
Terrible

372
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,399
Just a coincidence makes you

373
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,423
Cheese

374
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,519
I hope I don't

375
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:06,175
Chris manfredonia his name is only public

376
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:06,943
Because he ended

377
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
Open interviews

378
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,759
I don't know if the police released his

379
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,063
B like

380
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,367
I don't know I think

381
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,135
It's probably

382
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,208
One of the rare super rare but kind of

383
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,768
Not as common as we would like

384
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,792
Police being like

385
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,328
Right on

386
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:28,192
Target

387
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:31,264
Yeah

388
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,664
That reminds me so much of the Patrice O'Neal

389
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,224
I never litter because I don't want the chance of

390
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,272
Taasa recede into

391
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,624
Bushes and then there's a dead body and now I'm

392
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,904
Suspect number one

393
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,440
Like that's that's

394
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,208
Exactly.

395
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,816
SPI setting

396
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,584
People up

397
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:00,192
It is true and I can argue the FBI

398
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,264
Doesn't have a real dicey history in terms of setting people

399
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,032
Kristoff

400
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:07,872
I find it absolutely hilarious example out and come up with

401
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,152
Is this Christmas tree bomb

402
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,040
The 2010 car bombing playing in Portland

403
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,088
Those take out their Christmas tree light

404
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:17,856
Ceremony

405
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:22,208
This wasn't a terrorist unknowingly working with an FBI agent

406
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,744
Under-covered plan the attack

407
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:27,328
The FBI made sure that the bomb was on capable of detonating

408
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,656
And after Mohamed Osman

409
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,448
Used his

410
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:35,008
Just set off the inert bomb

411
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,032
He was arrested

412
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,592
Which is kind of b*******

413
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:45,248
Well well

414
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,528
A lot of it

415
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,880
But a a practice that has been covered and talked about

416
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,928
Is the FBI would find

417
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
Potential

418
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:57,536
Terror Justified

419
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,584
They would essentially teach the terrorists

420
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,888
How to make a bomb and then

421
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,192
Ask him to do the terrorism

422
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:08,032
And then arrest him after he was caught plenty of examples

423
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,104
Up and this this event actually said often interesting

424
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,408
Debate about whether or not the FBI head

425
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,432
Entrapped modmood

426
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,224
Seeing as

427
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,296
4 months

428
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,576
Came up on their radar

429
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,368
He was on set radar

430
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,160
Because he wrote for a publication called

431
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,440
Jahad recollection

432
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:27,744
And wasn't contact with

433
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,048
Who's known to the FBI as being

434
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,352
Jahad recollect

435
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,400
I never thought this would happen

436
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,240
Start a day

437
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:45,152
Entrapment would be a good defense for my mood and set such things

438
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,200
Cover agents

439
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,224
Overly cautious

440
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,760
Justin tried to talk him out of the

441
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,064
Washington

442
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:58,720
Where is entrapment legal defense has offered Mahmood multiple alternatives

443
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,512
Mass murderer

444
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:05,376
But he insisted he wanted to play Operation already picked his Target

445
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:09,728
Yeah I mean that's what I'm looking

446
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:16,896
Though I don't know how you feel about how embedded within the agents this is not a good example of

447
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,920
Aristotle

448
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,968
Intentions

449
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:24,064
Committed violent mass casualty event totally clear independent

450
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,112
Prior to the FBI getting involved

451
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,672
They're better examples I could have chosen

452
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:35,072
I'm for sure but most of the examples he would be able to come up with are minorities or left-leaning

453
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,352
By law enforcement

454
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,632
The story wants

455
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:40,704
Patel is one of Oppression at the hands of the federal government

456
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,496
Who's label them all the terror

457
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,544
But reality doesn't match up with that

458
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,640
In a 2012 article in Rolling Stone by Rick perlstein

459
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,432
He lays it out really well

460
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,224
The gold

461
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,504
Entrapment

462
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,272
Is 1 a story

463
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:01,184
Because they're involved on some level the FBI can control how the bus goes down at what point applauded disrupted weather

464
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,976
There's media attention or not

465
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,280
They can essentially use the investigation

466
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,328
To help them tell the story they want the public

467
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,888
To hear to get them to focus where they want them to

468
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
The focus

469
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,704
That's why from the sixties until

470
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,472
Present day

471
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,776
These things are almost exclusively used against

472
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,824
Left-leaning groups like occupy

473
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,104
An anti-war movement

474
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,896
With Muslims being a very common

475
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,688
Target in the past twenty years or so

476
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,712
But

477
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,552
It's never the right-wing groups they do this to

478
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,320
Right wing

479
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,368
Roblox are generally found out

480
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,136
Easter

481
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:31,904
The cape

482
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,024
Something goes wrong on their own or they carry out the plot for

483
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,816
Someone from the group defect

484
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,936
Law enforcement

485
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,984
So many examples

486
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,544
White nationalist white supremacist

487
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
Subscription

488
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,616
30 years or so and none of them

489
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,152
Had to do with like

490
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,456
Fpi prodding them

491
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:59,296
To carry out whatever they were willfully ignored

492
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:05,696
By law enforcement

493
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,256
Ones that they want to publicize because they don't

494
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,304
Priori

495
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,072
Yeah

496
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
Is weird

497
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,400
Is weird

498
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,960
Garbage

499
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,728
He's garbage

500
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,032
Vibrate

501
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,312
So now we have cover

502
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,848
To jump Whole Hog

503
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,384
This is fake the government

504
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,408
The whole thing is fake

505
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:28,480
Thanks to robbed you thank you Rob

506
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,040
Reporter

507
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,064
Do

508
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,624
He feels pretty comfortable about

509
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
Bees

510
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,744
Smoothly into

511
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,768
Position of

512
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,816
I called

513
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:47,424
Yeah if you want to play that clip for the is this fake

514
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,448
It's pretty solid

515
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,848
Right I think it's still in the ballpark of like for it unless you were the government

516
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,760
Like anytime he's like we have debates

517
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,808
No you just literally said

518
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,904
I'm starting to think about is like ice

519
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,952
The debate light

520
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,768
But I don't think there's a way he wants to present

521
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,304
I'm starting to suspect

522
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,840
The debate

523
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,376
Weird people

524
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,704
Government killed all these kids

525
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,008
I meant other people say they're all fake

526
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:29,408
Not it was real

527
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,040
And I will

528
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:39,136
I bet there were it was a narrative progression of him having Gaston

529
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,416
And people saying

530
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,208
Or whatever

531
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,768
So I don't know

532
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,304
The debates thing is is

533
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,072
Assertive

534
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:50,144
Funhouse mirror of reality

535
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,424
But still

536
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,752
That to me even Alex saying the government went in and kill those two

537
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,776
Killed all the kids

538
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,824
Disgraceful and disgusting

539
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,104
But it's what you

540
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,128
Do you expect from Alex

541
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,664
And I think it's safe ground

542
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:05,504
But I don't think it's legally actionable I think it's disgusting

543
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,784
Exploitative

544
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,576
I still don't think alike

545
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,856
I think it's what he

546
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,624
Does

547
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,904
I think that's his brand

548
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,208
You can

549
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:18,816
Charged with if you just save the government did it

550
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:22,656
Like the government

551
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,680
Kill

552
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:29,312
I mean but we don't know about John

553
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,432
Thousands of things that he says that they dead

554
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,808
Narrative never progresses from there

555
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,832
Which we know it does

556
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,368
It'll be like

557
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:47,744
I'm put off by a monster

558
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,560
Still not like

559
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,840
It still.

560
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,120
We're defining

561
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:56,192
Fumble

562
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,472
And I find that fascinating

563
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,752
That really interests

564
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:04,384
Yeah it's it's another situation he doesn't know when to end a paragraph

565
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:11,040
If you just if you just said it was fake and then put a. At the end of it we'd all hate shown we all move on

566
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,856
But you know the reason

567
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,392
Have to keep

568
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,720
What's going on in the world

569
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:25,888
Sciatic nerve

570
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,848
And their families

571
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,696
You are a bad person

572
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,512
Tyranny

573
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:58,400
You are a bad person if you don't

574
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:02,496
To at least reasonable dog f****** control laws

575
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,776
You're bad person

576
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,312
Yeah

577
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,944
Person that this is the way you behave in the face of the tragedy

578
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,296
You're a bad person. Because of your gun position

579
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:21,696
I would rewrite that

580
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,488
Is another one of his classic like

581
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,584
You just went

582
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,144
These bad little kids

583
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:36,288
That's the bad person come out in front of us

584
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,080
Days ago

585
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,408
20

586
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,944
Irrevocably changed

587
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,760
So many people's lives

588
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,552
You were completely destroyed

589
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:54,208
And you were like they're dangling these dead kids in front of us

590
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,072
Whoopi s*** Alex

591
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,616
No I'm out of here you're f****** gross

592
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,640
Yeah you're

593
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,920
F****** gross

594
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:20,064
Already had on

595
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,136
He has Larry Pratt back on gun rights

596
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,208
Forgot. Owners for America

597
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,488
Right

598
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,792
Pnra

599
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,376
Because the night before

600
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,936
Larry went on Piers Morgan show

601
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:45,408
I don't like being totally

602
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:48,224
It's one of these things like them fight

603
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,808
Morgan was talking about how like

604
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,368
You should have some sort of gun reform

605
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,208
Larry Pratt is like

606
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,768
Look what you guys took the guns

607
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,048
Crimes through the roof

608
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,328
All that stuff

609
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,400
We're talk about that in a second

610
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,448
Alex is going to make that point

611
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,472
And Larry is going to

612
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,240
3 with him

613
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,032
Need to establish that

614
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:13,824
F****** stupid

615
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,560
Cranium of the normal

616
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,840
Liberal

617
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,608
Anchor

618
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,704
Violent crime rate

619
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,848
Let's see if it fits inside are yours or

620
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:54,528
Statistics out of context to argue that the UK made restrictions to gun ownership and then finally defense numbers jumped or bad

621
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,600
If you just look at the raw numbers you can make that

622
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:02,720
But in order to literally all of the context

623
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,792
And numerous investigations of Publications put out by Parliament

624
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,400
In 1997 the UK pass the Firearms Amendment Act of 1990

625
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:14,752
Is there regulations in place but registration and whatnot

626
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,312
But this act effectively banned private ownership of

627
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,384
This Act was passed in part as a response

628
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,176
So the dunblane school massacre

629
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,480
Where man enter the school shot 16

630
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,248
In the age of

631
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,272
5 + 6

632
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:28,064
Shot a teacher and then killed himself

633
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,600
This is referred to as

634
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,904
The UK's first and only school shooting

635
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,696
Possibly because they took action

636
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,024
Address

637
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:43,936
I'm just going to let you take a shower

638
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:46,496
Craigslist

639
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:50,336
Why the Firearms Act was

640
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:54,432
Provide the necessary context under understand

641
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,992
Is lying about crime rate

642
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:01,600
Serious person every reason to know what I'm about to tell you

643
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:06,464
In 1998 Parliament pushed Police Department's crime

644
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,792
There was no real standardization

645
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:13,120
Apartment issues word identical crime could be

646
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:13,888
Declassified

647
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,912
Completely differently

648
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,192
Depending on what

649
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:16,960
Investigated

650
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,776
Completely unreliable in

651
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:23,872
Of what crime in the UK actually look

652
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:26,944
So it's a little bit like the difference between

653
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,736
Crime reporting a

654
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,576
Chicago and crime reporting in

655
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,880
Joe arpaio's neck of the woods where

656
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,184
Crime reporting in Chicago would include rape

657
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,560
Joe arpaio's world they're like doesn't even really happen level perhaps

658
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,608
But

659
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,448
Encouraging them

660
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:54,848
Accounting rules introduced National Crime recordings

661
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,384
Crime stat

662
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,432
Including a 100

663
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,480
18% jump in violent crime alone

664
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:04,576
Part of this was because departments were now required to include indictable

665
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,624
Impossibly indictable crimes

666
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,392
Statistics

667
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:10,720
And they also changed

668
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,768
For each crime or victim

669
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,304
As opposed to one crime

670
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,072
For criminal

671
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:21,216
That is to say violent people

672
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,752
Before it would have just been one

673
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,288
Ride that makes

674
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,568
F****** perfect

675
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:29,920
April 2008

676
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,456
Most of the way they counter defenses

677
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,736
Would lead to it barge jump

678
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,504
Open statistics

679
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,040
A serious violent crime

680
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:38,624
They began to include quote gross bodily harm Within

681
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,928
Tent as a serious violent crime

682
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,720
Whereas previously it would not have been

683
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,024
So all the Hooligans finally got

684
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,560
Maybe

685
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:51,680
This boils down to situations where the assailant intends to do gross bodily harm but fails

686
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,448
To do so

687
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,568
That would not have been considered an instance of gross bodily harm has previously and now was

688
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,360
This change came as the result of

689
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,128
2006

690
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:04,736
2007

691
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,760
The violence was not.

692
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,600
And to get a better picture of crime as it exists

693
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:12,160
It would be wise to include attempted violin

694
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,952
And credible threats of violence

695
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,976
Discounting is SiriusXM

696
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,584
This alone led to a massive spike in reports of serious violent crime

697
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,144
With no actual additional crimes being committed

698
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:25,728
Statisticians of analyze the data and their assessment is largely the

699
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,288
The crime is fairly close to flat or even down

700
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:30,080
But there's an outward appearance

701
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,360
There's been on the rise since

702
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,384
1998

703
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,408
Because of these changes

704
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,504
Tell crimes are reported

705
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,528
Some s*** all over it

706
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,208
Eczema

707
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:49,280
Unfortunately 1998 is right after the UK's.

708
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,608
Place for Alex

709
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,912
Take these statistics totally out of context

710
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,472
Represent the guns than

711
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,008
Violent crime went through the roof

712
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,104
Either Alex doesn't know this explain explanatory context

713
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,176
In which case he's an idiot doesn't understand the issues he covers

714
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,504
Or she does know about it and he's intentionally lying about it

715
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,784
Neither are good

716
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,320
Neither are good

717
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,160
And even then like your

718
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,768
It's hard to come down anywhere other than

719
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,144
He's ignorant of all the stuff

720
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,424
Other than the fact

721
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,984
That stuff would disprove what he say

722
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,008
He knows that

723
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,824
What would disprove what are you saying

724
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,872
But he does not bother to

725
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,640
To learn about

726
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:41,760
Threatening to know exactly

727
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,296
Yeah yeah possibly

728
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,088
It's impossible to know for

729
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:47,904
For sure

730
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,928
No just faced

731
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,696
Activate

732
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:50,976
I think you

733
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,280
More stupid and reactionary than

734
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,304
Conniving

735
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,072
Yeah

736
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,352
I think that's probably

737
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,632
Affair

738
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,448
Conniving enemy

739
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,496
I don't know

740
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
Puppyfind

741
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,432
That he has been so intense

742
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,200
Send Sandy Hook

743
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,480
About how he knows

744
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,528
The war coming

745
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,808
That's

746
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,368
That he has been

747
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:24,768
Did not make me

748
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:32,448
I got to be nice to my wife and kids

749
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:42,176
Call warm up

750
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:42,944
To each other

751
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:49,600
Her husband.

752
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:21,344
This is a different level of my gut told me they did it

753
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,648
This is reporting at MN

754
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,256
Every now and again bringing his gun into the conversation

755
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:33,376
Also fun fact Alex got divorced like a year after

756
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:39,008
Wipe the computers Adam Lanza tried to destroy

757
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,032
Computer is before.

758
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,104
Yeah

759
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,128
Although

760
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,200
I've done it

761
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:47,968
Deep dive on that

762
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,504
As I recalled

763
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,528
It was a him

764
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,600
Yeah that makes sense

765
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,368
A lot of people

766
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,976
Really we don't really have much to go on

767
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:05,120
Get back to Piers Morgan

768
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,680
You know

769
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
This is great

770
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,472
Cuz this is sort of a

771
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,496
A Prelude

772
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,520
Alex

773
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,312
Morgan show

774
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,592
It does that great publicity

775
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,616
Vista

776
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:20,736
We're on his own show

777
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:21,760
Get out of America

778
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,416
Play Foreigner

779
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:43,776
Neither of you were involved in that.

780
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:52,224
I mostly kept that in there cuz the excuse me is so weird

781
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,064
Bilderberg trash

782
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,088
Excuse me

783
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:03,488
Get out of my company's on the show

784
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,768
And that includes me

785
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,304
And Bilderberg trash

786
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,840
Is the worst insult

787
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:16,288
Problem for the radio station

788
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,040
I think the heat made

789
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,832
You feel that way

790
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,904
We're

791
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,464
That's the type of ship

792
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,768
Do not understand at all

793
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:39,840
You have a f******

794
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:46,240
Personal vested interest in the Civil War the Revolutionary War

795
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:52,640
Hundred years ago paly

796
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,175
Alex

797
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,735
Race memory

798
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:02,623
Manchester still live within his barely chest you know that 100 times

799
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,671
We bury the hatchet

800
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:09,791
The Americans because both countries are f****** garbage

801
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,559
How about that

802
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:17,215
The embodiment of all who have come before

803
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,495
Of course is a

804
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:25,919
People who did all the revolution organism

805
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,687
King

806
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:32,063
Miller's surf they were they were parked their Red Coats

807
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,391
No sisters were the Redcoats

808
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:37,951
Lexington and Concord

809
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,047
That doesn't track

810
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:47,423
A pictures of a Trax feels good to Alex and that's what matters

811
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,703
Neither of your

812
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:52,031
Sisters still didn't really care

813
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:55,103
They were both just working stiff

814
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,151
Or they were all work

815
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:57,919
Not Alex

816
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,967
Hayward

817
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:03,551
They were Generals River

818
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:10,719
Alex's family

819
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:12,767
Pierce's

820
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,535
This was that

821
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,399
That simple

822
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:21,983
But you make

823
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,543
Upsetting

824
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,311
About how great

825
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:54,495
I guess I guess Jaws is real

826
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,543
That's true that's true

827
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,895
Still can go

828
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:06,527
I think that's where I land on the Jaws

829
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:09,599
Argument

830
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,903
Fourth

831
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:12,671
That draws

832
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,463
Did cause a lot of people

833
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,487
Be afraid of sharks

834
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:18,047
Isn't that weird

835
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,583
Greatest movies

836
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,607
Ever made

837
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:39,039
Because of it and Alex

838
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,087
A bunch of peaches almost went bankrupt

839
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:46,975
I just delivered f****** Hawaii a family like who live in California

840
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:48,255
Close beaches

841
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,559
Can't f****** charge you to go

842
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:57,215
People who like sharks

843
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,103
He probably meant to say is like

844
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:09,503
Tourism struggling

845
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:13,087
Microband last battle against

846
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,623
Norris Dam break

847
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,695
Crazyshit

848
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,743
Here in Mexico

849
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,511
Clip

850
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,047
Raises the alarm

851
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,327
And put the word out

852
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,863
Time for all good men

853
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:25,887
The aid of the party

854
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:04,031
Temperature is anything bad happen

855
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,079
Lawless that's pretty bad

856
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:09,151
Is that

857
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,735
Cancel

858
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,319
Play that

859
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,879
Calling all Calling All Patriots

860
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:21,439
Redware in authoritarian ism

861
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:26,303
Hear that hear that as a called

862
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,119
Talk of the revolution

863
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,703
You would obviously hear that is a

864
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:34,495
It's time to overthrow this f******

865
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,519
Government

866
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,055
Didn't

867
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,847
Terrorist attack on children

868
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,127
Because I want my gun

869
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,919
It's time to roll

870
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,015
You hear that sort of thing in

871
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:50,367
Especially with the laundry list of supposed crime

872
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:53,439
Absolutely

873
00:46:56,511 --> 00:47:02,655
What is your right

874
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:05,471
I have war on the Patriots

875
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:11,871
Galaxy

876
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,663
You're jumping the gun

877
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:26,463
There's an extreme

878
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,231
Comedy

879
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,511
As to what he says

880
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,535
Immediately after

881
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,119
Who's that laundry list of things that the government's doing

882
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,399
And then he says

883
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:37,215
Authoritarianism

884
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,719
So

885
00:47:59,487 --> 00:47:59,999
That's

886
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,559
Why is it that the next thing he says

887
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,351
Everyone loves

888
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,119
New shows

889
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,935
It's not like he's talking about like a place you go

890
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:08,703
You can buy a gun

891
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,471
Under the radar

892
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,263
TV shows

893
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,031
Yeah

894
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:18,943
So you can stop

895
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,991
Well you can still find the ratings

896
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:23,551
TV shows back in 2012

897
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,319
Anythink

898
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:25,855
Close to what Alex's

899
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:28,415
He's presenting the idea that gun shows makeup

900
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,183
Half of the time

901
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,463
10 shows on cable

902
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:33,279
Is a breakdown of the 2012

903
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,559
TV season on network

904
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,399
2 1/2 guns

905
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:45,055
Young Guns

906
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:51,455
Big guns futuristic world with Dinosaurs in it

907
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:57,855
Revolution revolution

908
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:00,671
TriCity another's dinosaurs cuz I have to go back in the past

909
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:07,071
It's complicated. Be very excited

910
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,727
It's like a minute number 13

911
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:17,311
Betty White's prank Show Off Their Rockers

912
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:21,407
Just missed the top hundred come and get it whenever 101

913
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,967
0 gun program

914
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:30,367
Vaccina in retrospect that sounds pretty great number 101

915
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:34,719
So no gun programs on their speak of unless you can something like NCIS

916
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,999
Is a gun show

917
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:40,863
So if you check in with Nielsen to have the ratings for network and cable program

918
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,703
And the top 10 most-watched programs

919
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:48,799
The 2012 we're all number 1 through 8 being NFL football

920
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,847
Number 9 was the Summer Olympics open

921
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:52,127
Ceremony

922
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:52,895
Who was the Grammys

923
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:55,199
Their top 10 ratings for regularly

924
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:58,271
Schedule program for the NFL

925
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,831
Trees for American Idol

926
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:01,599
With the Stars

927
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,879
NCIS

928
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:03,903
The Voice

929
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,671
The show Vegas

930
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:08,511
Save a top-10 programs that were recorded to watch later

931
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,583
Do you know zero Gunn program

932
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:14,655
Does Mad Men Breaking Bad Justified Fringe

933
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:17,983
Sons of Anarchy American Horror Story and of course

934
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,007
Suit

935
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,799
Exactly what you would expect

936
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,359
That's what I mean the show

937
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:27,199
Yeah that's a cross-section of the the the

938
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,551
TV is the opiate

939
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:33,087
So TV Guide put out a list

940
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:35,135
The top 25 most watched shows

941
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:37,695
Both Network

942
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:44,863
Be called a gun show

943
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,983
Having a celebrity for how stupid it was number 21

944
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:52,543
Well below Modern Family

945
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,871
And post Charlie Sheen version of Two and a Half Men

946
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:59,711
I'm not sure that qualifies as something that would scare the globalist

947
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:03,807
That Duck Dynasty number 21

948
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:10,719
Incredibly unsatisfying network shows even the ones that had both Network at cable

949
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,743
Inside out

950
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:13,279
We talkin about cable shows

951
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:14,815
Done

952
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,375
Thankfully after doing a little more

953
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,143
The most-watched

954
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:18,911
Cable shows

955
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:23,263
Interesting the article was posted on December 12th

956
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,055
So this should be fresh and Alex's

957
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,175
Here's the top 10

958
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:34,527
You tell me if there's anything on this list that you would call the gun culture show

959
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,807
This is a door

960
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,599
The Walking Dead

961
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:38,879
The closer

962
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,159
Rizzoli & Isles

963
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,183
Major Crimes

964
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,463
Pawn Stars

965
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:46,815
Rizzoli & Isles everyone loved it

966
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,351
Dallas

967
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,143
Sons of Anarchy

968
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,191
Suits

969
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:52,959
Jersey Shore

970
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:59,359
What was I don't remember has a gun show cuz they were always take their shirts off

971
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,943
Make a terrible argument

972
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,223
The Pawn Stars

973
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,247
Might be

974
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,783
They cuz they sometimes have

975
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:07,807
Guns on it

976
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,575
But it's not

977
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,343
Regular

978
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:13,695
Gundam Wing

979
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:16,511
Be considered gun shows now that's just part of the word

980
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:24,959
I don't know I don't think any of those are Sons of Anarchy violence

981
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,751
Major Crimes I'm sure something

982
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:30,591
People got shot that's just like a procedural drama

983
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:33,663
I think I was looking through this list I like I don't know what half of these

984
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:35,199
These f****** shows are

985
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,783
I don't know what suits is I don't want to know

986
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:41,599
No I'm fine with it I don't know what major crimes

987
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:47,999
Specifically I know I

988
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,535
I have no idea what that was

989
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:54,399
I don't really know what Rizzoli & Isles was I've only heard people make jokes about it

990
00:52:54,911 --> 00:53:01,055
Wait was Rizzoli & Isles the one with Zack from Saved by the Bell and what's his face

991
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:06,175
NFL bracket

992
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:08,991
Franklin & Bash

993
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:16,159
A send a send a blank and blank

994
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:16,927
Yes trouble

995
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:19,743
I don't know what it is but I do know what Revolution is

996
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:22,559
Was very disappointed

997
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:28,959
Entertainment Weekly article provides breakdowns for all these different

998
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:30,495
Adult

999
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,263
249

1000
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,031
An adult

1001
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:32,799
1:35

1002
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:35,103
54 and none of them contain any gun

1003
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:38,175
I literally have no idea what Alex is talking about

1004
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,455
I can't make sense of it

1005
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,479
It does not track

1006
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,783
With any of the actual

1007
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:43,807
Beekeeping

1008
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:44,575
Places

1009
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:50,463
Is legally actionable

1010
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:53,535
All of Television to be able to sue him for libel

1011
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,327
It's weird I was very

1012
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,863
Confuse

1013
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:03,263
We're going to find out more about you looking like

1014
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:06,079
Another guess he's already had

1015
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,103
Aftermath of

1016
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:07,871
Sandy Hook

1017
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:14,015
Extreme

1018
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,807
Very regularly

1019
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:17,087
It's almost like

1020
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:18,879
You know

1021
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,415
I don't know how to describe it

1022
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:23,999
Started

1023
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:26,815
I need have a guest co-host that would be there for a week

1024
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:27,839
No

1025
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:32,191
He used to have like it was a week and your dad like Snoop Dogg was the guest for the week

1026
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:34,239
I do not watch

1027
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:35,519
Any of the late night

1028
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:38,335
I don't either but I remember that because I was like

1029
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,103
19

1030
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:46,015
It feels the same way with this rotating cast of

1031
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:46,783
These gone weird

1032
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:50,111
Like Larry Pratt coming on twice

1033
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,671
5 Stewart Road twice in like

1034
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,439
3 days

1035
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:55,999
It seems like these we only people get any info

1036
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,791
Inputting

1037
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,607
That makes sense though because

1038
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:03,167
Especially

1039
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:05,471
Even if he's not doing his own

1040
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:13,663
Naturally he would want to surround

1041
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:16,479
Themselves with the most Psychopathic gun

1042
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:20,575
In order to insulate himself from any kind of

1043
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:25,695
Putting that s*** out in order to make his listeners

1044
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:28,767
Afraid and distract them from the tragedy of the

1045
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,071
Situation

1046
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,375
Distracted

1047
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,143
Keep 817

1048
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:37,471
Keep him on the straight and narrow

1049
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:40,287
It's just a path shaped like a gun

1050
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:43,871
Starts at the top of the hour

1051
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,151
As we know the first segment

1052
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,199
Is not brought

1053
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:52,063
For the station youth radio station

1054
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:52,831
Minutes

1055
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,367
I am so Alex is already

1056
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:57,439
Whatever he says will recap it

1057
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,463
That sort of thing

1058
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:00,767
Good radio

1059
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:03,583
Stewart Road

1060
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,351
Start stalking

1061
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,887
About

1062
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,167
The militias are great

1063
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,983
He has a quote

1064
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:10,751
From the sound

1065
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:11,775
Father

1066
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,151
Declaration right is a going out to break

1067
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,175
Solve the mystery

1068
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:38,143
Limited

1069
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:41,215
Wonder what you mean by

1070
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:44,031
Your Birthright

1071
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:46,079
Military grade

1072
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:51,199
Just for immigrants citizens allowed to also

1073
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,479
Have that Birthright

1074
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,783
That's a question I can't answer

1075
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,599
Stop you know I don't know

1076
00:56:57,855 --> 00:57:00,927
I know what my gut tells me

1077
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:07,327
Did you catch the founding father that was quoted there

1078
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:10,143
Play pit play the number of times

1079
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,679
Steelhead

1080
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:15,775
Google a try and find out who's talking about

1081
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:19,871
Something

1082
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:28,063
Selectively remove that name from founding fathers it's gempa

1083
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,599
Cox

1084
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:33,695
List of founding fathers

1085
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:40,095
Temperature

1086
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:46,495
He was just a f****** guy

1087
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:52,895
That's good enough for Alex and Stewart to consider him one of the founders of discovery

1088
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,943
Funnily enough

1089
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,991
After the country was founded Cox

1090
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,271
Declared himself a wig

1091
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,159
Which that helped him secure a position as

1092
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:06,463
Commissioner in the Washington administration

1093
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:11,583
Years later he decided wasn't really a Federalists was actually a democratic-republican

1094
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,887
Curiously around the same time

1095
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,935
Veterans coming from that party

1096
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,215
Thomas Jefferson

1097
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:20,031
Was president whose animated purveyor Republic supplies

1098
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:20,799
Great

1099
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:26,687
Opportunistically during the first few years of countries existed

1100
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:28,735
Leveling accusations

1101
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,783
He was actually a British spy in a tory

1102
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,575
I'm not sure about those accusation

1103
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:34,111
But I do know that it's critics

1104
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:37,183
Would refer to him often and Mr facing both ways

1105
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:40,767
F******

1106
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,351
Gateway

1107
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:50,751
As far as things go that's true

1108
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:54,591
As far as mr. worldwide

1109
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,407
But not as good

1110
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:00,223
Mr. Steal Your Girl

1111
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:00,991
Mr. Steal Your Girl

1112
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:08,671
Is the hero

1113
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:12,767
It was free skating at the time

1114
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:20,959
Also teach Cox

1115
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:22,751
It is widely credited with pushing

1116
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:23,519
For cotton

1117
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:25,567
Main crop grown in the American South

1118
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,103
It's worth mentioning that

1119
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:30,175
He was opposed to slavery as he wrote a letter from

1120
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:35,039
1808

1121
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:40,415
Where the slave trade right safe and constitutional

1122
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,975
Which state which they do now

1123
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:43,999
Referring to other

1124
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:50,911
But as labor is and is likely to be in America we shall make a progress a little slower but not less certain

1125
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,703
Transferring

1126
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:54,751
Much of this business of raising those two

1127
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:57,823
No pills awfully opposed to slavery

1128
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:02,175
Cox's actions in Raleigh

1129
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:08,575
The greatest drivers towards the rationalization of and acceptance of slavery

1130
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,343
Free in America

1131
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,623
CVS

1132
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:12,927
Quote within 10 years of the cotton

1133
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:14,463
Jen

1134
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:17,535
Use the value of the total United States cropley

1135
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:20,607
From 150,000 dollars to more than 8 million dollar

1136
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:27,519
This success of this plantation crop made it much more difficult for slaves to purchase their freedom or obtain it through the Goodwill of the

1137
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:34,431
From 1790 to 1810 close to 100,000 slaves moved the new cottonland

1138
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,711
In the south and west

1139
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:40,831
From each decade

1140
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:42,879
A million in total

1141
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,671
Cultivation

1142
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:47,231
Spread slaveholders and tobacco

1143
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:51,071
This crop was no longer profitable made huge profits by selling their slave

1144
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,143
This domestic slave trade devastated black fan

1145
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:55,935
American-born slaves

1146
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:58,495
Record for the plantations they had no no

1147
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,775
Placed in shackles

1148
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:00,799
Forced March

1149
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:03,103
Hundreds of miles away from there

1150
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,407
The enslaved populations in

1151
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,943
Cotton producing states.

1152
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,223
27

1153
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:08,991
5%

1154
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,783
Per decade in the early 8

1155
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:13,087
Etiquette all be traced back

1156
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,367
Exact problem

1157
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,391
The tent Cox

1158
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:16,671
Clearly aware of

1159
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,207
It is 1808 letter

1160
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,487
Namely that

1161
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:22,047
If we do this reasonably it'll take a while

1162
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,327
If we had slavery week

1163
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,607
We can take over this Market

1164
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:27,167
The labor question

1165
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,151
Now that's a fun name to think about

1166
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:41,503
I like your elementary school education or your life

1167
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:45,855
Was Eli Whitney's cotton gin

1168
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:47,391
And they didn't provide that

1169
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:50,207
Asterix next to it

1170
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:56,351
Eli Whitney's cotton gin led to a massive explosion in slavery so horrifying

1171
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:00,191
8/10 coxswain

1172
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:02,239
Peking

1173
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,519
Huntington.com

1174
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:04,799
Perhaps

1175
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:08,639
So speaking of yeah

1176
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,663
Cox

1177
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,967
Kissing rationale for what benefits

1178
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:12,991
Getting into the cotton

1179
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:18,879
Quote the southern militia as it is conceived would acquire the spirit of a core

1180
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:21,439
The state government

1181
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,463
Blue cotton cloth

1182
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:25,279
With white or yellow cotton under the clothes

1183
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,815
Summer at Autumn

1184
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:27,839
4 piece uniform

1185
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:30,399
It would certainly take a

1186
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,423
Thunder

1187
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,447
Impressive auspices

1188
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,007
Equally important

1189
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,287
In the good of the militia

1190
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:40,895
Natural manufactures and it's bright and novel novel cultivation

1191
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:43,455
Those opposed to slavery tench coxe

1192
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,247
He's partially directly

1193
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,015
Irresponsible

1194
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,807
For creating the market where slavery

1195
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:50,367
Loaded and got way way worse

1196
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,903
His reasons for that

1197
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,183
We could make

1198
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:54,463
You can make a lot of money

1199
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:57,023
I'm at the southern militia could get cool Yuna

1200
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:58,559
Yeah

1201
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:00,607
Sounds

1202
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:02,911
A lot like

1203
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:08,543
Babolat Lancaster Road

1204
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:13,663
Politicians weather like

1205
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:14,943
Look

1206
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,479
Climate change

1207
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:19,807
I don't want to move on it though because

1208
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:26,207
I am getting a lot of money and I think we can make a lot of money and if we don't do anything about it

1209
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,535
Get this get this like you

1210
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:33,375
Demystify it a little bit like why is

1211
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:38,495
Cox father well because

1212
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:41,567
Use the motherfuker who inadvertently or

1213
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:43,615
Surreptitiously

1214
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:44,895
May flavory

1215
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,175
Super terrible

1216
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:52,575
Mister facing both ways

1217
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:58,719
That means that what he's reading about in history

1218
01:03:58,975 --> 01:03:59,487
Is

1219
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:03,327
The guys who made slavery words and but I think you just ignores that

1220
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:06,143
Part isn't calculus

1221
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:12,287
Awesome Southern delicious

1222
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:19,711
That's covered in the book that they would be interested in Reading

1223
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:25,343
I've never heard of because we're not reading crazy malicious

1224
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:32,511
Remember the name

1225
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,535
Text Cox

1226
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,839
W Rosebud

1227
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:37,887
Like what

1228
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:43,007
That sounds so f******

1229
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:43,775
Stupid

1230
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:46,079
God.

1231
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,359
Man

1232
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:49,407
Little interesting history

1233
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:52,223
Anyway it is next clip Alex gets back to

1234
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:53,247
The laundry list

1235
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:56,319
She has to be upset

1236
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,975
The oppression of gun culture

1237
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:06,815
Walmart

1238
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:13,471
Channel 4 hours

1239
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:16,031
Network

1240
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:22,687
Aha now we have a new Clues alright alright alright about Discovery in history

1241
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:25,247
Channel TV

1242
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:28,063
So we can find what are the shows that working

1243
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,599
In 2012

1244
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:31,135
They might be talking about

1245
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:33,439
The three shows I was could be talking about

1246
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:36,255
American Chopper Dirty Jobs

1247
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,023
An American

1248
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,559
The last one

1249
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:40,095
Clearly what he's talking about

1250
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:40,863
Will the TV show

1251
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,911
For this this entire time

1252
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,703
Gun shows being so awesome

1253
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:48,287
I should have known it was just some b******* that

1254
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:52,127
I like this reality show that got cancelled

1255
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:55,711
He's the Firefly fan of a gun shows

1256
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:59,039
It'll be easy to assume that the show was canceled because of Sandy Hook

1257
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,831
Given the timing of the announcement

1258
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:02,111
Cancellation

1259
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:08,511
According to deadline

1260
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:11,583
It wasn't so much cancelled as it was not

1261
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:12,863
Picked up for a third season

1262
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:17,983
And the reasons given were that the network felt that there wasn't any story left to tell with the characters on the show

1263
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:20,031
And more importantly their ratings

1264
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,591
Quote finish down double digits

1265
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:23,615
From season 1

1266
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:25,919
The spider starts strong start

1267
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,711
Had a bit of a sophomore slump

1268
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,015
No more stories to tell

1269
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:32,319
About what

1270
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:33,855
American Guns

1271
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:35,391
Really just seem like that

1272
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:36,159
Quick story

1273
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:38,719
Like you don't even need Ed Burns for that.

1274
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,767
This type of s*** happen

1275
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:44,351
Every time some gun show or some b******* conservative-leaning thing

1276
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:47,167
All the Alex Jones types take a

1277
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,191
The cancellation

1278
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:49,471
Auto Network

1279
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:55,871
Decision making

1280
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:57,151
Oregon conservatives in the media

1281
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:59,711
It's so goddamn but I realized

1282
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:03,039
Maybe I should have co-opted that argument if I could have got that disappointing

1283
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:05,599
Futuristic

1284
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,391
See if I could have got it a second season

1285
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,439
Go to figure it out and write it

1286
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,463
The ship

1287
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,935
So f****** pathetic

1288
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:20,703
Three shows on

1289
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:21,471
Discovery got

1290
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:22,751
Canceled one of them

1291
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:26,079
Had really high ratings

1292
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:31,711
Probably

1293
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:33,503
Late-season

1294
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:36,575
Write the micros pretty one

1295
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:42,463
More probably probably was because they were putting it up

1296
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,487
Open Facebook post

1297
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:45,279
Supporting trickle down economics

1298
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:52,447
Turns out

1299
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:56,543
There's one more show that got cancelled I don't know anymore

1300
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:02,175
Before shows

1301
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,015
Nope

1302
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:12,159
Because it was good looking

1303
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:15,999
Definition of pedophile

1304
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,095
This is b*******

1305
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:27,775
I didn't know Ted Nugent had a show so already that's a bad spoiler

1306
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:35,199
Google cancel

1307
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,551
With that kind of thing happening

1308
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:42,367
As a relates to a show on Discovery

1309
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:43,135
Cancel

1310
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:47,487
According to Discovery news on there called gun

1311
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:51,583
It will be a one-hour special

1312
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:55,679
You know Jordan like something that isn't a recurring show

1313
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:59,263
Babysitter one-off 1 hour thing with Ted Nugent's of Gunn

1314
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:02,335
In the ratings

1315
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:05,919
Newton claimed that he was working on it

1316
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:06,687
People from the networks

1317
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,223
Absolutely not true

1318
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:12,831
Interesting Lee in other Ted Nugent Show cancellation news

1319
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:16,671
14 multiple shows on Nugent store

1320
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,207
One of them

1321
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:21,535
Idaho

1322
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:27,935
Really according to billboard

1323
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,983
Nugent without realizing he espoused

1324
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:33,311
And they quote did not

1325
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:36,895
Tell Witcher of Nugent

1326
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,943
Which kind of an open question

1327
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:40,479
So much racist

1328
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:46,623
It's hard to pin. If I was listed all of the racist comedians that I've ever met who still work regularly

1329
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:48,927
Casinos it would be a long conversation

1330
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,815
Tacoma Washington

1331
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:58,143
Casino were cancelled ostensibly for similar reason

1332
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,959
It 2012

1333
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:02,751
Ted Nugent was kicked off a concert

1334
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:05,567
Fort Knox

1335
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:09,151
Are you scheduled to open for REO Speedwagon and Styx

1336
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:12,991
This is in the lead-up to the 2012 election back in April that year

1337
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:20,159
Cold with recent comments posted on the NRA's official YouTube page

1338
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,183
Quote

1339
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:26,815
If Barack Obama becomes the president November again I will either be dead or in jail by this time next year

1340
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:29,375
If you can't go home and get everybody in your life

1341
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:33,215
House of this vile ministration

1342
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:35,007
I don't even know what you're made of

1343
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:38,847
Considering it also previously called Obama a quote

1344
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:39,871
Cuban mongrel

1345
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:43,199
There's a decent chance that just want you to also been canceled for rapist

1346
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:47,807
Impressed that he's going to murder the president

1347
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:50,111
Also just because it's fun

1348
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:52,927
The day before Ted Nugent was kicked off his Fort Knox concert

1349
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:59,583
You come to a plea agreement on charges he was facing free legally killing black bear in Alaska across state line

1350
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:08,031
Keep kill that bear for an episode of his show Spirit of the wild that aired on the Outdoor Channel Wichita

1351
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:14,431
Network network even leaving aside all the stuff about how he clearly likes underage girls stands up

1352
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,199
Claiming racism

1353
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:18,271
I'd never kill a polar bear

1354
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,807
You might

1355
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,087
It turns out

1356
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:25,439
Humanity disrespecting

1357
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,207
Things about him

1358
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,535
He also doesn't respect nature responsible hunting dwaihy

1359
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,839
It's almost like that's all just

1360
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:33,375
The character these people

1361
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:37,727
Ted Nugent

1362
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,519
Real piece of s***

1363
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:45,663
He's a real judge

1364
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:46,687
Oh we can talk

1365
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:53,087
For a day is about how f*****-up you was all I needed to know and now there

1366
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:58,463
Also a delicious irony

1367
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:04,863
In July 28th Center in

1368
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:05,631
Virginia

1369
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:10,239
Not deny open carry permit

1370
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:13,311
Unless it's specifically requested by the performer

1371
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,663
I said that the request came from Nugent

1372
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:22,783
Quote given the things that have happened at nightclubs like pulse and what happened at Manchester

1373
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:25,343
Nugent security people are taking extra precautions

1374
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:30,975
When the subject of guns came up Nugent's people said oh no no

1375
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:33,023
During the show which was Favre

1376
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:33,791
I'm sold out

1377
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:36,351
Newton used to State patterns. About how great he is

1378
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,375
Surprise

1379
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:41,471
He also used the time to specifically insult a man named Andy Park

1380
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:47,615
Parker's daughter and co-worker were murdered at Bridgewater Plaza by disgruntled former coworker

1381
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:52,223
So Parker decides to buy a billboard calling do today

1382
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:55,039
Agree with all those

1383
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:58,111
Sonu and said quote

1384
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:00,159
If I get to political f*** you

1385
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:02,207
Listen to everybody

1386
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:06,303
Including those dumb motherfukers were protesting because they're still grieving

1387
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:08,351
When you lose a loved one we pray for you

1388
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:10,655
Will you lose when you lose a loved one

1389
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:12,191
We pray for him didn't we

1390
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:15,263
How the f*** do you hate the newgen family when we're praying for you

1391
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:17,567
You dumbfucks

1392
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:25,759
I can lift a whole long list

1393
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:27,551
Ted Nugent

1394
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:30,111
Just be ignoring

1395
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:36,511
Motherfuker

1396
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:38,815
Strike a good tone there with the whole

1397
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:40,095
Hey hey

1398
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:46,495
Idiots still grieving the death of his family or whatever it is like that I said a prayer for him

1399
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:50,079
And then worked to make sure that the

1400
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:54,431
The issue is this

1401
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:57,503
Nugent would be

1402
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:59,295
Cuz he's bringing up the idea.

1403
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:00,063
He's associated

1404
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:02,879
With the NRA

1405
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:04,159
Gun regulation

1406
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:05,183
Impossible

1407
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:07,231
Is so funny

1408
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:12,351
At this concert where he's screaming about this guy his team it said no guns

1409
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:18,751
Which makes it always

1410
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:21,311
You're sitting ducks for the gun

1411
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:26,687
Newton claimed that he said

1412
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:28,735
Switch the venue replied quote

1413
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:32,575
We stand by what we said Tuesday night and this is the end of our Ted Nugent story

1414
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:40,767
Football

1415
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:43,583
If you're afraid of the Pulse Nightclub shooting

1416
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:46,655
Is there with guns

1417
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:49,983
Are you actually do

1418
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:55,615
You been gone to your own f****** concert stupid

1419
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,663
Yep

1420
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:58,431
I hate that

1421
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:04,831
Yep find something like that that's what really sets me off like that to it to an extent that I usually don't get

1422
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:06,623
But that's

1423
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:09,183
Someone like motherfuking Ted Nugent

1424
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:11,231
One of the worst piece of s*** in the world

1425
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:12,255
Between Hayes

1426
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:14,047
Weird love of underage women

1427
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:15,071
He's violent

1428
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,863
Threats toward public officials

1429
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:18,655
Is over racism

1430
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:21,983
His clear inability to live by his own principles

1431
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,007
As it relates to

1432
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:27,103
To preservation of wilderness and nature big thing

1433
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,639
Aye look guns

1434
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:30,431
Crossbows so much

1435
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:34,015
Is because I respect nature and help

1436
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:35,295
All that stuff Tupac

1437
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:37,343
Now you have an instance like this

1438
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:38,111
Why it's like

1439
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:42,719
I fear for my own safety exactly what you said and still I

1440
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:45,791
Say no guns at the venue where I'm at

1441
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,327
Principal

1442
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:49,375
You stupid

1443
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:52,191
Make it so everyone else gets hurt

1444
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,727
And then you will how are you

1445
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,775
You have to try and insulate yourself

1446
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:56,799
From your own

1447
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:58,847
F****** b*******

1448
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:01,407
People should be ashamed

1449
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:07,551
That is the underlying

1450
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:09,599
Motherfuking

1451
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,623
Cowardly nonsense

1452
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:11,391
Cancel

1453
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:12,415
I didn't say that

1454
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:14,719
Oh that is so cool

1455
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:19,327
I'm a big fan of

1456
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:23,423
Simply because of it

1457
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,191
Its brevity

1458
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:24,959
Just that

1459
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:27,007
And that is the last we have to say on this

1460
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:30,335
Newton storage

1461
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:33,663
That recalls the what's a if we

1462
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,455
If we take your

1463
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:38,015
Conquer you will burn your cities.

1464
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:39,807
The ground and then the reply message

1465
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:41,343
If

1466
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:44,159
Like

1467
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:48,255
Vet vert

1468
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:51,327
Responses

1469
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,095
Come on

1470
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:53,375
Come on

1471
01:16:53,887 --> 01:17:00,031
Cut it out response makes you win the argument regardless

1472
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:01,055
Like that

1473
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:07,455
Fuct

1474
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:14,111
The worst result of our years electricity and this podcast

1475
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:17,695
Long discussion of Alex Jones will really be boiled down to

1476
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:19,487
Buckhead Nugent

1477
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:22,047
Yeah true go

1478
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,071
Who is Steph

1479
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:23,839
Listen here

1480
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:26,143
I look forward to the next time he comes up

1481
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:30,495
Because like I don't know I can't imagine what more awful things you can find about him

1482
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,103
Well I've never read anything

1483
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:35,871
Goodbye

1484
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:41,503
It's good about it

1485
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:47,135
Right

1486
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:49,951
I've never heard anybody like you're always a great guy

1487
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:57,119
Well-reviewed

1488
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,143
Like

1489
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:03,519
I think that double live Gonzo is the best

1490
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:10,175
Portishead live

1491
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:10,943
But that's just me

1492
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:11,967
Buddakan

1493
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:16,831
Imagine Outsiders think about that Fort Knox show

1494
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:23,231
With Nugent REO Speedwagon and Styx can you imagine like REO Speedwagon

1495
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:32,191
Guy from Styx

1496
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:36,543
Acting like that kind of an a****** man

1497
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,383
I wish

1498
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,175
More bands just

1499
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:44,223
Turn towards

1500
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:44,991
I don't

1501
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:51,391
Wanted plenty more fun if Lindsey Buckingham just went out

1502
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:52,415
How to say it was like

1503
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:55,743
Hey next song is going to be

1504
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:58,303
Another another one of our hits

1505
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:04,703
Let's kill the president all right let's go guys Donald Fagen just loses it in the middle of a peg

1506
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:05,727
Assassination

1507
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,871
It's really confusing man I think it's partially

1508
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:14,175
Because he has all the same guest on all the

1509
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:16,991
What time is it I don't know where a lot of our players

1510
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:20,831
You don't like a lot of people that we know from Alex's world where are they

1511
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:24,415
Blaring in his absence

1512
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:25,951
But he's around

1513
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:29,279
He Alex and him are both Big Sandy Hook deniers

1514
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,559
Long time

1515
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:31,583
And initially

1516
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:34,399
So like I expect to see him somewhere

1517
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,703
All these other dudes

1518
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:39,519
Gerald Celente is nowhere to be found

1519
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,311
Peter Schiff isn't around

1520
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:44,383
I don't know who else Paul Craig Roberts

1521
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,407
None of these guys

1522
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:46,943
It's weird

1523
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:47,711
It is next

1524
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:48,735
We do

1525
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:50,527
Hear about somebody

1526
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:53,599
Stop raining

1527
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:55,903
As it relates to Sandy Hook

1528
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:06,655
Great investigative journalist

1529
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:13,567
Mr. brainwash

1530
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:16,896
Plastic Rappaport

1531
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:20,224
I'm sure he'll show up pretty soon

1532
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:23,296
Some of that juicy

1533
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,088
Rapoport

1534
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,368
So

1535
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,184
Dirt roads is on because he has a new

1536
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:29,952
New Pledge of Allegiance

1537
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:38,144
Pledge of Allegiance

1538
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,704
I don't even like the regular Pledge of Allegiance

1539
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:42,240
F***** up

1540
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:45,312
It's not a pledge of allegiance I kind of miss poke it's more of a pledge of

1541
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:46,080
Independence

1542
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:48,384
Okay it's all just the same

1543
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,176
Keeper

1544
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:56,576
We're not going to take gun from people if you try and take our guns that's a Line in the Sand

1545
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:00,160
I'd like what what you just

1546
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,440
Reiterating

1547
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:03,744
You say all the time no big deal

1548
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,536
So trust me it's not going to be

1549
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:07,328
I do believe that

1550
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:08,864
If we play this out and listen

1551
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,656
You'll see what Alex has

1552
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:11,680
Is doing a little bit

1553
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:13,728
He's using Stewart a little bit

1554
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:19,616
Start it off

1555
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:42,912
Welfare

1556
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:45,216
It is because we know what he's talking about

1557
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,008
Yuri Doki code

1558
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:53,408
SEPTA that's the welfare welfare

1559
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:56,992
There is that subjects to it

1560
01:21:57,248 --> 01:22:01,088
Entirely this is what I think is actually

1561
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,112
The most important

1562
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:03,648
Really speak

1563
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:05,696
Stewart

1564
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:08,768
But something that I think is

1565
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,048
Hi early Acura

1566
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,584
About what him and Alex

1567
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,352
For trying to do

1568
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,912
Denison people killed

1569
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:21,568
That's the end result of what they're trying to do

1570
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:27,712
Through the actual

1571
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,992
For the mealy-mouthed

1572
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,856
AR

1573
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:43,840
Always conservative conservative now

1574
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:49,216
These are people who never understood the right to bear arms

1575
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,176
The dispensary

1576
01:22:58,432 --> 01:22:58,944
No s***

1577
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:02,272
He also even go so far as to say it's

1578
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:04,064
Career change

1579
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,464
This is an opportunity

1580
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:14,304
For us to wrap and make sure that

1581
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,352
Free of people

1582
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:19,168
That's a hundred percent like what

1583
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,448
Is behind what you say

1584
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,008
And he's absolutely 100%.

1585
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:26,336
Made this point

1586
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,224
Once you get past that point no matter how

1587
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,504
Decently a reason

1588
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:35,296
You present yourself

1589
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:38,624
People who stuck around

1590
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,672
Even if it is just totaled

1591
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:41,696
Conventional

1592
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:42,976
P line of

1593
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:44,512
Resisting any gun

1594
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:46,304
Legislation at all

1595
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,072
Regulation

1596
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,608
You're past that

1597
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:49,888
You are radical

1598
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:50,912
Yeah

1599
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:53,216
That's what

1600
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:54,752
Yep kicks

1601
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:59,616
Interesting that you can

1602
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:05,504
I think that's interesting that they like from

1603
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:07,552
Couple days

1604
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:12,416
There's even an awareness that what they're doing is getting

1605
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,696
Any moderation

1606
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:14,720
Out of this

1607
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:16,000
Getting it all

1608
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:17,792
As Extreme as we can make it

1609
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:18,560
Get because it has

1610
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:20,096
That sort of thing

1611
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,960
Are politicizing

1612
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:29,568
Open attic cover

1613
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:31,872
That are mango

1614
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:35,200
8 radicalized

1615
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:40,320
Exactly something that I think is probably like I think they might be aware of this

1616
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:41,856
But not necessarily

1617
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:43,136
I don't know B

1618
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,440
They don't kick out ever

1619
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,208
Everybody

1620
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:46,976
2

1621
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,840
It's not like a we get past this point everybody was still on board and is it

1622
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:53,632
Voting against

1623
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:57,216
Our Second Amendment or whatever

1624
01:24:57,472 --> 01:25:00,288
Because there's people who were skills

1625
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:01,312
Conservative

1626
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:05,920
And I think it's like

1627
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:12,832
Two same people Marco Rubio still pass the radicalisation point

1628
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:13,856
As

1629
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:14,880
Punching bag

1630
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:18,976
For people like store

1631
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:25,376
Moderate radical so far that we would consider

1632
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:31,264
Adjust a moderate GOP Republican like Mark

1633
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,544
Marco Rubio

1634
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:34,336
Is actually now

1635
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:38,688
Windows

1636
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:43,040
So far right

1637
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:45,088
Openly saying kill the president

1638
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:53,536
Like if everybody was exactly what they wanted the world

1639
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:55,328
Governing would be

1640
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,120
Like is everybody

1641
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:58,144
Goddamn

1642
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,168
Viggo Mortensen

1643
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:00,448
King Addie's

1644
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:01,728
Tea party politicians

1645
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:08,128
It was like if that was all the Republicans

1646
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:11,456
They have no idea

1647
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:13,760
Ruby scandal after scandal

1648
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:17,088
And the ultimate end result

1649
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:19,648
Probably

1650
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:24,000
Well no

1651
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:25,280
Well

1652
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:28,864
Everything else

1653
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:39,616
GOP shell I'm sure he likes it much more now

1654
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:40,640
Music f*** that guy

1655
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:41,408
Souvlaki

1656
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:43,456
He needs those people in order to

1657
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:44,992
Keep the ball moving

1658
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:48,320
Or whatever

1659
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:49,856
Of the world to be like

1660
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:50,880
This is what

1661
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:56,256
With the full recognition of know what you need is a goddamn mix

1662
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,304
Who's exactly what you hate

1663
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:01,632
You need to radicalize but you need

1664
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:02,400
Brings up

1665
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,680
People who know how to do

1666
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:05,472
The work along with you

1667
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:08,032
And keep them somehow cloistered from

1668
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:10,592
Like

1669
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:11,360
The outright

1670
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:12,640
Association

1671
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:14,176
Deny Xavier hook

1672
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:14,944
Being a Nazi

1673
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:18,272
Because if all of your pee

1674
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:20,064
People who know how to get anything done

1675
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:22,112
Like you

1676
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,672
Then it becomes too clear what your party is about

1677
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:26,720
It's an interesting sister

1678
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:28,768
I don't know

1679
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:35,680
This is a lot of the socks that were coming up as I heard

1680
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:37,984
Edx

1681
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:41,824
And it's so important for the moderates like

1682
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:45,152
For the f****** evil conniving pieces of s***

1683
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:47,456
Like Mitch McConnell in Marco Rubio

1684
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:51,040
To have these assholes around in the same way that it's important

1685
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:53,344
Those assholes

1686
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:59,488
Because the moderate guys can paint themselves

1687
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:01,280
F****** radical

1688
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:02,560
Douchebag conserved

1689
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:05,888
Words that you can be

1690
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,264
That's what Alex

1691
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,824
Being that guy

1692
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,616
Being the Steve king of radio

1693
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:17,152
Crush

1694
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:18,688
And I

1695
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:24,064
People who

1696
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,368
Otherwise would be like

1697
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:28,160
Racism is bad

1698
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:29,440
Still vote

1699
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:30,976
For racist policies

1700
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,000
By saying

1701
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:32,768
Team sports

1702
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,072
You know what we can't vote for

1703
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:36,352
Democrat.

1704
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:37,632
No matter what

1705
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:38,912
Burglar

1706
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:40,960
Races personally

1707
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:45,568
But I vote for every possible candidates

1708
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:47,872
Who will promote racist policies

1709
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:50,432
Even if they're not saying the quiet part loud

1710
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:51,968
Because they're not Stephen King

1711
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:53,760
Who is the one who Steve

1712
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:55,040
Who is the one thing

1713
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:55,808
The quiet part

1714
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:57,600
It's f******

1715
01:28:58,368 --> 01:29:00,416
Disgusting how well-read

1716
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:03,744
And how shittily people

1717
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:05,536
God

1718
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:09,888
This is why we lose

1719
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,424
Do you see that

1720
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:13,216
Jackson play

1721
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:15,520
To be at least

1722
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,360
Of that being what they're doing.

1723
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:20,640
But

1724
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:23,456
Alex takes this Independence pledge

1725
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:24,224
Or whatever

1726
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:25,760
Just doing

1727
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:26,784
Which again

1728
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:28,064
A hundred percent

1729
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:28,832
Is just

1730
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:29,856
We're not going to take your

1731
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:31,648
Which is the old key

1732
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:33,184
Initial pledge to be

1733
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:36,512
In addition to that

1734
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:39,072
If you vote to take away our guns

1735
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:40,352
We will vote you out of office

1736
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:44,448
I don't know

1737
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:50,848
Like I guess that's better than your pledge sing will kill you

1738
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:53,920
But Alex

1739
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:54,688
Piggybacks

1740
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:56,224
Is using it to

1741
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:56,992
Get himself

1742
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:30,016
Seems like

1743
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:32,064
Kentucky like national attention

1744
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:38,976
Ghetto

1745
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:47,680
I've made pledges before and I got a lot of none of those

1746
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:49,984
Your blood is great

1747
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:55,616
July

1748
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:57,152
What are you doing store

1749
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,528
So when it comes to their radicalization

1750
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,320
To know the idea of like

1751
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:05,856
Use this to get rid of

1752
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:06,624
The milk

1753
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:13,536
Try to make sense why you would

1754
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:14,560
In their world

1755
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:15,584
But it is next clip

1756
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,120
It becomes very scary

1757
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:19,424
Because dirt road starts talkin about

1758
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:20,704
People he wants

1759
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:21,984
To be on his radicalized

1760
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:26,336
Victory we have

1761
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:28,384
The freedom of speech on the internet

1762
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:40,416
Golden Corral

1763
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:48,864
You might not get a chance about the rainfall in 2016

1764
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:52,192
Focus on the guy with the gun

1765
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:56,544
I don't care if you do or how you do it

1766
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:00,896
Wake him up

1767
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:03,200
If you want to help us

1768
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:04,224
Pass

1769
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:12,160
And I'll tell you why

1770
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:13,952
We have a lot of gas

1771
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:15,744
And that is

1772
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:17,024
Hey

1773
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:23,424
Not for nothing responsible gun owners cool there been in the group there was some really interesting

1774
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,472
Coronavirus

1775
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:26,240
Bugatti

1776
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,360
If you have a lot of guns

1777
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:32,896
That's something

1778
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:33,920
Tension

1779
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:36,480
Cuz there are a lot of guns

1780
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:41,088
Anyway I think it's possible for a person to

1781
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:41,856
To pay attention

1782
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:43,392
Do that themselves

1783
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:44,928
Like I think

1784
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:46,976
If you recognize I have a lot of guns

1785
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:51,072
You know that's something it's a little bit outside of the norm

1786
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:55,424
Have you keep track of that yourself go to therapy or whatever check in on it

1787
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:56,704
85

1788
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,520
You find who like that's alright it's like guns

1789
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,544
Responsible

1790
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:02,080
That is enough

1791
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:04,896
Keep doing that

1792
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:08,480
I think that when you say

1793
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:10,016
We want the people with a gun

1794
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:12,576
And your people like Stewart

1795
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,368
You want them for bad

1796
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:16,416
I would say I'd like

1797
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:17,440
People with gun

1798
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:18,976
But not to do anything

1799
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:19,744
Them to do

1800
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,280
I want them to calm down

1801
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:25,888
The battle for the hearts and minds of

1802
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:27,936
Hypothetical people with guns

1803
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:28,704
They're like

1804
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:29,984
Get ready

1805
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,008
The end is coming

1806
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:32,032
We will need to fight

1807
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:34,592
My Angela

1808
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:35,360
Cool

1809
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:42,272
That may be why we're struggling struggling

1810
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:44,320
Is like wait for the information

1811
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:45,088
Right

1812
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:47,136
Act on reality

1813
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:49,696
That is not as much fun as

1814
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:55,840
It's not as fun to wait

1815
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:57,120
As it must be

1816
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:58,144
Get tons of

1817
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,168
Retweets and stuff

1818
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:01,472
Speculating

1819
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:05,568
It's not as fun to hang in the back

1820
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:07,616
They should come out and go

1821
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:11,968
Along with America as it is much more fun safe

1822
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:14,016
Yep make more money

1823
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:18,368
None of the stuff that is the right thing

1824
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:19,136
To do

1825
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:22,464
Situation is the most fun

1826
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:25,536
As the person you're morally obligated

1827
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:26,304
To do those things

1828
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:27,840
Especially

1829
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:29,120
Platform

1830
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:29,888
Because today

1831
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:30,912
Do otherwise is to

1832
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:31,680
To do harm to

1833
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:32,448
People

1834
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:33,984
Set a reminder

1835
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:35,008
A10e

1836
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:37,312
Never fails to report

1837
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,920
The reason that this is so difficult

1838
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,200
Because we're just big dumb

1839
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:47,296
Right so in his ex-wife

1840
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:48,320
A talking about the ways

1841
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:49,344
We can get these people

1842
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,368
What guns

1843
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:51,136
Do our side

1844
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:52,928
Stewart's talking about

1845
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:54,464
Find

1846
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:57,536
Land outside like a barracks

1847
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:05,984
Like and then everybody all the soldiers that are there will be like Infowars billboard or whatever and then there is

1848
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:10,336
Terrifying evil strategy I can

1849
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:12,384
Right

1850
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:37,728
That is terrible

1851
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:40,288
Alex is being attacked

1852
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:42,080
For with dead kids

1853
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:42,848
Garbage

1854
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:45,920
Garbage

1855
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:51,040
Suggest

1856
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:51,808
Because they've kept

1857
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:52,576
Winning

1858
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:55,136
For such a long time by being

1859
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:55,904
Evelyn

1860
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:56,928
Yeah

1861
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:00,512
They really don't understand what a double-edged sword

1862
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,840
Because if your if your angle

1863
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:05,120
Is what we need

1864
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:07,936
Is radicalized military

1865
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:10,752
With right-wing pro-gun propaganda

1866
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:16,640
In order to make sure that if something does go down we have the military on our side

1867
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:19,200
Who will then presumably go to the liberal

1868
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:19,968
Cox home

1869
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:24,576
Whatever it's worth talking about

1870
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:28,160
Like I'm in globalist houses

1871
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:33,024
Don't tell the police

1872
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,328
So yeah

1873
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:36,864
We get them on our side

1874
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:43,520
Kill Soros or whatever realize when you make that a norm

1875
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:46,336
Then that is okay

1876
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:47,872
To be used against

1877
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:54,016
Liquid McConnell is like let's get rid of the filibuster for but it at all

1878
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:55,040
Okay

1879
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:57,088
You realize though that later on

1880
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:59,136
That can be done

1881
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:02,464
You're f****** because

1882
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:07,328
As as history has progressed

1883
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,864
Progression has half

1884
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:12,448
So no matter how much you want break the system

1885
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:13,472
To f******

1886
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:14,752
That progression

1887
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:19,616
That's really doing is ensuring your own f****** downfall later on

1888
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:22,176
As the pendulum swings

1889
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:26,784
We talked about the last time we talked about the pendulum

1890
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:30,880
If you really slam it as hard as you can maybe it doesn't swing back

1891
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:33,184
But that's not how this f****** work

1892
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:37,024
Like this is a bad idea

1893
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:40,352
Headlights

1894
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:42,912
Ostensibly fighting against

1895
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:45,472
It's not

1896
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,104
It it's obvious if you start looking

1897
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,152
What is probably the gift

1898
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:53,920
Have having

1899
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:54,688
Time

1900
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:56,224
You know being in 2019

1901
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:01,600
On so many of his long-held positions want

1902
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:04,672
He knew he was safe from whatever tyranny

1903
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:06,208
Encroaching

1904
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:07,488
Right

1905
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:09,024
You start to look back on this stuff

1906
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:10,304
You see how flimsy

1907
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,072
Superficial it is

1908
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:12,352
You see how it's not based

1909
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:14,656
It's mostly distraction

1910
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:16,704
Yeah

1911
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:23,616
Rival right selling products necessarily

1912
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:25,152
Are you still selling subscription

1913
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:26,176
Select prison plan

1914
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:28,224
Right

1915
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:31,296
Behind all of it

1916
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,088
Of the narrative

1917
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:36,416
The ways it time has shown

1918
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:37,184
That his

1919
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:38,208
Anger

1920
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:40,000
Towards tyranny and authoritarian

1921
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:40,768
Doesn't mean

1922
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:44,096
It makes you start to realize that all of this stuff

1923
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:45,120
Just like

1924
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:47,680
Will you have to make sure they don't do

1925
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:48,448
Exactly

1926
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,520
We have to make sure they don't do it and if in the process

1927
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:52,800
We end up doing it

1928
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:55,616
Albee what happened

1929
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:59,968
Greater Freedom cross that line

1930
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,504
Either way

1931
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,296
Go forward

1932
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:04,832
Or we pull back

1933
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:06,368
We're lunatics

1934
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:08,672
We will never ever ever

1935
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:12,000
Pullback

1936
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:13,536
About how I deal

1937
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:15,840
Donatos

1938
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:17,888
The Flash

1939
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:20,960
He gets pretty into

1940
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:27,360
Fight

1941
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:30,688
Plays out and what he gets to at the end

1942
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:32,736
Is such a damning indictment

1943
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:34,016
Who dies of the purse

1944
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,184
Call Lynn

1945
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:44,768
I will never submit to the New World Order

1946
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:57,824
Who you really are

1947
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:08,576
Dictator

1948
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:19,584
Really start living

1949
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:24,448
Here's my problem

1950
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:27,008
If Alex Jones Hood red

1951
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:29,056
Professes to have read

1952
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:31,104
He would have such a better reference

1953
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,896
For that kind of an idea then

1954
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:33,920
Be for Vendetta

1955
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:34,944
Come on

1956
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:38,272
V for Vendetta

1957
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:40,064
Grid references you can make

1958
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:43,648
Very easily the idea of ideas being immortal

1959
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:45,184
And the flesh being weak

1960
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:51,328
That sort of thing your ideas live on

1961
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:02,336
To site

1962
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:06,688
Make whatever movie reference

1963
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,480
How do you start to realize

1964
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:11,808
Alex have no literary reference

1965
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:14,112
Because he's read all these books

1966
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:16,416
But he has such a like a dearth of knowledge

1967
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:18,976
About these every single time

1968
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:21,280
He brings up a philosophical concept

1969
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:24,608
We're some sort of an idea as opposed to citing a book

1970
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:28,704
Citing a philosopher anything like that he's like

1971
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:31,776
I don't understand

1972
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:35,360
Good books are usually harder to

1973
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:37,152
But he says he's red.

1974
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:40,736
Is my point also harder to say

1975
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:42,528
Like I mean

1976
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:45,856
Not necessarily

1977
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:50,464
Information

1978
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:54,560
I think Alex is to ascertain

1979
01:41:55,584 --> 01:42:01,728
He makes complicated subject to very easy to understand

1980
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:03,776
Because he can

1981
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:07,872
He could

1982
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:14,528
Any of these things do that it's like one of the brothers karamazov set

1983
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:15,808
About it if it is just

1984
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:16,576
The thing where it's like

1985
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:17,856
If you knows that his audience

1986
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:18,624
Borderline

1987
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,464
You appeal to them on the ground

1988
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:27,328
A good idea

1989
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:31,168
If it's that then I understand but it's almost

1990
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:33,216
Never heard

1991
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:34,752
Accurate

1992
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:35,520
At least cite a book

1993
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:42,432
Heavy reference steady reference

1994
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:46,272
You have

1995
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:52,160
High literature

1996
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:54,720
Joyce quotes

1997
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:55,744
In his back pocket

1998
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:00,352
But

1999
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:01,632
Outtakes

2000
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:03,424
Call Zack

2001
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:09,056
From a guy who's frustrated

2002
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:12,128
I called the like Senators off

2003
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:14,176
I leave a message about

2004
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:15,200
You'll like this

2005
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:16,224
Is b*******

2006
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:18,272
Weirder

2007
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:21,088
Whatever whatever

2008
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,392
Listeners would give Congress

2009
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:26,208
Prostrated by that

2010
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:28,512
Alex has a inch

2011
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:40,544
Amazing

2012
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:52,064
Original

2013
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:56,416
Republican

2014
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:05,632
Shout began office and Alex complaining

2015
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:13,824
Complaining about Eid

2016
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,360
Doing exactly what

2017
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:23,808
Fealty to somebody lied to your face but at the same time

2018
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:25,088
He was complaining about stuff

2019
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:31,744
I don't know some people went bullhorn to Tucker Carlson's house

2020
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,096
Eating

2021
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:39,168
Alex's people at

2022
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:40,704
Something like that

2023
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:46,336
So you could be reasonably like okay well maybe it's a thing about the Quorum in people's private space

2024
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:47,872
Unfortunately Alex

2025
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:56,832
Congressman Talbot

2026
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:05,024
We need to go put private investigators on people

2027
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:07,840
Hargett is harassment

2028
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:14,240
I'm not sure it is follow your tongue

2029
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:18,592
I really should have looked into it the legality

2030
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:24,736
I don't think I'd be comfortable with it

2031
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:26,016
If we could

2032
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:31,136
Really think it would be a bad idea to hire a private investigator on Mitch McConnell

2033
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:37,536
I'm not sure what the

2034
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:43,936
You know I would say don't do it because it is private

2035
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:48,800
You're going to end up finding stuff that has nothing to do with whatever you're curious

2036
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:52,128
Violations

2037
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:53,920
People that is unnecessary

2038
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:56,992
Like whatever problems you have about Mitch McConnell

2039
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:01,600
Should stay in the political Realm

2040
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:05,440
Whatever his cheating on his wife

2041
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,024
Tell people why

2042
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:10,304
Why not

2043
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:17,984
Riverview that's wrong if you want to live in that space Coupe

2044
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:24,384
Cool I don't want to live

2045
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:29,504
I would not want to know those.

2046
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:30,528
Because I couldn't

2047
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:31,808
If you can find a

2048
01:46:32,064 --> 01:46:33,088
Pi2 just look

2049
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,136
2 likes proboat

2050
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:35,904
Connections with

2051
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:36,928
Like that

2052
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:38,720
Then that's more like it

2053
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:42,560
Researcher

2054
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:49,472
Right

2055
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:51,520
It's just that to me

2056
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:57,664
I don't know

2057
01:46:58,176 --> 01:47:02,272
On the other hand like you doing is farming outs talking to a

2058
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:03,296
Professional basically

2059
01:47:04,064 --> 01:47:05,856
Well yeah but you leave it up to the profession

2060
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:11,744
So

2061
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:14,560
Alex is reading an article

2062
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:15,328
About guns

2063
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:21,728
Alex says

2064
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:23,264
Is a Freudian slip

2065
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:24,032
In this

2066
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:24,800
In this clip

2067
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:25,824
Freudian slip

2068
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:27,104
That he

2069
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:28,640
He said something

2070
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:30,944
Teddy's so f****** accurate

2071
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,480
And he doesn't even realize it

2072
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:34,016
This blew my mind

2073
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:57,568
Spanish

2074
01:47:57,824 --> 01:48:03,200
You're not wrong

2075
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:08,832
Do you think that means I quit

2076
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:10,880
Enthusiastic

2077
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:11,648
The tyrants

2078
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:18,048
That's why I think he's trying to express

2079
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:21,632
You said that the stone was a complete

2080
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:22,912
Yeah

2081
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:24,448
Wow

2082
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:30,848
Episode Racine a lot of like just sort of standard Alex Jones

2083
01:48:32,128 --> 01:48:34,432
That was listened to

2084
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:36,736
Like it's pretty

2085
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:39,808
Display

2086
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:40,832
Which is interesting

2087
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:43,136
Cuz the other days haven't really been as

2088
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:44,672
Regular

2089
01:48:45,184 --> 01:48:46,208
That's not see him kind of

2090
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:47,232
Place where

2091
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:50,816
He's comfortable enough now cuz

2092
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:52,096
We can hang our hat on that

2093
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:53,888
Sandy Hook done

2094
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:58,240
Checkmart does Justice Gunn defense narrative

2095
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:00,800
Territory

2096
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:03,360
At the same time

2097
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:05,920
That's litify of the government did this

2098
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:08,224
They did it this is the government doing it

2099
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:08,992
In order

2100
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:11,808
The op to take our guns

2101
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:12,832
That's bad

2102
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:15,136
In the

2103
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:17,440
Beginning of the episode

2104
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:19,232
Alex

2105
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:20,000
The beginning of swords

2106
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:22,560
Alex gets a call from a guy who's like

2107
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:23,584
Did you

2108
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,888
Read the article in veterans today

2109
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:27,424
About how

2110
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:28,704
Hook was retro

2111
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:30,752
Tribution on behalf of Israel

2112
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:31,776
For something or other

2113
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:33,824
And Alex

2114
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:37,152
Alex like the good guys

2115
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:39,712
Israel did Sandy Hook

2116
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:40,736
And Alex is like

2117
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:42,016
Look

2118
01:49:42,528 --> 01:49:47,136
I don't know who's David General quoted in the article did they name them

2119
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:47,904
Look

2120
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:49,184
This is no good

2121
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,464
Like and I was like

2122
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:56,864
Holyshit Alex for another minute or so

2123
01:49:57,632 --> 01:49:59,424
Look veterans today has a great name

2124
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:06,080
Integrate URL at like he's jealous of the URL

2125
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:09,408
I have a great night and then he gets into talkin about how they

2126
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:11,456
Like you said he was an a******

2127
01:50:11,712 --> 01:50:12,480
In the past

2128
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:14,784
Exactly

2129
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:16,320
This doesn't really work

2130
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:19,648
He probably would have been like

2131
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:24,000
Tell me about it

2132
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:28,096
Has him like

2133
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:29,888
Interesting

2134
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:31,424
Goodnight

2135
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:36,288
Veteran interview like

2136
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:37,312
F*** them

2137
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:38,592
Part of his brain

2138
01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:40,896
There has not been a ton

2139
01:50:42,432 --> 01:50:44,480
What you would call conspiracy s*** about

2140
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:47,552
Broader

2141
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:48,832
The government did it

2142
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:53,184
There's not a ton of specifics there's that second shooter stop right but that's kind of like

2143
01:50:53,952 --> 01:51:00,096
You know that's misreporting that happened early on you don't want to engage with how reporting works

2144
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:04,448
We're not at like a

2145
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:07,776
Towers don't fall like that unless there's

2146
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:13,920
Charged explosives at the right exact points and we can prove that this is how they fell in all that s***

2147
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:15,712
We're not there yet we're just at like

2148
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:19,040
Yeah

2149
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:21,600
And I'm so here at the end of this episode

2150
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:22,624
We find

2151
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:23,648
The clip where everything

2152
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:46,944
Okay

2153
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:50,784
Martial law

2154
01:51:56,928 --> 01:52:00,512
What about Putin getting elected

2155
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:01,792
So

2156
01:52:02,304 --> 01:52:04,352
Here's where this becomes on 10

2157
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:05,888
This is where this

2158
01:52:06,656 --> 01:52:08,448
Days later is taking

2159
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:09,216
The turn

2160
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:10,752
Unpredictable

2161
01:52:11,008 --> 01:52:11,520
Much later

2162
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:14,080
The only reason you would bring up

2163
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:14,848
Something like that

2164
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:16,896
Is if you're going to suggest

2165
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:17,920
People

2166
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:19,456
Exactly

2167
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:24,064
Why why

2168
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:26,624
From the guy who knew Victoria Soto

2169
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:27,904
The teacher who died

2170
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:30,208
Picture of her

2171
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:36,608
He's reporting on are talking about this video of the father at leaves names Robbie Parker

2172
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:37,888
Who

2173
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:40,192
Was laughing nervously before

2174
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:41,728
Depressed speech

2175
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:43,776
Yeah we talked about this

2176
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:50,688
It is nervous situation

2177
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:51,712
Is

2178
01:52:53,504 --> 01:52:54,272
Ridiculous

2179
01:52:54,784 --> 01:52:55,808
To make a claim like

2180
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:58,112
He was laughing before is that interview

2181
01:52:58,368 --> 01:52:58,880
That means

2182
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:01,440
Most people don't have to

2183
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:02,464
Press conference

2184
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:05,024
Most people aren't good at Publix

2185
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:07,840
You and I both have years of

2186
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:09,376
Experience

2187
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:12,192
I'm so our response would be very different

2188
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:18,592
Then johnny-come-lately off the street or whatever if we were pulled in front of a camera right

2189
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:21,920
Both sides of his face

2190
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:23,456
Much less discomfort

2191
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:24,736
With speaking in

2192
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:26,016
In front of cameras

2193
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:28,064
I granted if we were talking

2194
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:29,344
About a situation

2195
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:30,368
We have lost loved ones

2196
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:38,048
How the f*** could you even put yourself in that space to imagine what are you suppose right

2197
01:53:38,304 --> 01:53:42,912
Normal reaction would be exactly stage preparation

2198
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:47,264
Intrinsic trading and it to bring another very

2199
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:52,384
Yeah like even taking that aside who knows how we would respond to that

2200
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:54,432
Just consider this

2201
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:58,528
Prior

2202
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:01,344
The only reason

2203
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:03,648
You would ever cover this story

2204
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:06,208
Or bring it up with any suspicion

2205
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:08,256
Is if you're intending

2206
01:54:08,512 --> 01:54:09,792
To introduce the idea

2207
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:10,560
That his

2208
01:54:10,816 --> 01:54:11,840
Kid didn't die

2209
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:12,608
And he is an act

2210
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:16,192
There's no reason

2211
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:17,728
To cast suspicion on the Family

2212
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:19,264
If you believe

2213
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:20,800
Is it people died there

2214
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:24,896
But I need to make this very strong

2215
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:27,456
This doesn't match

2216
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:28,992
With the narrative

2217
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:30,016
But he's been building

2218
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:31,552
For the previous days

2219
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:35,392
Right this doesn't match with anything that Larry Pratt

2220
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:39,232
Road Stuart Road

2221
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:43,584
Weirdo love guns his friend Matt Williams

2222
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:48,704
Earth

2223
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:51,776
None of these people have suggested

2224
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:53,312
In any way

2225
01:54:53,568 --> 01:54:54,592
That this stuff is fake

2226
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:57,664
Alex is doing this on his own

2227
01:54:58,432 --> 01:54:59,968
He's bringing up this story

2228
01:55:00,992 --> 01:55:01,760
Of the idea

2229
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:02,784
That this father

2230
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:04,064
Is laughing

2231
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:05,856
And reading off cue cards

2232
01:55:06,624 --> 01:55:07,648
On his own

2233
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:10,464
Is what

2234
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:11,232
5 days

2235
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:13,280
5 days later

2236
01:55:13,536 --> 01:55:14,816
He is at least

2237
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:16,352
Speculating

2238
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:17,632
That their actor

2239
01:55:17,888 --> 01:55:19,680
Earlier

2240
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:22,752
What is saying

2241
01:55:23,264 --> 01:55:25,312
We need to hire private investigators

2242
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:29,408
For these people other than professional harassed

2243
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:36,064
Wow your freelance

2244
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:42,464
Pro bono work

2245
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:51,680
Binoculars you know you'll

2246
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:55,008
You see that his kids still alive bada-bing bada-boom

2247
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:56,288
Closed case

2248
01:55:56,544 --> 01:55:59,360
Like why would you want to investigate this

2249
01:55:59,616 --> 01:56:02,432
If your suspicions wasn't that they were lying

2250
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:03,456
Yeah and we're fake

2251
01:56:03,968 --> 01:56:07,040
Because the only end result if you think it's real

2252
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:08,320
Or presenting

2253
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:09,600
Public facing

2254
01:56:09,856 --> 01:56:10,368
Appearance

2255
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,672
We get into that mess the whole body

2256
01:56:12,928 --> 01:56:14,208
We know that he knows it's

2257
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:16,512
But we keep saying like he thinks

2258
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:18,816
It's fake yeah

2259
01:56:19,072 --> 01:56:20,352
Right

2260
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:21,632
He thinks it's fake

2261
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:23,680
Telugu.

2262
01:56:23,936 --> 01:56:25,728
Yeah he knows it's real and he has

2263
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:26,496
From Facebook

2264
01:56:28,544 --> 01:56:29,312
If you

2265
01:56:29,568 --> 01:56:30,080
Think

2266
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:33,152
If you want to present the idea

2267
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:35,456
After think that there's a

2268
01:56:36,224 --> 01:56:36,992
It's just so

2269
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:38,272
F****** baffling

2270
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,344
Yeah I don't understand why anybody would

2271
01:56:43,136 --> 01:56:43,904
Even him

2272
01:56:44,672 --> 01:56:45,696
He's ruined

2273
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:47,232
His defensible position

2274
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,024
By covering this

2275
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:56,704
We sow the seeds of our own downfall from the very beginning

2276
01:56:57,216 --> 01:56:57,984
I guess

2277
01:56:58,240 --> 01:57:00,800
I don't know I don't know how

2278
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:02,848
Poetic

2279
01:57:04,128 --> 01:57:10,272
Like if I were if your goal is to cast aspersions on literally everything

2280
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:12,320
Sooner or later you're going to get

2281
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:13,344
Get yourself a

2282
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:15,648
In trouble if I were Alex Jones

2283
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:16,416
In this position

2284
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:19,744
Someone brought me this robbed

2285
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,024
Cuz he's already in the hopper

2286
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:27,424
Like if it was Rob Rob brings me this video that everyone's

2287
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:35,616
If you bring that to me and I'm Alex Jones and I've already worked for a couple days

2288
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:36,896
To build the

2289
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:38,688
It's all about taking our guns

2290
01:57:38,944 --> 01:57:41,504
The globalist

2291
01:57:42,016 --> 01:57:43,552
Killed the kids or whatever

2292
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:44,832
And you

2293
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:47,648
Totally everyone died

2294
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:49,696
That's the rock worst

2295
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:52,000
I'll be like

2296
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:53,280
Ha

2297
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:56,352
Let's not talk about that

2298
01:57:59,168 --> 01:57:59,936
Okay

2299
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:05,568
I see I see how that would be a natural reaction someone might have to in mental stress

2300
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:06,592
Right

2301
01:58:06,848 --> 01:58:08,128
Let's hunt on this one

2302
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:09,664
Cuz we don't need it

2303
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:14,272
Right over and over

2304
01:58:14,784 --> 01:58:18,112
I've never felt this way about Alex

2305
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:19,392
But listening to him

2306
01:58:19,648 --> 01:58:20,928
Like just a stop

2307
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:21,696
Stop

2308
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:26,560
You can do all you need to do without any of this ice cream

2309
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:31,680
But

2310
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:36,032
It is impossible for him not to

2311
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:41,408
Probably Push Pull

2312
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:42,176
Is that

2313
01:58:42,688 --> 01:58:44,992
Even on some level I'm sure he knows that

2314
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:47,808
He doesn't need to do that he's already got his gun

2315
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:48,576
Narrative going on

2316
01:58:49,344 --> 01:58:49,856
But

2317
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:52,416
Somebody Icarus somebody eggs

2318
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:53,440
You know somebody's like

2319
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:54,976
Hey

2320
01:58:57,536 --> 01:58:59,072
Literally

2321
01:59:01,632 --> 01:59:02,144
What about look

2322
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:03,936
Well guess what I'll go even f***

2323
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:08,288
Call me telling me to look into this

2324
01:59:08,544 --> 01:59:10,592
Who's the master of looking

2325
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:12,896
It's all fake

2326
01:59:14,688 --> 01:59:15,200
Wow

2327
01:59:15,456 --> 01:59:18,272
He didn't say anything about it

2328
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:56,928
Camera

2329
02:00:11,008 --> 02:00:13,824
Doug right now

2330
02:00:18,944 --> 02:00:20,224
I hate that so much

2331
02:00:20,992 --> 02:00:21,760
Because it shows

2332
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:25,344
Such an awareness of what the reality is

2333
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:26,368
Within

2334
02:00:27,904 --> 02:00:28,928
Creating suspicion

2335
02:00:29,184 --> 02:00:29,696
Demonized

2336
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:32,256
Maybe that's just how people react

2337
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:34,304
Distress

2338
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:35,072
Yep

2339
02:00:35,328 --> 02:00:36,864
He knows exactly what the true

2340
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:37,632
Truth is

2341
02:00:37,888 --> 02:00:39,936
He said the word came up like an actor

2342
02:00:40,448 --> 02:00:42,752
Nmds stupid f****** character work

2343
02:00:43,264 --> 02:00:45,312
About

2344
02:00:45,568 --> 02:00:46,592
Like as if

2345
02:00:46,848 --> 02:00:48,384
Whatever reaction he was having

2346
02:00:49,664 --> 02:00:50,432
Breath comes

2347
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:54,272
With her I don't know maybe that's

2348
02:00:58,624 --> 02:00:59,136
F****** garbage

2349
02:00:59,904 --> 02:01:01,184
I didn't expect a

2350
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:01,952
A little bit

2351
02:01:02,208 --> 02:01:03,744
I didn't expect to come this far

2352
02:01:04,768 --> 02:01:05,792
Crazy

2353
02:01:06,304 --> 02:01:08,096
Yeah we had

2354
02:01:08,352 --> 02:01:11,424
Articles week

2355
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:15,264
It's not

2356
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:17,824
We thought it would be at least a while before he died

2357
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:18,592
Decided that

2358
02:01:18,848 --> 02:01:21,408
We thought there would be some emotional distance

2359
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:23,200
Between when he goes from

2360
02:01:23,456 --> 02:01:25,248
This is real and it's affecting me

2361
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:28,832
Maybe the government did it but it still children who died

2362
02:01:29,088 --> 02:01:29,600
2

2363
02:01:31,392 --> 02:01:36,512
People who are all actors all of this

2364
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:38,560
Deeply insinuate

2365
02:01:40,096 --> 02:01:40,864
Happened on

2366
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:42,144
Friday

2367
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:43,936
Do not be Wednesday

2368
02:01:45,472 --> 02:01:46,240
It's nuts

2369
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:47,520
This is

2370
02:01:48,288 --> 02:01:49,056
Breezy to me

2371
02:01:49,824 --> 02:01:51,872
How did it happen that fast

2372
02:01:54,176 --> 02:01:56,224
You know totally it makes perfect sense

2373
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:58,784
How else would we have a gun culture

2374
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:01,600
So entrenched in this f****** country

2375
02:02:03,904 --> 02:02:04,672
After all

2376
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:13,120
How is it possible that

2377
02:02:13,376 --> 02:02:13,888
She was taken after

2378
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:17,216
Especially considering we know that in the UK

2379
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:23,616
One mass shooting happened

2380
02:02:23,872 --> 02:02:24,640
Happen and they went

2381
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:25,664
F***

2382
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:27,200
Hey this got to stop

2383
02:02:27,712 --> 02:02:30,784
The only way it makes sense for our culture.

2384
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:34,624
No legislative reaction to this

2385
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:36,160
Is it people like Alex

2386
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:37,696
Can turn that corner

2387
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:40,000
Such a short.

2388
02:02:40,256 --> 02:02:43,840
To unify their message of nothing can be f****** done ever

2389
02:02:44,096 --> 02:02:45,376
Nothing can be done about that

2390
02:02:45,632 --> 02:02:47,424
Because if it took him three weeks

2391
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:53,824
Maybe people would have finally gotten the goddamn picture in 3 weeks

2392
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:55,616
It's all fake

2393
02:02:55,872 --> 02:02:58,688
Beginning of this episode

2394
02:02:58,944 --> 02:02:59,712
Gandus weapon

2395
02:02:59,968 --> 02:03:02,272
And their their advantage over

2396
02:03:02,528 --> 02:03:04,064
Decent people is weaponizing

2397
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:04,832
The unknown

2398
02:03:05,344 --> 02:03:06,624
Like the idea of

2399
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:07,648
We don't know all the

2400
02:03:07,904 --> 02:03:08,672
The fact

2401
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:11,488
You can get all if you're decent person

2402
02:03:11,744 --> 02:03:13,536
You can watch that video this father

2403
02:03:14,048 --> 02:03:15,584
And not come away with it with any

2404
02:03:16,096 --> 02:03:17,376
Confusion or suspicion

2405
02:03:17,632 --> 02:03:18,400
Anything like that

2406
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:20,192
But a lot of these other things

2407
02:03:22,752 --> 02:03:23,520
But he's already started

2408
02:03:23,776 --> 02:03:26,080
Bring up of his own accord

2409
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:27,872
Stuff like that

2410
02:03:28,384 --> 02:03:29,664
The weaponizes the idea that

2411
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:30,688
So we don't all

2412
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:31,968
Have the reporting on

2413
02:03:32,224 --> 02:03:32,736
We don't have the

2414
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:34,528
And

2415
02:03:36,064 --> 02:03:37,344
It just it bums me out

2416
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:41,696
I don't I can't

2417
02:03:41,952 --> 02:03:45,280
Prove this but I don't understand how this isn't a financial motive

2418
02:03:46,048 --> 02:03:48,608
Like I don't understand someone doing this

2419
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:49,888
Who isn't getting

2420
02:03:50,144 --> 02:03:50,912
Paid a lot

2421
02:03:51,936 --> 02:03:52,448
Like I don't

2422
02:03:52,704 --> 02:03:53,472
I know that I can

2423
02:03:53,728 --> 02:03:54,752
Chip back that up

2424
02:03:55,264 --> 02:03:56,800
And I don't like to speculate about

2425
02:03:57,824 --> 02:03:58,336
But like

2426
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:00,896
There's only two ways

2427
02:04:01,152 --> 02:04:01,664
This makes sense

2428
02:04:03,968 --> 02:04:04,992
So much fun

2429
02:04:06,016 --> 02:04:07,808
What

2430
02:04:09,088 --> 02:04:10,368
He's just stalling

2431
02:04:11,904 --> 02:04:12,672
I have copies of it

2432
02:04:13,184 --> 02:04:13,696
To Keegan

2433
02:04:13,952 --> 02:04:15,488
Got us some of those copies and they're terrible

2434
02:04:19,584 --> 02:04:21,376
I meant subscriptions to his website

2435
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:23,168
I could see some Revenue

2436
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:26,240
The amount of money that it would

2437
02:04:29,824 --> 02:04:30,336
It just

2438
02:04:30,592 --> 02:04:31,872
Screams to me

2439
02:04:32,384 --> 02:04:33,664
Someone's got to be

2440
02:04:34,944 --> 02:04:35,456
Even back then

2441
02:04:35,968 --> 02:04:36,736
Someone

2442
02:04:36,992 --> 02:04:37,760
To be motivating

2443
02:04:38,272 --> 02:04:41,600
I'm actually going to go the complete opposite direction

2444
02:04:42,112 --> 02:04:43,392
There is no way

2445
02:04:43,904 --> 02:04:44,928
Vete

2446
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:46,720
Reasonable human being

2447
02:04:47,232 --> 02:04:50,304
Could get enough money to make this change back

2448
02:04:52,352 --> 02:04:55,680
Recognize and I totally understand your bafflement at this

2449
02:04:56,192 --> 02:04:56,704
Behavior

2450
02:04:57,472 --> 02:05:01,568
At the same time I'm baffled that people kill

2451
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:03,360
People in

2452
02:05:03,872 --> 02:05:07,712
Zodiac killer was a think

2453
02:05:07,968 --> 02:05:09,248
Not

2454
02:05:10,016 --> 02:05:11,296
Reasonable human

2455
02:05:11,552 --> 02:05:13,344
A financial interest

2456
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:15,648
This is a f****** serial killer

2457
02:05:15,904 --> 02:05:19,232
Of course you understand functioning

2458
02:05:19,744 --> 02:05:20,512
Other Avenue

2459
02:05:21,024 --> 02:05:22,048
The other area

2460
02:05:24,608 --> 02:05:26,400
Sure

2461
02:05:27,424 --> 02:05:31,008
Not all of them that painting with a massive broadcast

2462
02:05:31,264 --> 02:05:32,032
Yeah there's a high incidence

2463
02:05:32,544 --> 02:05:33,824
That in those those sorts of

2464
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:38,432
I just I

2465
02:05:38,688 --> 02:05:39,200
I just don't know

2466
02:05:39,968 --> 02:05:40,992
Even if your social

2467
02:05:42,528 --> 02:05:43,040
Because you don't

2468
02:05:43,808 --> 02:05:44,576
What I keep saying

2469
02:05:45,088 --> 02:05:45,600
You don't need

2470
02:05:47,136 --> 02:05:47,904
It's not

2471
02:05:50,208 --> 02:05:51,488
If he's a psychopath

2472
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,560
And what he cares about is defending his guns

2473
02:05:54,816 --> 02:05:55,584
And stuff like that

2474
02:05:56,096 --> 02:05:58,400
The idea that the families are actors

2475
02:05:59,936 --> 02:06:00,704
Doesn't help

2476
02:06:01,216 --> 02:06:03,520
It doesn't do anything more for him

2477
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:04,288
Then

2478
02:06:04,544 --> 02:06:06,848
The government came in and killed these kids

2479
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:09,664
In fact the government

2480
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:11,200
He's probably better for him

2481
02:06:11,712 --> 02:06:13,504
Vanity these people are actor

2482
02:06:14,272 --> 02:06:16,832
Write the serial killers

2483
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:23,232
Another aspect of that is always wanting to be the smartest person

2484
02:06:23,488 --> 02:06:28,864
Public there's a reason like the Zodiac Killer didn't need to send letters

2485
02:06:29,376 --> 02:06:29,888
You know

2486
02:06:30,656 --> 02:06:32,192
Like that didn't help his cause

2487
02:06:32,704 --> 02:06:37,056
Yeah you know the Unabomber didn't mean to send those letters

2488
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:39,872
He could have just bought

2489
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:43,200
The only difference is that this didn't

2490
02:06:43,456 --> 02:06:43,968
And

2491
02:06:46,784 --> 02:06:47,808
It didn't bring any X

2492
02:06:48,064 --> 02:06:48,576
Consequence

2493
02:06:49,344 --> 02:06:50,880
So it's not quite like that

2494
02:06:51,136 --> 02:06:57,024
The things that got serial killers caught

2495
02:06:57,536 --> 02:06:58,048
Yeah

2496
02:06:59,584 --> 02:07:04,192
I don't know I'm just saying I don't disagree

2497
02:07:04,704 --> 02:07:07,008
Vikas mental state

2498
02:07:07,776 --> 02:07:09,824
But I still I still

2499
02:07:10,336 --> 02:07:10,848
There's

2500
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:12,384
There's got to be some

2501
02:07:12,640 --> 02:07:13,408
Undisclosed

2502
02:07:14,432 --> 02:07:14,944
Something

2503
02:07:15,456 --> 02:07:16,480
I don't know what it is

2504
02:07:16,736 --> 02:07:17,504
It could be financed

2505
02:07:18,784 --> 02:07:22,368
Lake from where I'm standing

2506
02:07:23,904 --> 02:07:24,416
The operator

2507
02:07:24,928 --> 02:07:26,720
It really feels like

2508
02:07:27,232 --> 02:07:28,000
There has to be some

2509
02:07:28,512 --> 02:07:29,280
Ufinancial motivate

2510
02:07:30,048 --> 02:07:31,072
And turning this

2511
02:07:31,584 --> 02:07:33,376
Right foot

2512
02:07:33,632 --> 02:07:34,656
He also is beholding

2513
02:07:34,912 --> 02:07:36,448
A lot of really bad sources

2514
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:37,728
So there are p

2515
02:07:37,984 --> 02:07:38,496
People like to see

2516
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:39,264
4chan X

2517
02:07:40,288 --> 02:07:41,824
The world

2518
02:07:42,336 --> 02:07:43,616
And there could be some like

2519
02:07:44,384 --> 02:07:45,408
Really nefarious

2520
02:07:46,176 --> 02:07:47,456
Hasn't reared their head

2521
02:07:47,968 --> 02:07:51,040
We don't know who who or what is going on

2522
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:52,576
That is motivating

2523
02:07:53,088 --> 02:07:53,600
Yeah

2524
02:07:54,112 --> 02:07:57,696
I don't know I don't know if it's because unacceptable

2525
02:07:57,952 --> 02:07:59,232
Because to me that's

2526
02:07:59,488 --> 02:08:00,256
Smacks of a

2527
02:08:00,512 --> 02:08:01,280
Certain kind of

2528
02:08:01,536 --> 02:08:02,560
Hope which is

2529
02:08:02,816 --> 02:08:04,096
A weird way of putting

2530
02:08:04,608 --> 02:08:05,888
But one explanation

2531
02:08:06,144 --> 02:08:08,704
Yeah

2532
02:08:12,544 --> 02:08:15,104
It has to be something more than this guy's just

2533
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:15,872
Serial killer

2534
02:08:16,384 --> 02:08:17,920
Because at the very least

2535
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:19,968
I could understand this guy

2536
02:08:20,224 --> 02:08:20,992
If it was money

2537
02:08:21,504 --> 02:08:22,528
If you because

2538
02:08:23,296 --> 02:08:27,904
You and I would never f****** do something like this no matter what the price tag

2539
02:08:28,416 --> 02:08:31,232
But we can understand somebody who

2540
02:08:31,744 --> 02:08:34,048
We recognize that those people exist

2541
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:35,328
For a price

2542
02:08:35,584 --> 02:08:36,096
They'll do that

2543
02:08:37,376 --> 02:08:40,192
But the only problem with that is all the time

2544
02:08:40,448 --> 02:08:41,728
We've seen Alex showroom

2545
02:08:42,752 --> 02:08:43,520
You know it.

2546
02:08:46,848 --> 02:08:48,384
Given the awareness of life

2547
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:53,504
Maybe that's just how people respond like expect out of

2548
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:54,272
A stereo

2549
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:58,368
It would be going.

2550
02:08:58,624 --> 02:08:59,136
Or

2551
02:08:59,392 --> 02:09:02,208
Possibly

2552
02:09:03,744 --> 02:09:08,352
I don't know if he's good at this conversation

2553
02:09:08,608 --> 02:09:09,376
We're having

2554
02:09:09,632 --> 02:09:10,400
Reason why this must

2555
02:09:10,656 --> 02:09:11,168
Continue

2556
02:09:11,424 --> 02:09:12,704
This investigation

2557
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:13,728
Like it's not

2558
02:09:13,984 --> 02:09:15,008
I'm not nearly done

2559
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:16,800
Trying to find context clues

2560
02:09:17,824 --> 02:09:19,872
Just because 5 days after f****** saying

2561
02:09:20,128 --> 02:09:21,408
He's already

2562
02:09:22,176 --> 02:09:23,712
Dumbass unreal

2563
02:09:23,968 --> 02:09:24,480
Conspiracy

2564
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:26,528
Being thrown around

2565
02:09:26,784 --> 02:09:27,808
Using it on

2566
02:09:28,064 --> 02:09:28,576
Insinuate

2567
02:09:28,832 --> 02:09:29,856
That the victims

2568
02:09:30,624 --> 02:09:31,136
Really victim

2569
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:34,720
So how long is that even take to penetrate

2570
02:09:34,976 --> 02:09:37,792
Was that like a pretty quick

2571
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:40,608
Interview

2572
02:09:40,864 --> 02:09:41,376
You probably was

2573
02:09:42,144 --> 02:09:42,656
4

2574
02:09:43,168 --> 02:09:45,728
Correctly

2575
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:46,752
Conspiracy board

2576
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:49,568
It was a

2577
02:09:49,824 --> 02:09:50,336
Current time for

2578
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:52,640
Then it is nowadays

2579
02:09:53,408 --> 02:09:55,712
Like

2580
02:09:55,968 --> 02:09:56,992
Alex has been playing

2581
02:09:57,248 --> 02:09:57,760
Ketchup

2582
02:09:58,272 --> 02:09:59,040
Conspiracy world

2583
02:10:00,064 --> 02:10:00,576
Impreza

2584
02:10:01,344 --> 02:10:02,880
I'm creating fake Zack

2585
02:10:03,136 --> 02:10:03,648
His

2586
02:10:04,416 --> 02:10:06,208
Alternative

2587
02:10:06,464 --> 02:10:07,232
And all that

2588
02:10:09,536 --> 02:10:10,560
Was kind of like a big

2589
02:10:10,816 --> 02:10:11,328
Much bigger

2590
02:10:11,584 --> 02:10:13,632
Deal

2591
02:10:15,168 --> 02:10:16,960
Feel like him covering this is

2592
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:19,008
Like him feeling

2593
02:10:19,264 --> 02:10:20,032
Pressure from the

2594
02:10:20,288 --> 02:10:20,800
Conspiracy world

2595
02:10:21,056 --> 02:10:21,568
To cover it

2596
02:10:21,824 --> 02:10:25,920
If only because he had other callers were speculating about other

2597
02:10:26,432 --> 02:10:28,480
Mercy stop even wiser

2598
02:10:28,736 --> 02:10:29,504
Universal

2599
02:10:30,784 --> 02:10:31,296
I don't know

2600
02:10:32,832 --> 02:10:34,880
I think your assessment of me wanting an explanation

2601
02:10:35,136 --> 02:10:36,160
And it probably is impossible

2602
02:10:36,416 --> 02:10:36,928
Ever figure out

2603
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:37,952
I think that's fair

2604
02:10:38,976 --> 02:10:40,256
Still not going to

2605
02:10:40,512 --> 02:10:42,048
I'm not going to stop looking

2606
02:10:42,304 --> 02:10:44,608
Alright

2607
02:10:44,864 --> 02:10:45,376
I'm just

2608
02:10:45,632 --> 02:10:46,400
I'm putting

2609
02:10:46,656 --> 02:10:47,424
Button

2610
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:49,984
I love you

2611
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:50,752
4

2612
02:10:51,008 --> 02:10:51,776
Context clues

2613
02:10:52,288 --> 02:10:52,800
Possible

2614
02:10:53,312 --> 02:10:53,824
Because

2615
02:10:54,336 --> 02:10:54,848
Mine

2616
02:10:58,176 --> 02:10:58,688
Yeah

2617
02:10:58,944 --> 02:10:59,712
I don't know

2618
02:11:02,528 --> 02:11:03,040
But

2619
02:11:03,296 --> 02:11:05,344
Until we figure it out

2620
02:11:05,856 --> 02:11:06,624
It shouldn't take

2621
02:11:08,416 --> 02:11:10,720
It really shouldn't

2622
02:11:12,512 --> 02:11:14,304
Every other one of our investigations

2623
02:11:16,608 --> 02:11:19,424
Six months into a big investigation

2624
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:21,216
Life changing events

2625
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:23,264
Yep and it took

2626
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:26,080
20 seconds for him to speak

2627
02:11:26,336 --> 02:11:28,640
Yep

2628
02:11:29,408 --> 02:11:30,176
Still say that it's

2629
02:11:30,432 --> 02:11:31,200
Real

2630
02:11:31,712 --> 02:11:32,224
Workout

2631
02:11:32,736 --> 02:11:34,272
I believe the official story

2632
02:11:35,296 --> 02:11:36,064
It's so sad

2633
02:11:37,088 --> 02:11:37,856
All these folks

2634
02:11:39,136 --> 02:11:39,648
5 days

2635
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:41,952
He's already

2636
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:43,232
Speculating

2637
02:11:45,536 --> 02:11:46,304
Use the word back.

2638
02:11:48,864 --> 02:11:49,888
I can't f*** you

2639
02:11:52,448 --> 02:11:54,240
Like if I were to put myself in the

2640
02:11:56,288 --> 02:11:57,312
And I know I'll never

2641
02:11:59,872 --> 02:12:01,664
But but like the idea of

2642
02:12:02,176 --> 02:12:03,200
Even for even for us

2643
02:12:03,712 --> 02:12:04,224
Okay

2644
02:12:04,736 --> 02:12:08,576
For some reason because of the show somebody kills somebody

2645
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:10,112
Somebody kills him

2646
02:12:10,368 --> 02:12:10,880
And they

2647
02:12:11,136 --> 02:12:12,160
Do you like an interview with me

2648
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:16,512
My reaction would almost certainly be like a

2649
02:12:17,792 --> 02:12:18,304
Weird

2650
02:12:19,328 --> 02:12:20,096
Laugh cry

2651
02:12:20,864 --> 02:12:22,656
Just like I can't believe this is

2652
02:12:22,912 --> 02:12:25,216
This is a silly story book joke

2653
02:12:25,472 --> 02:12:26,496
I'm crying

2654
02:12:26,752 --> 02:12:28,288
I don't f****** understand

2655
02:12:28,544 --> 02:12:29,824
Anything that's going on right now

2656
02:12:30,336 --> 02:12:34,432
So if you wanted to call that a can if you wanted to use that video is like a

2657
02:12:34,688 --> 02:12:35,712
Proof that nobody in my

2658
02:12:36,224 --> 02:12:39,040
Only died you would almost certainly have all kinds of s*** like

2659
02:12:39,296 --> 02:12:42,624
There's no way that I could have any control over

2660
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:43,648
My reaction

2661
02:12:45,952 --> 02:12:46,976
That's banana

2662
02:12:47,488 --> 02:12:48,256
Banana

2663
02:12:48,512 --> 02:12:50,560
100 other

2664
02:12:52,608 --> 02:12:53,632
Publicized

2665
02:12:53,888 --> 02:12:54,400
Event

2666
02:12:54,656 --> 02:12:55,680
So you could find where

2667
02:12:55,936 --> 02:12:56,448
People are

2668
02:12:56,960 --> 02:13:00,800
Awkwardly or uncomfortably goofing off and then get

2669
02:13:01,056 --> 02:13:03,104
What's the message whenever the

2670
02:13:04,896 --> 02:13:08,224
And so many murder trials have those eyewitness accounts

2671
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:09,248
That are

2672
02:13:09,504 --> 02:13:10,272
Oh you know

2673
02:13:10,784 --> 02:13:12,064
Later on found to be f*****

2674
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:14,624
Looking stupid weather like well the person wasn't

2675
02:13:15,392 --> 02:13:15,904
Affected by

2676
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:16,928
So they probably

2677
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:19,232
You don't

2678
02:13:19,488 --> 02:13:25,632
F****** Noah covering the episode where

2679
02:13:25,888 --> 02:13:26,400
Alleged

2680
02:13:26,912 --> 02:13:27,680
Alleged

2681
02:13:27,936 --> 02:13:29,472
Shooter was a kid who was a victim

2682
02:13:29,728 --> 02:13:35,872
En guitarra island people thought didn't respond

2683
02:13:36,384 --> 02:13:38,432
That's traumatized

2684
02:13:38,688 --> 02:13:39,200
The best way to eat

2685
02:13:44,832 --> 02:13:45,344
Anyway I can

2686
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:50,720
Still better than

2687
02:13:50,976 --> 02:13:54,304
I have to stress that as much as

2688
02:13:54,816 --> 02:13:55,584
Not pleasant

2689
02:13:59,168 --> 02:14:00,448
I talk about whatever

2690
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:05,312
I don't want to do

2691
02:14:05,824 --> 02:14:07,616
Nope I don't take our audience

2692
02:14:07,872 --> 02:14:08,384
It's really want this

2693
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:10,176
To do that either and if they do

2694
02:14:12,992 --> 02:14:14,016
Platte River website

2695
02:14:14,272 --> 02:14:17,344
We do have a website then

2696
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:23,744
Ritron Twitter

2697
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:27,584
We even have a Facebook group called

2698
02:14:31,168 --> 02:14:31,680
We are on

2699
02:14:33,728 --> 02:14:39,104
Drive review all those good Etc people still

2700
02:14:39,616 --> 02:14:42,944
Yes I would say

2701
02:14:43,712 --> 02:14:44,736
The imaginary second

2702
02:14:45,504 --> 02:14:46,016
Sandy Hook

2703
02:14:46,528 --> 02:14:47,552
Did not kill anybody

2704
02:14:48,064 --> 02:14:48,576
I can play

2705
02:14:48,832 --> 02:14:49,344
Because they don't exist

2706
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:51,136
Right but there's one guy

2707
02:14:51,648 --> 02:14:53,696
Who technically probably have killed a guy that's true

2708
02:14:53,952 --> 02:14:55,232
And his name is Alex

2709
02:15:00,352 --> 02:15:03,936
