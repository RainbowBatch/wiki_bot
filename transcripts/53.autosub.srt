1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
Holding

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work

3
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:18,432
Because I am a complete Nutter

4
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:26,368
So grateful you forgot it

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,024
Discuss a little coconut water with little jokes

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,304
Dreading that two episodes

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,840
Would have been

8
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:42,496
Nightmare

9
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:48,896
Maldonado

10
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,432
Without talking about Alex Jeff

11
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:55,296
Alex Jones

12
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:59,136
This is not your grandpa podcast

13
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:03,232
I don't know I don't know

14
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:09,376
What the f*** is wrong with that guy

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,192
Yo

16
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,240
Today

17
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,520
What is

18
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,288
Monday

19
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,616
Monday Monday June 12th

20
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,408
Okay

21
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,248
It's sort of the culmination

22
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,528
Of our last

23
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,672
Control

24
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,464
About the Megyn Kelly interview that's

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,488
Coming out on Sunday

26
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,792
Obvious

27
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:41,632
Like there's some damage

28
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,680
And he's gone overboard

29
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,216
Attacking Chelsea Clinton

30
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,240
Quite a bit

31
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,056
Does she

32
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,336
She got involved

33
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:54,176
She started talking about how big and Kelly shouldn't have had Alex Jones on the show

34
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:59,040
You know there's a lot of people who have been going around on Twitter and saying that she should not be giving him a platform

35
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:05,440
Absolutely a valid point disagree with it to some extent

36
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,744
Because that work is done

37
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,096
The interview has been done and it's going to air barring

38
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,400
Bring some sort of crazy sponsor.

39
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,216
And we can

40
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,264
Which I'm assuming Alex Jones

41
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,056
Somehow Lobby and go sponsor

42
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,920
Twitter and said like oh JPMorgan

43
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:32,320
You're not ever really actually has done that

44
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,880
What's the f****** shelf that's a win-win

45
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:41,024
Oh yeah

46
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,840
The liberal Twitter

47
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,864
Don't put

48
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,728
Maniac on there which makes his followers even more maniacal in their support for

49
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,520
Whenever you have

50
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,568
Sponsors pull it cuz he doesn't have sponsors

51
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,592
Pull out real

52
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:59,968
He doesn't have that concern

53
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
You then

54
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:05,088
Because I'm so dangerous

55
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,392
Everything plays into his hands

56
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,672
Except for one

57
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,208
Very specific thing

58
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,768
That I'll be laying out over the course of this episode

59
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,560
Because this is innocent

60
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,096
The third installment of our

61
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,424
How not to cover Alex Jones

62
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:25,056
Continue until he's penniless

63
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
Tumi VI

64
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,848
Idea that everyone

65
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,152
If I don't give this guy a platform

66
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:35,296
Right understand the issue there

67
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,856
You just do it right

68
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,160
Gym in

69
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,720
Hockey and mundane ways

70
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,792
Playing into his hands

71
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,632
Set down the other night

72
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,680
Twitter thread

73
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,496
This is a major opportunity

74
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,568
Are people really want to make Headway against Alex Jones

75
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,872
There is a path we can proceed down

76
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,408
But no one is doing it

77
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,736
It's hard everyone is just getting mad about Sandy Hook

78
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,784
And I understand why

79
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:07,808
It's horrible

80
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,856
We've covered it extensively

81
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,136
If anything I've done

82
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,464
His denial of the death

83
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,256
Of those 20 children

84
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,280
Yeah

85
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,303
It is

86
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,071
Monster

87
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,351
It's unconscionable

88
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,167
Airline the damages done to their family

89
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:29,823
The lady who was getting death threats

90
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,199
Included

91
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,855
Yeah that was in the article

92
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,879
Was that you can't listen

93
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:47,743
Wow order deprogramming of a cult

94
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
Yeah

95
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,375
So all that is awful and I get why people want to focus on

96
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,679
Even in that

97
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,215
Scenario even if

98
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,239
Colonel

99
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
There's something

100
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,287
So much more

101
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,823
That we need to

102
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,591
Like

103
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,919
The issue that should be pressed on Alex is not

104
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,735
Why do you think that nothing happened in Newtown

105
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,319
Because that's a question he's been ready to answer forever

106
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,343
Yeah he's been

107
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:18,719
He's been preparing for that one absolutely

108
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:24,095
She's going to do that Buckley sat him down and was like dude I'm your cousin

109
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,375
Now you listen to me

110
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,167
That's going to come up

111
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,215
And stop marrying my third wife

112
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:36,895
I like the ongoing marital Troubles of Buckley better based on nothing

113
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,479
So the question that Megan Kelly should've asked

114
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,247
In regards

115
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,295
Sandy Hook and maybe she did I don't know

116
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
Who interviewed

117
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,159
So I don't I don't know what she has

118
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:48,927
And a lot of

119
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,719
The things that we have to go on it

120
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,999
Assumption

121
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,791
Past history

122
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,607
Of TV News special

123
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,655
Trailer

124
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,703
The question T-shirt

125
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
What is

126
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,591
Let's talk about your position on Sandy Hook

127
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,919
That put the traps down for Alex to walk

128
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,759
Because his narrative trailer

129
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,295
Is B we had debate

130
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,903
We we heard both sides of it sometimes for Devil's Advocate

131
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,927
Aldi's

132
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,719
So you say that

133
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,999
Then play him

134
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,023
VSCO

135
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,631
Use a synthetic

136
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,167
Completely

137
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,447
What actors

138
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,775
Fractured

139
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,967
That they clearly

140
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,295
Used Acura Sunday even ended up using

141
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,903
Photos of kids killed in mass shootings

142
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,695
Shooting

143
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,607
The sky is now the limit I appreciate your call

144
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,399
So you play that clip for him

145
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,007
Which is why are you lying

146
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,543
About what you said in the past

147
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,871
It's not about Sandy Hook necessarily

148
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,663
The important question is

149
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,223
Why are you pretending that wasn't your position

150
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,271
It's very publicly available

151
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,087
He's not ready to answer

152
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,623
And it's not

153
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,927
It's not a question that he can answer

154
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,695
Without

155
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,999
Stepping into a huge pile of s***

156
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,815
There's no conceivable answer to it other than

157
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,607
I was lying back then

158
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
Right

159
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,215
I was caught up in propaganda back then

160
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,543
And I think there will be consequences

161
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,359
I didn't realize how bad that would look in hindsight

162
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,663
He would have to say

163
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,223
I found evidence that it wasn't

164
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,807
Fake and I'm an idiot I'm sorry I said those things

165
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,415
Know his position would have

166
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,207
To be I was playing devil

167
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,743
What do you want

168
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,535
You have to listen to that go

169
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
No

170
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863
Unequivocal

171
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,143
He was explaining

172
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,191
What he saw the reality as

173
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,215
To his audience

174
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:15,871
He was directly saying it to a listener who was calling in and everyone else was the third

175
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,687
Yep they were the surrogate callers were being trained

176
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,063
And taught in the Macabre was that

177
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,343
In that clip he's

178
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
He says

179
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
I did

180
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:27,903
Believe it at

181
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,695
And now I do

182
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:34,815
So tell you can't call that Devil's Advocate you coming to a realization

183
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,143
There has to be something

184
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,959
It's not to get to like

185
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,495
Why are you a monster

186
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,543
How could you deny Facebook

187
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,079
It's why did you lie right

188
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,871
Or are you going to apologize

189
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:52,223
What is the nature of your deceit in this case or are you going to say

190
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
Your

191
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,295
Wrong or I'm dumb

192
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,831
I fell for this

193
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:00,415
With that sort of a question

194
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,183
You ask him

195
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,487
Why would you do that to those families

196
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,303
It sounds like there's going to be an emotional resonance

197
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,095
It's to it but it doesn't work with him

198
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,631
He's not going

199
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,655
He's ready for

200
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:16,031
His feelings and emotions

201
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,615
He's better than everybody else

202
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,943
No he has no feeling

203
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,223
Because he's never laugh

204
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,015
He's never actually left

205
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,039
Never

206
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:31,135
So we're going to get to this episode there's a couple of fun things

207
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,719
We're going to deal with a lot of damage control about Megyn Kelly

208
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,767
Getting

209
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,583
Then we're going to get to some really f***** up stuff

210
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,375
At the end of this

211
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,679
I'm going to play you a clip

212
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,983
That I think indicates that out

213
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,287
Our last episode back from 2015

214
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,311
Alex Jones

215
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,103
Quote-unquote jump the shark

216
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,151
In not in his conception

217
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,735
In this episode and validates the last 20 years

218
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:02,111
This career

219
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,511
So we're going to start at the beginning

220
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,423
You don't have coconut

221
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,007
Henry stop drinking wine whoever takes out the window

222
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,335
Alex started out the show on Monday

223
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
June 4th

224
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:30,271
Infowars.com Studios

225
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:36,671
Alex

226
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:46,911
Absolutely dominating

227
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:53,055
The treaties

228
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:11,743
Coordinated MBC this is all PR

229
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,535
Freshly out of Megyn Kelly

230
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,815
Chelsea Clinton

231
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,375
We know that you hang out with

232
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,679
This is incredible

233
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:26,591
Kelly

234
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:30,175
Trump says better watch out

235
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
Add

236
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,063
I just knew I was walking into a trap

237
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:42,975
Because no matter what

238
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,535
Zombies

239
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:52,959
Everybody else then just reminded of the show so it grows even fast

240
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,751
In the WikiLeaks

241
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,847
Patients dying because of your foundation how your mommy

242
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,319
Airplane

243
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,975
Alcohol

244
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,863
I kinda already know too

245
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,191
What the format of it

246
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:24,959
Who's going to be

247
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,495
Essentially the same attempt

248
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
Gotcha

249
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,799
There's going to be a mobster

250
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,103
Of course he knows we all know

251
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,151
What do you eat with the answer

252
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,431
Cancel the interview will be

253
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,991
Chelsea Clinton

254
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
He really

255
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,319
Stop bringing up Jeffrey Epstein

256
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,087
Flame

257
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
Does Trump was on it

258
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:49,023
Whatever he brings up how Clinton was on the quote-unquote Lolita Express

259
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,095
Trump but did to they were friends also

260
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
You can't

261
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,191
I'll just ignore that part of it

262
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,007
Fiesta frame

263
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
The interview as a hippie

264
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,079
That's important to his

265
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,103
His narrative work

266
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,151
And maybe that's fair

267
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
I don't know

268
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,991
I mean

269
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,807
You think there's no other way.

270
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,831
Organize

271
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:16,415
Is it right

272
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:22,815
How would you how would you do a puff piece on Alex Jones

273
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,351
I could do a piece that wasn't a hippie

274
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,911
I think I think certainly is it safe

275
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,727
Forgiven

276
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,751
Interview Alex

277
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,591
I wouldn't be doing it as a hatchet job

278
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,359
Destroy them

279
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,967
To drop that because I would also

280
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,991
Speak to

281
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,295
Here's what I would

282
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,135
Seek and Destroy first off by

283
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:57,887
What is my Approach Kelly should have done

284
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,447
The Sandy Hook stuff alone

285
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,495
Do something we talked about the beginning

286
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,543
Do you have to bring it up that's the approaches

287
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
2X

288
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,431
Explain to him and to illuminate to the audio

289
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,991
The link between his past

290
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,015
And his propaganda

291
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,087
That's what I would speak to do if I were doing

292
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
A story on him

293
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,391
It would not be a hippie

294
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,439
In the sense that I want to

295
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,719
You know like

296
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999
Score points off ever

297
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,535
I got but I wouldn't

298
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,839
Make clear

299
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,143
All of your toxic masculinity

300
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,727
All the things that you have about

301
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,287
All of that is very easily traced back

302
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,823
To your relationship

303
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
But your mother

304
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,639
That you've explained yourself on the air

305
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,431
Lathe

306
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:49,599
Further I would lay out God that would Blindside him beyond belief further I would lay out your

307
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,367
You're a bigot

308
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,159
I know you don't want to believe that

309
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,183
But you are

310
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:56,767
You think that you've been beaten up by black people more than

311
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,071
Martin Luther King has been beaten up by white people

312
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,375
You think that you're the new Martin Luther King

313
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,679
You have real problems

314
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,447
Grace

315
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:10,335
Maybe you don't say the N word on-air or maybe not even your private life I don't know

316
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,359
But that doesn't matter

317
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,175
You embody horrible racism

318
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,223
Now look at your pants

319
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,831
You think that you were beat up all the time by black

320
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,623
When you are a kid

321
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,159
Not realizing

322
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,207
World problems

323
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,023
You were a f****** s*** head kid

324
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,559
Also how many

325
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,351
How many Comas do you have to

326
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:36,703
You put other people in before it invalidates any before you look in the mirror

327
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,727
Yeah

328
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:42,335
Betsy I would take those stories that he's told on the air of being like

329
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,871
Targeted for his white

330
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,919
You realize how

331
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,479
The way that you deal with race now mirrors

332
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,807
That childish idea that you had when you were a kid

333
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,879
Do you realize that all of your anti-feminist ID

334
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,903
Kind of root

335
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,207
They take you

336
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,791
How to be a man you can't be a mama's boy you don't get love anymore kind of stuff

337
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,071
That's what I would do

338
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,887
Just laying there

339
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,679
Let's get in there what do you think

340
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:14,079
And hopefully there'll be some Opera mean he would just scream at me but

341
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,871
Like that's the way that

342
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,407
You would have to

343
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,967
Because because that would

344
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,503
Do the thing that

345
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,527
The

346
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,575
That the thing that he would hate the most

347
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,111
That would amass

348
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,415
Well

349
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,487
Far more damaging to his listeners

350
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,023
Because they're in

351
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,863
Like will not there but his audience as

352
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,143
Noted in the past

353
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,679
Is mostly White

354
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,775
80% +

355
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:44,799
Percent dudes

356
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,847
Yeah and

357
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,871
The most damage

358
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:52,735
His listeners be idea

359
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,527
Percent White

360
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,063
Instead of

361
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,599
Instead of trying to catch

362
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,367
In Ally

363
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,903
Or catching him in

364
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,695
In a

365
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,231
Evil

366
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,279
Are you really just

367
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
A p****

368
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,631
Did you ever consider that maybe you're a coward Act

369
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,167
I don't like that phrase

370
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,447
First of all the p****

371
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,751
See stuff but also

372
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
Using

373
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,943
Anything else I appreciate where you're coming

374
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,479
But here's the distinction I would make

375
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,783
I would not be seeking to emasculate

376
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:31,391
But he would feel emasculated based on his own twisted worldview

377
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,951
I will be seeking to actually

378
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,487
Give him a more robust

379
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,791
View of race and masculinity

380
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:41,887
Better much more integrated into the realities world as opposed to

381
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,703
His abused child understanding of it

382
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,239
Play clearly

383
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,287
I don't know this is

384
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
This is f*****

385
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,359
But clearly something happened

386
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,431
And it arrested in his development

387
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,479
Yeah that is what happened

388
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,015
Very simple to see

389
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,599
So all his understandings about the way people interact

390
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,367
The way

391
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,647
The world works

392
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,671
Is childish

393
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,719
Globalist

394
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,511
Is walking childish to begin with

395
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,815
And you take it you take it further

396
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,631
That's what I would want to get out of the inner

397
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,703
I would just do the psychopath test with

398
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,751
Call boy

399
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:23,871
Hey you scored your a murderer

400
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:29,503
Are you a murderer probably knock

401
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:37,951
Memphis be like like

402
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,583
Did you f*** Buckley's wife

403
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:49,471
Either questions we need answers

404
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,519
Less emasculation in more infantile

405
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,639
But I want to be able to connect with

406
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,455
The child the child version of himself

407
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,503
But he clearly is acting out with

408
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,295
Cuz it's

409
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:07,391
Don't you think that would make him a sympathetic

410
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,159
Figure though

411
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,695
No because

412
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,743
The damage is done is so severe

413
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:15,071
Daddy would take a tremendous amount of work for him to ever become zip

414
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:15,839
Pathetic again

415
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,911
Because once you get through that part

416
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,447
This is the route

417
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,239
Oh so much of your bigoted

418
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,287
So much of your stupid position

419
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,055
That you have

420
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,871
So much of your twisting of the truth is to match

421
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,639
Be there in five

422
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,175
Open tile ideas about the world

423
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,967
What is that

424
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,759
Then you can pile in with the

425
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,319
Why do you feel the need to lie about Sandy Hook

426
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,343
Cuz then you can

427
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
Like you

428
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,415
Destroy him

429
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,207
You can get in with the

430
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,279
Okay what about this do you realize that

431
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,583
Deep state of the conservative movement

432
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:53,471
Right now is going to take away healthcare for women that really need it a lot of it

433
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:59,871
Totally your fault that you played a massive role in perpetuating at Planned Parenthood

434
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,639
For medical progress

435
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,175
Platypus

436
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:05,759
Merida propagandistic Ali do you realize all the damage

437
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,807
That you've done to our International standing

438
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,623
Two are actually caught me once this bubble

439
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:14,975
Starts to go down a little bit justify your cheerleading for

440
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,255
Do you understand

441
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,279
Do you understand

442
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,815
Do you understand

443
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:21,375
And then he said that he would take take away a lot of

444
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,143
Sympathetic

445
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:22,911
Yeah

446
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,239
It's such a

447
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
To watch

448
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,079
Watch this

449
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,103
Reaction

450
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,895
Based on this

451
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,175
This entire interview

452
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:35,967
It's just that

453
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:43,647
Like you say something inflammatory and then you get out right

454
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,951
The outrage goes bad

455
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,975
To the other side and you just

456
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,255
Outrage

457
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,535
And nobody ever actually

458
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,303
Deals with

459
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,583
The f****** problem

460
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,863
V to some extent

461
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,911
Because it's a ping pong the game where used

462
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:58,239
Play yeah it's a traditional

463
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,263
Structures at

464
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,847
Unit like you said you get you say something f***** up I get mad

465
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:09,247
You get mad that I'm mad at you and it just goes back and forth

466
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,831
A media and a number of the players make a good amount of money

467
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,879
There is that.

468
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,184
That is really really

469
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,208
Customary

470
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,512
Even even though Alex

471
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,280
Themself as such

472
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,816
Alternative media figure

473
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,352
He's still very willing

474
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,376
Play that game

475
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:33,824
But the reality is you need to not play that game

476
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,640
Can't be played with someone like our

477
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,432
Like he's too

478
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,968
He's only

479
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,504
He's only yeah

480
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,528
Now the whole thing

481
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,064
The whole thing is a mess

482
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,208
You just described in your interview something that TV news

483
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,256
Witches

484
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,280
Just play the clip

485
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,584
Make you sit there

486
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,400
And listen to your word I would love to watch Alex

487
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,592
BB jelly and sweaty

488
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,384
Adjust

489
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,712
Probably better interview is

490
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,736
Alex Jones

491
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,296
Can't handle something could have your

492
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:21,696
Immaculate Alex Gallagher moments

493
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:28,352
And that's the whole thing again you can dish out all you want because you're a boy

494
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,656
Bully moment you get challenge

495
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,216
Runaway you're out

496
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,240
Is a

497
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,336
Withal

498
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,104
Sincerity

499
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,408
I wish they would have let me

500
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,688
The interview

501
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,968
It would be

502
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,736
The greatest

503
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,784
I would be in the background just

504
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,624
Barely barely audible just giggling like a lute

505
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,648
Yeah

506
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,232
Anyway

507
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,816
41 Clifton

508
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:02,400
Is Alex explaining

509
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,936
He thinks he was lied to

510
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,472
About the premise of the inner

511
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,008
Purview

512
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,104
It's simply amazing to see them

513
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,200
4 hours

514
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,552
In the morning till 10

515
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,344
45 at night

516
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,880
Interviewing me

517
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:27,488
They rented a barbecue place they rented out in my office

518
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:32,096
So they can edit it down to 11 minutes and then

519
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,936
I know he's ended questions together

520
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:43,104
Villain lighting

521
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,408
Villain lighting

522
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,880
Villain

523
00:23:55,136 --> 00:24:01,280
Maybe you just look like a villain in any lightning

524
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:07,680
On the phone with you

525
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:12,288
I know you're a lawyer and a hat

526
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:18,688
Sandy Hook

527
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,016
Those things

528
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,856
So she can try to get some answer she can stick together

529
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,904
Amazing

530
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,208
So let me read between the lines on that

531
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,536
You look like you want to yell something

532
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,816
Megyn Kelly

533
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,120
Told Alec

534
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,496
Means that what she actually said was

535
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,520
I find you fascinating

536
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,544
Or something like that

537
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,360
If you're crazy person

538
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,920
I also probably like

539
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,736
You know go get some dinner I'm coming down to Austin

540
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,504
Show me some

541
00:24:56,064 --> 00:25:01,184
Call wife

542
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,464
Let's let's

543
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,816
Get comfortable talking to each other a little bit make out a little bit

544
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,912
Sup the other stuff

545
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,752
TheCHIVE

546
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,520
Look that villain

547
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,056
It's just kind of a standard

548
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,848
2020

549
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:21,664
News interview footage

550
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:25,248
Is really dead

551
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:29,344
Terrible

552
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:37,792
Is product even later

553
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,376
The other thing

554
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,424
Cyberghost

555
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,728
The other thing

556
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:48,544
She kept asking me the same question over and over again

557
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,080
We know why

558
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,640
He didn't just

559
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,576
Service question and Ike

560
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:04,160
Continue to not

561
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,488
How do you feel about all the

562
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
The damage that

563
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,024
You've done to this

564
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:14,656
Coming

565
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,032
How do you feel about that

566
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:25,920
About as bad as the Sandy Hook victims

567
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,808
You keep bringing this up

568
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,832
I mean

569
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:36,928
Cuz I think our listeners interviewers want to know Megan this is our profession

570
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,024
Alright I'll change that

571
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:48,192
Uber how I look at it

572
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,728
You know what I just realized to

573
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,776
Pet Megan is gorgeous

574
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,592
She is beautiful

575
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,384
What team may end up

576
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,712
Humor

577
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:10,976
He left January with the secret

578
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,680
Presentation of what the interview is and her setup of it

579
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,960
Is very

580
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,984
Wrong

581
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,872
I would have got it was wrong

582
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,688
Clip is Alex trying

583
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,224
Explain

584
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,760
Why the demo

585
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,320
In the world are mad about his interview

586
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,928
Flagging show

587
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:46,048
15 minutes

588
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,096
So that she couldn't sit there and edited together

589
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:08,064
Unbelievable credible

590
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,440
Take 5

591
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:18,048
Why would you do a villainous laugh

592
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,096
Sing about your village are you talking about

593
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,376
The Trap

594
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,704
It also like

595
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,776
That strikes me so much

596
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,688
Yeah you're stupid Network

597
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,992
You're mad that I always win

598
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,040
Doesn't mean that you get to

599
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:42,368
Are me down he was that kind of f******

600
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,840
I don't actually really want to bully

601
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,424
That is actually

602
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,728
Goodnight clip

603
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,264
He said one thing that I

604
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,544
Kind of do agree with

605
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:04,640
And that is that a lot of the outrage about it is serving

606
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,664
To get more hype

607
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,200
For the interview

608
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,272
Intentional or not is another thing

609
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,088
I don't believe that there's a

610
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,392
A plot on the part of NBC-2

611
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,440
Hey let's anger people

612
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,720
Maybe there is

613
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,048
Guarantee guarantee

614
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,352
How many people watch

615
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,168
Sure

616
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,776
It's going to have very good rated no s***

617
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,800
Why

618
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:36,384
Probably do a lot to the extreme

619
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,664
Like

620
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,712
You would watch it

621
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,992
Yeah

622
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,320
We do for our work

623
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:48,928
Haywood Road

624
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:53,280
Are we going to cover it

625
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,328
Tech news

626
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,656
Yeah totally you have a built-in audience

627
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:02,496
A couple hundred thousand people listen to Alex regularly

628
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:07,616
Cuz his body was not nearly as big as he thinks it is

629
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,384
See Clinton

630
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,664
Get more yeah

631
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,968
The people who say Hillary should go away

632
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,272
Hillary should not

633
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:18,880
Go away the avatar for why the f*** are you white

634
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:23,232
Hating on women so goddamn much

635
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,048
Chelsea Clinton should go the f*** away

636
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,608
I don't need any more political Dynasty

637
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,400
I'm done with the bushes

638
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,680
I hope they all go

639
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,264
Done with the Kennedys

640
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,824
I'm done with where the whole point

641
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,616
If not to have

642
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,152
A goddamn monarchy

643
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:44,992
I think the Kennedys are done

644
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,296
For the most part

645
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,832
Second I don't think

646
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:52,672
Chelsea is necessarily engaged in electoral politics

647
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,584
I don't know if she's been asked if she's intimated that perhaps he'll run for office

648
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,352
She said no

649
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,912
Oh did she go

650
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,448
The few I've seen a few where she

651
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,984
She's like at this time

652
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,752
Am I to have milk

653
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,664
Either one

654
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,200
I don't think it's fair to

655
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:15,968
To say

656
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,504
Here is a person

657
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,320
Who is entire adult life

658
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,112
In the realm of politics

659
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,392
XM is gotten involved

660
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,696
The nonprofit NGO organization

661
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,000
Opinions on things

662
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,560
I don't think there's any reason to tell her to shut up

663
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:34,912
I don't like the idea of her running for office

664
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,192
Necessarily because

665
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,728
The same reason

666
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,032
But there's no reason for her to go away

667
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,568
Coppell

668
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,360
I agree with you completely

669
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,408
Okay.

670
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:52,832
I disappointed cuz I want my I want my the bushes are a much bigger problem

671
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,136
F*** off

672
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,160
Yeah

673
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,976
I know I know I'm wrong

674
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:02,816
I know I'm wrong but I have this very visceral emotional reaction

675
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,096
2nd time it's like

676
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,120
Oh

677
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,168
What is Mike Huckabee's daughter have

678
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,752
I don't buy a f****** car I don't care

679
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,312
He's way better at this

680
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:18,944
Maybe he was the problem is Sarah Huckabee Sanders is talented

681
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,480
Anyway

682
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,504
I don't know

683
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:29,696
Diamond Caesar bad that's my point my point

684
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,768
It might even be okay

685
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,328
But if you're going to run for president I would not be

686
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,096
Be against that

687
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:36,864
Yeah well

688
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,888
I'm against

689
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,656
The Senate is

690
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,592
Cox out

691
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,872
Talk about how great he is

692
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:48,896
Which is

693
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,176
Pretty standard fare

694
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,088
Yes

695
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,904
Cancel him don't show it

696
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,208
It's so hard

697
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:08,352
Controversy

698
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,680
Don't go watch it

699
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,312
A literal Passion of the Christ

700
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:24,992
That's how the Romans got criticized

701
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,648
Operating system

702
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,816
In the dark

703
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:03,392
Running around

704
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,928
Ivanka Trump had to say

705
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,960
I mean you're screaming was super vague

706
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,008
Soft supper maybe the

707
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,544
I checked into the small business

708
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,592
Optimism index

709
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:25,408
Even in the article

710
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,432
Specifically says

711
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:29,248
It's mostly because these companies are not going to have to pay Healthcare

712
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,064
I don't like that

713
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,088
Being high

714
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:40,512
That does not bode well for us the Christ is the top-rated movie of all time

715
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,048
Yeah no

716
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,096
It's number 30

717
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:47,936
Haven't you ever seen

718
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,960
The reprisal

719
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,984
No I've never seen

720
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,008
Does the direct

721
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,056
YouTube video sequence

722
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:00,736
Number 30

723
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,552
Number 33 is

724
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,576
Secret life of pets

725
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,648
Right around there

726
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:14,560
What do you mind if it's saying is it set of box office record that is beat

727
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,584
Been beaten

728
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:19,680
Superfair

729
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,448
2000

730
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,216
4

731
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,752
Number 30 is Lord of the Rings

732
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,544
Return of the King that came out in 2000

733
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,312
3

734
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,872
Second work number 24 is Jurassic Park

735
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,944
It just doesn't work

736
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,992
Lion King is 18 Again

737
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,016
4

738
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,320
Never was even close

739
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:42,720
Probably not even in the top 50

740
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:43,744
Yeah

741
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,280
My parents

742
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,328
When it came out my parents were part of

743
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,888
Church movie where the

744
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:50,912
We have

745
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,680
To go see the patch

746
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,472
Ports to support

747
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,264
Christian values

748
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,592
In the world

749
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:03,712
Give me the wildly anti-semitic characters that's okay sorry

750
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,760
Sorry

751
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,808
Actually

752
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:11,136
My dad is a religious studies professor

753
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,672
He wrote

754
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,464
An opera

755
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,048
Camp

756
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,072
Where are we living

757
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,984
University of Missouri

758
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,568
I was walking by The Secret Circle

759
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,616
Which is a place where

760
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,664
Free speech

761
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,736
You have protesters out there a lot but basically was just for

762
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,040
This insane preacher in a brother Jed

763
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:42,624
The scream at people already big Pandora

764
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,392
Already

765
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:49,280
Real fun for a day and then Super annoying after

766
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,584
I heard him screaming about my dad

767
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:58,752

768
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,056

777
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,584

Real Passion of the Christ fan blow

783
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:41,248
Also Alex

784
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,016
This is way smaller than

785
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,296
If you really look

786
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,088
Numbers are

787
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,368
Mini skewers

788
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,952
I recently checked back in

789
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,744
He had been growing at all

790
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,096
Not really at all

791
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,400
His profile

792
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,216
You're such a

793
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:01,984
English

794
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,008
Number of

795
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:03,776
People listening

796
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,824
Extol extol

797
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
This much

798
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,688
To the point where he

799
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,712
You can be

800
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,480
Indians

801
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,760
Higher National concert

802
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,552
He is in the zeitgeist

803
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:20,160
Nothing nothing we can't get there

804
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,696
I don't even know

805
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,744
Anybody can get there Beyond

806
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,768
I don't know

807
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,792
Christ

808
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,376
MB

809
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,400
Jim Caviezel

810
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:36,544
He was a movie with

811
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,848
No

812
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,384
Nothing

813
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,176
Really nothing

814
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,224
And somehow he's turned

815
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,504
Super small

816
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,296
Into a

817
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,088
It did just like

818
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
The constant

819
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,672
Left

820
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,304
Do you know the reason I think is because his actual audience

821
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,096
Is much larger than his

822
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,632
Going to his website

823
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,168
Actually listening to him audio

824
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,472
There are a lot of people who don't listen

825
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,520
Who are

826
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,544
Did Leah Greene

827
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,568
Yeah

828
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,128
I'm so the damage being done

829
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:15,968
That's being done by his

830
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,016
It resonates

831
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,296
The people who don't listen

832
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,600
But are already on that page

833
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:26,464
Yeah the biggest of the world the white nationalist time

834
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,488
Nationalist

835
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,280
Somehow

836
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,072
Very high

837
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:34,656
Steve

838
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:43,616
Athlon TVs Hillary for prison or whatever it is and immediately that is

839
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,248
Extend his reach

840
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,296
Through yeah I get it

841
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,136
Having him on

842
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:58,208
Megyn Kelly NBC that makes the most sense

843
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:58,976
Is that

844
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,000
There are late

845
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,024
Bigot

846
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,560
Who will be exposed to him

847
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,912
It's backwash

848
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,128
It's all bad back

849
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:18,944
Yes

850
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,968
The the

851
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,248
Main piece

852
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,528
Pf2 Resistol

853
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,392
In this episode as a massive rant

854
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,928
In the middle of the episode

855
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:35,584
Just because otherwise I'll be like 7 minutes long

856
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,352
This

857
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,400
Is where Alex is in

858
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,936
Mulan murder mode

859
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,984
He is prophet

860
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,520
Deciding his own demise

861
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:49,920
Oh yeah of course he's going to die but this is where

862
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,200
I'm talking about the

863
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,504
Damage control

864
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,040
The so far has been like

865
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,576
Kelly sucks

866
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,856
Ryder shows

867
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,880
All this stuff is just

868
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,744
JoJo stuff

869
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,048
This point gets to like

870
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:12,704
I got to make sure people know that I'm

871
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,056
Laying my life down intentionally.

872
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:22,176
He knows that they're like I was telling you before we started recording I have a very strong Theory

873
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:22,944
The Heat

874
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,712
Bentley said something

875
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,992
On camera that he knows he

876
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:28,576
I think that he exposed himself in a way

877
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:31,136
That make Kelly probably didn't realize

878
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,184
I bet he wasn't what he said

879
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,488
I'm going to guess it won't be

880
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:39,072
In the actual interview but if I watched all four hours that raw footage

881
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,912
Check 37 I'm certain

882
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,448
He knows that he said something

883
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,496
And he's worried that it'll be in the actual

884
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,056
Not to the extent of like

885
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,360
Or something like that

886
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:58,271
Just just one in one clip like

887
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:09,535
We're playing the game here come on

888
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,071
It's nothing like that

889
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,351
But

890
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,399
Pretty certain based on his

891
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,447
Veggies

892
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,751
He knows that he's in jeopardy

893
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,543
I believe

894
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:25,407
Chelsea Clinton

895
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:32,831
Hates women I'm not trying

896
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,647
To get out of this alive dumbasses

897
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:40,767
Saratoga restaurants in to get out of this a winner in your system

898
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,047
I'm here

899
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,631
I'm here to make you pee

900
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:52,287
Dewar's analyze and the corruption and the Clinton Foundation

901
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:55,871
Missing the main calculation

902
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:59,455
So I want and the Clinton Foundation

903
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:06,111
Charitable organization regardless of a very bad book title

904
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:09,183
I want to do I want to deposit right there because

905
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,463
I agree

906
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,231
Not with any

907
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,791
Except for what he said right there at the end

908
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,559
That is

909
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,095
This is why you missed

910
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:16,863
The calculation

911
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,679
And I agree that everybody who covers him

912
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,447
Missing

913
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,983
What his priorities

914
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,775
He is

915
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:24,799
To ascertain

916
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:25,823
A kamikaze

917
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:30,431
There is a reckless abandon about his public self

918
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,711
You don't give a fuk

919
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:34,783
If he's on NBC talking about how he doesn't believe in Sandy Hook

920
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,831
He has a thin for it and play

921
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,111
What

922
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,647
Terrible

923
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:41,695
Is is much different than

924
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,999
Would you care about is

925
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,047
The deconstruction of his ego

926
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,327
Remedy Construction

927
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,119
The globalist

928
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:52,191
Those two things would really put him in jeopardy

929
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,727
The everything else

930
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,495
Was just nonsense

931
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,543
You want to bring up 9/11 to him

932
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,847
He said 17 here 16 years

933
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,895
Really really puts

934
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,919
Varnish on that beat

935
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,687
Piece of s***

936
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,455
He has

937
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,991
He has it all.

938
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,015
Conspiracy stuff

939
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,039
He's Ironclad

940
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,599
So you do miss the calculations

941
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,391
Whatever you're approaching

942
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,415
That way

943
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:13,951
Just because

944
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,303
Right

945
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:22,399
Megyn Kelly in the Greater Media at Large

946
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:26,239
Is still Bound by a lot of

947
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,007
Things

948
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,031
And they can imagine

949
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:28,799
Somebody

950
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,079
Completely

951
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,103
Unbound by

952
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,151
Like even Fox

953
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:36,991
Clings to some of those old ways

954
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,527
Some of those like

955
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,551
We have to

956
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:40,831
Berries

957
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,599
Sliders

958
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:44,415
Have some sort of underpinning some sort of

959
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,439
Fact

960
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,743
Some sort of small little thing that we

961
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,023
We can kind of glom onto

962
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,047
Alex

963
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,583
Does not care

964
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,863
Natto

965
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,631
Hilton

966
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:59,519
He will just make sure it up you can catch him in that making s*** up

967
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:05,663
He's going to make sure it up about that there's no

968
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:07,967
You think

969
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:11,551
EBay normal for a normal media figure

970
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,087
Sooner or later

971
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,111
There's going to

972
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,135
Be a break

973
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,671
There's going to be

974
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,695
Where you have

975
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:18,719
Something

976
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,511
To to hold on to

977
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,303
Alex

978
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,071
Alex's

979
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,119
F****** Smoke on the Wind

980
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,399
Here's why

981
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:28,191
Smelling

982
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,471
Mail

983
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:32,031
The toxic vitality

984
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:37,663
He has a width of Axe Body Spray

985
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:43,807
In all conventional news in almost every other facet of people who are

986
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,087
Pontificating

987
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,111
Or whatever

988
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:48,415
They have forces to keep them in check

989
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,183
Like sponsor

990
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:51,743
Like the network like

991
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,559
Lake

992
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:57,119
He probably does have some sort of a

993
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,423
Billionaire benefactor that's backing him up

994
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,471
There probably is something like that you'd assume

995
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:06,335
Beyond The Zone products

996
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,383
Breitbart

997
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,943
There's got to be something like that behind the scene

998
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,759
Do finances can't work otherwise

999
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:16,063
But be that as it may the rest of it

1000
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,855
Is he sells his own product

1001
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,135
But he

1002
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:23,231
Warehouse that ships everything himself

1003
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:26,047
Sponsors that would ever betray you

1004
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,631
Indicated by a

1005
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,959
Basically just Alex

1006
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,007
So he's not going to abandon

1007
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,287
That's who Cash Cow

1008
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,567
Nothing

1009
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,335
Deleuze either

1010
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:48,831
Never heard of good luck radio stations that are under arrest

1011
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,647
Control but if those go away

1012
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:54,207
He's not getting paid for that there's no syndication

1013
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,999
MP4 Infowars stop

1014
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,791
So he's not losing money there

1015
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:01,887
If every single one of his radio Affiliates got lost

1016
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,679
Tell me the best thing ever for him

1017
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:07,007
He could claim that he's the biggest victim of censorship in the world

1018
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:09,055
Who caused Mass migration to his webs

1019
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,615
Such a great

1020
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,919
Swell of like the globalists are coming

1021
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,991
I need you to buy my products

1022
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,783
Do doesn't lose any money

1023
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,807
Spider-Man

1024
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,599
Uvideos do all this stuff because

1025
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:27,999
So all of these other people even Sean Hannity

1026
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:31,071
Rush Limbaugh

1027
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:36,191
Very serious Market pressures that stop them from being out and outliers

1028
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:38,239
People can boycott their sponsor

1029
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,775
People can make threats

1030
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,799
Things like that

1031
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,847
The free-market can touch them

1032
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,127
Alex really can't

1033
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,663
Except by

1034
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,711
The people who have been tricked by him

1035
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,247
Stopping buying a product

1036
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:52,063
And the likelihood of that is very low

1037
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,087
So

1038
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,111
Again cult

1039
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,135
C programming

1040
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,159
Like you can't

1041
00:47:56,415 --> 00:48:01,023
You're much more likely to get a mass suicide

1042
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,071
Yep totally

1043
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:06,655
So if you come at him with like this idea that you're going to

1044
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,423
Shame him

1045
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:11,519
And Subway is that you would to somebody who have the same Market pressures

1046
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:12,543
Your delusion

1047
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,823
Never going to crack

1048
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:16,127
He's only going to crack the threat

1049
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:18,431
Who is masculinity threats to his ego

1050
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,455
Or threats to his

1051
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:22,527
Globalist Smith

1052
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:27,391
Cuz he could just start yelling about a bunch of bulshit that probably isn't real

1053
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,183
If it's like

1054
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:32,255
It's like putting a psychopath on trial for

1055
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:34,559
Like 30 murders

1056
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:35,839
If you can't

1057
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:36,863
Definitively

1058
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,399
Prove

1059
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,935
He's going to deny them

1060
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,727
Yeah

1061
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:43,263
420

1062
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,287
You can put them in jail

1063
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,055
He's just going to

1064
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,103
To deny them because no matter what

1065
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:47,871
She thinks

1066
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,895
He's smarter than

1067
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,455
Thinks he's better than you and that

1068
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:53,247
You are less of a human being

1069
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,039
So it's

1070
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,063
Yeah

1071
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:00,159
Yeah I'm trying to steam a psychopath is mind-boggling

1072
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,695
Like you just don't

1073
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:03,487
Understand that the Shameless

1074
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:06,047
Necklace

1075
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,607
Trump has never been ashamed of any

1076
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:09,631
Nope

1077
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:15,263
We're like find like Alex called to the deep and Trump

1078
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,823
Within their souls

1079
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,639
May precision-guided

1080
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,687
Coming in on top of you

1081
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,671
I don't like you getting away with what you do

1082
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,463
You make me sick

1083
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:38,047
The barbed wire

1084
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:44,191
Doberman

1085
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:50,079
Yeah

1086
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:54,687
No and you can't hold it back

1087
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:58,271
You can destroy leaders you can destroy me but you can't

1088
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:02,367
The signal of Americana

1089
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:05,439
Americana Renasant 2.0

1090
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,535
Freedom prosperity

1091
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:14,143
Apparel

1092
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,935
Will County

1093
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,983
Compassion

1094
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,079
Friendship

1095
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:28,991
Globalism

1096
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:32,831
On your power trip

1097
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:40,767
I'm going to need that explains

1098
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,447
Together

1099
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:50,751
I love Humanity

1100
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:53,055
Because I'm so selfish

1101
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,871
I believe it because I know it's me

1102
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:57,663
And if you and us together

1103
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,855
And you have no idea because you don't know God

1104
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:09,183
This is where we'll take our first break in Atlanta

1105
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:12,255
This gets back to his

1106
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:15,839
My ancestors Army

1107
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:18,911
Who cares about that part of it for right now

1108
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:23,263
He does talk often about how like your offspring are just

1109
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:24,799
I don't like

1110
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:27,103
Erase memory and stuff like that

1111
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,687
That's true I believe that he thinks that you live on

1112
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:31,455
Through your answer

1113
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,527
I think that that is

1114
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:35,295
Okay this is

1115
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,063
The new fund

1116
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:42,719
I think that might be what he's getting it's hard to tell with Alex often when he's talking metaphorically or literally

1117
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:45,279
But he's brought this up enough times that I think

1118
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,303
When he talks about like

1119
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,095
I'm being selfish

1120
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,399
Selfless

1121
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:52,191
Please continue I'm being selfish

1122
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,215
Because I

1123
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,287
And I don't think he means my

1124
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,567
Gene's will carry on

1125
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,847
I think he thinks

1126
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,151
My great-grandson will be me

1127
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,711
Or something along those lines

1128
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,527
There's some sort of a reincarnation thing

1129
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,295
Going on

1130
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,855
Alex's believing in

1131
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:15,999
Spell it out cuz that's not too weird

1132
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:18,559
Espouse

1133
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,839
Ostensibly Christian

1134
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:20,863
Beliefs

1135
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,703
Ostensibly not really

1136
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:27,263
God damn it if we know what he actually believe

1137
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,311
Some weird facts

1138
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:32,895
So the other thing that clip it's really important

1139
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,663
You talk about like

1140
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:34,431
Notice the

1141
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,455
The talk-radio is beat

1142
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,759
The president has become

1143
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:38,527
Me

1144
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,319
And it's not

1145
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,087
Fair

1146
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,367
It's not real

1147
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,647
It's not true

1148
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:46,463
He's become Bannon

1149
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:52,607
Yeah I think that is I think you're right that's a much better way of putting it was a late

1150
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,375
Bigot

1151
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:58,239
And he is in our investigation in 2015 we flash back to that time.

1152
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:00,543
He never says Americana

1153
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:02,335
He never says Renaissance

1154
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,359
2.0

1155
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:05,663
He never talks about any of the things

1156
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,687
But he talks about now

1157
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,735
He's a completely different person

1158
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:11,039
In terms of the day like

1159
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:13,343
The catchphrases the men

1160
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:14,879
Does it work

1161
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:18,207
But he throws out rid of those little speech meme

1162
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:18,975
But he has

1163
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:20,255
Completely different

1164
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:22,047
It all changes with Trump

1165
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,583
He did not

1166
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,119
Everybody is not

1167
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:25,887
Become him

1168
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:28,447
He has become part of all that

1169
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,263
Now unfortunately

1170
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:33,567
Homogeneous to a certain extent all of it

1171
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,591
Which is

1172
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:35,615
White

1173
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,639
Nationalism

1174
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:39,199
These people have that in common

1175
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:41,503
Their priority is great white

1176
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,271
Christian man

1177
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,063
That is what it like

1178
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:44,831
That is the

1179
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:45,599
Thread

1180
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,367
Ties

1181
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,647
Between the

1182
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:51,231
The rebel media The Alex Jones the zerohedge

1183
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,511
The

1184
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:56,607
And that's another thing that and we were we were texting

1185
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,655
I have the specifics

1186
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:01,727
In front of me

1187
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,055
They were they will never actively point out

1188
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,591
This is a white

1189
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,615
Nationalist

1190
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,919
No

1191
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:10,943
The white Nash

1192
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,503
Those small groups

1193
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:19,903
Right

1194
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,439
The entirety

1195
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,719
Yeah it is not

1196
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:23,743
Small amount

1197
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:26,047
It is not these Fringe groups

1198
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,327
Yeah

1199
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:29,631
Those guys are out

1200
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:36,287
That's it that's the reality that my hypothetical interview with Alex Jones would also take on

1201
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,079
Is that I would like

1202
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:39,871
To elucidate to the audience

1203
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,919
That he doesn't care about the

1204
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:45,759
Conspiracy theories nearly as much as he cares about white identity

1205
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:48,831
Really really cares about when he gets

1206
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:49,599
To work

1207
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,647
It's usually about those things

1208
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:54,463
So to my estimation from my

1209
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,231
Now

1210
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:57,279
Six months of intense research on him

1211
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,071
You poor bastard

1212
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,607
Operating

1213
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:01,887
Like Theory

1214
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:04,703
Is

1215
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:07,519
The conspiracy stuff is intention

1216
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:10,079
It's a glittery seductive Ella Mae

1217
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,615
Map to get people to pay

1218
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,895
NSYNC

1219
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,943
But he's someone who tells the truth about

1220
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:15,711
Hot stuff

1221
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:17,503
Then once you're in

1222
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:20,063
All of these white narrative start

1223
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,367
To come up all of this victimhood narrative

1224
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:23,903
Everything about how like

1225
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,975
Estrace

1226
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:28,255
It all come

1227
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,047
And that's the main funk

1228
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,071
What you doing

1229
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:34,911
Tricking people into buying a survival Goods

1230
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,191
Fort illegal

1231
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:38,239
And then now also

1232
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:41,055
Lee radicalizing dudes

1233
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,335
In2white National

1234
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:48,479
And whether that was the case years ago I'm not sure

1235
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,527
But it absolutely is now

1236
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:54,879
The problem

1237
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,439
Yeah

1238
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,487
The Sandy Hook b*******

1239
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:00,511
Symptoms

1240
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:02,815
We should

1241
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,375
Why are you

1242
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,143
To Sandy Hook

1243
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,983
Or why are you f****** ruining their lives

1244
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:13,567
Like not to minimize that at all

1245
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:15,103
But the larger issue

1246
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,639
The thing that nobody

1247
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,943
Is white

1248
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:19,967
Primacy

1249
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:20,735
Because

1250
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:21,503
That is

1251
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:26,879
Just to make it clear that I'm not

1252
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:27,903
Just talkingshit

1253
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,695
I pulled up

1254
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,487
Statistics from quantcast

1255
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,023
Of demographic breakdown

1256
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:35,583
Of all of the sources that Alex Jones

1257
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,351
Respect

1258
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:39,935
He doesn't really site Breitbart article that much anymore

1259
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:43,519
I don't know what happened between them but there is there some sort of

1260
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,543
They're not

1261
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,823
They're not on who

1262
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:48,127
Is regular rotation

1263
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,711
But Infowars probably stop Trump from

1264
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,527
Or maybe

1265
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:58,623
Alex's cross about it

1266
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:02,463
Is 78% male

1267
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,023
22% female

1268
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,815
Credibly disproportionate today

1269
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:07,583
Demography

1270
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,351
Pics of the America

1271
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,143
The America

1272
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,935
If you want to look at

1273
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:15,007
Abnormal breakdown should be very close to 5050

1274
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,543
If you look at represent

1275
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,615
Specifically Appeals

1276
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,151

3% effort

Population

1280
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:27,807
Give me something to the effect

1281
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:28,575
13 /

1282
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,599
Percent African-American

1283
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,391
You expect something much

1284
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:33,183
Closer to that if it wasn't

1285
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:35,743
A massive operation

1286
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,791
Not beyond that

1287
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:38,815
The audience

1288
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:39,583
Is

1289
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:42,143
Something to the tune of

1290
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,679
60% over the age of 40

1291
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:44,959
So weird

1292
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,495
Just got that before in the past

1293
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:47,775
But that's an update

1294
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:48,799
The numbers of changed

1295
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:49,567
The tiny bit

1296
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,615
Now you look at the sources that he trusts

1297
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:52,895
Any flights

1298
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:54,431
We have World News Daily

73% over the age of 40

These places

Did Alex Jones

1326
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:52,287
Credible

1327
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,567
And I mean

1328
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,639
Just because 60% is over the age of 45 that doesn't

1329

40%

1330

But Alex Jones

1339
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:14,303
Credible and not part of the fake news

1340
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:17,375
The dinosaur media rat enemy media

1341
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:20,191
All of those places are heavily

1342
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:22,495
Older dudes

1343
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,287
And that's not a coincidence

1344
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:28,383
There's a reason that all of these places are networks together

1345
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:30,175
Unfortunately quadcast doesn't Publix

1346
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,711
64 Breitbart

1347
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,479
Pretty much

1348
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:34,015
So I mean like

1349
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:36,575
You understand what I'm getting

1350
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,647
This is

1351
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:43,231
A self resonating Echo chamber of white narrative

1352
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:45,791
Especially white male narrative

1353
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:48,095
And they realize that they have no danger

1354
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,119
In spelling out those

1355
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,167
They're totally fine to be

1356
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:53,471
Is flippant and dismissive

1357
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:54,495
Charleston

1358
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,519
As a shooting

1359
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:58,079
Because who's going to

1360
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:02,943
Already agreed 9% male audience

1361
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:06,271
87% white audience

1362
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,807
Is probably no one's going

1363
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,671
The worst

1364
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:15,487
The worst they could get out of that is

1365
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:17,279
Somebody saying well I'm not going to

1366
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:23,679
Rye or you might have someone who's like Alex is getting be a little much for me

1367
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:27,519
I may Drift from the fold but they're not going to be drudgereport

1368
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,823
Right

1369
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,127
UCO Mark Dice video out there that Alex

1370
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:32,895
Who's playing today

1371
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,431
And now you're back in the psycho

1372
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,967
It's

1373
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,015
It's

1374
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,551
It's completely nuts

1375
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,343
I don't know how else

1376
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:47,743
To put it

1377
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:58,751
It's one of the old-fashioned voice club we don't allow women golf

1378
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:02,591
This depicts about Infowars

1379
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:04,895
I saw that

1380
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:05,919
Checks out

1381
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:08,991
Yeah

1382
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:10,527
Is really scared because

1383
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,551
A very

1384
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:18,463
Is that

1385
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:23,327
Incredibly similar demographic

1386
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,095
Patterns

1387
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:26,655
I realize that a lot of people are probably the

1388
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:30,495
Call self-reinforcing

1389
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:32,543
Cuz they play the same stories

1390
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,335
They play the same narratives

1391
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:35,615
Well

1392
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:37,407
Alex

1393
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:43,551
Confirm not realizing what they're all in

1394
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:45,343
Together it's all a mess

1395
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,111
Propaganda

1396
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:46,879
Campaign

1397
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:48,415
Targeting White

1398
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,207
Fragile

1399
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,743
White male fragility

1400
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:55,839
The same as I said

1401
01:01:56,351 --> 01:02:02,239
Yeah it's going on here

1402
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:07,103
And the only difference is that Alex is dog-whistle about his calls for viola

1403
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:10,175
He is really desperately

1404
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:15,551
We're trying to get people to start

1405
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,599
Because when he is

1406
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:18,879
2 / 2

1407
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,903
Things happen

1408
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:23,487
Like the guy who showed up a comet ping pong with a gun

1409
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:26,303
Pull-A-Part

1410
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,583
Constantly harass this

1411
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:31,167
Hook victim after Alex Jones

1412
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:35,263
Stuff about Bohemian Grove there was a guy who tried to sneak in

1413
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,543
With a bunch of guns

1414
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,079
He was going to kill everybody

1415
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,103
Bohemian Grove

1416
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:46,271
If he's too overt there are people who follow

1417
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:47,551
What he says

1418
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,575
And those people

1419
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,647
A real Danger

1420
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:55,231
So you think if there is a

1421
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:58,303
If there is a white nationalist suicide bomber

1422
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,863
He will not say

1423
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,655
Oh he's a hero

1424
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:03,935
He's a martyr

1425
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,519
What

1426
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,287
Yeah

1427
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,847
Yeah that's what I'll do

1428
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,151
Drugs

1429
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:18,271
What's that south of South American drug that you

1430
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:22,879
Zombie

1431
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:31,583
Girls like you

1432
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:34,655
Of course which is the story every time

1433
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:38,495
Again as we discussed

1434
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:40,031
He still has never

1435
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:44,639
Apologize for insisting that it was a Muslim who shot up that mosque

1436
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:48,479
Yep he is not at all he said

1437
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:50,271
I know that it was a Muslim

1438
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,087
IEEE just doesn't

1439
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:56,415
Whatever I say

1440
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,951
He's a racist

1441
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:00,255
And this show is about white

1442
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,791
It sounds crazy

1443
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:02,815
Two stomachs

1444
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,863
And I understand

1445
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,399
Because he doesn't say like

1446
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,423
The n word

1447
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:10,751
It doesn't say black people are stupid or anything like that

1448
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,543
And he has Faith Harbor because of

1449
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,895
It is testimony said

1450
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:17,919
President-trump

1451
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:18,943
Didn't tell me to stop

1452
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,223
The investigation

1453
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,271
But there were all these insinuation

1454
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,831
I hope you'll stop

1455
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:27,903
Play I'm not racist

1456
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:31,231
I say that we're all humans with all Red Bluff

1457
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,535
The trappings of it

1458
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,303
The way

1459
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,327
Deals with

1460
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,631
A white death versus a minority.

1461
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:42,239
The anger that he has towards trans people and anything that's an aberration

1462
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:44,031
From what normal

1463
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:46,847
No

1464
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:48,127
We're that he's a bigot

1465
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:49,919
Anyway

1466
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:53,503
Alright

1467
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:20,383
So alive it's unbelievable

1468
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:21,407
Stand it

1469
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:25,503
You fallen monsters

1470
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:31,903
Cellular level

1471
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:35,231
I'm not with you and your damned to Hell system

1472
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:40,863
I'm good

1473
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,143
Know what that way

1474
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,711
Ascetic

1475
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:02,367
Duh

1476
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:06,463
Let It Go near me for 4 hours to edit it together

1477
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:10,047
And India blue Shelbyville was really sad

1478
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:13,119
No idea what that mean

1479
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,655
Or how that would work

1480
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:17,727
Or what you do I can ride into a trap

1481
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,359
Victor winner

1482
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:25,151
They think they're invincible

1483
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:33,855
Trying to put me down the mud they have a victory over busy shoving me down in the mud everybody's over-running

1484
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:38,975
Am I making it safe for everybody else to speak

1485
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:41,791
Just like Tom stealing Hannah much bigger scale

1486
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,351
So when he says that he is

1487
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,119
Telling the truth

1488
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,399
In some ways

1489
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,703
He's making it okay for people to

1490
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,727
Speak out about

1491
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:53,567
I'm freaked out by Muslims

1492
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:54,847
That's the third thing that

1493
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:59,455
The anti-pc stuff that he's doing is an actual like political correct

1494
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:02,783
I'm making bigotry okay again

1495
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:04,831
That kind of

1496
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:05,599
Agree with him

1497
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:10,463
That's why we do this show

1498
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:11,743
Trump campaign

1499
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:14,559
It was just all out now

1500
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,351
Because it's like

1501
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:20,447
It's not necessarily bigotry to make fun of a handicapped reporter and s***

1502
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,495
That's just cruel

1503
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:23,519
Ableist

1504
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,055
But I don't know if

1505
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:34,015
Question now is a good time for us to do that one little gate that

1506
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:40,415
Why they sell the hopes he's falling sell the hopes that he's a criminal

1507
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:44,767
Enron

1508
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,351
Good or bad

1509
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:54,239
Island

1510
01:07:54,495 --> 01:08:00,639
The winning team of the mainstream media wants you to lose once you pour once you are there control

1511
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:07,807
She wants to empower you

1512
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:11,135
Be a winner join MSM

1513
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,487
Lame

1514
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:17,023
And complete test

1515
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:28,287
And then make you believe that you're joining the winning team by going against rockets

1516
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:31,871
If you look at things

1517
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:38,271
We're destroying them in this way it's the next wave that will completely

1518
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:41,087
So

1519
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:44,415
Test is really bizarre

1520
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:51,071
But we have to frame it to his audience

1521
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:56,703
This life is just preparation for the

1522
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:59,263
So this whole thing is just a game

1523
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:01,567
Yeah he's using

1524
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:04,127
Trump to be that

1525
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,919
It might be slightly sacrilege

1526
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:06,943
In undertow

1527
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,735
But beyond that

1528
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:10,527
I don't understand his

1529
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,063
Conception where it's like

1530
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:14,367
You're either with me or you're

1531
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:16,415
With the mainstream media

1532
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,695
There's a middle ground

1533
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:21,791
There's a Nike and I can reject most of both not anymore

1534
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:26,911
Wholeheartedly

1535
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,703
The choices Dan

1536
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:31,007
Training your ideas

1537
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,055
How big

1538
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:36,639
I support the existence of the media as opposed to the existence of Ally

1539
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:40,223
I would tell you that

1540
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:43,551
Counterproductive

1541
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:46,879
To save it

1542
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:47,903
That's it

1543
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,183
Stupid but there's

1544
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:51,999
At this point there's nothing maybe that need

1545
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:53,023
Needs to be more protect

1546
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:56,095
You can't have cameras

1547
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:58,911
Recording the GOP answer

1548
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:03,007
They won't show you the Builder

1549
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:03,775
Because quote

1550
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,311
We're not stupid

1551
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,079
Exactly

1552
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,103
Quotes

1553
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:13,247
We might as well be the f******

1554
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:14,015
Is

1555
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:14,783
Keeping this

1556
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:19,391
Pictures of really good reason the freedom of the

1557
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,671
Press is in there

1558
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:23,743
Is the

1559
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:24,767
The First Amendment

1560
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:25,791
But freedom of the

1561
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:26,815
Is a

1562
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:27,839
Big deal

1563
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:30,399
Because in countries where they don't have

1564
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:33,471
Like ones that have influenced our

1565
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:40,383
National Security

1566
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,663
Journalist murdered

1567
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:43,199
For reporting the truth

1568
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:45,759
Yep and that is

1569
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:48,319
That is the point that's the danger and

1570
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:50,367
Buckhead

1571
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:52,415
Assistant

1572
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,951
Sounds it sounds

1573
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:54,975
Hyperbolic

1574
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:57,279
It really does to a lot of people really

1575
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:59,071
No America still has

1576
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:00,095
Protections in place

1577
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:00,863
We don't

1578
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,655
Rule of law

1579
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:03,423
God

1580
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,983
People were saying

1581
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,519
Even before the Alexa

1582
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:09,823
Trinidad

1583
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:13,407
Principles that we have are only as strong as

1584
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,175
Is the people

1585
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,199
Door

1586
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:16,223
Play

1587
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:24,415
So apparently

1588
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:27,743
This whole idea of like

1589
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:30,815
Norms

1590
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:33,375
Maybe we should have written that s*** down

1591
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:35,167
Yeah

1592
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:39,263
What was the thing about the press to is that like

1593
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:42,335
People don't believe that psychopath

1594
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:45,151
People don't understand

1595
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:45,919
Psychopath

1596
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:48,735
What these guys are

1597
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:51,551
They have no feelings I have no emotion

1598
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,343
They don't give a fuk about you

1599
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:55,391
They don't pretend to know

1600
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:57,695
Like this this game of

1601
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:58,719
Oh you know

1602
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:00,511
A general belief

1603
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:02,303
Humanity

1604
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:04,607
In the fundamental decency

1605
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:06,399
Of the people who want to

1606
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,191
Hey you don't run for office

1607
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:09,983
Power

1608
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,263
Because you think

1609
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,799
You know the people you know

1610
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,847
The majority of us

1611
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:16,127
Goodbye

1612
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:25,087
Why were fascinated by serial

1613
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,111
Killers

1614
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,391
Because of this like

1615
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,159
I can't

1616
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,695
Believe

1617
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:32,511
I can't believe that a person who looks

1618
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,047
Like a human being

1619
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:35,071
Is not

1620
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:41,727
Watch documentaries on the world right now

1621
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,359
Aruba

1622
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:48,127
Healthy

1623
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:50,943
Democracy Republic whatever

1624
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,735
It can contain

1625
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,527
A liar who's not funny

1626
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:57,855
Like Alex Jones can exist within a free speech

1627
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:58,879
Free Press

1628
01:12:59,135 --> 01:12:59,903
Paradigm

1629
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:00,927
Very easily

1630
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:04,255
And has for 20 years

1631
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:05,023
Did for the nonsense

1632
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:05,791
She's pouting

1633
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:08,351
But we can't have

1634
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:11,167
People who are legitimate reporters being demonized

1635
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,447
The fist

1636
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:15,519
Implode every

1637
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:19,359
So we are watching

1638
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,431
The other the other thing

1639
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:24,735
Into this is the reality of it

1640
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,783
Jones's game

1641
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:27,551
Can't be screwed

1642
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,343
Like it came

1643
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:31,647
Really survive people actually paying a

1644
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:32,671
Intuit

1645
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:35,999
So he has to demonize the media as a self-preservation

1646
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:39,327
Because if people start paying attention

1647
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:40,351
If

1648
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:41,631
We had funding

1649
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:44,703
Legitimately do this everyday

1650
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:45,983
Document what

1651
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:46,751
Are you saying

1652
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:49,311
Create this database that I'm working on

1653
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:51,615
Of the narratives that he's pitched

1654
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:52,383
Complete lies

1655
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:53,663
Over the years

1656
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:56,223
He just be like he'd be laughing

1657
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:59,039
If the mainstream media really

1658
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:00,831
Took their critical comb

1659
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:02,367
Did they wash over

1660
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:04,415
I think that mother forgot to wait for me

1661
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,183
If they

1662
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:09,791
If they scrutinize him the way they scrutinize real stories

1663
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:11,071
He'll be screwed

1664
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:14,399
And that's why he has to create like

1665
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:16,703
It's all it's all it desperate

1666
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:19,007
Self-preservation

1667
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:21,311
Preempt

1668
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:22,335
Damage control

1669
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,871
Put on a large

1670
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:25,663
NeverEnding

1671
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:26,431
Scale

1672
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:34,623
But you want but

1673
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:35,647
Okay do you want

1674
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:39,231
Oh no and I think you just learned the word Gorga

1675
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,359
They think that will boost

1676
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:07,135
I was

1677
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:17,119
Obviously

1678
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:25,567
Little bit

1679
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:32,735
The Gorgons

1680
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:36,831
Medusa's Palace

1681
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:02,687
By going into the Gorgons pit

1682
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:04,479
Survive

1683
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:07,807
I survived going into that layer

1684
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:10,879
What it's all about

1685
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:20,351
Are in the dark when she first got here

1686
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:23,679
Let's play some of that with audio for coming into the studio last week

1687
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:24,703
Now he plays eclipse

1688
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:31,103
From Jason and the Argonauts

1689
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:37,503
Monitors on the wall

1690
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,303
Teen

1691
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:57,983
What's what what's a bold woman

1692
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:10,015
Good cold as ice willing to sacrifice

1693
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:15,135
Our luck

1694
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:22,047
Surrozen

1695
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:35,359
Studio

1696
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:46,111
Everyone that's not sick

1697
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:51,743
You don't like the whole person

1698
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:57,631
Fruitealicious

1699
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:00,703
Give us money

1700
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:02,751
He said Gorgan 6 times

1701
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:06,335
Itsfunneh

1702
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:08,639
That was

1703
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:14,527
That was a fun dumb little

1704
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:16,319
Philly

1705
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:18,879
If it's an indication that he doesn't have much

1706
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:21,951
Like

1707
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,743
Even in the middle of that

1708
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,023
She's a key

1709
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:25,791
Keem

1710
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:26,815
Bow

1711
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:32,191
Borman that was him going into his Arrow sheet

1712
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:36,543
And finding nothing

1713
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:40,127
Couldn't come up with archer

1714
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:42,431
That's like

1715
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:43,711
I mean it's Patty

1716
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:45,503
He's trying to say that she's ugly

1717
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:46,527
Elvis

1718
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:48,319
I don't

1719
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:51,647
I'm not down with that but at the same time that's just our

1720
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:53,439
That's classic Alex

1721
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:55,743
We can all have fun with that cuz the rest of this is

1722
01:18:58,047 --> 01:19:00,607
So if he wants to attack

1723
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:04,447
Liberal I want weird-ass Jason and the Argonauts Alex

1724
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:06,495
Yesterday

1725
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:10,335
Also I wanted to cover like the most

1726
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:12,383
Sedate Megyn Kelly stuff

1727
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:14,687
I am.

1728
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:15,967
Tuesday while recording this

1729
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:17,247
Owen Shroyer was host

1730
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:19,551
So this is the most up-to-date

1731
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:20,575
Ever recorded

1732
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:26,975
Owen Shroyer at work that's never going to happen

1733
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:28,767
The whole thing it's tough

1734
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:33,375
Ocho Rios going to make a brief appearance at the end of our episode today and it

1735
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:37,215
Okay but this next clip

1736
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:38,239
He gets

1737
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:40,543
Really self conscious about

1738
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:41,823
People thinking he's being

1739
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:44,383
Using dirty words

1740
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:47,199
Nope

1741
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:47,967
You'll see

1742
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:48,991
But then

1743
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:50,015
Spirals out of

1744
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:51,295
Control into

1745
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:53,087
Talk about how Liberals are dumb

1746
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:58,975
Did they claim

1747
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:03,583
They're awesome they're not they're bunch of drooling

1748
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:05,887
Mystery

1749
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:06,911
Boobies

1750
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:11,519
Poshmark

1751
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:18,688
Is there a South China Sea multi thousand-year-old name for pirates

1752
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:22,528
Booby trap

1753
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:33,792
I don't like going to settings

1754
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:37,632
Your soup truck when elections are liberal

1755
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:44,032
Intellectuals

1756
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:50,432
America year old

1757
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:58,880
Go to Publix coupons

1758
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:02,464
You can't talk to me

1759
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:20,128
Running around foaming at the mouth

1760
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,856
Video emerges of Chef

1761
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:30,880
Questioning

1762
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:34,976
102

1763
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:36,000
It is

1764
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:37,280
But

1765
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,376
I love that you got that

1766
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:43,168
Probably my biggest

1767
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:43,936
3 year old

1768
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:48,800
3 rolls

1769
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:50,848
Knowing teaching anyone's XX

1770
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:54,432
It's cool 3 year old sex act

1771
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:56,224
I think that the only like

1772
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,528
Might be taught in school by

1773
01:21:58,784 --> 01:21:59,296
Tears

1774
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:01,600
You know what I mean like there might be like

1775
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:05,696
Like your friend might tell you that or something like that

1776
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:06,976
Teachers are not

1777
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,512
Broaching that at all

1778
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,304
From my experience

1779
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:13,632
Been public schools

1780
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:15,936
There is a sex ed

1781
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,008
Health Plan

1782
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:20,800
Mine was very

1783
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:22,080
Anti-sex

1784
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:24,640
Siri very much are

1785
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:25,920
People is hell

1786
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:28,480
I remember there was a girl in my class who was like laughing

1787
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:31,296
It's something and the teacher f****** freaked out on her

1788
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:32,576
He was like

1789
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:34,368
If you keep laughing you're going to be taking notes

1790
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,160
The rest of the class

1791
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:37,696
But she was trying to

1792
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:39,488
To keep things really on lock

1793
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:41,792
I got to get through

1794
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:43,328
Talking about

1795
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:46,656
Is f****** middle schoolers I don't want to do this

1796
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:48,704
No one's happy about this

1797
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:52,032
Like I wasn't three

1798
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:53,312
No one's teaching anybody anything

1799
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:56,384
Is Doctor

1800
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,408
Sikorsky has big

1801
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:58,688
Breaking news about

1802
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:01,760
Can we not do that guys

1803
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:02,784
Guys

1804
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:06,880
Let that one go here's why they really should have let it go I'm about to

1805
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:08,928
To play you a video that they play

1806
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:13,024
You know maybe you could decide if it's if it means

1807
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:17,120
Okay

1808
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:24,288
The election for Bernie Sanders

1809
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:32,480
I think

1810
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:35,552
I guess we've looked at as an ounce

1811
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:38,112
With a vested interest in training

1812
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:44,256
How do we get better access to

1813
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:45,792
Heart catheterization

1814
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:48,864
Develop better training guides

1815
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:55,776
Can one of the election officials speak to any work you've done with either the parties or other groups on the phone that type of information

1816
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:07,808
That's enough

1817
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,624
That's not

1818
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,928
You're supposed to be an expert that's

1819
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:13,696
Nothing

1820
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:18,048
That's an absolute zero you talkin about provisional ballots

1821
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:20,864
Trying to better train the public

1822
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:24,960
How to use provisional ballot which is a good thing to be asking about

1823
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:25,984
Because it is

1824
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:27,264
We're complicated issue

1825
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:32,384
Quite frankly I don't know if I would know how to send in a provisional ballot

1826
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,944
So I wouldn't mind some education

1827
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,272
Could you explain why both get rejected

1828
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:40,576
Is an amazingly good Quest

1829
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:42,880
And that has nothing to do with

1830
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:45,440
Some sort of a set up against Bernie Sanders

1831
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:48,768
That's nothing to do with even questioning the Integrity of voting

1832
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:51,072
So they're just lying

1833
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:52,608
Let's just do

1834
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:59,008
I want a flashback to a little bit earlier in the episode when Alex Jones was talking about I'm still alive it's crazy

1835
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:01,824
My discernment is better than it's ever been

1836
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:06,432
How is your discernment allowing you to report on this video is something nefarious

1837
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:08,480
You understand

1838
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:09,504
That's insane

1839
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,088
Yeah that's bad discernment

1840
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:17,952
So Jerome corsi is on and most of it is about

1841
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:19,488
To listen to board

1842
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,280
What's the rapper

1843
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:22,816
He needs a more holistic

1844
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:24,352
I don't

1845
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:25,376
I don't not support that

1846
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,192
Corky's on

1847
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:32,032
How Alex is the victim of a propaganda campaign

1848
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:35,360
And how Megyn Kelly is doing her job

1849
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:37,920
Like I'm going to assassinate the character of Alex

1850
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:39,456
Couple of big things happen

1851
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:40,480
The first

1852
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:43,552
Is the Jerome corsi finally says meme correctly

1853
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:49,696
Then f*** it I'm back on inside baby meme I mean meme

1854
01:25:54,304 --> 01:26:00,448
Then about five minutes later it was a conversation with somebody like

1855
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:01,984
You just being like hey

1856
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:05,312
Not five minutes

1857
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,080
Stop f******

1858
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:09,920
Idiot

1859
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,712
Oh that's great

1860
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:15,808
I was I was referring to earlier than

1861
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:18,880
Jump the shark

1862
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:22,208
Yes and this clip Alex Jones invalidates

1863
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:22,976
It's his career

1864
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:25,536
What should Trump do

1865
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:31,680
Well the presidency as normal Power

1866
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:33,728
Start using it

1867
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:39,872
Better start realizing in Washington

1868
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:43,968
Don't wait till the end

1869
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,504
Get rid of all the people

1870
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:50,112
In the administration to I've been there from Clinton and from Obama get rid of them

1871
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,416
So far okay

1872
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:54,976
Also get rid of those people

1873
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:56,512
And then bring in a bunch

1874
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:57,280
Sycophant

1875
01:26:57,792 --> 01:27:01,632
Who will tell you that everything you're doing is right

1876
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:04,960
Still not the most insane thing ever

1877
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:08,800
I think it would be unwise and probably lead to a lot of trouble

1878
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:13,920
But not the worst thing I've ever heard I do like Jerome corsi

1879
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:18,784
Infowars studio and in d.c.

1880
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:23,136
You can hear a motorcycle wrestling outside

1881
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:24,672
Acoustics

1882
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:27,744
But now we get to I want him to have a pic

1883
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:35,168
Better be the best yeah yeah that was a weird little

1884
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:41,312
Easter egg across like a director has the same little time could be his little Winky

1885
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:44,896
So this is where

1886
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:50,528
Call me

1887
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:51,552
Clinton and the other

1888
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:53,856
Counterattack

1889
01:27:54,112 --> 01:28:00,256
Absolutely

1890
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:06,400
Horses

1891
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:14,592
So they're Alex Jones

1892
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:15,616
In one

1893
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:17,664
Invalidates the

1894
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:18,432
Entire premise

1895
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:21,248
His career government

1896
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:24,320
Take military action against

1897
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:26,368
Hypno against its own enemy

1898
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:29,696
Which conceivably would be some private

1899
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:34,304
Cuz they're talking about people who are

1900
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,584
Pushing this Russian

1901
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,888
Propaganda

1902
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:39,424
Directions to Fizz all fake

1903
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:42,496
I think so they know it's not

1904
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:44,544
Totally but here's the thing

1905
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:47,872
Sing fire all these people

1906
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:49,152
Is okay

1907
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,944
It's wrong but it's okay

1908
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,480
Him saying

1909
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:54,784
We need to indict call me

1910
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,320
Clinton Obama

1911
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:57,856
Is an abuse of power

1912
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,720
The President telling the f

1913
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:04,256
Bi to do this

1914
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:06,048
A

1915
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:06,816
Gross

1916
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:08,608
Nation of what the price

1917
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:10,144
Relation

1918
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:20,640
Because I have a sentence

1919
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:21,408
Kind of in the

1920
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:22,176
Wheelhouse

1921
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:25,504
Brielle hold off

1922
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,784
Cuz Alex Jones

1923
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,576
Legitimately just said

1924
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:30,112
A military coup

1925
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:31,648
Cleaning out

1926
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,184
Acting on

1927
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,720
The people who are against

1928
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:36,256
Trump with the military

1929
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,560
She is made

1930
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:40,096
Documentary film

1931
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:41,888
Called the road to tyranny

1932
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:43,936
Things will

1933
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:47,008
Everything that he talks about is a

1934
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:49,056
He's entirely

1935
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:50,592
His entire premise

1936
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:52,384
Is that like these globalist

1937
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,176
Are going to have some sort of a coup

1938
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:57,760
Counter counter counter

1939
01:29:58,784 --> 01:29:59,552
It's not okay

1940
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:02,624
It's absolutely not okay

1941
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:07,232
That is in later in the episode but

1942
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:08,512
Since I didn't get to it

1943
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:10,816
He absolutely didn't say that flipping

1944
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:11,584
He meant it

1945
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,352
Now you did

1946
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:13,120
Demon

1947
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:15,168
That the military needs to get involved

1948
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,192
And

1949
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:19,008
I don't know what the military would be doing first of all act

1950
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:20,544
Acting within the country's borders

1951
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:26,944
I think that's part of what he was really afraid of or not Jen 31

1952
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:33,088
I'm literally Caesar yeah that's quite literally

1953
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,416
What Cesar juicy power

1954
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:37,184
Yeah

1955
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:40,000
So if they everything is well with the military do

1956
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:41,792
I guess you loves and kill them

1957
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:42,816
Like

1958
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:46,912
Abu ghraib man

1959
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:48,704
There's opening

1960
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:55,104
Guantanamo Bay is one of the most expensive things I've ever heard

1961
01:30:56,128 --> 01:31:01,504
Megan Kelly style interview

1962
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,528
Your guy

1963
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,576
Having a military coup

1964
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:06,624
Why

1965
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:10,464
That's what he called for

1966
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:11,232
Yeah

1967
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:14,048
That's not that he said military action

1968
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:14,816
But

1969
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:16,864
Singapore news people physically

1970
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:20,448
What do you want

1971
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:21,984
What up what else is there to say

1972
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:23,008
What is there

1973
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:24,544
Set

1974
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:26,080
That's so

1975
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:27,104
That's

1976
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:27,872
Crossing a

1977
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:28,640
Huge line

1978
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:29,408
Yeah

1979
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:30,944
Now thankfully that's not

1980
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:36,576
Free market all of this

1981
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:43,232
Like less government is all gone the moment you want a military coup

1982
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:46,816
And you want a military coup to stop

1983
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:48,096
An investigation

1984
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:53,728
It has a lot of evidence behind

1985
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:58,848
The idea that you would do that is only because you know that eventually something is going to

1986
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:04,992
He asked you

1987
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:11,392
2015 he knew he was mobbed up in 2015 he was the frontman for a Consortium on the East Coast

1988
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:14,720
He knows all this stuff launders Russian money

1989
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:16,000
Yeah he knows that

1990
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:18,560
He can't pretend he doesn't know that

1991
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:22,144
That knowledge that he had 2 years ago is still in his head

1992
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,192
He's just pretending it's not there anymore

1993
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:26,496
He's pretending he doesn't know these things

1994
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:28,288
Talks about like

1995
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:29,824
This Russian thing is fake

1996
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,104
Dino's it's not

1997
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,664
I'm the idea that in order to stop it

1998
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:34,432
You would want

1999
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:36,480
The president to order the military

2000
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:37,248
To act

2001
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:39,552
Physically upon his opponent

2002
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:40,576
Is

2003
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,136
That is treason

2004
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:44,672
That is wishing trees

2005
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:46,720
Yeah I'm not saying Alex's committing

2006
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:51,072
Destruction of the American Republic entirely

2007
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:53,120
In the name of protecting

2008
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:59,520
Which is I mean that's what all scoundrels

2009
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:04,384
That's what the cultural revolution was

2010
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:08,224
All of these authoritarian Powers will always say

2011
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,016
You don't need these rights

2012
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:11,552
We're going to protect

2013
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:15,136
Yeah we are the ones who can do all of this stuff

2014
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:16,160
So you don't need

2015
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:21,536
Because these other fake people are trying to take me out

2016
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:25,632
The countries in this clip

2017
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:26,656
In case you're a nerd

2018
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:27,936
He put it another way

2019
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:28,704
And the next one

2020
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,896
The desensitizing

2021
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:37,920
Republic

2022
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:44,320
With this assassination play with.

2023
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:59,680
Hey course he wants that big story

2024
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:02,752
All of the

2025
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,248
Get rid of the Obama and

2026
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:15,296
Clinton

2027
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:26,560
That was for the nerd

2028
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:32,448
Kill the Jedi

2029
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,496
If you're keeping track

2030
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:36,288
If you're keeping track

2031
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,080
Order 66

2032
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:40,640
In the Starwars universe

2033
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:43,456
Revenge is what destroys

2034
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:44,480
The entire

2035
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,296
It's the Clones

2036
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:48,320
Hilton

2037
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:57,536
Alex

2038
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:58,816
You shouldn't do that

2039
01:34:59,072 --> 01:34:59,840
You know

2040
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:06,240
You know those movies that you love so much totally about a horrible restrictive empire being too

2041
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:08,800
Defeated by a lovable group of rebels

2042
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:12,896
Really love the empire

2043
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:15,200
That's the real message

2044
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:18,272
We got the whip

2045
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:24,928
Palpatine was just trying to do a good job and defeat the Universalist

2046
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:30,816
Small business number two had to work on the desk

2047
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:37,472
So many oh my God

2048
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:38,240
Free market

2049
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:39,776
To keep costs down

2050
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:46,176
Pay those contract probably not

2051
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:52,576
In this episode there's three instances and apologize I don't have audio of the third one

2052
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:54,368
Symptoms of Alex legitimately

2053
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,928
That drop needs to militarily act

2054
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:57,696
Act on his enemies

2055
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:02,048
If that's where the rhetoric is at that tells me a couple

2056
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:04,352
First this interview is

2057
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:05,120
The damaging

2058
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:05,888
Damaging

2059
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:07,424
Forgets keys in panic

2060
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,192
Check mode

2061
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:09,472
And second

2062
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:12,032
If the rhetoric evolves from here

2063
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:13,824
Serious trouble

2064
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:14,848
Like

2065
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,128
I don't know where else

2066
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:17,408
Chicken Go

2067
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:18,688
If the military

2068
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:19,968
Where else does it go

2069
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:21,504
If the military won't do it

2070
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:22,528
Patriots have

2071
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:23,808
That's where it goes

2072
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:26,624
I think he can probably say that legally

2073
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:30,976
For a bit but if he gets too descriptive or two like literal

2074
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:35,584
Then he really answer is into inciting violence

2075
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,608
Yeah but I think

2076
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:38,912
You can still say if the government won't do it

2077
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:39,680
Patriots

2078
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:42,240
Should I think you can still say that legally

2079
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:45,824
It's murky but I think I think it's free speech

2080
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,896
A man that sure seems like

2081
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:50,944
I'm against it but I think it

2082
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:51,712
It's illegal

2083
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:52,992
Yeah I know

2084
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:58,368
So I really think that Alex Jones abandoned every single one of his principal

2085
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,672
Span of like 3 minutes

2086
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,000
The show's not over

2087
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:04,768
2 years

2088
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:06,560
Which was not over we got a couple Clips laugh

2089
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:09,632
Cuz I what ends up happening a little bit later on the

2090
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:12,448
Michelle is that robbed

2091
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:13,984
And Owen Shroyer

2092
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:16,288
Went up to the mark

2093
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:17,568
Is over the weekend

2094
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:18,336
F***

2095
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:21,920
And the way they presented is that Muslims

2096
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:24,224
I've teamed up

2097
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:32,160
Always Auntie Sharia people are being attacked by the Coalition of Muslims and communist

2098
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:34,208
Also

2099
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:42,656
Probably some of the people who were

2100
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:45,472
Protesting the alt-right publicity stunt

2101
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:47,520
Probably worse than Muslims

2102
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:48,288
Anarchist

2103
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:49,568
Probably some communist

2104
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:52,640
Diverse group of evil

2105
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:54,944
Bigotry March

2106
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:59,040
If you are if you think people are for Sharia law

2107
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:00,320
Communism

2108
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:01,344
You've lost

2109
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,392
You're f****** poor people protest

2110
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:06,464
Sing the anti-sharia March workpro Sharia law

2111
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:07,488
They were just

2112
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:09,792
Holes

2113
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:12,608
I'm talking about Sharia law

2114
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:14,400
Oh

2115
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:16,448
If they're pulling that narrative

2116
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:17,728
They think that

2117
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:19,776
Sharia law is

2118
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:20,800
Compatible

2119
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:21,824
With,

2120
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:27,968
Well that's the Communists are the idiots were going to bring in the necessary circumstances where Sri Lanka

2121
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:30,016
Then the Communists will be beheaded

2122
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:39,232
Do not exist

2123
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:40,256
Sentrilock

2124
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:44,096
Pictures from the marches and demonstrations and they were

2125
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:45,376
Hilarious

2126
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:46,912
Yeah there were just a bunch

2127
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:48,704
Like armor

2128
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:51,520
And like like nights are her not like

2129
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:55,104
Not like for real night not like Teflon

2130
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:55,872
Crusade

2131
01:38:58,944 --> 01:38:59,456
Straight

2132
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,528
Holy Roman Empire garb

2133
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:05,344
Just tons of people with guns it was f****** in

2134
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:12,768
It seems like Civil War reenactors got bored with reenacting the Civil War

2135
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:14,048
Back to the Crusades

2136
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:18,400
A lot of them were like a modern-day dress just with tons

2137
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:19,168
The guns

2138
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:20,192
Like that

2139
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:23,008
But yeah I think it is probably

2140
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:30,432
We need a gritty reboot this is a Batman Begins

2141
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:35,040
Civil War reenactment

2142
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:36,064
Discuss their experience

2143
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:37,088
I want

2144
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:38,880
Also

2145
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:40,160
Shroyer's been playing

2146
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:41,952
A clip

2147
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:43,488
During the commercial break

2148
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:49,376
So whenever they go to commercial no not yet that's for tomorrow

2149
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:51,168
Don't kill the Younglings

2150
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:54,752
You'll be no better than

2151
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:56,032
John podesta

2152
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:59,360
You do not want Trump as your emperor

2153
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:00,384
Palpatine

2154
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:02,944
No

2155
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:04,480
At least Emperor Palpatine

2156
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:05,760
Teen was evil and

2157
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:13,952
Negotiated his way from being one sip lured into running an Empire pretty impressive

2158
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:20,352
He didn't even inherit a lot of money from his dad so real story

2159
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:23,168
Americana

2160
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:31,616
Whatever you're watching it on the website or on the livestream they don't play commercials that would be played on the radio

2161
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:32,640
But the times

2162
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:35,712
They play like 30 second

2163
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:37,504
And reports from their their reporters

2164
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:40,064
It has been talked about how

2165
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:43,392
At these Shreya marches everybody are bigoted against

2166
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:44,160
Bi-Rite

2167
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:47,744
Water balloons

2168
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:50,816
It's he's like

2169
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:55,424
A balloon full of urine

2170
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:56,192
Hit him

2171
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:58,496
It says him

2172
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:00,032
Way2go

2173
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:01,312
Lauren Southern

2174
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:03,616
Him well I did some looking into it

2175
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:04,384
Okay

2176
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:06,432
It turns out that as a Goose

2177
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:10,272
Lauren Southern protesting the absurdity of transgender

2178
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:11,296
Change their gender

2179
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:13,088
She became a man

2180
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:18,208
No one cared

2181
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,000
She became a man legally

2182
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:23,328
What I understand

2183
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:29,216
People very supportive of that kind of backfired

2184
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:30,752
Good for you

2185
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:33,568
No one

2186
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:38,432
The backlash

2187
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:40,736
So I don't know is that

2188
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:44,576
I don't know if that's what Owen Shroyer is like

2189
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:47,648
Like referring to or if it's just a mist

2190
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:48,416
Speaking

2191
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:50,208
I looked at

2192
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:54,048
That's hilarious

2193
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,864
That f******

2194
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:57,888
Hilarious

2195
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:04,288
Studio

2196
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:07,360
Right around

2197
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:12,224
His shot down the appeal

2198
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:13,504
Trump's travel ban

2199
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:20,672
Travel

2200
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:28,096
A second

2201
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:47,040
Somalia

2202
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:48,832
How did they get here

2203
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:55,232
He has that the imams are going out passports that's not true at all

2204
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:58,048
Some people are able to make fake passports but

2205
01:42:58,304 --> 01:42:59,072
Entire country

2206
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:05,472
Official Somali passports have biometric indicators in them

2207
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:08,800
Chili fake

2208
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:10,592
As of 2012 Somalia has

2209
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:13,152
Two airports have paved runways

2210
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:16,480
Airport

2211
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,416
What else might be talking about

2212
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:27,232
Is that there's a Civil War in 1991

2213
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:32,352
In Somalia and Airport closed

2214
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:33,376
Air Flight Services

2215
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:34,144
Experience route

2216
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:39,776
Are there like

2217
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:42,336
I don't know

2218
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:43,360
Probably enough

2219
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:44,384
62

2220
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:51,040
62

2221
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:52,832
Situation they're like

2222
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:56,672
How many people are in Somalia

2223
01:43:56,928 --> 01:44:00,256
There are nine airports that have commercial service

2224
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:04,096
And the other ones are all decimated populations

2225
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:05,120
18.3 ml

2226
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:07,936
Yeah so in Chicago we have

2227
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:09,728
Two airports for three million

2228
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:14,080
Airport

2229
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:15,616
Commercial traffic first

2230
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:16,896
60 million people

2231
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:21,760
Spread out through a country

2232
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:24,064
Airport

2233
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,112
In Somalia

2234
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:27,136
Depopulation

2235
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:28,672
There's a large barrel

2236
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:30,464
Sweaters that they about

2237
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:35,328
There's a lot of rural areas throughout the country

2238
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:40,448
Have no use for airport or other than bringing something which is the other

2239
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:43,776
51 airports that have

2240
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:50,176

Like it

2245
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:57,344
A population of

2246
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:58,624
45

2247
01:44:58,880 --> 01:44:59,904

It's going to go to the store

2251
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:08,352
Recording everything

Going to be okay

2253
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:11,680
Possibly

2254
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:13,984
We're going to close this episode

2255
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:17,312

Stupid

2257
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:22,688
But also kind of endearing in a small way

2258
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:25,248
Alright

2259
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:29,344

01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:57,664
16

2276
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:10,464
Are these nuts

2277
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:25,312
7/2 seven-year-old Hillside passport

2278
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:41,440
I think the proper response in italics

2279
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:43,488
That's not Gallows humor that's racism

2280
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:44,512
Saturn

2281
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:47,840
That's a minute-and-a-half of just out-and-out

2282
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:49,632
Pleasant

2283
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:52,960
Wow

2284
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:55,776
Yeah. That I have about that first

2285
01:47:57,056 --> 01:48:00,128
They have to pitch this narrative that adult Manor being

2286
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:01,664
Classified as children

2287
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,456
Because otherwise the official

2288
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:04,736
Statistics about rap

2289
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:06,528
Ugis don't match up with their narrative

2290
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:12,416
They say that all of them are military age men

2291
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:16,000
Of them are women and children

2292
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:19,328
In order to get around that

2293
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:21,120
There's adults with children

2294
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:22,400
Be classified as children

2295
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:25,472
That's the game that they're playing

2296
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:27,520
I do not

2297
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:29,056
See a large differ

2298
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:31,360
Between what we just listen to

2299
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:33,664
And let's say I don't know

2300
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:34,944
70 years ago

2301
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:36,224
Someone being like

2302
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:36,992
You know what

2303
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:39,296
Look not all black people are bad

2304
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:46,208
You know like doing something like that

2305
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:48,256
There's really not much difference

2306
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:50,304
That is as offensive is that

2307
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:52,096
Stupid

2308
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:53,120
As childish

2309
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:55,936
Reality

2310
01:48:57,216 --> 01:49:00,288
I pray to God willing

2311
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:02,336
Too promising also

2312
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:05,152
Pray that that sort of thing that we can see

2313
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:08,224
See right now in the present day

2314
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:09,760
That's f****** racist

2315
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:12,064
I pray

2316
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:14,624
Twenty years from now 5 years

2317
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:17,184
You can look back on that sort of behavior

2318
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:21,280
The same way that we look back on the boat

2319
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:23,072
God we don't do that

2320
01:49:28,448 --> 01:49:29,472
F****** idiots

2321
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:30,240
Died

2322
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:31,520
Thank God Alex Jones

2323
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:33,568
Didn't do that yesterday

2324
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:37,664
I hope that interview goes well on Sunday

2325
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:38,944
Not going to

2326
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:41,248
Oh yeah

2327
01:49:42,528 --> 01:49:43,808
Although not disaster

2328
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:45,344
To the level that we wouldn't

2329
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:47,392
Disaster in the

2330
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:48,160
Orchestrated

2331
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:54,560
Spread the word about the show

2332
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:02,496
It's it's more like

2333
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:05,056
Telling a lot of people

2334
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:07,872
Yeah

2335
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:11,712
Absolutely

2336
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:13,248
To somewhere to

2337
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:16,320
To follow us at where would you go

2338
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:17,600
That's where you would go

2339
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:19,648
Lowe's on Twitter

2340
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:20,672
The score fight

2341
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:22,208
Acknowledge

2342
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:26,048
Score for Augusta

2343
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:30,912
I'm seeing it happened a bit I'd like to reinforce the behavior

2344
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:33,216
You see people tweeting about Alex Jones

2345
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:33,984
Just f******

2346
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:36,032
Get in there getting their replies

2347
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:37,312
At those assholes

2348
01:50:37,824 --> 01:50:38,336
And tell him

2349
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:39,616
To get your perspective right

2350
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:41,152
Yeah get in the knowledge fight

2351
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:43,200
Don't play this reactionary

2352
01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:49,856
Play this reactionary ping pong game of outrage in the actual knowledge fight or we can

2353
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:51,136
We can make Headway

2354
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:52,928
Champs Alex we can

2355
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:54,720
Not necessarily take him down

2356
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:55,488
But week

2357
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:58,560
Play a game he can't respond to

2358
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:05,472
I don't want

2359
01:51:05,728 --> 01:51:06,240
2

2360
01:51:06,496 --> 01:51:08,800
I don't give a f*** about the cult leader

2361
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:10,080
I want the

2362
01:51:10,848 --> 01:51:12,384
They're the ones who are going to be

2363
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:14,432
And that's always the case

2364
01:51:14,944 --> 01:51:16,736
Yeah support Alex

2365
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:18,784
Are only getting hurt

2366
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:24,160
Buy the shirt that they believe it they're the ones who Trump is f****** over

2367
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:25,440
These are the

2368
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:29,024
People who are actively destroyed these are the people

2369
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:30,816
Who are just like us

2370
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:32,608
Struggling their asses off

2371
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:35,168
And instead of engaging with reality

2372
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:37,216
And doing their best

2373
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:37,984
Kind of fight again

2374
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:39,264
There

2375
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,032
Regret

2376
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:41,824
SeaWorld

2377
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:43,104
Where they don't have to

2378
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:44,640
Furious any of this response

2379
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:50,528
Difference between those people and you and I are possibly too bad choices

2380
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:54,624
Somewhere down the line or maybe even their choice

2381
01:51:55,904 --> 01:51:59,232
Pressure

2382
01:52:00,256 --> 01:52:00,768
1

2383
01:52:01,024 --> 01:52:01,792
Like

2384
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:05,632
If you were real a shame if you were raised in the same environment they sin

2385
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:06,656
Entirely possible

2386
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:11,264
You would be an Infowars you might be a victim of the

2387
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:13,056
Alex Jones

2388
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:14,336
Absolutely

2389
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:20,480
Real clean

2390
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:23,552
Hate their wives

2391
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:25,344
Cuz their wives

2392
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:29,952
I have stopped enjoying that hard

2393
01:52:30,464 --> 01:52:32,512
Let's just robbed

2394
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:35,840
Also if you want to appreciate it

2395
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:38,912
There's a button over on the show

2396
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:41,472
Become a policy wonk or if you'd like

2397
01:52:41,728 --> 01:52:42,240
Donate

2398
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:44,288
What was it

2399
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:49,408
Time travel episode

2400
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:54,528
Slightly as I go through my 2015 investigation but we will pop them in as well as we can

2401
01:52:57,344 --> 01:52:59,648
Who's been I've been fun but you know what

2402
01:52:59,904 --> 01:53:00,928
This dislike

2403
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:01,952
Alex

2404
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:03,744
Sort of narrative that

2405
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,536
This interview is a trap

2406
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:08,352
And that he's going to come out

2407
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:09,120
Dead

2408
01:53:09,376 --> 01:53:10,656
Yeah that is a doornail

2409
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:11,680
But

2410
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:13,472
But what is one guy

2411
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:15,520
Is it

2412
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:17,568
It's Batman

2413
01:53:17,824 --> 01:53:19,872
Redbox

2414
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:22,944
Thanks for holding

2415
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:28,576
Alexandra Thurston color with your trip and I love your work
