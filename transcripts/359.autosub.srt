Aliexpress.com

3
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Everybody just a little bit

4
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,304
About

5
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:10,912
Jordan Jordan

6
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,960
Let me answer a quick question

7
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,728
For you

8
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,032
Did you ever have a

9
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,056
Specific affect

10
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:21,664
Like a hat that you wore all the time that you would like when you tried to change

11
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,552
Your personality by some sort of outward appearance baby yeah I think so probably probably had a lot of

12
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,344
I did Little Things

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,880
Like one off

14
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:34,976
But what if things I did in high school was I had a lot of shiny shirts

15
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:41,632
Shiny button-up shirts and I was over my head like flaming dice something

16
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,680
Alright okay

17
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:50,080
Alright I don't know exactly what I was thinking

18
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:56,224
There was a it was a Guy Fieri before you existed kind of vibe

19
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,760
But also weighs

20
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,528
Shinier

21
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,112
New habitable arable weird beard

22
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:02,880
High School

23
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:06,208
I didn't ever weird beard

24
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,232
Small beard

25
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,048

26
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:15,424
Daughter my Mennonite heritage

27
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,448
I got called everleigh

28
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,776
Stop it

29
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,848
Time all around

30
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,408
Everlast

31
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:29,248
That is the guy from Smash Mouth again

32
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,528
Because that Guy Fieri

33
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,624
Proper place among

34
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,184
If timing is indifferent I probably would

35
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,512
Guy Fieri a lot but Sarah

36
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,048
Oh yeah I think I'm

37
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,864
I think you should be grateful that you missed that time

38
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,264
Yeah I did probably I'd I know that I had a bowler hat for a little while as well but I don't think I ever

39
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,104
It never really took over too much as like a part of my personality

40
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,664
You tried the bowl I did drive the bowler hat

41
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,248
And then the other social Gatherings or is like a work

42
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,160
I wore it to like a homecoming

43
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,488
School dance

44
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,256
Skyrim Rusty

45
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,792
Brewing tractor

46
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,072
Believe me

47
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:20,448
Rusty Drew is Dad on the car dealership in Columbia and

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,496
Use a big dick

49
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:28,128
I didn't really even know him he was a great older than me and he just

50
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:32,224
Got in my face looks like hey are you man enough to wear that hat

51
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,552

Why you got to pick on me what's going on

53
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
Arable

54
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,792
Are you mad

55
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,376
Shoulder bags

56
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,144
That was one

57
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,216
Alligator leather shoulder strap bag

58
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,752
You call that an affectation

59
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,288
Instead of wearing a backpack

60
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:02,688
I'm feeling a little bit about the stations that are unsuccessful and I know a lot about

61
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,760
And I only know what you tell me about both my

62
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:10,368

63
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:15,744

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,791

Succubus Queen Amber thank you so much you an alibi was he want

95
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,375
And finally they don't actually

96
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,983
So she would be president

97
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,775
It's not a democracy through public

98
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,799
Exact

99
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,079
Then finally ghost

100
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:12,479
My Robin thank you so much

101
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:19,135
I'd rather listen to take inhaler like what these guys do like sport the show you could do that by going to our website

102
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,159
Show

103
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
Appreciate

104
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
Baby lovey

105
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,743
So Jordan

106
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,511
Today August

107
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,047
Sudo wacky 1

108
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,071
Yes

109
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,863
I was racking my brain

110
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
In preparation

111
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,167
So try to come up with what

112
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:31,935
We could do

113
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
For Wacky Wednesday

114
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,519
Episode number of possibility

115
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:41,919
Ever brought up a number of times in the past I think I've about reached my point of disinterest in Kerry Cassidy and project

116
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:45,759
And a couple of interviews of hers that I listen to to like train

117
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,807
Chart a course that we're pretty uninspiring

118
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,159
So I consider the possibility about doing another episode about Kevin Moore

119
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:56,255
The guy was making a documentary about Carey's best friend who's in prison for murder mark

120
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,631
He started releasing his new docu-series about people who Channel aliens and spirits

121
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,911
But decided maybe I should go

122
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
Give that a shot

123
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,471
It's called they call us channelers

124
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:10,335
They do not some people do

125
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,615
Not if you're interested in

126
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:18,015
Otherwise seemingly normal people do terrible alien Impressions and talk super vaguely about standard new age

127
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,551
Flash self-help ideas

128
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,855
This is the damn show for you

129
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,415
But ultimately it didn't feel like something Worth Art

130
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,975
There's not a whole lot to be constructed

131
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,511
Discuss about people pretending

132
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,351
And that would ultimately just to end up with us mocking them

133
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:36,447
Which is kind of fun but maybe not the best Bedrock for an episode

134
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,799
Yeah we it's it's kind of like a flow state

135
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:42,847
In the world

136
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,639
Frolic amongst

137
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
These people

138
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,503
You know things are far darker and more serious

139
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,647
Where in the where in the DC Universe we're not in the Marvel Universe and there's also a feeling of like

140
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
Alright

141
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
A time to talk

142
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,815
F****** till apples

143
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:09,215
10 years from now we'll look back on this and be like I wasn't this stupid

144
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,239
Whatever

145
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,311
So also I buy a mother Avenues

146
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:17,151
And I've said in the past that I didn't want to cover Skype

147
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,943
Kelly ever again

148
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,503
But I stumbled into a little video that he put out

149
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,039
If you if you were called this

150
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,367
The guy who claims those demonic forces that have a base underneath the

151
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,415
The Getty Museum

152
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,975
Killing children there to harvest

153
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:35,327
Whatever that is I recall loose factored heavily into that up

154
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,375
Episode and I would never adequately

155
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,399
Lowe's

156
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,191
So

157
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
For a while

158
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,983
Steven Kelly was trying

159
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,519
The Coop the qanon audio

160
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,335
Trying to get them into his side

161
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:52,735
I think he's moved on from that now and just putting out weird videos where he talks about battles he and his Jedi followers

162
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,527
Girls are having deep underground Wild

163
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
Sitting in front of us

164
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
It's all pretty disturbing

165
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
Wingstop

166
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,951
Baby clear I don't want to cover that dude ever again

167
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,975
And cuz he scares me

168
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,767
He looks like killer Bob from

169
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:09,631
From Twin Peaks videos of sitting in front of a sheet looking at the camera and rambling

170
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
Menacingly

171
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:14,751
About mindwar and also fairly often about how he's not so into

172
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,311
It's not it's not good

173
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:24,223
The premises that premise sounds fun but then you realize there's always the undercurrent of racism underneath and it gets

174
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,551
Dark but the racism in the anti-Semitism is like

175
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
That makes it

176
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:32,415
Relevant to possibly still talk about

177
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,463
Tendrils and where they go

178
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
But

179
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:35,999
I just

180
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,023
Now it's a mess

181
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,607
Add another issues that Stephen Kelly is a very small audience

182
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,423
I guess YouTube videos all hover around 1,000

183
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,471
Views and it just doesn't feel like a

184
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,775
Great use of our time to make fun of him

185
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:48,799
It just seemed

186
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,335
Again

187
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,639
Go to do your Jedi Mind

188
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,663
Mind Wars

189
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,431
And whatever

190
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,247
Hey Anthony. He's on the more successful side

191
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,783
The space weirdos that I was looking

192
00:09:59,295 --> 00:09:59,807
Considering

193
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,087
A cover for the show that

194
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:05,183
The problem is a way we can't Frolic anymore so much

195
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,975
Similarly we can't really

196
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:11,583
Just that take any old video on YouTube and feel good about ourselves

197
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
So

198
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,143
I felt like I'd hit a brick wall

199
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,935
But then it dawned on me

200
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
Brick wall

201
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
Yes

202
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,799
Episode all about the manufacture of bricks

203
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,615
If punching down is concerned

204
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,407
And there's one obvious solution

205
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
That problem

206
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,967
How does this grab you Jordan

207
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:47,167
Gilmer rotor for you

208
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:53,567
Call me

209
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,479
It's a very common request

210
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:03,295
Listeners that we tap into the catalogue of coasttocoastam

211
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,831
And I've resisted the urge

212
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:11,231
To do so after this point mostly because I was perfectly satisfied with the Paranormal space weirdo stuff that we cover

213
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,559
Project Camelot in the rafters with all they really need it

214
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:19,679
But I thought well is gone dry and we've gotten a pretty good idea of what's underneath Kerry Cassidy

215
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,983
Mostly Sovereign citizen ideas

216
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
Is encoded racer

217
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,823
It feels like we need to move on to greener pastures

218
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,895
And there is no Greener pasture than post

219
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
To Coast AM

220
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,479
Will never need to worry about punching down

221
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,039
They have millions of listeners in the show is basically and it

222
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:35,807
Institution at this

223
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
We will literally

224
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,903
Never come close to the level of success

225
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
But they have

226
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,695
So we can mock

227
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
Freelee

228
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,743
That's a big

229
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,535
I like that

230
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:52,191
This will be a new Venture on the show and I intended to be an ongoing Series so I apologize if this episode in particular isn't going to cover

231
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,983
A lot of the background information

232
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
About Coast

233
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,055
The coast and George Noory in great detail

234
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,359
To save those for a future episode

235
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,919
Because I think the best way that we can make our transition

236
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,711
The world of Coast to Coast AM

237
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,759
It's by way of familiarity

238
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,295
As we learn to listen

239
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:10,111
Coming to Alex's shows on the days after the Boston bombing

240
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,159
Alex was a guest on Coast to Coast

241
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
On April

242
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,975
The day after the tragic

243
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,791
Now that we're equipped with a bit of the

244
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,887
Open understanding about what Alex is bring to the table on his own show

245
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,423
Thought it might be interesting

246
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,703
See how he was presenting

247
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,495
Take himself on a different show

248
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,543
A show with a way bigger audience

249
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,311
Ensign his

250
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,591
And a show

251
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,383
It's hosted by a Friendly House

252
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,967
As opposed to someone who is likely to call him out on his b*******

253
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,527
I think that looking at Alex's appearance

254
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:42,111
On the April 16th 2013 episode of Coast to Coast AM

255
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,439
Might be a perfect way for us to dip our toes into the water

256
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,231
And that's what we'll be doing

257
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,255
I'm here today

258
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,071
Sudo Wacky Wednesday

259
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,143
I know you put it very kindly

260
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
Broke up with Carrie

261
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:01,567
Yeah I think that's what I heard I heard you say it's time to move on

262
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,591
Damn this

263
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,127
I know

264
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,151
How is

265
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,431
Just like a man

266
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,991
To get a modicum of Fame and then leave his

267
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:15,647
Old girlfriend behind for the vase

268
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:21,279
Barry can't compete with that I don't know Project Camelot I know you got me through some hard times sure

269
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,607
Look look how hot coasttocoastam is I can't pass this up

270
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:29,471
I don't like you presented that way but there may be some truth to it

271
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,495
Maybe some Underground

272
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,127
I'll still check back in whenever she has Mark Richards on or let's say there's a

273
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:41,503
There's breaking news in the Eddy page world

274
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,831
Bringer of death absolute Archangel Abaddon news

275
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,111
Got to keep up

276
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:51,999
That's just our journalistic dude

277
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,535
I think I think

278
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
Might be a much better

279
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,863
I have a

280
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,631
I have a working

281
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,679
Theory about coasttocoastam

282
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
Pickle flash out over the course of

283
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:04,287
Not just this episode with other episodes with you about it that I take

284
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,335
I think it's a very important

285
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
Spoke

286
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,663
Maybe even a centerpiece

287
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,735
Of the wheel

288
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:16,319
These are cryptofash

289
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,647
We'll get into that as we go along

290
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:23,743
But let's let's jump in your this April 16th episode

291
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,279
George Noory

292
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,559
Host of coast to coast

293
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
Coast to Coast

294
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:35,519
Giorgio moroder put me in a great mood

295
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,799
Think about the previous day

296
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
Is bobbing

297
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:48,063
George Noory

298
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,111
Hi George

299
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:59,583
Law enforcement officials have no concrete information on hoopla

300
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:05,471
Finish Line of the Boston Marathon

301
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:10,079
Hospital

302
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,223
Situation

303
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,295
So you know you can already here like I just

304
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,831
Much better Brock

305
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:24,159
You can see the the the chop

306
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
The Voice

307
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,463
He has a warrant

308
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,743
Qm

309
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,767
Alex doesn't have

310
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,303
Yeah.

311
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,071
Never let

312
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,119
Oh yeah

313
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:37,727
What's this song

314
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,031
I truly don't know what you're talkin

315
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:43,359
Well I wish I prepared differently then I assume that you would have some

316
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,919
Familiarity with just such a cultural in

317
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,479
Turn on the radio for f****** ever

318
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,783
But one of the things that doesn't really difficult about

319
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,343
The idea of us dipping our toes in

320
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,367
I'm trying to do like an

321
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,391
All income

322
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
Episode about

323
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
Coast to Coast

324
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
Is the

325
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,743
It's had a number of hosts over the year

326
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,535
Okay like

327
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,863
Art Bell's era is very different than George Noory

328
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,191
There's a lot of complex

329
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
YouTube

330
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,287
And so that that's why I would want to leave

331
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
4

332
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,871
I got the gradual getting into it

333
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,431
Put all you really need to know is George always going to be

334
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,735
But I got you

335
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,783
Much better broadcaster than where you

336
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,599
Got you some of that is

337
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
Almost

338
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,391
Even more Danger

339
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,927
Because as we

340
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,975
Just hear 30 seconds of his voice

341
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:34,303
Come here a welcoming there's a there's a

342
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,095
Performance to his voice that is

343
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:42,495
Is there a Old School radio this guy is welcome you into the show when he's friendly

344
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,543
Your smile in his voice

345
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,359
I heard that and I thought of one of those old like

346
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,639
Big box

347
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,455
Radios then the family would sit around and

348
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
240Z

349
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
You know one of those Jaya

350
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
But I don't know what

351
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
Just Cabinets

352
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,855
Filled with

353
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,135
Yeah

354
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,207
So Alex isn't on the show right at the beginning

355
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,999
George has another guest

356
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,791
Who is a psychiatrist

357
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,095
Who they talk about hate

358
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,143
And the experience of hate

359
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:17,311
It can overwhelm a person not really that important

360
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,895
But I'm going to play Clue. And that is because

361
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,199
George Noory is sort of spitballing

362
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,735
About who might have been behind

363
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,503
This bombing

364
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,295
Okay no that's not that's not a good idea

365
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:31,647
Well it's what a lot of broadcasters and and commentators

366
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
We're engaging in

367
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,951
Perhaps Fair

368
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,231
Speculation

369
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
Runs rampant

370
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,535
Sometimes

371
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,351
They're big news stories

372
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,167
I don't think that his behavior is

373
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,191
Too irresponsible

374
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:48,031
But I do think that Alex would see this as very

375
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:48,799
Responsible

376
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:53,407
What's assume for a moment that the situation Boston was caused by

377
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,759
Individual necessarily a group

378
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,063
That has some kind of political ideology

379
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,623
Who's just ticked off

380
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,791
Innocent people

381
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:15,167
So you got George Noory speculating that it's a lone wolf

382
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,495
Okay maybe it's someone who's angry at the government baby

383
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,567
Yeah it's he's talking to his psychiatrist Peter breggin

384
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,847
About the nature

385
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,919
Like I said it's largely and unnoticeable interview and I don't have much

386
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:31,295
To say about it other than to point this part out

387
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,111
A leader in the field of the anti medications

388
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:34,879
Psychiatrist

389
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,159
Call God

390
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:41,023
You may not be as crazy dude is most of the anti-science guest Alex will have on his show

391
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,303
Guest choice

392
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,399
Is an editorial decision important to remember no s***

393
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,679
In that clip weirdest list

394
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,959
Nori is trying

395
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,495
Bragging about how person

396
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,287
I hate so much as to pull off a bomb in

397
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,335
But in the process

398
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:59,199
Nori's speculating that the bomber was a lone wolf and the example he comes up with his

399
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,735
Maybe they did this pic

400
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,015
The government

401
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,551
Which weirdly

402
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:09,439
He doesn't think as a political motive for they're not with any group

403
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,999
It's just a lone wolf who's angry with the

404
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:17,119
Tiger government's anti-government political

405
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,679
Very strange

406
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,263
That might imply a slight bias

407
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,287
Could could

408
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,567
It's it seems like

409
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,919
I can recognize this is a person speculating and having a conversation

410
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
Abstract

411
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,967
But Alex

412
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
Cannot

413
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,807
This is exactly the sort of behavior he spent days on a

414
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,087
Show claiming as evidence

415
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:37,855
Set the Main Street

416
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,671
BT is planning to blame right-wing Patriots for the bombing

417
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,719
Is Alex at any intellectual

418
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:46,815
Consistency human yelling at George Noory about I was trying to set up the paper

419
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,863
We don't hear that sort of thing

420
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,959
Imagine that's because Alex is welcome as a guest on Coast to Coast AM

421
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,775
A place like MSNBC don't have any interest in books

422
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,311
This is very

423
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:01,407
Tensional do this same exact behavior that your decrying in the rest of the

424
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:07,039
The media is something that nor he's doing and you're going to be on the show in 20 minutes and talk to him about how he's the greatest

425
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
I mean

426
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,087
Yeah it's obviously

427
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
But it gets worse

428
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,183
George Noory speculates a little bit

429
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,911
Would have been bigger

430
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,959
A little more

431
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,895
Well you know they're saying that they that studies pressure cooker bombs

432
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,175
You don't have to have

433
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,455
Come out of the

434
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
Pakistan

435
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,551
Yeah yeah so I mean not obvious

436
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,087
A little bit out of my ex

437
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:41,855
Expertise

438
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,623
But

439
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:47,743
I don't have the answer to that one knowing it's going to be important to find out I'll be

440
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:54,399
A military person I mean

441
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,935
What if it was somebody who

442
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:07,455
You talk about rainbow about hatred and

443
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:13,855
So Alex is also spent all this time talking about how the mainstream media is trying to demonize returning veterans

444
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:20,000
Hey could be our guy who people at Rainbow

445
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:20,768
I don't know

446
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,912
Guilty of literally all of the behaviors Alex's grieving about to be what if it was

447
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,936
Literally

448
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,960
Charles Bronson

449
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:32,288
Not the film version of Charles Bronson

450
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,080
Play the regular Charles Bronson

451
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,360
Chickenshit

452
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,896
Government

453
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,712
Nobody's hiring them for the Deathwish films anymore

454
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,992
He did it I would like

455
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,016
To say that

456
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,040
We could be bronze

457
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:47,136
Is he was dead at this point could be alive right now

458
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,672
Or he could have died in

459
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,048
What was it

460
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,072
The Wild Bunch

461
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,120
Movies

462
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,168
You might not have been in it might have been

463
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,728
A hologram for a look-alike I have no idea

464
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:05,312
No one besides me who's ever seen all five of them

465
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,592
He died

466
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,664
I could be wrong

467
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,688
Could be

468
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,224
So it's not only

469
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,016
Play George

470
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:14,784
Sing about the ape

471
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,552
Possibility

472
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,576
That's

473
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,856
Returning veteran

474
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,928
Is while he's talking to this psychiatrist

475
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,464
He opens up the phone

476
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,256
Takes calls

477
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,792
And one of his callers

478
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:28,864
Has a theory at this Jordan if you pay close attention

479
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,144
Is a really wild thing

480
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,168
Because

481
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,448
This caller

482
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,496
As best as I can tell

483
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,032
Fix that the motivation

484
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,056
For the bombing

485
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,360
Might have been someone who is angry

486
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,128
At leg

487
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,944
And I'm thinking what kind of person

488
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:48,320
Well I think it went like this

489
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,648
What did runners run with their legs

490
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,000
They fix the vines and places at the

491
00:22:56,256 --> 00:23:02,400
People in Olathe

492
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,704
Ex-serviceman with an amputee

493
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:12,640
And I love all the servicemen God bless Amaya to chandan the service years ago

494
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:17,504
And about had to be someone with the love yourself

495
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,552
I got a view

496
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,624
And it's supposed to have have no conscience

497
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,416
I think he's a loner

498
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:36,448
That's what I think happened

499
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,664
George Lopez

500
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:58,208
We've got too many True Crime shows on right now that's what it what I'm hearing there is somebody putting together a Law and Order

501
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:01,792
It's almost supervillainy inmate search

502
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,352
Cartoonist

503
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,888
Do you sew

504
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,240
Positive with people every single things I got the great thought

505
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:15,616
That is his patronizing almost in his support of people's ideas

506
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,944
Hey yeah I think we should look into that lie

507
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,528
What she said that if you have all these amputations

508
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,624
Eddie George himself there all night

509
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,648
That was

510
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:31,232
My favorite he will literally talk about someone whose arm was a

511
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:34,048
Okay so

512
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,680
Is jumping along with okay I got a picture of George Noory now

513
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:44,288
I think I know what I'm getting into whatever picture you have Adam mustache and your goal

514
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
Alright

515
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:48,128
I got you some sort of husky

516
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,248
He's helping her build the argument

517
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,064
Yeah you know what you're

518
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,416
It could be a disgruntled legless man and hiding bones in a wheelchair I didn't

519
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,976
Consider that but you ladies you could have

520
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:06,560
Part of me thinks that would make him like the best dad ever

521
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,608
It's just so supportive

522
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
No

523
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,960
Baby supportive but also it doesn't it doesn't

524
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,752
The best equipped

525
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,032
To deal with people who might

526
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:16,800
Might have

527
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,080
Bad faith

528
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,384
They write become opposition of like

529
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,664
I want to manipulate

530
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,224
If you have someone like him who

531
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,504
It's just like

532
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,880
What combination is Steamroller

533
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:32,928
Wiwik

534
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,952
Fairly certain

535
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,536
Don't know for sure but we can be fairly certain that

536
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
She doesn't have

537
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,072
Some sort of

538
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,888
Anti a

539
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:47,776
Beauty agenda that she's trying to turn public opinion against specific amputee I don't think so

540
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,824
That would be crazy

541
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,688
Behaving this way and non-judgmental Ian on abusively towards collars

542
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,736
I think you have a pretty good

543
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,040
Pardoned by using the term O'Lakes

544
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,808
To stand on

545
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,832
For George

546
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,624
They cannot

547
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,208
Attacking her for this and being like

548
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,280
That's kind of being a gracious host

549
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,376
Keep the dick to your audience

550
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:17,984
When that behavior is so Universal and apply to all of these gas

551
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,752
That you have

552
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,520
If it

553
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,824
That's where it becomes a little bit murky

554
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
For me

555
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:25,152
But I appreciate that you

556
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:29,504
Use understood what was going on there and see that that is a perfect encapsulation of Joker

557
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,808
Doll legs

558
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,088
It's all lyrics

559
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:38,208
It's so easy origami it's all legs North

560
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,512
That could be turned it back

561
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,792
Just be like

562
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,424
They were all Jews like you can totally see how easy that that little transition is because

563
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,448
Cuz he's not trying

564
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,728
You're bad guy

565
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,544
If like after the Oklahoma City bombing

566
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,944
You know or 911 when they the rumors are going around the Jews were told to stay home from work

567
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,344
I have no idea

568
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,880
Episode

569
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:10,208
You could see that same sort of inability to

570
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,232
Push back

571
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,768
Yeah

572
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,048
Introduced

573
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:17,632
As you could see that could apply in situations

574
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,656
Then you'd like

575
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,216
To his credit

576
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,240
He does also seemed

577
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,264
Genuinely curious

578
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,080
I don't know about that

579
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,360
Maybe not listening

580
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:36,064
Then I guess I did not get a perfect encapsulation I think you might be. Actively listening to his guests

581
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,088
Point Mallard

582
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,648
You guys are real hearts

583
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:42,464
To pull out with they're all like no you don't get

584
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,864
You do don't you got to remember that they are tall legs and then still say that they are all a very simple to do while you're

585
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,400
Passively listening

586
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,984
So we get now to Alex's production

587
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,056
This is a little bit

588
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,848
A little bit glowy

589
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,040
All kinds of world issues

590
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:11,392
Department of Homeland Security

591
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:17,024
So we wanted to get Alex in here to talk about his

592
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,072
Propaganda narratives

593
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,888
Yeah let's let's really get to the bottom of it

594
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:25,728
I'm going to give him a real real tough interview are we

595
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,544
Proof

596
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,592
Because

597
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,384
This is not an unbiased energy

598
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,200
This is not like somebody who's bringing in Alex

599
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,480
To get to Greater truth

600
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,296
You can hear even from as this introduction goes on

601
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,088
These two dudes are compared

602
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,880
Is

603
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:45,696
Infowars.com

604
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,768
The foremost media

605
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,304
Alex is recognized

606
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,376
As the father of the truth movement

607
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:57,472
And that he is a digging reporter

608
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,520
Alex Jones

609
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,152
That's what I did when you come on my little show

610
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:08,224
George it is great to be here to talk about the globalist

611
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,040
Masterplan the biggest

612
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:14,112
The long-term there's lots of distractions going on

613
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,672
Lots of things happening at the media are hyping up

614
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,464
But you you look at the big

615
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,000
Be a big issue

616
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:23,328
So that doesn't seem like that. That's friends

617
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,376
Yeah Yeah Yeahs are at least

618
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:29,984
It's a supposed to being just like

619
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,520
Get his take on things

620
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,080
Yeah that's

621
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,152
That's a weird

622
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:37,920
Have not heard some

623
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,248
He's considered one of the founders of

624
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,016
The 9/11

625
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:42,784
Truth movie

626
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:49,184
In that kind of positive and loving total good long lines at the head of the foremost mean

627
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,464
Journalist

628
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,744
The f*** out here

629
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,024
So

630
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,072
And then you also hear Alex

631
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,376
Get it like on my little show

632
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,424
There is almost like a

633
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,240
Nothing compared to your van

634
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,032
He's learned lesson

635
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,336
Arab butter up in

636
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,640
Flattering person that you want something from

637
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,432
Namewee access to Their audience

638
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,480
You're just seeing Alex place.

639
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:15,040
Yes yeah yeah that is interested

640
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:15,808
Yeah

641
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,088
The kind of know what they're doing

642
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,624
So Alex Alyssa

643
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,392
Georgia

644
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,160
The show the night

645
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,720
Before and Siri talks about that

646
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,792
We probably do need to spend a few minutes

647
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:30,656
On the tragedy of it being regardless of what really happened whoever was behind it

648
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,216
After all of those I listen to you last night

649
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,776
Break that down eloquently with your gas

650
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:40,896
Of all the people there and then then and so many going to the trauma of just watching

651
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:45,248
So on the night of the 15th George Noory did a show that was just about the attack

652
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,016
What happened

653
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:52,928
I applaud him for having a large chunk of open phone time for callers to call in and just

654
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:53,952
Experiences

655
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:59,328
Just kind of like him offering up a public forum for his audience to collectively process their grief and let it happen

656
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,632
I think the radio shows should do stuff like

657
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:02,912
B positive

658
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:07,264
On the other hand I absolutely do not applaud him for his guests choice

659
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:11,872
I'm at night no worries only guest was Infowars regular Doug Hagmann

660
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:16,480
And a large part of his narrative on disappearance was about how this supposed

661
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,272
Bomb drill

662
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:21,088
Marathon in order to make the argument

663
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,368
This is a false flag

664
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,952
The headman was on on the 15th on coasttocoastam

665
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,744
Pushing for this narrative

666
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,048
Hagmann is a far-right and

667
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,072
Happy communist lunatic

668
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,120
Disseminates information through group

669
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,400
Started call Dean Dorothy

670
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,168
Least intelligent

671
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,216
Throughout the years he's been in

672
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,240
Entirely wrong about

673
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,776
Cowboys bombshell stories

674
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:45,920
These claims were based on unnamed but very real and very credible intelligence source

675
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:49,504
His career has completely Fallen apart by the present

676
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:54,112
And now you host a show on YouTube or as guest roster includes Coach Dave daubenmire

677
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,184
Appearances by Steve Quayle

678
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,232
The guy who Alex thinks is a prophet

679
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,280
Has written multiple books about how biblical

680
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,304
Giants are real

681
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,120
You can't prove they're not

682
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,656
I don't have to

683
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,472
The well then

684
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,544
The burden of proof is on the person making the extravagant playing

685
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,616
You'll be you'll be sorry when my Giants show up

686
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,408
I will I'll close them and they'll

687
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:20,224
Step on you I certainly will be sorry at that one

688
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,552
The day of the Boston bombing Was a Very Berry 10

689
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,112
And if you're a person who has a large audience

690
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,392
You have a responsibility

691
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:31,744
You can't just let them be misled by con men while they're in that vulnerable state

692
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,048
And to do so is to be actively complicit in

693
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,072
In the car on your self

694
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,400
And I'm sure George Noory a Doug Hagmann booked in advance

695
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,936
This was just bad timing

696
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,960
But I don't give a fo

697
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,008
If you have Hagmann booked

698
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:47,360
And there were bombings like this you got to say that something like eight Doug we're going to reschedule

699
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,920
There are 100 100 acceptable

700
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,736
Excuses and goddamn George Noory holds all the cards

701
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:53,760
These dicks

702
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:54,784
Almost donut

703
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,600
Exist compared to coasttocoastam when you're judging by Audio

704
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,624
Size and influence

705
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,160
What he says goes

706
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:04,256
What I'm getting at is that nor yet every reason to cancel Doug Hagmann

707
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,536
Appearance on the day of the bombing

708
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,584
He didn't because he thinks

709
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
Doug Hagmann

710
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,376
Is a credible source

711
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:12,192
And wants to help spread is bulshit far and wide

712
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,496
These are structural editorial.

713
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,520
Decisions that run

714
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,336
Under the surface of a show like coasttocoastam

715
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,384
And they're a big part of the reason why

716
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,176
As it exists with George Noory

717
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,968
This show is a trojan horse

718
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:27,296
For the very propagandist who are now currently running a buck

719
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,320
And have

720
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,112
Caused so much

721
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,392
Disorder

722
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,672
Is it like George

723
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,696
Story himself

724
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:37,024
Actively complicit in this yes I mean

725
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,048
Sorry

726
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:42,400
Open Agent on this or is it there or does he have some

727
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:47,008
Booking manager Endeavor collaborate himself 100

728
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,544
Yeah okay

729
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,360
Alright I have no doubt about that bass on every

730
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,384
I know about him

731
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,176
That's something we'll probably get into it if you

732
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:58,016
What's bucks up with this weirdo thanks

733
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:58,784
It's all legs

734
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:05,184
I'm really trying to push for someone

735
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:10,816
So just in the month of April 2013 George Noory lent his gigantic platform to

736
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,096
Familiar names

737
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,376
Alex Jones

738
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,168
Jerome corsi

739
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,448
This is posts

740
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:19,520
Boating I should point.

741
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:23,360
And soon-to-be Infowars employee at that point Anthony gucciardi

742
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,896
That's a lot

743
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,432
Guest bookings

744
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:31,552
Of people who are directly Infowars contributors and they also had

745
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:32,832
Sebastian Gorka

746
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:33,600
His family on

747
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,904
The song like what are what are we doing here

748
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:40,512
Welcome to Coast to Coast AM I guess today is a Hungarian who knows Gorka

749
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,072
You can do the next few months

750
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:47,424
After April 2013 you see appearances by Steve Quayle Webster Tarpley

751
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,960
Steve pieczenik was on

752
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,728
Weis

753
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,752
Catherine Albrecht

754
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,032
Who filled in for Alex

755
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:55,616
That when he went on vacation recently for almost the entire week shoes on

756
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,432
Auntie tax protester Joe Bannister

757
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,968
Bilderberg fanfiction

758
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,248
Expert Daniel estulin

759
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,528
William Binney

760
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,552
Mike Adams

761
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,344
And even more appearances by Alex

762
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,368
Jerome corsi

763
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,232
It would be easy to say that this is a radio show that has a very serious wedding problem

764
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,768
But that's absurdly night

765
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:17,120
These are intentional choices made by producers and Nore himself

766
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,400
To have these people on

767
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,192
Despite the very clear reason

768
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:20,960
Not too

769
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,240
They're Liars

770
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,800
Coast-to-Coast while Charming at times

771
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,592
At least it I am part exist

772
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,616
To mainstream

773
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,384
Invoices like

774
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,688
And to introduce them to a giant

775
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,968
Gullible platform

776
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,992
Either way that makes

777
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,016
Incredible

778
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,320
That alone would be really shity

779
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,856
Better be like

780
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:38,880
You know

781
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:42,720
But the fact that Nori would have Doug Hagmann on the day of the bombing

782
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,512
And Alex on the day after

783
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,536
Is inexcusable

784
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,840
Yeah that is in that says everything

785
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,120
End of that

786
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:49,888
Space

787
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,192
The game it's not like he needs ratings

788
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,216
It's not like he needs

789
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,240
Stunts for rating

790
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,032
You could do an open line

791
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,312
Show about ghosts

792
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,592
Or something

793
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:02,944
Did you guys see anything on the woods ever hit Millions

794
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,992
People love coasttocoastam

795
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,016
There's no reason

796
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:06,784
Start book

797
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,576
And be like hey you know what

798
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,368
There was just a f****** terrorist attack

799
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:15,232
Let's get Alex to Yellow

800
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,256
To get her

801
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,352
Yeah only serves Alex's interest

802
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,656
And that's an editorial choice

803
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:25,216
Sound like a broken record on this

804
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:27,008
Editorial choices

805
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,032
Are important

806
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,056
Whenever you

807
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,080
Have a show like this

808
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,384
So George Noory wants

809
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,688
On the bombing

810
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,968
Don't know why so much

811
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,760
Why would someone do something

812
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,600
He already had a psychiatrist. He said it was

813
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,672
Sure

814
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,696
Problem-solve

815
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,232
Sure

816
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:50,304
Seems like a pointless question to ask Alex

817
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,400
You know that Alex thinks is a false flag and you want him to soft pitch

818
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,680
Into the

819
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,984
Absolutely

820
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:02,592
Organized group

821
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:09,504
What would make someone

822
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,808
Focus on them

823
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:16,928
The loss to make trillions of dollars invading countries and selling robots every city 25

824
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,744
Nonexistent mom and there's a lot of issues

825
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,280
So did that

826
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,840
That explanation can't apply to

827
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,912
Anybody bout to go out

828
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:32,032
It's like okay I can see lust for power that's maybe maybe

829
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,824
Celeste at the media pants

830
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,592
Keno Lottery

831
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,360
People wanted

832
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,128
Reality Tea

833
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:42,272
Are there trillions of Dollars around the world that one is released

834
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:46,368
Invading countries of salad robot

835
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:52,768
They could be applied to let's say Al-Qaeda or from North

836
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,560
Carolina.

837
00:37:54,816 --> 00:38:00,448
None of that is possible unless your underlying implication is that it was the global

838
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,984
So

839
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,752
Great

840
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,312
Alex

841
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,592
Talks about his

842
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,872
About whether or not

843
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,152
Conspiracy

844
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,688
And we know from listening

845
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:13,504
Alex's show on April 15th and April 16th

846
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,296
E.com absolute

847
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,088
So it's interesting to hear

848
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,624
How moderate he is

849
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,160
In another forum

850
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,464
You know I have the New York Times here in front of me

851
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,280
April 28th

852
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,072
Hatch by the FBI

853
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,120
And the New York Times talks about

854
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,216
Just a few cases but there's hundreds

855
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:36,288
The government going out and finding mentally ill people

856
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,568
Anybody could do that

857
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:42,176
And then giving them the weapons and and pointing them in the direction

858
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:45,248
Depart of Heroes and I'm not saying

859
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,320
That's what's happened with this case but I do know this

860
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:52,928
There were 4000 great National Guard out there great men and women

861
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:56,000
Not part of the conspiracy and there is one

862
00:38:56,256 --> 00:39:00,608
Out there trying to protect people but violate the Fourth Amendment searching bags and running

863
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,376
Checkpoints

864
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,424
So that's interesting

865
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,776
It's an interesting

866
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,056
They're not part of the

867
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:12,128
Conspiracy if there was there was that strange

868
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:12,896
How can you

869
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,712
You don't know there is a conspiracy which means

870
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:21,856
By definition you can't know if they were or were not a part of it that's secondary

871
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:28,256
Concern what is that on his own show hours earlier

872
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,792
Coasttocoastam

873
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,560
Seemed a little bit

874
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,352
Right now I mean that's

875
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,376
That clearly obvious

876
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:37,984
Immediately wrote down my nose is how Brazen this is

877
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,056
Is knowing full well that nobody's going to be going back and forth from

878
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,592
Maybe Show 2 a.m.

879
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,872
For the being like

880
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:52,064
But no one's going to do that and I'll try to

881
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,600
He is to get as many

882
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:57,952
People from the coast to coast audio to him if you lose some

883
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:58,976
After that point

884
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,000
That's fine

885
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:03,328
Let's say you loses 60% of the people who come over

886
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:09,728
Yeah that's 40% is still going to be much larger than the amount of people that would come over if he got on and started yelling

887
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:14,592
No one's going to check into

888
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,640
They're not

889
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:19,200
They're not

890
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,224
Then right

891
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,272
So is it a strategic decision

892
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,320
On his part it's very obvious

893
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:30,976
Yes absolutely so about that New York Times article Alex wants to argue that the FBI

894
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:35,072
F***** up an inappropriate methods to generate terrorist arrest

895
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:38,400
Most likely to justify their funding I'm willing to listen to him

896
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:41,216
Loses me is when he tries to connect that to

897
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,032
To the very not very real Phenomenon with

898
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,568
Actual terrorist attacks

899
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,592
Have been carried out

900
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,456
Is New York Times article that Alex is referencing here is specifically about

901
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,736
Pretty much exclusively

902
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,760
Muslim ban

903
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,576
Who have indicated an interest in committing a terrorist

904
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:01,184
Worthington snared by the FBI who helps facilitate an artificial attack

905
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,720
In order to eventually arrested

906
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:06,816
Personally I think this is a f*****-up practice and a waste of resources

907
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:12,448
But it's super important to point out that these people who are disgusting this New York Times article are not people who act

908
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,216
Actually carry out

909
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,520
That's a bridge that Alex needs

910
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,544
To build if you want

911
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,104
See you this idea to support his false flag argument

912
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,152
Everything I could tell you spell to do that

913
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,200
The larger point though

914
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:23,968
Izzy you can see it

915
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,248
Wheatley different Alex

916
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,784
This show from the Galaxy song

917
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,576
Michelle from the same day April 6th

918
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,672
Hiiraan Coast-to-Coast you saying he's not sure if there's a

919
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,440
Conspiracy

920
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,488
New doesn't know if the bombers were put up to

921
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:39,328
Steve pieczenik wouldn't commit treason on air until the 7th

922
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,376
But Allison show on the 16th

923
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,936
On that show he was very clear that he thought this is

924
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:44,960
Yeah

925
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:48,800
Alex was yelling about radu's brother that manipulative lie edited

926
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:52,128
Family Guy clip you sending damprid on D2

927
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,151
Disrupt Boston official

928
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,199
Press conferences yelling about how this is

929
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:55,967
The false flag

930
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:59,295
He wondered on Airway right-winger hasn't blown up the UN bill

931
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,343
Alex knows what audience

932
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,111
He's speaking to a

933
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:04,415
And always tries to cater to what they need

934
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,951
To become interested

935
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,815
He knows the Coast-to-Coast has a huge audience in the whole lot of them aren't what we now call Red

936
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,911
His goal is to get more people to his website in the maximize strategy

937
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,447
G4 that easy to moderate

938
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,495
You can still be a paranoid f***

939
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,519
Fancy dumb s***

940
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,311
But most of the coast to coast audio

941
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,615
Isn't ready for raw uncut Alex

942
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,919
Yeah you can't go further then

943
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,687
They're all like

944
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:29,247
A like they're all Muslim

945
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,783
We're not ready to go there

946
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,087
We're still at just they're all legs

947
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,623
Part of this is just good business

948
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:39,743
But another part is clear evidence that Alex knows that what he says on his own show is

949
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,815
If you believed any of the s*** that he says

950
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,631
He wouldn't come on this show and that you didn't know if there was a

951
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,399
Conspiracy

952
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,935
He does that so he doesn't look

953
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,703
Crazy

954
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,983
Because he knows a few tricks

955
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,287
People that he's not crazy for long enough

956
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,823
Might just give him some money

957
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,127
Also they weren't checking bags

958
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,919
At the marathon and there were no on

959
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:04,575
And they weren't the National Guard was not part of the conspiracy if there was one

960
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,111
Which there might have been

961
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:14,303
And if there wasn't maybe they were involved when I get to the bottom of it

962
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:19,423
So are you digging Journal Jacob digging Journal

963
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:22,239
I told you that one of the reasons I thought that this would be

964
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,287
Good way for us to

965
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,079
Dip our toes into the

966
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,103
Coast to Coast

967
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:27,871
Canon

968
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:28,639
Is because

969
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,407
The familiarity

970
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,455
But little did I know

971
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,991
That this would be

972
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,015
Sofa

973
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,575
You cannot control

974
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:39,903
What are the persons good

975
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,047
Did he not say

976
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,655
Take away the guns from the

977
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,959
The only one who will have the gun

978
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:55,007
Is the Criminal Who plants

979
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:59,103
Absolutely that's a Thomas Jefferson quote right there your ride Georgia

980
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,663
Alright

981
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,687
Why

982
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,735
Why do they keep doing it

983
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:08,319
They can't if they can't.

984
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,599
To nobody's nobody

985
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,367
Checking up on him

986
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:15,487
So this is so interesting man any idea what Thomas Jefferson

987
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,767
Did or did not say

988
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:20,095
All them love Jefferson so much but haven't done a single

989
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,887
Seconds worth of work into understanding

990
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,679
His life for accurately discussing his

991
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,447
Career

992
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,495
Acopian reference deer is

993
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:30,335
The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature

994
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,639
They disarm only those were neither

995
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,919
Client nor determine

996
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:34,943
The crimes

997
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:38,271
Now it is truth that line appears in Thomas Jefferson's

998
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,039
Legal comment

999
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:39,807
Place book

1000
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,087
But it's a complete mistake

1001
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,111
Meant to say that the words

1002
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:42,879
Are Jefferson

1003
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,951
They appear in his book because he was quoting a passage

1004
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:49,023
Hopefully super influential legal reformer of

1005
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,071
The time Caesar at becaria

1006
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,631
His 17th

1007
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,655
64 publication

1008
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,935
Essay on crimes

1009
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:56,703
Punishments

1010
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,751
Becker Rio was a big

1011
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,287
Inspiration to a lot of the founders of

1012
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,567
States with

1013
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,591
Complete sense for Jeffrey

1014
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,359
Decided

1015
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,127
Work later

1016
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:06,175
So it could be fair to say this quote is something

1017
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,711
The Jefferson most likely a

1018
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,271
Alex's George were saying

1019
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,807
That would be totally cool with it

1020
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,831
And I just let it be

1021
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,623
The fact that they repeat

1022
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:18,207
Keep this as a Jefferson quote indicates that they don't know where this quote actual

1023
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:18,975
Comes from

1024
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,999
Nor do they care

1025
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:24,351
Even if I once knew where the quote actually came from he's smart enough to know that his audience

1026
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:27,423
Sonora have no interest in what illegal reformer from the 7th

1027
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,191
Hundreds

1028
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:30,495
Oh yeah

1029
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,031
His words are pure gold

1030
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:35,103
Alexis just a tribute to quote to him and move right along who gives

1031
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:39,455
That's what's going on that's how that's how they interact with

1032
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:41,503
And deal with that that these Jefferson

1033
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,551
The prop

1034
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,319
It's like

1035
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:49,951
Rather than talk or engage with Thomas Jefferson at all

1036
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:50,719
They're just

1037
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:53,279
Holding up a Ben Garrison

1038
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,047
Caricature

1039
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,607
Listen to be like see whatever this thing said

1040
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,679
Is imaginary

1041
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,471
It definitely is

1042
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,799
So

1043
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,335
This is where things

1044
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,615
Real f*****-up

1045
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,407
But you can already see the

1046
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:14,015
Princes and Alex's presentation like trying to moderate his his beliefs

1047
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,039
Cannot be like

1048
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:19,135
I know that this is a proper box. Screaming.

1049
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:26,047
But this is what they were arms there too I swear to you

1050
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,839
George said that himself later

1051
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,887
This is where I think it gets.

1052
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,679
Disgusting because it takes on

1053
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,703
Assertive

1054
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,727
Human level

1055
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:34,495
Like Alex

1056
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,519
Changing his

1057
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,567
Form of humanity

1058
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,335
Almost

1059
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,127
I just I find this

1060
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,943
There is no way to stop someone

1061
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,247
If they're committed to something show

1062
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,039
K show this idea

1063
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,599
That we all better be afraid and again for the

1064
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,903
3 people that died the hundred plus a 1/2

1065
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:55,743
It's terrible I empathize with him if I see an old lady

1066
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:57,535
Fall down at the mall

1067
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:01,375
Breaker head which I saw once I heard it snap when she fell

1068
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:06,751
I mean I still have your nightmares about that I have empathy you cuz I'm not a psychopath and a sociopath

1069
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:09,055
You're the SheaMoisture letters are the same

1070
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:15,199
Understand there are millions 15 million children starving a year

1071
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:18,783
Close to 40

1072
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,063
People worldwide

1073
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,135
Most of them children

1074
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,159
So

1075
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,439
Cool

1076
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,463
You know

1077
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,767
You got him biting his empathy

1078
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:35,679
A couple times in our coverage of Alex's immediate response to the bombing

1079
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,703
Victims are survivors

1080
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,519
Alex was singularly focused on building is

1081
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:42,591
Conspiracy in Spanish centrally no time to even acknowledge

1082
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,383
The people most affected by the tragedy

1083
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:48,735
This is another instance of Alex shifting his behavior to suit the audience you speaking to

1084
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:53,087
The Infowars audience has no expectation that Alex will even pretend to care about that

1085
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,367
People who were hurt or killed

1086
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,159
But for the uninitiated that

1087
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,951
Comes office super f***** up

1088
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:04,095
To make sure that the Coast-to-Coast audience doesn't get the impression that he's a real pile of s*** trying to profit off of tragedy

1089
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:06,143
It's important for Alex to really Express

1090
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,167
Country cares about

1091
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:08,703
And yet

1092
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,239
You can't even get through a sentence

1093
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,287
Talk about caring about the victims of the bombing

1094
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,311
Without qualifying

1095
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:16,383
Saying that that's just three dead right thousands are starving

1096
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,175
Is it to say that

1097
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:20,479
You should care about this tragedy but keep it up

1098
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,295
I think that's a dick move

1099
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,343
On the day after a bombing

1100
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:31,231
Probably a shity thing to say the people who care about the dead or injured or misplacing their emotions

1101
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:34,559
My larger problem though is that in my experience

1102
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,583
I see no evidence

1103
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,143
That Alex cares about starving children either

1104
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:44,799
I don't think I've ever heard him advocate for anything other than vague Notions of prosperity that would alleviate poverty or stay

1105
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:45,567
Starvation

1106
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,103
He's totally against the system

1107
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:47,871
Program

1108
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:54,015
And I'm certain that he's against Universal school lunch programs even though I have not heard him speak on that one specific

1109
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,111
This is the issue here

1110
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:01,695
Is your someone like Alex and you expect to get some mileage out of the

1111
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:04,767
These deaths are bad but what about The Starving Children argument

1112
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:09,887
You better make sure that you know you've made directly addressing the problem Starving Children

1113
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,935
And identifiable part of your career

1114
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,471
Because if you have it

1115
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:17,567
It really comes off like what you're doing is trying to convince people not to care about the victims of

1116
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,847
Particular tragedy

1117
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,639
Because something else is supposedly worth

1118
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,175
This is just

1119
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:29,087
What are you talkin about the gun desert over 30,000 people in the year died

1120
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:29,855
Car-X

1121
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,623
Andover

1122
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:33,183
What are you going to Outlaw refrigerators 100

1123
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:39,583
Do people get killed by refrigerators where we going to do there we can't do anything and the primary function of that he's just

1124
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,351
To minimize

1125
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,631
The boss

1126
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,679
You are going to do something about the other

1127
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:48,799
No but I mean

1128
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:52,383
Steve comes on Alex's show on the 70

1129
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,407
Commits treason

1130
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:55,455
Right and great day

1131
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:57,503
That was a very funny

1132
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,039
In that episode

1133
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,319
He gives Alex

1134
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:01,599
Motive

1135
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:07,999
Which is that the supposed bipartisan committee showed everybody for war crimes and

1136
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,559
Navigate it out of the news at this point on this

1137
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,583
16th Alex.

1138
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,119
Have that as a motive

1139
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,911
So he only

1140
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:17,983
His standard go to which is visible extraction

1141
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:18,751
From something

1142
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,799
Where's my phone

1143
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:25,407
Because I want to hear your point George's this

1144
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:32,831
Right now they're trying to pass total blanket open border and the standing of Homeland Security get some control over that and take

1145
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:39,231
Congress out-of-the-loop that's unconstitutional they're trying to pass massive gun restrictions and registration or they can

1146
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:41,791
Take your guns on the word of one psychologist

1147
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,095
Not a judge not a jury not proof

1148
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,887
And they're trying to give

1149
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:49,983
Homeland Security other domestic powers and Hegel

1150
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,007
Talking about

1151
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:53,311
Basically soft martial law

1152
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,335
All that

1153
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:57,663
Is before congress with a razor-thin margin

1154
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,943
All of it is failing

1155
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:01,759
Because not all the House and Senate members are corrupt

1156
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:06,623
So this happened and it diverts everyone in Old let's get behind

1157
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:09,439
What the government wants or what the president wants

1158
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,231
The whole thing is very

1159
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:13,279
Very suspicious that's all I have to say

1160
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:16,863
So this is standard Alex Jones Show

1161
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:23,263
Oh no there's something that has to do with guns that people are talking about the clear that this is a distraction to push that through

1162
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:26,079
We now live in 2019 we know that none of that happened

1163
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,639
Now that idea about like

1164
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,687
Immigration and open borders

1165
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:31,455
Stuff like that is

1166
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,735
Particularly ludic

1167
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,527
Because as we

1168
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:37,343
Come to know the do you know

1169
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,671
Johar and tamerlan Tsarnaev

1170
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,463
Did the bomb

1171
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,743
Yeah

1172
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:48,863
The idea that they would end up doing this bombing

1173
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,679
And that the culprits would be the Chechen

1174
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:57,311
People who came to the country Haviland wasn't even to Citizen johar was

1175
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,591
But like

1176
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:04,479
The idea that that would be what they would do in order to somehow distract people from

1177
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:07,807
Pushing through it open borders package

1178
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:11,391
It seems like

1179
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:12,415
If any

1180
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:15,743
An attack like this even before we know who did it

1181
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,559
Probably lead to xenophobia

1182
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:20,607
I know that does make sense

1183
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,375
About what they're

1184
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:23,167
To do is open the Border

1185
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,703
Everywhere but

1186
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,495
Okay you know that

1187
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,775
The real plan.

1188
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,055
All right you know

1189
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:31,615
We covered up the hole Saudi involvement in 9/11

1190
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:34,175
Of course but we just got to get somebody to

1191
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,199
Get rid of the

1192
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:37,503
That's what we've always wanted

1193
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:41,855
Fine I just think that it's the globalists are having a grand old time

1194
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,391
I just think that there is like

1195
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,415
Such as

1196
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:46,975
Standard Miss to this argument and such a like

1197
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:50,047
It's just universally deployed to the point where it

1198
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,327
Loses any kind of

1199
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,631
You been feeling good it means any yeah yeah

1200
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,423
Distracting us from

1201
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,447
X

1202
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:58,751
Know everything that happened

1203
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:02,847
From everything else fine right and the part that super malicious about this

1204
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,127
So manipulative

1205
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,919
Is it now we live in the future

1206
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,967
We know that like this gun Legend

1207
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,247
Empath

1208
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:12,319
Because I yelled

1209
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,623
I-80 if it does

1210
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:21,023
Past

1211
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,815
I got it it's a it's a trap

1212
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,095
Absolute rap

1213
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,631
That he can profit off

1214
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:26,911
No matter how it goes

1215
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:28,447
So

1216
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,215
George

1217
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:31,775
Is a terrible terrible

1218
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:33,311
Trash fire

1219
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,079
I think he's doing

1220
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:37,663
He comes in with you

1221
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:38,431
Questions

1222
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,199
Bat

1223
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:41,247
In another setting

1224
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,015
Might be

1225
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:42,783
Good question

1226
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:44,063
A lot of the time

1227
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,135
I think that this question that he's trying to answer you want to order

1228
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:50,207
That would be great questions of Thai

1229
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,279
This question I think would be good if

1230
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,303
The person asking

1231
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,863
The question had any interest in the actual answer

1232
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,399
And Hadley

1233
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,959
Cassidy or inclination

1234
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:02,239
To ask a follow-up question

1235
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,263
These are

1236
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:05,567
Neither of those things described George Noory

1237
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:06,335
F.

1238
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,127
This will end up poorly

1239
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,199
Alex

1240
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,247
Where do you draw the line

1241
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,271
Between

1242
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:19,391
The real conspiracy

1243
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,159
Of the event

1244
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:35,007
Weather

1245
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:39,103
Sure

1246
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:43,711
An end for you because you know you're you

1247
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,879
Yourself

1248
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,207
Picture

1249
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:57,791
It would be a good question if honestly answer

1250
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:01,119
Now we know from listening to this day on the 15th

1251
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,911
Minutes after the bombing

1252
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,703
Alex is talking to Richard Belzer

1253
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:06,495
And their spitballing

1254
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:13,151
Talk talking about how Rob dudes brother was in command of the army unit because he misunderstood running the race

1255
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:17,247
There is no bottom

1256
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:20,575
He was on like

1257
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,879
Truth drug that would be the answer

1258
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:25,695
But we know from looking at the actual

1259
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,975
Timeline of the event

1260
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:30,047
Come up with ways to argue that this

1261
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:32,863
Do the false flag within minutes of it happen

1262
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,655
There was no evidence that

1263
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,959
That led him to suspect

1264
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:41,055
False flag there's nothing it was something he was trying to build

1265
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:42,335
From the jump

1266
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,871
So here's his aunt

1267
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:44,895
Which isn't good

1268
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:47,711
The best question I've been asked

1269
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:51,295
Steve pieczenik style flattery

1270
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,319
Batman Forever

1271
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:59,231
Because I struggle with this everyday and I want your listeners to know something I don't just look at an event and say

1272
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:04,351
Hey what will be Sensational I got three children I've got a wife I've got a family

1273
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:07,423
I try to with Integrity gets

1274
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:11,263
And that doesn't mean that I don't make mistakes we all do

1275
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:14,847
Historical

1276
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:18,943
Spectrum of research it coz it's fact-checking it's

1277
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:20,991
It's good she's looking at the

1278
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:24,319
Events that lead up to something if she's watching for

1279
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,855
Telltale signs

1280
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:29,439
So that's vague it means nothing

1281
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,463
I haven't

1282
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:37,375
This is this is I want your audience to know that I'm not some crazy guy who just yells bulshit minutes after a terrorist attack

1283
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,471
Determine conclusion that

1284
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:46,335
Safe to come over to listen to my show you

1285
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:48,127
Research

1286
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,663
Historical

1287
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,431
Context

1288
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,199
It's the truth

1289
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,479
He's telling him

1290
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:54,015
South Georgia's helping it

1291
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:56,575
I feel like I'm in one of those TV shows where

1292
00:56:57,343 --> 00:57:00,671
Like they have that episode where the longtime nemesis

1293
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:02,207
Just shows up and acts like

1294
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:06,559
I've no idea who the who they were before I do know I'm completely

1295
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,839
Maybe I'm a changed person

1296
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,631
You're going crazy like

1297
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,655
No there

1298
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,935
Does wearing a mask

1299
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,215
You can't buy it

1300
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:18,079
And everybody doesn't believe you and you start to go crazier and crazier things

1301
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,359
That you're the one who's in

1302
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:21,663
Say no and then Damascus revealed and it

1303
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:23,199
It was the bad guy all along

1304
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:24,735
Going crazy

1305
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,527
George Noory is

1306
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:30,623
A big bad

1307
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:33,695
Because he has that folksy presentation

1308
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:36,255
Oh

1309
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:38,303
Whatever

1310
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,351
When you really get down to

1311
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:44,447
He is far more similar to Alex then he might like

1312
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,215
People to think

1313
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:50,847
There is no question in my mind

1314
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,663
The elitist

1315
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,479
Anything

1316
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:57,759
Two controllers

1317
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:59,551
To pull our rights down

1318
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:05,951
For someone like me and you

1319
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:08,511
Is that what events occur

1320
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:13,375
Question the possibilities of one

1321
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:18,751
Fortune

1322
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:20,031
Is that

1323
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:23,359
My frustration is it could be alone

1324
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:25,663
Crazy psychopath just wants attention

1325
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:32,575
Family Guy on the 17th or the guy bombs

1326
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:34,879
Marathon to win right at the finish line

1327
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:37,183
Maybe a crazy saw that one on did I do

1328
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:39,999
What

1329
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,607
That doesn't seem in line with his coverage

1330
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,399
That is unfortunate

1331
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,959
I will agree with you that is very

1332
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:55,615
You know what that's a f****** problem though is that the same thing as does all the time like

1333
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,407
People like

1334
00:58:57,919 --> 00:59:00,735
Kaitlin Bennett will go out and try and get people riled up

1335
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,015
Can cause a negative reaction

1336
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,319
Because I'm a conservative

1337
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,879
Framing it as like you're mad at me

1338
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:09,183
Because I'm a conservative is the way that you

1339
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:09,951
Sweetly

1340
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:10,719
Wharf

1341
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:12,255
Whatever you're actually doing

1342
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,559
Went Out in Georgia expressing

1343
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:15,839
It's like we have to ask

1344
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:16,607
The question

1345
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,631
Could this be fake

1346
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,703
It's like yeah I honestly do think that that is fine

1347
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:23,007
Yeah that is absolute being

1348
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:27,615
Very cynical and skeptical about things right I don't think

1349
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:29,151
That is a negative impulse

1350
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,175
It's fine

1351
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,711
When you're actively trying to

1352
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,991
How to build up argument

1353
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:33,759
On

1354
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,807
Like you're building a house of balsa wood

1355
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,343
Yeah that is

1356
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:39,903
No trying to demonstrate that this is fake

1357
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,439
That's not asking question

1358
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:46,303
No that's the same thing as like Millie Weaver Caleb Bennett Owen Shroyer being awkward

1359
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,095
Because of that

1360
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:48,863
No

1361
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:49,631
Why why

1362
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:50,911
F*** out of here

1363
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:53,471
No one's mad cuz you're asking the question

1364
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:55,263
You're mad cuz you're a liar

1365
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:59,359
F****** talking about the Family Guy episode is your

1366
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:01,663
This is why

1367
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:04,223
Every episode 3 Palms the Boston Marathon

1368
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:06,527
You know damn well that's not what that episode was he

1369
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,575
Bulshit

1370
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:10,623
It's just

1371
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,159
It's just not

1372
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:15,743
I've said it before there is it the way that they cheat

1373
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:17,791
Furiate

1374
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:18,815
In-N-Out

1375
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,095
In such a like

1376
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,887
Specific weight

1377
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:22,655
Hit you right in

1378
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:24,703
Eating so many

1379
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:27,519
4 ways I'm fine with that but this little alike

1380
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:28,799
You know what

1381
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,335
I know it

1382
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:32,383
Everybody knows what I

1383
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,175
And we're all just

1384
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:35,711
Shout

1385
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:38,015
And if you can do to stop his imperator

1386
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:40,063
Yeah and the end they won't have

1387
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:43,903
Say it right to your face

1388
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,695
I know I'm lying

1389
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,487
You're like no but you do

1390
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,255
Yeah

1391
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:52,607
So you know the Family Guy what is things that's important about that

1392
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:54,655
Line of rhetoric that narrative

1393
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:55,423
Is

1394
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,191
That

1395
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:57,727
It demonstrates

1396
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,007
Foreknowledge

1397
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,847
Peter Griffin setting off two bombs

1398
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,127
The Boston Marathon

1399
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:05,663
Episode

1400
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:07,455
Your manipulative lie edited clip

1401
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:09,503
You got that that's foreknowledge of what ends

1402
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:11,039
Happening at the Boston bombing

1403
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,831
And you know what

1404
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:14,879
Habitat Oklahoma City

1405
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:21,279
The former Governor of Oklahoma

1406
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,815
Rock or something

1407
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:30,239
Oklahoma City

1408
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,543
It was probably 6 months before yes

1409
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,335
So do you know about this

1410
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,383
This is

1411
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,175
If you are host

1412
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,479
It's like this

1413
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:43,039
And you're supposed to leave the house of this

1414
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,575
You can't just be throwing up

1415
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:49,951
Was there a thing about that or something I don't know do you go but there was something about that

1416
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,743
Right go ahead and fill in my life

1417
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:54,303
Irresponsible

1418
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:59,423
So the book that Alex Georgia talking about here is called the final Jihad when the best of the worst

1419
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,703
Finally come for us

1420
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:02,751
Which is a f****** unwieldy subtitle

1421
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:03,519
Should I

1422
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:04,287
Got that

1423
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,055
I got that down a lil

1424
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:07,359
The book was written by Martin Keating

1425
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:09,407
Brother of former Governor of Oklahoma Frank

1426
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:14,783
Conspiracy theorists believe this book somehow demonstrates for knowledge on the part of the government

1427
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:15,551
What about the alcohol

1428
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:16,575
City bombing

1429
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:18,623
Then they knew you know they knew was going to

1430
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,695
The evidence for this is that there's someone there

1431
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:22,719
Tom McVeigh in

1432
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:25,023
In the book carries out a bombing on a federal building in Elko

1433
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:26,559
Oklahoma which definitely see

1434
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,095
Seems kind of weird at first glance

1435
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,935
It becomes way less weird when you take a couple more clients

1436
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:36,799
Keaton had written the book prior to the Oklahoma City bombing but it wasn't published

1437
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,079
The telar the middle of

1438
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:38,847
19

1439
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:39,871
96

1440
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:41,407
Well after the bombing

1441
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:43,199
There's literally no reason to think

1442
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,735
He couldn't have gone in and changed

1443
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:47,807
A few details in his manuscript to make it seem more interesting

1444
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:48,575
After the bomb

1445
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,135
Because it wasn't published until after

1446
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:53,695
I want to sing is published six months before

1447
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:54,463
It was not

1448
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:56,255
Probably it was about it

1449
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,791
Year after the bombing

1450
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:58,815
It was actually published

1451
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:01,887
Early manuscript could have been varied

1452
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,679
That is

1453
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,471
Brilliant

1454
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:08,031
Pretty pretty good on him

1455
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,823
F******

1456
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:10,847
Brilliant

1457
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:14,687
Said I look it wrong it wrong it's wrong

1458
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:15,967
Evil 8

1459
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:17,759
Wrong I know it's wrong

1460
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:20,063
Morally I can feel it's wrong

1461
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,599
But I do admire it be

1462
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:25,695
You create decent sales out of a problem

1463
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,487
Absolutely

1464
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:30,303
So I found an interview with Keating from April 9th

1465
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,071
Teeth 99

1466
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:32,607
95 the day of

1467
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,375
The bombing

1468
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,911
I did it well what

1469
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:39,007
He was talking to a reporter from the Oklahoma educational television Authority

1470
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:41,823
And I have to say this guy f****** weirds me out

1471
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:45,151
41 the anchor of the segment says the key

1472
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:47,711
He's currently quote finishing up a book

1473
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:52,575
Which really gives you the strong sense that he wasn't finished with it yet mostly because that's what those words

1474
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:55,903
Yeah in the middle of the interview he says unprompted

1475
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:56,671
Quote

1476
01:03:56,927 --> 01:04:01,791
I also predicted the World Trade Center bombing because that would be a gorgeous thing to bring down

1477
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,583
He thinks for a Beat

1478
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,351
Then says

1479
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:09,727
From their perspective with a really weird face

1480
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:16,127
Alright we're really getting into GoPro Isis territory

1481
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:22,527
Me the f****** creeps oh man they would love to blow that up I bet they would false flag me blowing that up all I want to blow

1482
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:26,623
He's clearly saying that he thinks it was a right-wing

1483
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:29,951
Group

1484
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:31,487
I even in that interview he's talking

1485
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,255
I'm about how

1486
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:35,583
The Murrah building that got bombed

1487
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,375
Was the place where the

1488
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,655
FBI agent

1489
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,679
Office who was

1490
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:42,495
In charge of the Waco sharing.

1491
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,287
This was great

1492
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,823
He's very clear that

1493
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,615
He believes happened in the real world

1494
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,895
Yeah but is also trying to

1495
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:49,919
Betrayed in some sort of

1496
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:50,687
Prophetic

1497
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:51,455
Aspect

1498
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:58,367
So this isn't alive TV show they had to pre-tape this just hours after the bomb

1499
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,927
How the hell is this station goat

1500
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:06,047
To dig up a story about an unfinished manuscript for a book that has some parallels to the bombing

1501
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,607
Am I to believe that the Oklahoma education

1502
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:12,191
Television Authority as a researcher that thorough on their payroll

1503
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:15,519
They got somebody on the unpublished manuscript beat

1504
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,055
Obviously not

1505
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,591
This only happens if

1506
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:19,615
He reached out to them

1507
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:23,455
Note 8 there's a pretty good chance he reached out to all the other news networks

1508
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:25,759
Anno ETA is the only one that said yeah

1509
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:29,599
Bombing itself is not the main plot of the

1510
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:34,975
The bookstore would have been really possible to take an already existing manuscript about a terrorist cell in the United States

1511
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,767
Which is what the best of the worst days

1512
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:39,327
In the subtitles on wielder

1513
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:44,959
You can finesse a few details to make it mirror real-world event which it that naturally boost your sales considerably

1514
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:48,543
And tell anyone could demonstrate otherwise the simplest explanation

1515
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:49,567
For this is publicity

1516
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:50,847
To be hunting on the part of Martin

1517
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:54,175
How to Giorgio care about any of this though

1518
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:58,015
They need talking points they can use to justify their anti-government position

1519
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:59,039
And to create

1520
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:01,087
Doubt in their audiences mine

1521
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:03,391
Did all these horrible National tragedies are really

1522
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:05,183
Lots of these evil globalist

1523
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:08,511
Looking at them as if they are aren't acting

1524
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:09,791
Possession of bad faith

1525
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:11,071
You just see this as

1526
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:11,839
Absolutely

1527
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:12,863
You completely stupid

1528
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,399
But I think that's not

1529
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,167
Right

1530
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,703
Doesn't seem

1531
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:18,751
Yeah

1532
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:21,055
Hang up to it that educate

1533
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:22,335
What were they

1534
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:24,127
It was actually really great

1535
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:30,015
To watch yeah cuz it's so mid-90s like Aesthetics of it the people in the in the

1536
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:36,415
The studio right it's public access my light grey table with the black background on it I don't remember exactly

1537
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:39,487
Play but they had some like ads for other shows on that

1538
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:41,023
Public Access Network

1539
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,583
One of them there's just

1540
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,351
It's the weirdest look

1541
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:47,167
Okay dude in the world

1542
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:49,983
Yeah yeah I'd like a Wall Street review show

1543
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:52,287
Got to love it

1544
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,311
Lubbock

1545
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,615
So Alex that you bench

1546
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:59,967
Family Guy said earlier you bring that back up cuz at this point

1547
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:01,247
That is a

1548
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:03,295
One of the only things he has to go on

1549
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:05,599
If you recall on our episode about the 26

1550
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,135
April

1551
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,927
Episode

1552
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:12,767
What are you yelling about for a lot of you that carries over

1553
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:14,815
Family Guy

1554
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:16,607
You don't have shows where

1555
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:20,447
Where the cowboy joins the Taliban and blows up the Boston Marathon 2 weeks ago

1556
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:23,519
I am in another expunging that off all the

1557
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:27,359
DVRs and off of Tebow singing It's a hoax when it's not a

1558
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:29,407
Very creepy that's happening right now

1559
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:32,479
Not you got no exaggeration I did the math today

1560
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:33,759
22

1561
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,551
Current TV shows

1562
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:36,831
For every episode

1563
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:42,207
I mean I was talking to my buddy and watch Hawaii Five-O of initiation

1564
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:44,255
Every other episode

1565
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:48,095
Returning veteran is shooting cops or planting bombs or blowing up

1566
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:48,863
Sporting events

1567
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:51,935
That is a boring show that every other episode

1568
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:55,263
Absolutely. Every other episode

1569
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,031
That is a

1570
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:57,567
Really top show to watch

1571
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:58,847
It really is.

1572
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,127
Every other episode it's

1573
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:06,527
The same thing they changed it from bookem Dano to the veteran

1574
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:08,319
It was weird whenever they just

1575
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:17,535
Yeah I took the facts about evil veterans returning home app

1576
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:21,375
For this episode I don't I did not have time to watch the

1577
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,399
The entire third seat

1578
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,423
FYE

1579
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:26,495
But I did go to their Wikipedia page

1580
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,519
And I searched

1581
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:29,055
The page for veteran

1582
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:31,615
Military Soldier

1583
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:33,919
Right none of the episodes any of those words

1584
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:34,687
Description

1585
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:40,319
I don't know it was this the Hawaii Five-O with Scott cam

1586

Remember who else is on that show but it came out right

1589
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:48,511
After a little bit after lost

1590
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:49,535
Sightings

1591
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:50,559
People from Lost

Other bookings

1593
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:53,631

I'm always happy when James

1595
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:58,239
Sure that's just one of the weird thing Kenosha

1596
01:08:59,007 --> 01:08:59,775
Support Sports

1597
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:00,799

01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,663
Tomcat

1600
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:09,503
Yeah sure no way that was Gary Busey's son

1601
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:13,855
Is great in The Frighteners

1602
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,903
Is that unequivocally a true

1603
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,207
Comcast

1604
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:22,559
I'm good I only saw cuz I worked at a theater I never would have seen that movie otherwise

1605
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,351
That's awful

1606
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,143
Anyway

1607
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,959
Position where we know a lot about

1608
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:32,543
Do that that's not a bad Avenue to go down later

1609
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:33,567
Oh yeah I would

1610
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:35,103
I think it would make us to

1611
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,127
That's true

1612
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:38,943
Sodium

1613
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:44,063
All this doubt there's 22 shows demonizing Patriots Family Guy all this

1614
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:47,647
It's just Alex trying to build up the idea that there was a

1615
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:50,463
Preexisting vibe that was going on

1616
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,767
Don't let him to believe they were going to blame

1617
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:55,583
About that a little more

1618
01:09:56,095 --> 01:10:00,447
I came out I wish I was still broadcasting in overdrive Internet only

1619
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:03,263
Central for Eastern happen

1620
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:09,919
And I'm usually shed watch my gut tells me we'll try to blame the Tea Party regardless of whether it stays or not

1621
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:12,479
There were like Kim

1622
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:13,759
Kim newscast

1623
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:16,319
Right after that came on shed

1624
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:19,647
I bet it's tea party that did this Michael Moore has said

1625
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,695
Chris Matthews is shadow

1626
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:25,279
George Noory has set at yeah

1627
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,303
George noory's guest

1628
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:28,351
She said it earlier

1629
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:33,215
Tea party specifically

1630
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:34,239
Veteran

1631
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:35,775
Gun owners

1632
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,567
Militia right-wingers

1633
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:39,615
Download you are also trying to get

1634
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:40,895
Trillions of dollars out of

1635
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,175
Global

1636

Yellowstone wolves

1637
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,735
Yeezys using

1638
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,759
Tea party is like a

1639
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:46,527
Stand-in

1640
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:48,575
For all of those groups

1641
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,111
George

1642
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:51,903
But earlier on this very episode

1643
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:54,975
So the Alex is a Gaston George and one of his callers

1644
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:55,743
Where

1645
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:58,559
Bandying about the idea that

1646
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:03,423
It was probably somebody who was mad at legs cuz they're returning veteran

1647
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:05,983
Right Alex

1648
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:12,639
Anyway Alex gets into more conspiracy b******* and I think this is actually really in

1649
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:15,711
This low-key you might be one of

1650
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,479
My favorite

1651
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:17,503
Clips

1652
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:20,063
Malik's cuz I think it demonstrates

1653
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:20,831
Something

1654
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:22,367
So damning

1655
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,135
About him

1656
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:29,791
You've got the marathon coach saying they were on the drill they were announcing the loudspeakers nevermind

1657
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:32,607
What's happening this is part of the drill everything safe

1658
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:36,959
Right before it exploded and Rob do my news director for my nightly news show

1659
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:38,495
Rob Dyrdek

1660
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:41,823
Brother-in-law cuz I've seen of arguments with him on the phone

1661
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:46,943
His wife's brother is in Army intelligence isn't officer

1662
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:51,295
And

1663
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:52,319
He called

1664
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:53,855
Rob's wife about

1665
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:56,159
5 is sister and said

1666
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:59,487
Yeah it's weird they pulled me out of the race towards the end

1667
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:02,559
And I wish I was young pretty close to the lead

1668
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:06,911
They said your dehydrator going to the hospital and I didn't think that made sense because

1669
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:08,191
Normally they

1670
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:09,983
People can crawl across

1671
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:13,055
The hospital

1672
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:17,407
For some reason

1673
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:19,199
Talk to him since then no one will answer

1674
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:22,271
The phone the wife hasn't been able to see him

1675
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:23,295
And

1676
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:29,695
That's something that actually happened

1677
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,719
Coast to Coast

1678
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:33,279
No time to explore got to go to commercial

1679
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:36,351
So why do things that I think is the most

1680
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:39,167
Interesting about looking at Alex's narratives forensically

1681
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:40,703
Is that I can tell you when and

1682
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:41,471
How they check

1683
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,263
Based on new

1684
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:47,871
At this point on the 16th Alex's heard the stuff about the coach

1685
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:50,175
You mentioned the police exercise at the marathon

1686
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:52,735
Which based on all evidence is likely a crowd descent

1687
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,783
Station drill for the police dogs

1688
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,831
Alex ran with that information

1689
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:59,647
And you see being repeated here on this and that last clip

1690
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:04,255
August 16th Alex had not yet found the pictures on 4chan from the marathon

1691
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,815
So he doesn't know anything about Black Backpack

1692
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:08,863
This narrative about the

1693
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:15,007
Suppose drill becomes announcements on loudspeakers telling marathon runners not to be worried about men with black backpacks of later

1694
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:19,359
That's how he is telling the one we looked at the 18th

1695
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,383
The 17th

1696
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:21,663
At least the 18th

1697
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:23,455
That's what the narrative become

1698
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:25,247
Because he doesn't have that piece of it

1699
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:29,599
Yet his there was a drill narrative it's still in the larval stage

1700
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:31,135
As he's talking to George

1701
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:34,975
This is a really good case in point for how Alex incorporates information

1702
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:35,999
Ninja has already

1703
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,023
Narratives

1704
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:41,887
He's already established with his audience that there was a drill going on and that means this was a false flag

1705
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,935
Later on he'll build on this

1706
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:45,983
Adding in the entire part about the

1707
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,775
Supposed Navy Seals and

1708
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:50,079
The white Patsy Alex imagined in the pic

1709
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:51,359
Found on 4chan

1710
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:53,919
This fundamentally has no relation

1711
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:55,455
And do the comments made by the track

1712
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:58,015
But Alex needs them

1713
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:58,783
To be connected

1714
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:02,111
So he goes on to claim that the track coach was talking about announcement about

1715
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:03,135
People with black backpack

1716
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:04,927
Which is not here

1717
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:05,695
What are you talkin

1718
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:06,463
George

1719
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,231
On the 16th

1720
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:08,511
If he doesn't have that information

1721
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:11,071
But he should

1722
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:13,887
Because he all he's talking about is the announcements

1723
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:14,655
The track coach

1724
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:20,543
Had this beat had was if this was sincere and Alex just repeating

1725
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:25,663
You should know about the black backpacks from the announcement

1726
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:28,991
Of course it's just impossible for this to be the product of good faith effort

1727
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:31,295
Alex already has the information that came from

1728
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:34,367
The track coach so if that information have anything to do with black backpacks

1729
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:36,415
That to be a part of the narrative from the beginning

1730
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,439
And it's not

1731
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,207
That's

1732
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,231
Suspicious

1733
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:40,511
Yeah when I find

1734
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:41,535
The mostest

1735
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:45,887
How close to the lead was

1736
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:49,727
Most interesting you know what I'm saying put that in

1737
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:54,591
In the other episode brother get really good at Marathon

1738
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:58,943
That's that's interesting it and that's exactly

1739
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,479
It might be in there

1740
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:01,503
There's added.

1741
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:04,575
Details to Rob his brothers narrative that don't exist

1742
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:06,879
As it's been told on Alex

1743
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:07,647
Show

1744
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:09,439
And I think what's going on there

1745
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:13,535
Is it Alex starts down that road and then realizes he's not talking to his

1746
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:14,303
Dum dum audio

1747
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:15,327
Any dozen

1748
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:17,375
He has to make this more interesting

1749
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:19,935
Somehow a bunch more details

1750
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:20,703
He starts

1751
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:23,007
Embodying Rob dudes brother talking

1752
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:24,287
King in the first person

1753
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:25,311
Yeah make it somehow

1754
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:27,103
See more compelling than it is

1755
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:28,895
I hate when he does that he also

1756
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,175
Pitocin

1757
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,711
Some sort of brag

1758
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:33,247
Rice

1759
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,783
It's just that nurses

1760
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,831
Cystic malignant psychopathy

1761
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:44,511
He's close to the lead to why I think that's because I think that's fair

1762
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:45,279
Sick that's life

1763
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,047
Narcissism

1764
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:52,703
And more trying to make it seem more egregious that they thought he was dehydrated

1765
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:58,591
Alright people crawl across the finish line

1766
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:01,407
Yeah it's just sick manipulative s***

1767
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:03,711
And you can see like very clearly

1768
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:05,503
The way this Morris

1769
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:07,807
He's on a f****** jackass

1770
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:10,623
If you had the information that

1771
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:12,415
Supposedly

1772
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:13,439
Has

1773
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,463
It wouldn't come out

1774
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:16,511
And I think

1775
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:17,279
That's all they have

1776
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:18,815
This guy is

1777
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:23,423
So in the next clip Alex sites some globalist

1778
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:26,239
Talking about how they want to take us all out

1779
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:29,055
Then George asks another good question

1780
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:30,847
In a different account

1781
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:34,431
Be a good person and that's basically

1782
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:35,711
But they're real

1783
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:41,343
Straight Shooters

1784
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:43,391
Socially engineer has

1785
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:46,207
To make us pliable and submissive

1786
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,767
Exterminator

1787
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:51,327
Responsibility

1788
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:57,471
Absolutely the White House signs are Road ecoscience bragging about the 70s

1789
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:00,543
Bertrand Russell 80 years ago wrote about it

1790
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:02,591
I mean this is their religion

1791
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:07,711
And that's why they can find terrorists to attack us to scare us into submission that's why

1792
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:11,807
Yeah they can come out and say it's either Al-Qaeda that attacked us

1793
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:16,159
Orange Libertarians equation

1794
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,695
That there is some

1795
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:21,279
Al-Qaeda Middle Eastern people

1796
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:27,935
There are real grip Shannon eget recruited under multinational organizations

1797
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:31,263
To engage in selective control the tax

1798
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:33,823
Compartmentalize low-level people

1799
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:38,943
Don't even know what they're part of they believe they're fighting for you of the Jihad all I whatever

1800
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:40,479
Everwell hobbyism

1801
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:43,039
But they're working for a higher cause

1802
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:45,343
Scare the West in the giving up

1803
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:47,135
It's liberty in Freedom I mean

1804
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:50,463
So your answer is no

1805
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:52,767
There are no real terrorism

1806
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:56,607
Started run by the global everybody is run by

1807
01:17:56,863 --> 01:18:03,007
The white ones are tricked into doing it because they think that they're pursuing their own

1808
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:04,799
Pawns of the global

1809
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:09,407
Driving like a punk-rock scenario for terrorism we're like

1810
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:13,759
Do you get a good band together and you start out real small and then you start getting it

1811
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,551
Remembers

1812
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:18,111
And then the f****** record labels come in

1813
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:22,463
And they stood they just only terrorists

1814
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:24,255
Garage

1815
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:26,559
Down in the lower level you know like

1816
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:28,351
I know

1817
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:29,375
DC shows

1818
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,399
Right

1819
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:31,423
Yeah it's

1820
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,959
It's it's really strange

1821
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:35,775
And again like I said I think that would be a real pointed

1822
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:36,799
To ask Alex

1823
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:40,127
Situation where you would actually ask follow-up

1824
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:42,943
And actually be interested in an answer as opposed

1825
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,223
To allowing Alex to

1826
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:45,759
Just about his nonsense

1827
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:49,087
And one of the reasons I think that this

1828
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:50,879
The problem

1829
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:53,183
I'm just it's impossible for this sort of

1830
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:56,511
Interview to go well is that George Noory is not like

1831
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:58,815
I think his perception of things

1832
01:18:59,071 --> 01:18:59,583
Is a little bit

1833
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,351
Off

1834
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:04,447
Call Alex

1835
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:12,383
Create

1836
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:15,455
Who became part of al-Qaeda

1837
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:19,295
I would say all of them that would be pretty much everybody you act

1838
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:25,183
This is some kind of information are you

1839
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:26,463
Do you do you

1840
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:29,791
Sincerely think that most people who are in the media don't know that

1841
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:31,071
That's crazy

1842
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:33,375
This isn't some kind of berry

1843
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,143
Truth

1844
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:36,447
This is very well.

1845
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:38,495
It's one of the few agreed

1846
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,775
Stacks of a

1847
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:43,103
Treason committed by Republican president that we do talk about

1848
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:45,407
Is there so many that we do

1849
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:47,711
So widely spread it's almost it's

1850
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:48,479
If this is

1851
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:49,503
Is college dorms

1852
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:51,551
Who's blowing your mind

1853
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:53,087
Nonsense

1854
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:59,487
Presented the idea that everybody who's not part of their truth movement doesn't even know this is

1855
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:00,255
Crazy

1856
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:01,791
Nonsense

1857
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:04,351
Anyway here's where it turns that even worse

1858
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:05,631
And they start getting attacked

1859
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,399
80 Baxter

1860
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,191
The globalist

1861
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:11,775
As you know the talked about are pushing vaccines

1862
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:15,104
Put on record and made autism go from 1 + 25,000

1863
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:16,128
The one in

1864
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:21,504
Chelsea

1865
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:25,088
But I don't take

1866
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:25,856
Flu shot

1867
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:29,440
I had a vaccine when I was

1868
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:35,840
That blew my arm up the size of a basketball

1869
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:36,608
Was it for me

1870
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:42,240
It's great to not tell people that they shouldn't get vaccines but do you think that maybe you were cheating the exact

1871
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,264
Same outcome

1872
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:46,080
But make yourself feel better

1873
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:52,480
Because you say you're not telling me I'm out telling people not to I'm just repeating the story about the dangers of vaccines and hubby

1874
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:59,392
Personally and I consistently say that I never get in I will never do it and imma trustworthy

1875
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:05,280
Admiration and respect and I say that I never do

1876
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:11,168
You think that this might just be a psychological crutch so you have to take responsibility for the things you advocate

1877
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:12,448
Maybe

1878
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:16,544
Yeah some contacts on this George Noory has been on the radio since at least 90

1879
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,568
1579

1880
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:20,896
This time that you got a shot and had a bad reaction

1881
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:22,176
Do it happen before then

1882
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:24,480
It should be pointed out that vaccines

1883
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:26,528
To come a long way in the last 40 years

1884
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:29,600
The last time in or you got a shot with a Time

1885
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:31,392
Before I even had vaccine for

1886
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:34,464
Hepatitis A and B Lyme disease and rotavirus

1887
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:37,536
Countless lives have been saved due to these medical advance

1888
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:43,936
But George got a bump on his arm for decades ago so now he's going to let s*** head like Alex spread their anti-vax propaganda

1889
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:46,496
And give them photastic port

1890
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:51,104
Yeah guess who just booked their ticket to conman Island

1891
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,640
B on their George

1892
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,688
So I just

1893
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:55,712
I got I got no time

1894
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:56,736
I have no.

1895
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:58,528
And George

1896
01:21:58,784 --> 01:21:59,552
Cuz nothing but time

1897
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:05,184
You know my uncle is a Vietnam veteran I don't have to tell him about vaccines

1898
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,536
On his way to Vietnam

1899
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:14,656
That put him in the hospital for two weeks

1900
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:25,920
She said I'm never going to get one of those

1901
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:28,480
I was

1902
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:36,672
Anecdotal stories

1903
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:39,232
I will say in a very kind

1904
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:41,792
Sending tone God love you I love you

1905
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:48,448
Let me tell you about the time that I've gotten shots and nothing's happened

1906
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:54,080
Valid is all of your apocryphal stories about your uncle and some stranger you talk to

1907
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:56,896
I was at school and all of these

1908
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:57,920
These kids got shot

1909
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:59,456
And nothing bad happened

1910
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:00,480
And any of them but

1911
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:03,040
You're not going to see that being entered into and

1912
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:03,808
Anecdotal evidence

1913
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:07,136
Right that's why these arguments are made this way

1914
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:08,928
Because statistically

1915
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:13,536
The all the other stories are boring as s***

1916
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:15,584
You can only build a case

1917
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:17,888
For a position like this

1918
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:19,936
With appeal to emotion and

1919
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:20,704
Narrative

1920
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,728
These these

1921
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:28,384
Anonymous stories of someone who got sick because they got the vaccine or his arm blew up to the size of the basket

1922
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,688
Ball and if you don't have one of those.

1923
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:34,528
Make one up right now I don't know what this person was George to talk about

1924
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:41,440
That's probably a Welfare Queen sauce it in there were supposed to trust him cuz he spoke CNC

1925
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,000
Anyway why would you

1926
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:46,816
This is very important

1927
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:47,840
This is one of the

1928
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:50,656
Things that make George Noory realshit

1929
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:52,448
Is that he's pretty auntie

1930
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:54,240
And

1931
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:56,544
Is a lot of alternative ideas about science

1932
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,104
As evidenced by the doctor

1933
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,896
Did he talk to you

1934
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:03,200
I strongly anti recycle

1935
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:04,736
So

1936
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:07,296
That's a problem and a problem it will

1937
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:08,064
Continually

1938
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,880
Will develop as we get more and more is Jojo

1939
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:14,976
So Alex has a mad about people caring about

1940
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:16,256
Victims

1941
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:19,584
Android

1942
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:21,376
You should know of course

1943
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:22,400
Aubrey still mad

1944
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:25,216
Wow hundreds of thousands die from

1945
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:26,752
Flesh eating bacteria

1946
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,800
In the US every year admitted

1947
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:31,872
Hundreds of thousands die from Bad drug interactions

1948
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:34,432
Hundreds of thousands die from Bad Medical

1949
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:35,968
Procedures

1950
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:36,736
We're talking

1951
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:37,760
$600

1952
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:38,784
In total or more

1953
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,344
And no one cares it's not on the radar

1954
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,392
But oh my gosh in high-def

1955
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:48,768
Are three dead people we need to ban your Liberties because of this

1956
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:51,584
How would I not be suspicious

1957
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,120
Of the entire motive

1958
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:55,168
Here let's sell every city

1959
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:56,960
15 million dollars

1960
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:58,240
A bomb

1961
01:24:58,496 --> 01:24:59,776
Disposal robots

1962
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:00,544
Okay

1963
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,312
Alright

1964
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:02,336
Couple important

1965
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:07,456
Hundreds of thousands people do not die from flesh eating bacteria every every night

1966
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:11,552
CDC puts the number at between

1967
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:12,832
700 +

1968
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:14,368
1200 cases

1969
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:15,136
Puryear

1970
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:16,672
With about a quarter of the cases be

1971
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:21,280
That puts us at about 300 people per year in the United States

1972
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:23,840
Maximum dying from flesh eating bacteria

1973
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:27,168
I'm not even sure that 100,000 people die of it every year global

1974
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,192
I'm not even

1975
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:29,216
Ensure 100,000

1976
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:31,264
Probably

1977
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:32,800
100000

1978
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:34,592
Don't die from Bad drug react

1979
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:37,664
The number you most commonly cited as 100,000

1980
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:39,200
Which certainly is a lot

1981
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:40,224
Is a real problem

1982
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,760
But also still in Belichick

1983
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:43,808
In service of minimizing the deaths

1984
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:45,088
Set the Boston bombing

1985
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:46,624
Which is what a monster would do

1986
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:47,904
Alex might be

1987
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:53,536
Closer To Fine on the medical procedure one but there's a larger issue that he's completely ignoring about all of these examples

1988
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,352
All of these things are examples of

1989
01:25:57,376 --> 01:26:00,448
Things that the federal government has spent money trying to attract

1990
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:05,824
The CDC put that psa's and educational material about how to avoid getting flesh eating bacteria

1991
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:09,664
Many of the drugs that people have adverse reactions to are prescribed

1992
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,712
Stances that are literally called

1993
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:12,992
Controlled substance

1994
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,552
You're not going to last long being a license

1995
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:16,832
Being lights

1996
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:17,856
The doctor who can patch

1997
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:20,416
Does medicine did you keep boxing surgeries

1998
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,184
And procedures

1999
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:24,000
Using examples like these in relations to guns

2000
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:24,768
Really only

2001
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,328
The argument stronger that all gun should be licensed

2002
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:28,096
Register

2003
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:30,912
Sure a lot of people to die from medical complications

2004
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:33,216
But imagine how many more would be dying

2005
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:39,616
If you don't have no license or governmental educational requirements for doctors to do surgery

2006
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:40,640
Possibly a

2007
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:44,224
Because from the dawn of a medicine that is always

2008
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:46,784
The freeways never any

2009
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,088
Hundreds and hundreds of years where you could

2010
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,672
Call yourself a doctor

2011
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:59,072
The free market would settle you kill enough people no one's going to use your service

2012
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:07,264
You know what's funny about that it's the same argument I'm sorry

2013
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:12,896
You know why people say guns kill people but cars kill people you have to have a license

2014
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:14,688
You have to have insurance if you drive on

2015
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:15,968
Public Road

2016
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:19,296
Using that as an example to be like

2017
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,576
You know hey

2018
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:27,488
You do you say guns kill people that this does to think I absolutely think about how many more would be killed the government

2019
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:28,256
Care of

2020
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:30,816
Try to minimize the damage

2021
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:31,584
Is that that does

2022
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:32,864
Rude license

2023
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:33,888
Something through insurance

2024
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:36,448
In case you do get into an accident the insurance

2025
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:41,056
Helps pay for the person that you harmed it in there

2026
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:42,336
People only hurt

2027
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:45,920
Don't arguments Adventure at 3 or God

2028
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:48,224
I don't know you better believe it

2029
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:49,504
Exactly what you were

2030
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:51,296
What's

2031
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:53,600
Inch of what what's fascinating about this argument

2032
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:54,880
He gets that he

2033
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:56,416
Getting it both ways

2034
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:57,952
Because he's both

2035
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,024
Setting the stage for it to be a false flag

2036
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:03,072
It doesn't matter who did it

2037
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:04,864
Except for who they're trying to

2038
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:05,632
To blame for it

2039
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:07,424
What the same time minimizing what

2040
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:08,960
Silly means

2041
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:09,984
Almost saying like

2042
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:10,752
Well

2043
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:12,032
If it is a right-wing

2044
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:14,592
They wouldn't we wouldn't act

2045
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:18,176
But they wouldn't just go after something

2046
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:20,736
Mall like all only 3 deadbeat

2047
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:23,296
Only under you literally is doing

2048
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:25,344
We would have gone after

2049
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,136
Exact

2050
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:29,184
Yeah that whole thing

2051
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:31,488
Utterly utterly

2052
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:32,512
Fine

2053
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:34,560
I want white terrorism to happen

2054
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:35,584
And I don't want to be blue

2055
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:36,864
Yeezys

2056
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,400
Real real Shady

2057
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:41,216
So they get to talkin about some other topics like that

2058
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:42,240
There's a bit of Basa

2059
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:45,568
Embalming talk they also fear off in other directions

2060
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:47,872
Snorri has some news topics that he wants to

2061
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:48,640
The head

2062
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:50,432
And one of them is apparently

2063
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:51,456
I just got shot

2064
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:53,760
In about allowing people to have knives on planes

2065
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:56,064
Right and this is

2066
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:58,880
Well I don't I don't I don't care about my position

2067
01:28:59,136 --> 01:28:59,904
I care about their

2068
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:00,928
And it's weird

2069
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,464
Let me ask you

2070
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:11,168
Wheelchair

2071
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:12,448
Stuff like that is crazy

2072
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:13,728
The judgment

2073
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:14,752
Is Knotts

2074
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:16,288
But allowing

2075
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:18,592
To take

2076
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:24,224
Is Ludacris

2077
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:27,808
After all

2078
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:32,672
And with a 2.3 6 in knife

2079
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,536
Well yeah take

2080
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:40,864
Via Lone Star College thing in Texas last week

2081
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:45,216
We're 12-plus people or stabbed by a 1in exacto knife

2082
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:47,776
My issue is this

2083
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:51,872
England is trying to register butcher knives now

2084
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:54,432
Because they took the guns of the stabbings

2085
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:56,480
Exploded

2086
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,528
I want to know

2087
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:00,576
Why they make Pilots

2088
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:03,392
The whole aircraft

2089
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:05,440
Giant

2090
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:09,024
Why do pilots have two jobs I've interviewed him he better be them

2091
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:11,328
Oops

2092
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:14,400
Daddy locked up in the shape of firearm

2093
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:16,448
In the cockpit

2094
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:21,056
But now we're going to let people take knives on a plane it's just not at all I'm saying George

2095
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:22,336
This is crazy

2096
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:25,664
First of all I have not heard alexeeff

2097
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,480
Single word about that Lone Star College stabbing

2098
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:33,600
When you first brought it up I thought he was talking about the shooting at Lone Star College for Becky

2099
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:36,672
January 2013 that we covered on our show

2100
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:38,976
If you don't remember that was the one where Alex

2101
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:43,072
Feverishly covered live footage of it on his show saying the BET was covering it up

2102
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:45,120
Thinking that he could turn it into his own saying

2103
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:47,168
Sandy Hook only to realize that

2104
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:48,192
To the students

2105
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:49,216
At the school were black

2106
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:50,240
If you lost interest

2107
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:53,056
Well it turns out on April 9th

2108
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:55,616
2013 there was another incident at Lone Star College

2109
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:58,432
When a student named Dylan Quick-Step

2110
01:30:58,688 --> 01:30:59,968
People before being tackled

2111
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:01,248
The Ground by fellow students

2112
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:05,344
In interviews with police quick talked about having fantasies about cutting off people

2113
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,880
Both faces and wearing a mask

2114
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:07,904
Since you with age

2115
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:11,488
And he also talked about how he was into necrophilia and Ken

2116
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,280
Right right

2117
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:15,584
It's so weird to me

2118
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,632
That Alex never brought up this case

2119
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:19,168
Until now and

2120
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:20,448
Not on his own show

2121
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,752
I wonder if that has anything to do with the fact

2122
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:23,520
Dylan quick

2123
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:25,824
A white male who went on a stabbing

2124
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,128
Free at school that has a student body that's a proxy

2125
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:28,896
At least 75

2126
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:30,176
Not white

2127
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:31,968
We can see it's a story the 5th

2128
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:33,248
Perfectly into his narrative

2129
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:36,320
Do you have an example of a non gun-related School attack

2130
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:38,112
It's just sitting there on the TV

2131
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:40,672
For Alex ready for him to use as proof that school violin

2132
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:41,696
Isn't about guns

2133
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:44,000
But for some reason I don't remember seeing

2134
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:46,048
Or hearing him say anything about it

2135
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:48,352
Which I imagine is this because I was a super busy

2136
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:49,120
The timer

2137
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:50,656
Tried to help Steve pieczenik

2138
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:53,472
Can't be in Korea on clandestine business that could be

2139
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:54,752
He had more important

2140
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:58,848
Also shouldn't Alex police for being able to be armed on a plane

2141
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:04,736
Doesn't Disney not realize that him conceding that there are certain situations where it's not appropriate for him to be armed

2142
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:06,528
The really hurts his argument that the global

2143
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:07,808
Monster trying to make schools

2144
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:08,576
Hospitals

2145
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:09,856
Disarmament zones

2146
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:14,208
If he's allowed that some places are places where you should not be allowed to be armed

2147
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:17,536
It logically follows that there may be some other places where the same

2148
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:18,560
True

2149
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:20,864
What is an airplane that makes

2150
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,400
So you shouldn't be able to be armed on it

2151
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:24,704
Well if it's that it's a confined space

2152
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:29,824
And he shouldn't be okay with anyone being armed on a train or bus or any other form of public transportation

2153
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:33,408
These are just simple and very Elementary problems of the way Alex can

2154
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:34,432
Construct argument

2155
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:35,968
And the term for this is

2156
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:36,992
Consistency

2157
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:41,088
Alex goes on and on all the time but no more guns equals safe

2158
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,904
Because having a weapon and Powers a person to defend

2159
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:45,184
But here

2160
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:48,768
For some reason he's opposed to people being able to protect themselves

2161
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,304
Because they're on a plane

2162
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:52,096
His argument that the

2163
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:53,888
The answer to the bad guy with a gun

2164
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:54,912
One is a good guy with

2165
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:55,680
Gunship

2166
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:57,216
Still apply in this situation

2167
01:32:57,984 --> 01:33:00,032
The answer to a bad guy with a gun on a plane

2168
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:01,056
Is a good guy with

2169
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:02,080
With a gun on a plane

2170
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:08,736
There's nothing and it's even worse in terms of guys cuz guns you could say while you might shoot out the window and so big

2171
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:11,808
But not as you're not going to nice through the window

2172
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:13,344
You don't know that you're probably not

2173
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,368
Here's here's

2174
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:15,392
His Witcher

2175
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,440
It's all about

2176
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:19,232
It's all about dementia

2177
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:22,048
Alright 2.36 in

2178
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:25,120
Is far longer than 9 mm

2179
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:27,680
We all know what the real f******

2180
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:28,448
Shut off

2181
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:29,984
Appreciate

2182
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:32,032
I appreciate your templates

2183
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:34,080
Rationalization

2184
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:34,848
But it doesn't work

2185
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,384
He needs to provide

2186
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:37,408
Irrelevant

2187
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:39,712
Reason why he would be in favor of someone

2188
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:41,760
Being armed in every situation

2189
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:43,808
I didn't fail to do so

2190
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:47,392
The fundamental problem is that Alex has an absolute

2191
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:52,768
And he yells all the time about how the Public's right to be armed cannot be infringed

2192
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:53,536
And that's

2193
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:56,096
Incompatible with the belief that good law-abiding C

2194
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:58,656
Shouldn't be allowed to be armed on a plane

2195
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:02,496
They're not going to attack anybody while they're on that plan so why you worried about it

2196
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:04,288
Because these positions are

2197
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:05,056
Incompatible

2198
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:06,336
It's a strong indication

2199
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:07,360
Alex is

2200
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:09,408
Really as principled as he pretends to be

2201
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:11,200
Which I know is a shark

2202
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:12,992
Maybe there's something else

2203
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:13,760
Baha'i disposed

2204
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:15,296
Now that he's just

2205
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:18,112
Stop

2206
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:20,416
B2 review

2207
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:23,488
If you yelled at everyone should be armed and every single situation

2208
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:24,768
Be able to have guns at

2209
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:25,792
Stadium

2210
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:32,192
The hospital in the waiting room of your kids being born you should have a gun believe all that stuff

2211
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:34,240
You need to make a folder argue

2212
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:35,008
About why you're gay

2213
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,032
People having knives out

2214
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:37,312
Right right

2215
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:40,128
Probably

2216
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:43,200
What is it

2217
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:44,480
What if it crashes

2218
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:47,552
Where did you get stabbed by the knife

2219
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:51,904
That is a very serious consideration I hadn't thought about that I retract everything

2220
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:56,000
So a long way on this episode we've seen Alex

2221
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:57,536
Kind of minimized

2222
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:58,560
The deaths at the bombing

2223
01:34:59,328 --> 01:34:59,840
And be a little bit

2224
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:00,608
Dickish

2225
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:01,632
Even while he's

2226
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:02,656
Touting his

2227
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:03,680
Great

2228
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:04,704
Apathy

2229
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,520
Picture of George tries to push back a little bit on the

2230
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:08,544
About how like

2231
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,824
You should we should care about these

2232
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:12,640
Which I tip my hat to a little bit

2233
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:14,688
And Alex

2234
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:15,968
Tries to pretend

2235
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:18,272
Okay let's hear this tone of voice

2236
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:19,808
Chihuahuas scared

2237
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:22,624
Whoever killed three people at the Boston Marathon

2238
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:25,440
An immediate acting like it's the end of the world

2239
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:28,512
There's giant issues going on I saw washer

2240
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:30,304
Post article a few months ago that

2241
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,608
At the headline

2242
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:43,872
Injured

2243
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:48,992
With her arms and legs

2244
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:53,088
No absolutely not it's the opposite

2245
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:57,696
The minute I mean I saw the photos of a guy with his leg blown off at the me

2246
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:00,000
Bone sticking out with

2247
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:01,792
Arteries hanging out

2248
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:10,240
At the finish line for his father was in the race

2249
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:12,800
6 years old

2250
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:20,736
Marathon

2251
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:23,808
To come up to his family is little boys.

2252
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:26,112
And his six-year-old daughter has an arm gone

2253
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,840
All the media

2254
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:39,168
Appearances all week here so much over so sad

2255
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:40,704
Oh it's terrible

2256
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:44,032
But they're they're basically narcissistically

2257
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:45,824
Drawing all the ratings

2258
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,616
Alex wow

2259
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:50,944
Crazy you're doing it again man come on

2260
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:54,272
So this clip is super interesting to me because just hours earlier

2261
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:59,904
You're on his own show Alex repeatedly done some Rifts about 8 year old child

2262
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:03,744
Was probably killed because a cop told him to hold the bomb before it went awesome you got it

2263
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:09,632
Alex in his own controlled environment spoken ways are outrageously disrespectful about this kid who was killed

2264
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:10,656
And if I was

2265
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:11,424
The parent listening

2266
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,448
Think that I would be

2267
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:13,472
Furious

2268
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:17,568
But he did that and he was able to because he's acclimated is audience

2269
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:18,592
Did I cruelty in

2270
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:20,128
And inhumanity gradually

2271
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:26,016
And now he hasn't convinced it in fantasizing about imagine scenarios about the globalist

2272
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:27,808
Kill this kid is somehow productive

2273
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:29,600
As a part of fighting the globalist

2274
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:31,904
You can't do that on Coast to Coast

2275
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:33,952
As I've repeatedly pointed out

2276
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:36,000
He knows the audience is very

2277
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:36,768
Any nose

2278
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:40,096
Colors no one's going to come over to his show

2279
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:41,376
But it's bigger than that

2280
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:43,168
George Noory doesn't listen

2281
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:44,192
The Alex's show

2282
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:47,776
He doesn't know the kinds of horrible b******* Alex says everyday

2283
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:49,056
Time for that

2284
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:55,456
He's a busy dude he's got hours of radio to do is go up you got a Life to Live 3 hours

2285
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:59,040
Is Alex doing b******* that it's actually very boring

2286
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:04,416
He would probably be fine with most of Alex

2287
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:05,184
Is political

2288
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:10,048
Stupidity but this sort of disrespect to a child victim of a bombing would most likely offend

2289
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:11,328
Even Georgia Sensibility

2290
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:15,168
And Alex knows that that would mean he'd no longer be welcome on the show

2291
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:16,960
Is way bigger than his

2292
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:18,752
You know if you was

2293
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:19,776
Joking about the

2294
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:22,080
Is kid being handed a bog-witch

2295
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:23,872
The stress was on the 16th

2296
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:26,432
That was on our two showed that he did

2297
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:28,736
This same day

2298
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:30,016
This is crucial

2299
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:34,880
Alex demonstrated a certain sort of behavior on his show on April 15th

2300
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:36,416
And he's dead

2301
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:37,696
Menstrating quite

2302
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:40,000
Fred behaviors here on Coast to Coast AM

2303
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:41,536
When will be wise

2304
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:42,816
Ask themselves

2305
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:43,840
Possible explanation

2306
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:44,608
Other could be

2307
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:48,704
Money

2308
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:49,472
Yeah good

2309
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:55,360
And we see Alex like just sort of rolling around like a pig and s*** talking about his ratings are through the roof

2310
01:38:55,616 --> 01:39:00,224
Talk about narcissistic Beauty basking in the ratings

2311
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,528
And you did it again he did that thing where he's like

2312
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:03,552
I know how to make the

2313
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:04,576
Media sound

2314
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:05,600
I'm so evil

2315
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:08,416
I'll save they're doing what I'm doing right now

2316
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:10,976
I'll be honest I mean I think that the criticism

2317
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:12,000
Some of the media

2318
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:13,024
Hunting rating

2319
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,072
Call tragedy

2320
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:18,400
Absolutely agree and it's again

2321
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:19,424
I'm liking

2322
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:20,704
This formation of this

2323
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:21,984
How I say that

2324
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:23,776
I'll accept that criticism

2325
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:25,056
Anybody but Alex

2326
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:28,896
That is a fine point that you don't get to make it

2327
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:30,688
Can't be in the middle of

2328
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:32,224
Doing it while judging

2329
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:35,040
You can't that's a rule

2330
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:37,344
That's where the problem

2331
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:40,416
So they talk about a load

2332
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,952
Of b******* Alex

2333
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:42,976
Suggest that

2334
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:49,632
Jay Leno is in trouble with a network

2335
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:50,912
Sports Alex

2336
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:53,728
They talked about her gloved

2337
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:54,496
Alex's

2338
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:55,264
Appearance on

2339
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:56,288
A Morgan

2340
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:57,056
It's just a bunch

2341
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:57,824
Yeah yeah

2342
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,896
You can sort of Hit the fast-forward button on that

2343
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:03,712
And we get to them talking about how you need to get

2344
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:07,296
Takeoff

2345
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:08,576
Any moment now

2346
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:09,344
Answer George

2347
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:10,368
I think

2348
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:11,904
Jokingly asked Alex

2349
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:14,208
He's going to get chipped

2350
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:24,448
Years old and I have a heart attack when I go get a chipped

2351
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:25,984
That's fine

2352
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:29,312
But even technology itself

2353
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:31,616
But if it's a chip to buy and sell

2354
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:32,896
Absolutely never

2355
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:37,248
Are you serious do you think that these f****** evil globalist are going to

2356
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:39,040
Tell you it's for a medical reason

2357
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:40,832
What are you doing

2358
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:45,696
You're saying that in some circumstances it's fine to get these chips

2359
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:50,304
Well I mean Vince Staples said that you should never

2360
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:52,096
He is very Adam

2361
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:53,888
Okay

2362
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:55,168
But also

2363
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:57,472
That is such a fun

2364
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:59,008
Trusting dumb things

2365
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:01,568
Obviously

2366
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:02,336
Play technology

2367
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:03,360
He's not all leave

2368
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:05,152
If I need it I'll get it

2369
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:11,296
But if I don't need it then I won't get it you're like hey this one's going to be

2370
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:13,856
And this one over here is going to

2371
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:14,624
Control your heart

2372
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:17,184
Choose

2373
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:18,976
I know this one I don't trust

2374
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:21,792
So I'm going to choose the one that you said was going to kill me

2375
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:23,840
Alex I've listened to enough

2376
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:24,864
Enough of him to know that he

2377
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:26,912
He talks all the time about the globalist

2378
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:27,680
Trojan

2379
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:29,216
Trojan Horse thing things

2380
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:30,496
In backup

2381
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:32,288
Cancer virus in the vax

2382
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:35,360
He went to picking at the medical thing in order to

2383
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:38,944
If there's a medical

2384
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,992
For me to get this chip

2385
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:44,576
Such fantastic fan

2386
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:46,112
Testicle like childlike

2387
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:49,696
Thinking of the rules like they're playing by the fairy rules

2388
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:51,488
You can't do what you have

2389
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:54,560
Say my name backwards

2390
01:41:54,816 --> 01:42:00,192
Otherwise you got to heal my heart but it's also the same thing as the I'm against knives on a

2391
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:03,264
Applying this is a counterexample to

2392
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:09,152
What you believe or you express you saying there's a circumstance where it you're accepting this chip

2393
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:10,944
That means

2394
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:12,736
Not have the stuff you say his

2395
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:16,064
Damn you can't hold the positions

2396
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,600
You all day unless you allow people

2397
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:19,904
Also what if your 50

2398
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:24,512
Is there an age

2399
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:28,608
Cut off for you where you like around 70 I don't need to worry about it I'll get the hardship

2400
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:31,168
If they buy and sell me whatever.

2401
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:35,008
Surge of Baltimore talk about the Family Guy stuff and Alex's

2402
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:37,312
Pretty clearly expressing that he understands

2403
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:38,848
Is that what they did was

2404
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:43,968
Run with a clip that show different parts of the episode put together to make it appear

2405
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:47,552
Peter was bombing a marathon sort of indication

2406
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:50,112
He's aware of it I don't really care

2407
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:50,880
Jiren talk

2408
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:52,416
So much more about this

2409
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:54,208
George announces that he's going to

2410
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:56,256
Speech and Alex is going to be

2411
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:57,280
Live stream

2412
01:42:58,304 --> 01:43:01,376
Skype and Alex have they talked about

2413
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:03,680
Alex says

2414
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:07,264
That's not verified whatever

2415
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:11,616
Fuk up I don't know if Alex ended up showing up to that one but in 2015

2416
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:14,176
George Noory gave a speech in Toronto and Alex roses

2417
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:15,968
It's all built

2418
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:19,808
It just trying to build up his Rebel persona

2419
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:21,344
Well what it was he had enough

2420
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:24,416
That really Siri

2421
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,464
You know what you going to do

2422
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:28,512
So this last clip

2423
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:30,048
I think is

2424
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:31,072
Interesting

2425
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:31,840
And

2426
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:32,864
Sad

2427
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:34,400
In hindsight

2428
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:36,704
What you going to do

2429
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:40,288
I wonder what 2016 will be for all of us

2430
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:43,872
What do you think

2431
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:47,968
President

2432
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:52,576
And if there is free Elijah to this country he'll probably win

2433
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:53,344
Oh boy

2434
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:54,624
So

2435
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:57,440
That's why I just left

2436
01:43:57,696 --> 01:44:02,816
Could turn back time when I was listening to that just died hearing George Noory

2437
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:06,912
His folksy ass voice and all of us

2438
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:10,240
Oh no that is only you knew

2439
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:11,520
Jumpcut

2440
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:16,128
If only you knew and it's only you

2441
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:17,664
Is it a lot of the negatives

2442
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,200
Stop is a direct consequence

2443
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:22,784
Reactions

2444
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:26,624
Facilitate

2445
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:27,904
The platform

2446
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:30,976
Giving these people a much larger audience

2447
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:31,744
It's much

2448
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,280
More influence

2449
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:35,328
What they bring to the table deserves

2450
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:38,912
I would say you should look back on this George

2451
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:39,680
Nvda

2452
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:41,984
Deeply ashamed

2453
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:44,800
And this is something that

2454
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:46,080
I don't know if I can prove

2455
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:47,104
But I think

2456
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:48,640
George Noory

2457
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:49,920
In that moment

2458
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:50,944
Right

2459
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:53,504
Genuinely wondered what was going to happen

2460
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:56,832
So all the sudden we have a thought bubble

2461
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:59,136
And then we're playing out

2462
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:01,952
We're all living in that what would happen

2463
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:03,232
George Noory

2464
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,256
Continues on the say

2465
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:08,096
Same track when we find ourselves at the end of the world

2466
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:11,424
Explodes he's going to suddenly wake up in the middle of this conversation

2467
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,216
They f*** you Alex Jones

2468
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:15,264
Donald Trump will never be president

2469
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:18,592
He's going to burn the studio down and run out the door screaming

2470
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:21,152
And that's how we're going to save the world Dam

2471
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:23,200
Not good that that's a better

2472
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:26,016
Reality the day

2473
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:30,368
I know so this brings us to the end of our maiden voyage

2474
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:31,904
Going into the

2475
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:33,952
SeaWorld of coasttocoastam

2476
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:36,000
I think you can see

2477
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:39,072
Some pretty good reasons why this is

2478
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:40,864
Fits into what we do

2479
01:45:41,632 --> 01:45:42,144
This is ask

2480
01:45:42,912 --> 01:45:46,496
This is bulshit this is mainlining propaganda

2481
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:47,520
White Wedding

2482
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:48,544
Not talkin about big

2483
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:50,592
Talk about it

2484
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:52,128
At some point some of those

2485
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:54,432
Make sure you end up going into

2486
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:58,272
To somebody paranormal and weirder episodes of Ghost Coast

2487
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:01,344
But what you see is a very

2488
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:02,112
Concerted effort

2489
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:02,880
2

2490
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:03,648
Make Alex

2491
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:05,696
Seem like a credible expert

2492
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:07,488
And make

2493
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:08,256
The things that

2494
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:09,792
Sanitize

2495
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:12,096
The things that he does on his show

2496
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:14,400
By creating a difference

2497
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:19,008
Moderate version of it resent your audience and then loud

2498
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:20,800
That deep

2499
01:46:21,056 --> 01:46:21,568
Researcher

2500
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,616
Guy who knows all this s***

2501
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:25,408
And it would actually comes

2502
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:26,176
What is this

2503
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:27,968
Man between

2504
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:29,504
Nouryon Rogan we got

2505
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:31,552
Army of people

2506
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:32,832
Soft

2507
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:35,648
I think Nori is worse

2508
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:37,440
Oh I agree with you

2509
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:42,304
The what would I

2510
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,584
The intersection

2511
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:44,864
So many worlds

2512
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:46,400
Exist on

2513
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:49,216
Because we have

2514
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:50,240
Space weirdo

2515
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:53,312
So that has a lot of the Project Camelot stuff in it

2516
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:54,848
You have Alex

2517
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:56,384
Anti-communist

2518
01:46:57,664 --> 01:46:58,432
Extreme right-wing

2519
01:46:58,944 --> 01:47:02,016
Folk right Infowars contributors and what have you

2520
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:04,320
And then also you have people likes

2521
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:05,344
Quail in

2522
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,368
Tom Horn

2523
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:07,136
Who are

2524
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:09,184
Pretty regular guests on Jim Bakker

2525
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,976
Talk about apocalyptic

2526
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:12,256
X step

2527
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:18,400
You have the worst of it's like that book written by the brother of the Oklahoma governor

2528
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:22,240
It's the best of the worst oh yeah you might be right these people exist

2529
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:23,776
Within the

2530
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:25,312
Gastly

2531
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:26,336
Yeah

2532
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:27,616
Coasttocoastam

2533
01:47:28,384 --> 01:47:29,920
And then you add onto that that

2534
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:31,968
George Noory is

2535
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:33,248
One of the sponsors

2536
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:34,528
Is youngevity

2537
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:37,344
Dr. Joel Wallach veterinarian

2538
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:40,160
The f*** are those people have these

2539
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:41,440
Thank you there's so much

2540
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:42,976
A section that comes in

2541
01:47:43,232 --> 01:47:46,304
I think is weed to peel back layers on

2542
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:47,072
The Onion

2543
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:48,864
I think that what we what we'll see

2544
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:50,912
Is almost a unified

2545
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:55,776
A place where a lot of hover that youngevity is actually behind the f******

2546
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:57,824
And all of this

2547
01:47:58,336 --> 01:48:00,640
I don't think we'll find that but I do think it will see

2548
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:01,920
Honda parallel

2549
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:02,688
Not just

2550
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:06,272
Alex but to all these other topics

2551
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:08,064
We cover and all these other stuff

2552
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:08,832
Damn yeah

2553
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:10,112
So I look forward to

2554
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,904
I hope everyone enjoy

2555
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:13,696
I will be back

2556
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:15,744
