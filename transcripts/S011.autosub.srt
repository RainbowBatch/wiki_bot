1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Important

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as if through the good guy

3
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:59,136
Knowledge vype.com

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Everybody sit around and talk a little bit about Alex

5
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:11,936
What's up

6
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,216
Is

7
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:19,616
Chocolate graham crackers chocolate graham crackers very underrated

8
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:26,016
Are you talking the layer of chocolate on top of the graham crackers that are chocolate

9
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,856
They're not like actual milk chocolate chocolate

10
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,648
Grandpa

11
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,928
Underrated

12
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:37,536
Underrated straight up chocolate yes absolutely

13
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:43,936
To Suites on Geib and they're not I don't know I just asked

14
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:50,336
Got some recently and I thought they were really good and I'd forgotten how good they were. Remember the last time I had

15
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,896
Honestly you know you used to pour like

16
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:56,224
I used to pour like that

17
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,624
You get that handful of Teddy Grahams or whatever and drop it in that thing of milk and just practically drink it like cereal

18
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,208
Kind of like that except for the

19
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:06,976
Goodbye

20
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,000
My God

21
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,816
Teddy Grahams

22
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:17,216
Brickform

23
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:23,616
Alright that's what I'm going to do the new album

24
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:30,016
Play Isaiah Rashad first album in 5 years and it's fantastic

25
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,320
The sun's tirade

26
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,648
Was one of my favorite albums of 2016 it had

27
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,184
A absolute

28
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:41,024
Destruction of averse by Kendrick and

29
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,424
It was just fantastic and then his new album is really really great to I am very happy with it nice Tennessee

30
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,800
Represent sounds like the chocolate graham crackers over album

31
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:59,968
To Jordan today we have a re-release of an episode which is somehow we've done ever

32
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,016
Up to that point

33
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:07,648
I think sometimes we said hey go to check back out this episode or whatever I passed but

34
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,672
What I thought

35
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,584
Here's the deal Wednesday we discussed how we were going to check in with Alex as he

36
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,376
He goes to Sioux Falls with

37
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:23,776
This dumb cyber conference and obviously we're going to have to follow that story at under Marshall

38
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:30,432
Because Marshall I was going to Beyonce litter on on the 11th of Wednesday

39
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,456
What up happening

40
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,992
That's true

41
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
Tomorrow

42
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:38,624
Alex didn't go.

43
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:45,024
Course I was going to be a disaster he's been in studio this whole week and so like

44
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:52,192
That didn't happen we don't even like mentioned Mike Lindell and and all that stuff we may be a little bit

45
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:57,312
But like not not not enough to pique my fancy

46
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
And so like

47
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
Hello

48
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,896
That's a disappointment

49
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,200
I was looking forward to another Alex on the road

50
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:07,552
Situation where I was looking forward to him going to Mike lindell's

51
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,880
Big guy Comic-Con because

52
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,440
I spend a good bit of time

53
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,744
Watching his stream

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,143
Prepare myself to give myself the contacts that I needed to discuss and every Bowl

55
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,799
It was such a waste of time unbelievably bad

56
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,383
Improve his case and obviously the Supreme Court

57
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,783
Will be voting 900 today

58
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,367
Headlight

59
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,463
I don't know man the problem that I had was that

60
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:52,863
You know I seen a couple of funny clips on Twitter I was excited for whatever trainer

61
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:57,727
Direct was going to happen and it there's nothing it was just a long stretches

62
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,543
Just saying numbers

63
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:07,967
I got nothing to arriving to watch out for a PowerPoint presentation

64
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,135
Weird guy with an American flag bow tie

65
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,415
Whatever

66
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
I would rather

67
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:24,095
The guy from the 92 found a way to get free grant money from the government more this suit and did those commercials

68
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:30,495
I would do a 72-hour how to get free grant money from him I wonder about that guy I wonder if his free

69
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:35,359
Not not that far I wonder if like he actually help people

70
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,687
Anyway let's not do push-ups while I'm there

71
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,063
You know it was a bummer

72
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,903
Alex's Alex's not done anything really worthwhile

73
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:54,303
And the time that I would have spent just like being like a let's do a past episode 2 our who spent watching Mike lindell's stupid.

74
00:05:54,559 --> 00:06:00,703
And

75
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,031
Okay well let's find some of this good audio from

76
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:10,687
MyPillow stop that if you wanted to search on on Twitter and socks you can find other people

77
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,455
Posted

78
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:17,087
Yeah that's the stuff that's fun and I don't think we need to Pirate their content or anyting

79
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,927
So what are the things that they did see come up

80
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,719
Is that

81
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,047
It's being discussed

82
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:30,655
That the source of the information behind Mike lindell's

83
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:37,055
Conspiracies

84
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,079
PayPal

85
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
Diem

86
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,919
Dennis Dennis Dennis

87
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,087
So turns out that not only is Dennis Montgomery The Source apparently of this

88
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,391
Information to Mike Lindell has

89
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
He also

90
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:59,071
Is the guy who claims that he created hammer and scorecard guess the things that are behind like Sydney

91
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:05,471
Powell's let her conspiracies billion-dollar loss

92
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,263
Syracuse

93
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:13,663
That did not get thrown out this week another important news

94
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,527
Until what are the things that I thought when I when I heard that is is like he's done it again

95
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,087
Is Dennis Montgomery guy

96
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,927
He is low-key one of the most destructive

97
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:28,511
The horses and Mike conspiracy theory

98
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:34,911
He's a whack-a-mole to it's like you think he's down and then all the sudden he pops back up behind Mike

99
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:41,311
Bloomdale 72-hour Symposium supposed to do with this ass he's a name but most people don't know

100
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,639
No but he's f***** up so much

101
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,967
It's not even like he's a behind-the-scenes guy

102
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,503
It's almost like you just

103
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,647
Find a way to get into the right situation give the wrong information to the right people and then we're all f*****

104
00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:02,047
Yeah yeah yeah so the episode today that we're going to release is our 25th episode from

105
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,095
2017

106
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,935
Yeah it's a ways back

107
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,751
And this is

108
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:16,895
I was thinking about is like well as Montgomery's coming back up we can talk about this again or

109
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,175
We already did

110
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:24,575
And I don't think a lot of people episodes

111
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,599
Probably haven't heard this

112
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:33,791
It's done it's done as Montgomery if anybody had listened to this ahead of time

113
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:40,191
Maybe you Michelangelo or Sydney Powell if they'd listened to

114
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:46,591
How many people would not be getting sued if they just listen to our share saved you 1.6 billion dollars

115
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:52,223
You just know no oh no

116
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:57,855
I do believe that in the episode I say if I saw Dennis Montgomery I would run the other direction

117
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,671
That would have been good advice for all you dumbasses

118
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,767
It's so funny

119
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,047
You know I think

120
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,631
I think what you have is

121
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,679
Overtime

122
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,727
People have become

123
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:20,127
So gullible I guess that somebody like Dennis Montgomery could get

124
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,175
Like well way back

125
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:28,575
You could get somebody like Joe Arpaio to go along with him because Joe Arpaio was trying to beat a

126
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:35,231
A case with a conspiracy that I could use

127
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,631
It doesn't work you know doesn't work then everyone's like dance like this noise

128
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:46,751
Everybody is like the world is so weird now

129
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:51,359
And Mike Lindell has so much money to throw around at nothing now they

130
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,151
All of this

131
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:53,919
Good bike

132
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,735
So much of the quote-unquote

133
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
Proof

134
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,831
And the lingering of the election conspiracies

135
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,623
Comes back to

136
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,695
This guy who should just be discounted out of ham

137
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,463
Yeah

138
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:12,863
What are you do when the going gets weird weird refused to die and continue to pop up wherever it is

139
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:18,751
Is that they can like f****** zombies trying to kill the rest of us all it's wild yeah

140
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,543
Just listening back to this episode

141
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,847
And just because I felt like

142
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:28,479
I want to check back in I think there's a couple things I want to say before we we had to playing

143
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,271
But one is that

144
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:36,159
This was the first time that I really tried on our show to

145
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,975
Get into a topic

146
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:45,375
And I can tell like a list of listening back to it as I did not have a lot of practice in

147
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,167
Doing that I don't think that

148
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:52,543
Response to it but

149
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,663
The definitely shows that I have not done a whole lot of that good

150
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:04,063
Five years later you should be better than you do

151
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,855
That seem kind of idea

152
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:10,463
I think that there's a little bit of language that we wouldn't use today

153
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:15,839
That is thrown around slightly different

154
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,423
And I was considering going back in like cutting out stuff

155
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,263
What have you but I I I don't I feel like that would be slightly dishonest

156
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,055
No we were who we were

157
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:30,687
Is coming from a far more ignorant place you know back

158
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:37,087
Back in 2017 we hadn't even really started the show episodes in but

159
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,391
Charizard listener base there was

160
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,415
Just

161
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
You know the few

162
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:46,303
The few people who lived in Chicago really that were that were around so

163
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:52,703
Now that now that I'm not in such an isolated place you know only being around comics only being

164
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,079
Being around all of those people and have

165
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:01,407
Hi there I think some of it it was like gear

166
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:07,039
To hear the time it does represent show some

167
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,319
Modicum of growth

168
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,855
And I I think that

169
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,439
Is something can I have to just take on the channel little bit

170
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:17,023
And then the other thing too

171
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:22,143
More fun backpack

172
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,239
I think it before the world

173
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,287
Became what it is now

174
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:33,151
Is a bit easier to have fun talking about the subject

175
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:37,503
It's it's it's really it was really remarkable to go back at 8 and

176
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,295
Seether the like

177
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,831
I don't know goofiness

178
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:45,951
Interrupt so much more and I was so much more into it because

179
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:53,119
We weren't living through a year-and-a-half two years on pandemic we could have mostly been averted

180
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:02,591
Yeah it was weird it's funny that back then I predicted that Trump would try and overthrow the government and

181
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,895
And become a dictator and then when it happened

182
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,687
I was surprised

183
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,015
Is very strange I was and I wasn't that surprised

184
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,551
Bile

185
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,831
It's

186
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:19,231
Different now though I'd be like me predicting wild ends Montgomery's going to be trouble in the future I'd still be surprised

187
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:23,583
Seriously again here we are

188
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,119
Holyshit

189
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,423
What up what a bummer

190
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:32,543
Something so easy to avoid Dennis Montgomery

191
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:39,967
You know it's weird when somebody is put together a decades-long body of work that

192
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,271
Proves beyond a shadow of a doubt

193
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:47,647
This is someone you should not trust yeah and then five years later people are still like

194
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:53,279
I'm going to give this Shifty weirdo shot you know every every group needs to have a loose cannon

195
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:59,679
I mean I would say that even like taking leaving aside whatever we did or this

196
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,959
Like that

197
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:06,335
I think there was plenty of public information not to take this guy seriously

198
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
Butts

199
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,503
People are addicted to it they're addicted to fake whistleblowers they're addicted to

200
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,575
Tales of intrigue and and like

201
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:23,487
Jason Bourne types it's kind of amazing that tell me what I want to hear will often override

202
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:28,351
Any and all information

203
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119

205
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:39,615

206
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,455
I don't know if you saw the Rand Paul news

207
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,527
Would you like to debate him on these stocks

208
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,343
To debate Rand Paul it is day

209
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:56,255
285 inside of officially demanded a debate with Rand Paul do you like to do

210
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:02,399
Rand Paul about the ethics of his wife owning stock in the company to make the red desert VR

211
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,983
Wow he goes on an anti-vaccination Crusade

212
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:10,847
That isn't a lock should last one sentence

213
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,895
Unethical Edward

Unethical

Daisy Marc dicey clay that's what we're dealing with

216
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:26,207
Pillar of Integrity Rand Paul immediately thought of you and thought of how much fun

217
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:30,559
That would be babe I want to debate him

218
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,351

6

247
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
Level of hell

248
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
Like the world

249
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,095
Most boring hobo coming on TV

250
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:13,215
He's got quite a bit of a sudden realize that

251
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:13,983
Yellow tongue

To promote it online

255
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871

00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,151
Pizzagate

257
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,223

258
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
Watching

259
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
So far

260
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,807
No bombshell

261
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,367
So we will monitor

Nope not at all

264
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:38,559
I'm still standing by my former theory that I espoused of last podcast

265
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,607
If you got threatened with a lawsuit

266
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,143
Yeah

267
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,447

00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,935
Generally what we do is I take a day in the life of Alex

283
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:18,751
The clipse

284
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,775
Disgust

285
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
Incredibly wrong

286
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,567
About every

287
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,871
His break

288
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,431
The entirety of last week

289
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
This is unprecedented

290
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,271
Busted ass but Alex

00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,039
Cuz promoting

292
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,575
And the result

293
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,599
Of my

294
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,183
N2y Alex Jones

295
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,719
I feel like

296
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
Gastineau

297
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,279
That he's just being

298
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,071
Alright hamster no

About 30 text review over this past

Court documents

305
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:59,455
What is wrong with you

This is

308
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,783
Now this is a venture

309
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,319
Play just going to turn into me

310
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,599
Wishing well

311
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,439
Thrilled I know

312
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:14,815
That's one of the problems I had an amazingly great time reading up on all this stuff

313
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,607
I found

314
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,935
Is like legitimately horrifying

315
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,727
There's individuals that we're going to do

316
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,495
Disgust

317
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,823
You probably wear of maybe one or two of them

318
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,871
Jesus sure he's going to come in the mix

319
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,991
Infowars

320
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,551
Franklin delanor Roosevelt

321
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,599
I think it's an accident but I'm not

322
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,487
Etiwanda

323
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,327
There's a guy at least one who's going to come up

324
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,631
Will know who he is

325
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,447
Before but the amount of research that I did

326
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,495
Really highlighted how much worse

327
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,031
From here

328
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,823
That was not fun

329
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,359
Reading some of the stories

330
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,967
Why are you taping

331
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,735
Because

332
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,551
I want it now all I can think about is who it might be

333
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:11,647
For some reason I don't think that's right

334
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,415
No we watched

335
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,951

00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:19,071

410
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,656
Actually

411
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,192
About to talk about it all

412
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,520
It's infuriating it drives me incredibly insane

413
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,544
But

414
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,616
So we have the this clip is done

415
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:19,200
There's more

416
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,992
What we have already as the introduction

Universe theme

418
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:25,600
It's that there is an essay CIA whistleblower who is come out

419
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,880
Who has a ton of documents

420
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,184
Donald Trump

421
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,464
Is being surveilled

422
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,256
Inez

423
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,816
Will learn

424
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,864
That not only is Donald Trump

425
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,632
Being

426
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,680
Surveilled and have been for years

427
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,704
Bethany was just

428
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,472
A business

429
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,520
Right not only that

430
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,800
Alex Jones

431
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,080
Michael Savage

432
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,872
Other people's families

433
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,664
The news

434
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,456
Just other people say hi

435
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:56,832
No

436
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,368
Although Snowden

437
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:04,768
Get clocked out a little bit in this episode minor compared to what this whistleblower

438
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:10,656
Is bringing out every single element

439
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,936
I will

440
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,752
If in the next

441
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,520
Two-and-a-half

442
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,312
23 hours

443
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,384
If we don't end up with everyone who hears this

444
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,176
Realizing that this is nothing

445
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,456
I will

446
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,736
Commit Harry Caray

447
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,576
Live at the purple couch

448
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,696
Look it up

449
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,888
The only way to go about things honorably

450
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:47,264
At least come out and say it wasn't true kind of like we got the microphone

451
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:51,872
Police and a Federal Marshals another copy from different division

452
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:00,320
And for a week the media

453
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:09,280
I also called the phone numbers on there

454
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,264
Right now

455
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:30,016
Again again that to him reading

456
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,576
I'm not figuring out outside

457
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,112
Works on the garage

458
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,536
Remember

459
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,608
Yes where we go

460
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,400
What's the movie with The Rock in

461
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,960
And Steve Carell is that right I don't know

462
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,032
Yeah with

463
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,360
The old one

464
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,384
They made a new one

465
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,408
Steve Carell

466
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,432
I don't think the rock was

467
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:02,784
Employment

468
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,624
So on Sunday of last week

469
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,416
Infowars published

470
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,184
What they

471
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:12,000
Believe claiming

472
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,792
A database

473
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,584
Phone numbers and address

474
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,376
Right and Alex

475
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:21,216
Who said this these were my old phone numbers this is correct

476
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:24,544
These are the phone numbers that I have for Donald Trump

477
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,336
These are real phone number

478
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,872
But as We Know

479
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:34,272
He doesn't know Donald Trump's phone number

480
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,552
Look for the prize he keeps

481
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:38,624
He's claimed that he has multiple phone numbers

482
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,672
It falls flat

483
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,768
Thompson different area code

484
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:52,192
He has he has these things that he published

485
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,728
With some redacted

486
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,520
Parts you know like you don't want to

487
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:59,360
Sacred on it even if you do

488
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,384
You've got you don't want to

489
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,152
The docks

490
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:01,920
The people

491
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:05,248
Phone number

492
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:10,112
They claimed it was a part of a massive index people who were being spied on

493
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,160
And this is from this whistleblowers

494
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:14,976
Now

495
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,512
The problem that we have with that

496
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,536
Is that it

497
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,072
Completely unproven

498
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,424
All of this information could have been gotten by someone who has

499
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,472
The minimum amount of hacking

500
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,240
Scales

501
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,264
Hated willing to

502
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,032
Who falsified

503
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:33,664
Keep that in mind as we go further

504
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,992
Posted

505
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,016
Does not have

506
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:38,784
Newcomb

507
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,600
He's posted on the website

508
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,880
Does not have to come

509
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,648
From

510
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,696
Like an NSA source for CIA

511
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,000
It's all very easily accessible information

512
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:52,096
Like a lot of the information is the address of Mara Lago

513
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,120
I could Google

514
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:59,520
I need print out like a part of the phone book did I think someone else

515
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,824
Did and sent it to him as evidence of a leak

516
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,104
Okay so it's

517
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,640
It's not the white papers

518
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,408
It's the white page

519
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,456
That's what we're talking about

520
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,224
Nailed it

521
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:14,112
Yeah you think I can sell my baby all day

522
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:14,880
So

523
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:18,208
This is basically the construction of

524
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,744
What is going on

525
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,584
Building

526
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,632
Eli's

527
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,752
If using whatever information that he got as evidence

528
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,288
The Trump has been being

529
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:33,824
Spied on

530
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:37,152
He's using it was right all along

531
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:37,920
Right

532
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,736
So on Monday he has an interview with

533
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,016
A guy

534
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,552
Named Mike zullo

535
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,880
Okay so is a former Detective

536
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,184
A for what

537
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,744
Yes so he come back for one last job

538
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,024
Is he

539
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,608
Two or three days away from retirement please give me something

540
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:03,008
Okay he's currently used car dealer as far as I can tell that's what I found in my flight

541
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,800
Research

542
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:08,128
I don't care too much about Mike zullo

543
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:12,992
Alright care about more is that he is

544
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,016
An employee

545
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:14,784
Informer

546
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,552
Former employee

547
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,320
Because he's not out of

548
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,344
Anymore

549
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,648
Sheriff Joe Arpaio

550
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,952
He was a member of his

551
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,976
Posse

552
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:28,352
And now I think it is time that we start to deal a tiny bit with Joe Arpaio

553
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,400
Racist

554
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,168
Garbage

555
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:31,936
Pile of

556
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,960
Human f***

557
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:41,152
Earlier when I said when you look at him he's way worse than even went huge

558
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:45,248
Just said I did not know

559
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,296
Everything I know about it

560
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,600
So we're going to get to it and

561
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,624
Lilo is going

562
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,440
To make the argument

563
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,000
Can get much worse

564
00:30:56,256 --> 00:31:00,608
But you think the devil can't go lower but there we go the devil also

565
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:05,216
You know cheats of cards come on

566
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,056
So you always shoot

567
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,128
Get to

568
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,920
Zulos point

569
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:14,944
Which is basically

570
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,224
That when

571
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,784
Joe Arpaio was being

572
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:19,808
Tried

573
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:21,856
Court

574
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:22,880
For now

575
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,928
Making the necessary changes

576
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,952
Vetta judge

577
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:26,976
Insisted that he make

578
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:30,304
Based on findings that they had of racial discrimination

579
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,584
In the Maricopa

580
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,984
County police force

581
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,776
Default

582
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,824
Him to follow the law

583
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,384
X 2080

584
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,456
2010's

585
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,736
This is a severe problem

586
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,040
He was held in

587
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,064
Contempt of court

588
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,368
Arrested

589
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:59,488
What should have happened right in this court case

590
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,304
I don't like

591
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,096
So I don't want to remove it

592
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:10,752
Yeah exactly the argument

593
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,776
That he was being

594
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:13,824
Because being

595
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,872
Surveilled upon and wiretap

596
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:16,896
During

597
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,200
That investigation and we'll deal with that in the moment

598
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,736
I want to deal with first

599
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,296
Cuz I want to give an accurate picture of

600
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,832
Sheriff Joe Arpaio

601
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,136
Let's get down to it

602
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,160
I have

603
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,952
Pages

604
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,720
Subway

605
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,328
Where any one of these

606
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,864
Is disqualifying

607
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,912
So get ready

608
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,216
Does he say grandpa

609
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:41,984
No

610
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,336
Maricopa County in Arizona

611
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,944
Joe Arpaio set up a tent city

612
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,528
The houses inmates have not believed that they deserve to be inside

613
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:57,344
Great Arpaio literally describe the tent city as a

614
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,232
I like his willingness to embrace

615
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,768
Does monstrosity like

616
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,328
Didn't even bother to call it

617
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,888
The different he's like if I could burn you

618
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,936
I would I would totally do that

619
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:18,336
Speaking of burning these inmates please don't say anymore after

620
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:22,688
On July 2011 temperatures in Phoenix

621
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,968
18 degrees Fahrenheit

622
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:26,784
Arpaio measured the temperature inside

623
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,832
As 145 degrees

624
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,416
Some inmates complained that their fans near their beds were not working

625
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,720
From the Heat

626
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:39,840
During the summer of 2003 when outside temperatures exceeded 110 degrees Fahrenheit

627
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,864
Arpaio

628
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,888
Complaining inmate

629
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,680
Hit 120° in Iraq

630
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,960
The soldiers are living in tents

631
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,240
And they didn't commit any crime

632
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,520
So shut your mouth

633
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,056
Which is

634
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,616
Horrible

635
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,992
How do you not have any f

636
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:57,760
Empathy for another

637
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:04,160
The human being in 1997 Amnesty International said arpaio's Tent City Jail is not a quote

638
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,208
Humane alternative to housing

639
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,256
Inmates in suitable jail facility

640
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:14,656
People get mad when you leave a dog in a f****** car and this dude is little

641
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,192
Really burning people alive in

642
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:16,960
In the desert

643
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,008
Tent city is criticized

644
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,544
Is contending with their RV

645
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,848
The human and constitutional rights

646
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,872
Implicit in it

647
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:27,200
Formation

648
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,480
Yep you at

649
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,016
Do that

650
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:34,368
His argument is that they're criminals

651
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,136
Who cares

652
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:40,000
Committed crimes really bad argument

653
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:45,376
One of our public relations actions was a requirement that inmates wear pink underwear

654
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:48,192
In order to prevent it's fact by the released inmates

655
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,472
Which of the stupid rationale

656
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:54,592
He claimed the most harmless thing I've ever heard anybody

657
00:34:55,104 --> 00:35:00,480
He claims that he has saved the county $70,000 in the first year this rule was in effect

658
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,064
King County

659
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:12,512
Subsequently started to sell customized with a Maricopa County Sheriff's logo

660
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,536
Joe on them

661
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:16,352
As a fundraiser for Sheriff's posse Association

662
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:22,752
What's the spike Arpaio declined to provide

663
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,520
For the money

664
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:26,336
He basically use it as a promotional tool

665
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,224
So so it's so

666
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,272
With his financial

667
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,552
We're not even

668
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:38,112
Close

669
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:44,768
M2010 Arpaio put together an arms illegal immigration policy to help enforce immigration laws

670
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:47,328
Posse Posse

671
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,352
You do it gets worse

672
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,632
This Posse included

673
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:52,704
Steven Seagal and Lou Ferrigno

674
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,728
No that's better

675
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,848
I know that

676
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,872
That Posse

677
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,640
Is

678
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,432
Immune to ninja

679
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:05,504
That's the first thing we know about that party

680
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,528
Building

681
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,064
And then if

682
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,344
Anybody gets

683
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,112
Really out of

684
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,184
Control

685
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,280
He's a big green guy

686
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,072
You would not like me if yours

687
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,888
Especially not if you're a God

688
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,192
Zebra

689
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,240
Close to the tip of the iceberg

690
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:32,896
Routinely abused detainees at Maricopa County Jail

691
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,456
Fruit leather

692
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,480
Contaminated food

693
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,552
Is to endanger their health

694
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,576
Denying them care for

695
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,600
For serious Medical

696
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,392
Mental health needs

697
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,416
And keeping The Pact

698
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:48,000
Sardines in holding cells for days

699
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:52,096
Now that's before they've been middle Medieval ages what is funky

700
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,656
Happening before they were charged

701
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,728
That's before they were charged for the f****** Christ

702
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:00,032
Pretrial detainees

703
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,080
That is probably true

704
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,360
People

705
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:09,760
No you should treat you awake

706
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:14,112
Human and constitutional rights

707
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,136
Yeah

708
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,464
That should have taken like toy

709
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,232
20 seconds

710
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:24,096
Under Arpaio the Maricopa County Jail multiple times

711
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:27,680
In September 2008 the National Committee on Correctional Healthcare

712
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,752
Terminated the accreditation of Maricopa County Sheriff's Office

713
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:34,080
Does jail for failure to maintain compliance with national standards

714
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,640
Information about such compliance

715
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,408
What does that mean

716
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,968
They lied

717
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:46,112
Accreditation does that mean people aren't allowed to be supported by these Medical Association

718
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,904
They're in charge of sort of

719
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,464
Keeping track of making sure that jails

720
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,608
They just

721
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,144
I think

722
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,544
That's bad I love though I love their life-saving

723
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,896
Enforcement capabilities but they do have

724
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:09,920
Like

725
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,504
Waving the finger

726
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,904
Can get a f*** face to go to a Goddamn pizza restaurant human being

727
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,184
Other human beings

728
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,768
Liberals are

729
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:31,680
Maricopa County

730
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:37,312
Are unconstitutional

731
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
And safety of prison

732
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:40,896
But these are different

733
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,664
OK Google

734
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:44,224
Arpaio

735
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,504
Is places of punishment

736
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,040
The inhabitants are Criminal

737
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:51,136
Although most inmates have not been convicted of a crime and are awaiting trial

738
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,416
F***

739
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,440
Q

740
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,232
What the f***

741
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,256
It gets worse

742
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,048
Where is Egypt worth

743
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:01,376
It gets worse

744
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,168
Ted Bundy was honest

745
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:03,936
About his

746
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,472
Monstrosity

747
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,264
Like I would much rather

748
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,568
Like he's a sociopath

749
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,872
But still allowed to roam the streets like you just

750
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,640
Figure it out

751
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,664
How to parking

752
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,968
Turn it into a money you like

753
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,248
Turn

00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,296
Ted Bundy into a job

755
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:22,624
That's what he did was re-elected like four times

756
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:26,720
Arizona's a f****** garbage

757
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,488
That's fair

758
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,536
Here here here's another one

759
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,864
Under Arpaio the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office

760
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,656
May have been properly cleared

761
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:38,240
Or reported it solved as many as 75% of

762
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,288
Without a rest or proper investigation

763
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,080
How's that grab you

764
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:48,992
During a three-year period ending in 2007 more than 400 sex crimes reported to arpaio's office

765
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:55,904
No while providing police services for El Mirage Arizona

766
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:02,304
The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office at least 32 reported child molestation

767
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,680
Jesus f*** why

768
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,472
Menu

769
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:12,032
Many of the children at home

770
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,056
We're illegal

771
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,384
I don't care how do you

772
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,152
Not

773
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:17,920
Care about that

774
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:28,160
Hey 1999 undercover Maricopa County Sheriff's Office deputies arrested

775
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,696
Then 18 years old

776
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:32,768
And charged him with plotting to kill Arpaio with a pipe bomb

777
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,560
A local television station

778
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:37,376
I've been tipped off to the arrest by the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office

779
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,424
A broadcast

780
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:43,520
The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office

781
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:49,920
And everything else

782
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,200
It's not going to bother me

783
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:56,832
After spending four years in jail awaiting trial for years awaiting trial

784
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:00,672
He was about to sign a plea deal that would have sent to prison for 20 years

785
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,208
Although you maintain

786
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,000
He was initially unwilling to

787
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,024
Take a chance on being

788
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,048
To even longer

789
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,400
If you were convicted

790
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,680
However

791
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:17,824
The former head of undercover investigations for the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office

792
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,872
Based on his review of the case

793
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,640
He felt that

794
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:25,504
Although entrapment is all but impossible to prove in most jurisdictions

795
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,552
Civil attorneys eventually discovered that

796
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,088
The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office

797
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,368

Bought the bomparts themselves what

799
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,976
Then convince the vale to build it

800
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,792
Even though he was not predisposed to commit such a crime

801
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,072
On July 9th

802
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,608
22000

803
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:43,680
Maricopa County superior court

804
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:46,496
Finding that the bomb plot was an elaborate publicity stunt

805
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,544
The Boost arpaio's re-election bid

806
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,895
Siri

807
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:57,759
In 2004 Seville argued Arpaio and the Maricopa County

808
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,319
Maricopa County

809

Seeking 10 billion dollars in Damages

810
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:08,767
Joe Arpaio

811
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:11,839
In 2008 the suit was settled with Maricopa County paying

812
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:13,887
Six billion dollar

813
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,423
Little bit less

814
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:18,751
You should have gotten but dollars

815
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:19,519
Yeah

816
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,311
I am

817
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,335
I like this

818
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,919
I am against the death penalty

819
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:29,503
But your pale should be f****** killed

820
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:34,111
He's only there's only one reason for the

821
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:40,767
Cheats for f****** monsters like him he's abused the public trust to such an

822
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,583
F******

823
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,631
Like there's no other

824
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:48,191
Hey Jordan.

825
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,215
No

826
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,495
He's already dead

827
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:56,127
This is the producer

828
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:58,431
Justice department

829
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,223
Unconstitutional

830
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:03,039
Tino's for detention and arrest

831
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:05,855
And retaliate retaliating against critics

832
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:10,463
In a report to justice department concluded that Arpaio oversaw quote the worst

833
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:13,023
Profiling in US history

834
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,559
It 2016

835
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,607
That's f****** hard to do

836
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,423
After after all Arjun

837
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:22,239
If you get labeled with that

838
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,799
In 2015 Arpaio was charged with

839
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,847
Contempt of court for failing to implement a court

840
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,127
Required changes

841
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,431
I to his police force regarding ramp

842
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,455
Social profile

843
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,759
He was also found to have destroyed evidence

844
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,063
Course he did

845
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,647
But he's also publicly promoted the Obama birther

846
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,415
Repeat

847
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:43,231
Up to December last year 2016

848
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:43,999
He was quote

849
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,535
Investigate the birth certificate

850
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,815
And he erroneously claimed

851
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,583
2009

852
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,631
Points of forgery Obama's birthday

853
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,167
So

854
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,263
A2000

855
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,287
Slitting my f******

856
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:03,199
In 2008 win Phoenix mayor Phil Gordon called the federal investigation into a federal investigation

857
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,991
Immigration

858
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:05,759
My tactic

859
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,295
Arpaio's office respond

860
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:10,111
By demanding the mayor's emails and phone logs

861
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:14,207
Arpaio also had his critic Maricopa County Supervisor John

862
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:16,511
Republican arrested

863
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,791
Suspicion of failing

864
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:18,815
To properly discuss

865
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:19,839
This was business

866
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:23,423
Stapley agreed to a 3.5 million settlement

867
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,471
Is a lawsuit against Arpaio

868
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,007
Thomas

869
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:27,775
Beaver Falls

870
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,591
Multiple times

871
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,383
A suit for it and lost

872
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,431
He's cost

873
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,199
Tri-County

874
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,247
So many millions of dollars

875
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,551
Because of these illegal tactic

876
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:40,575
He's undergone

877
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,855
And he was re-elected

878
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:46,719
4 * has like a runoff election twice

879
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,559
It failed both.

880
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,631
Really yeah

881
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:59,007
How could this country have elected Trump

882
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:02,079
Deeply entrenched

883
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,103
I like

884
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,383
Illegal

885
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,175
Operation

886
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,199
This pile of s***

887
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:10,015
Yeah so

888
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,831
Awful but it's not in jail

889
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,623
Cuz he argues that he gets results

890
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,159
How is he

891
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,951
Wow you committed all the crimes

892
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:18,975
He might be soon

893
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,511
He should be dead

894
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,279
He already

895
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,071
His argument is that he is

896
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:28,959
Gruff but he gets results but that's not an argument in a case of law

897
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:32,287
In 1998

898
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,335
You're under arrest for terrorism

899
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,615
Excuse me

900
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,151
I believe I get results

901
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:44,575
The commission to study by Arizona State University criminal justice professor

902
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,623
Examine recidivism

903
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,415
Spaced on conditions of

904
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,951
Confinement so basically like

905
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:50,975
Beforehand

906
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,279
Comeback

907
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,559
It's supposed to be before him

908
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,327
After him

909
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:03,007
Recidivism rates under Arpaio to those of his predecessor

910
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,031
The study found

911
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:10,431
There's no significant difference observed between those offenders released in 1989 to 9

912
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:14,527
Released in 1994 to 1995

913
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:15,295
A criminal

914
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,319
A monster

915
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,111
And it's offensive I get results

916
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:22,975
F******

917
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,023
How can you help

918
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:25,791
Could you not

919
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,071
Prosecute

920
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,631
Like there's no

921
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,911
That you could not

922
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:33,471
Put him in jail forever and ever and ever

923
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:39,871
All the lives by rhino

924
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:42,175
In reincarnation or ghost

925
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,711

Determined

936
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,007
We're talking to a f***

937
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:09,823
He's an evil man

938
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,127
Here's the situation

939
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,919
There's a lot of really sucked up stuff

940
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,967
So you can find out about the history of

941
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,991
Joe Arpaio

942
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,783
Maricopa County

943
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,599
Sheriff's Association

944
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,159
F****** bullet point list of

945
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,439
Absolute

946
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:33,375
Upon reflection man Jordan talked it over and we've decided that a lot of the stuff is not

947
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:35,679
For us

948
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,215
Broadcast

949
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,007
I think

950
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:39,775
I think you should

951
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,311
On your own

952
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,871
In a comfortable place

953
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,407
Because I'm listening to it

954
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,431
In a row

955
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,199
Is

956
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,991
Overwhelming

957
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,015
So

958
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:57,183
Place to start you can find about

959
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,975
Want to go you can find out more about

960
00:47:59,231 --> 00:47:59,743
The depth

961
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:02,047
Of the truly irresponsible

962
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:02,815
Evil

963
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,095
Police work that

964
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,191
Joe Arpaio presided over

965
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:08,959
Everyone

966
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:10,495
Convicted in the Nuremberg

967
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,031
I genuinely

968
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,823
I genuinely believe that

969
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:19,199
Is the sort of

970
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:19,967
Will be here

971
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:24,063
Are we going to give a moment of silence

972
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,391
Let's get it

973
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,159
We will wait

974
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:28,927
4 second

975
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:33,023
Right back at you like tapping my foot waiting

976
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:38,143
Here we go we get into now this interview with Mike zullo

977
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,215
One of the higher-ups

978
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,495
To the Maricopa County

979
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,519
Former higher-ups

980
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,287
Does it work

981
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,847
Alex does a lot of vamping

982
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,639
Accomplice to every single thing

983
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,407
Image of iPad

984
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:56,575
Implicitly sign

985
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,879
And off by supporting him

986
00:48:59,135 --> 00:48:59,903
Supporting him to this day

987
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:02,463
Also Alex does a lot of sort of

988
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:03,999
Opening present

989
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:04,767
Temptation before

990
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:05,791
He gets to the interview

991
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:06,815
Some play couple quotes

992
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:18,847
The documents the surveillance arpaio's house is office all of us fight on

993
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,319
Serving

994
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:30,367
Decorated Sheriff Patriot

995
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:36,511
Monsters

996
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,279
Racist

997
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,863
Yours truly

998
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:43,935
Isn't that just special

999
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:47,263
Not particularly

1000
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:52,639
Nope

1001
00:49:53,919 --> 00:50:00,063
Shipping about the paper

1002
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,367
So the argument that make

1003
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,415
That the black

1004
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:11,071
Tommy's

1005
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:17,983
So the argument that he's making there is that Arpaio was

1006
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,287
Spy.

1007
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,567
His trial

1008
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:22,591
This is

1009
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,639
Absolute Auto nonsense

1010
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:28,223
The secondary argument that he's making is this

1011
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:29,759
To come out with all of these

1012
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,575
All these people

1013
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:34,111
One of them

1014
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:34,879
It's permission in Paw

1015
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:41,791
And get the Blacklist RJ will get a little bit

1016
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:43,071
Further down the line

1017
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:46,911
Make sure

1018
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:49,983
In a second but let's get through his his introduction

1019
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,519
This is where he

1020
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,287
Connect

1021
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:54,847
What's going on

1022
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,639
The Arpaio spying

1023
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,407
Situation

1024
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:59,455
To what we're going to be talking about later

1025
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,735
The bigger case

1026
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:01,759
That involves Trump

1027
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,039
Involves Alex

1028
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:06,623
It's the guy named Dennis Montgomery who is that nsa's CIA

1029
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:09,695
Who is much bigger than Snowden

1030
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:13,023
I swear to God I have you seen the movies

1031
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:18,399
Yeah have you seen any movie where somebody has a giant pinboard

1032
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:21,215
Filled with string connecting one thing to another

1033
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:24,799
Because it's on your goddamn wall

1034
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:27,871
This one's real simple though it's not out

1035
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,175
I assure you this is not that hard

1036
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:32,223
Line of string

1037
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,759
That's all we needed for this basic

1038
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,111
They ignored it

1039
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:44,511
Even harder because he had the Whistleblower that had all this information

1040
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:45,791
So

1041
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:50,655
Connect everything there this whistleblower and question is this guy named Dennis monkey

1042
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,703
Janet Montgomery

1043
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:55,263
Would you like backstory on him now or later

1044
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,567
Let's go with half an hour

1045
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,431
Okay here's a fun one

1046
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:08,831
Janice Montgomery was a guy who he sounded a video compression noise filtering business called

1047
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,111
Etrepid Technologies

1048
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,135
A video

1049
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,415
Compression noise filter

1050
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,975
Like in 1998

1051
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:15,999
Oh okay

1052
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,279
Business started out as

1053
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,047
Tool for the cassette

1054
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,863
Do you know industry but eventually they sought out government

1055
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,935
In 2014

1056
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:26,751
Montgomery was revealed to be working as a confidential in

1057
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,543
Informant for Sheriff Joe Arpaio

1058
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:29,567
He claimed

1059
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,103
When he was Contracting

1060
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,383
For the CIA through the

1061
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,663
Etrepid Technologies

1062
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:34,943
The government contract

1063
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:35,711
Cuz he was doing

1064
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:36,735
Your pain

1065
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:37,503
Approved

1066
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,039
Conspiracy against Arpaio

1067
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,063
Basically that the

1068
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,111
Department of justice under Eric Holder

1069
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,135
Was working

1070
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,415
With the judge

1071
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:45,695
McKay's

1072
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,719
Unopposed

1073
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,511
Racial profiling case

1074
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:50,303
Together

1075
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,327
I had the doctor

1076
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,399
Isn't that just called

1077
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,167
Get like doing

1078
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,727
Doing the law in this case it's conspiracy

1079
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:58,751
Well I mean

1080
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,799
Conspiracy

1081
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,591
Is it just like

1082
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:07,455
But I guess I mean

1083
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,223
You can't man

1084
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,015
They were otherwise

1085
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,063
Conspiracy

1086
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,343
Wiretap

1087
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:20,255
That which the judge

1088
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:24,095
I also don't

1089
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:28,191
All my cards on the table

1090
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:32,031
I don't think it was also

1091
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:38,431
We know how bad do Joe Arpaio is

1092
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:42,271
Publicity stunt in this 2004 claim that Montgomery made

1093
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:48,415
As the result of Montgomery's investigation is quote

1094
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,183
Junk

1095
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:52,767
So even our pale things

1096
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,303
Yep

1097
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,655
Come on Alex Jones

1098
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:01,471
Is a shadowy figure

1099
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,519
Alright so he's a vampire

1100
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:05,823
Mark Mike zullo

1101
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,615
Who is arpaio's

1102
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,407
Who's arpaia

1103
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,455
Now cartel

1104
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:14,271
Is

1105
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:16,831
We're leaving up

1106
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,367
Such an elaborate

1107
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,903
And super-long

1108
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:23,743
At least on Scream

1109
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:26,303
The whole introduction I'm looking awkwardly

1110
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,839
Jerome corsi

1111
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:34,495
Looking uncomfortable

1112
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,823
Jerome corsi is hanging out

1113
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,431
Pacing back and forth

1114
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,199
Things up

1115
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:45,503
Between zullo at Alex

1116
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:47,039
Do an interview

1117
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,367
He is there as like a third wheel

1118
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,903
Okay

1119
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:57,279
This point Alex drop the information that shows

1120
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,047
He doesn't have

1121
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,631
About the situation that he's going to be

1122
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,527
They're the ones that got the documents

1123
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,831
Ohio

1124
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:31,071
Interview

1125
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:41,055
He doesn't know what to talk about unless this information is sitting right in front of them

1126
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:43,103
Cuz he doesn't know the situation

1127
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,127
Of course

1128
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:49,247
He only knows if he's reading Awesome piece paper wet meanwhile he yells bodies teleprompter free

1129
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,527
You don't know the story

1130
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,551
He only knows

1131
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,343
Staff

1132
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:56,159
Is feeding him information

1133
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,695
Key Alex

1134
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,975
I had published

1135
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:03,327
List of people's phone numbers and addresses

1136
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,863
This Montgomery

1137
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,679
Because Dennis Montgomery

1138
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,447
I just did

1139
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:11,263
Oh well let's recap what happened yesterday

1140
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:15,103
+ 6

1141
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,127
Being spied on

1142
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,015
The group of documents

1143
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:24,831
That Dennis Montgomery has revealed

1144
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:26,623
But he hasn't

1145
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,415
The nude

1146
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:36,607
Going on

1147
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:38,399
And Trump is being f****** railroaded

1148
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,167
It's good

1149
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,727
This

1150
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:45,055
I wish you was on a railroad

1151
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:47,359
Twisting their Pencil Thin Mustache

1152
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,431
What

1153
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:53,759
Once again I want to use this next clip

1154
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,551
Just established

1155
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,343
That Alex is

1156
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,367
Specifically

1157
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,391
Talkin about

1158
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,463
And Arpaio

1159
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:04,767
As being the exact same thing

1160
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:05,535
What about

1161
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,839
In the mix

1162
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:10,143
I think

1163
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:12,703
Second part of the series

1164
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:15,007
Publix.com

1165
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:20,639
Bombshell discovery shows Target

1166
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,175
Project

1167
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:24,735
Here's a Larry klayman article

1168
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:39,071
Masturbate

1169
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:43,679
With the 47 hard drives over 60

1170
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:46,751
Ma

1171
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,287
Talking about Snowden

1172
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:51,871
Necessary

1173
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:58,271
Also known as hard drives

1174
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:02,111
Three-by-five floppies he's got a mountain of a

1175
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:06,207
They claim it's actually 600 million documents

1176
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:09,535
Aleksandra.

1177
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:14,399
The issue is that no one really knows what's onto them or if they're even real

1178
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,167
Could you

1179
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:18,495
Impossible

1180
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:23,103
Even a couple years lead-time couldn't process 600 million.

1181
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:27,711
McDonald's

1182
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:30,015
Can sell 99 billion

1183
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,879
Alex is proof

1184
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:36,415
But all this is real

1185
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:40,767
Yeah it is that his phone number and his old phone number is

1186
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:41,791
Along with

1187
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,815
Donald Trump

1188
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,863
Phone numbers which again we have

1189
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,911
Suspicions whether he actually knows or not

1190
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:51,775
Here's a clip of him providing literally the only evidence

1191
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:52,799
At any point

1192
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,335
This stuff

1193
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,103
Is true

1194
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:58,943
Super stoked bleached show Obama

1195
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,991
Right on Trump

1196
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,015
Alex Jones

1197
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,551
Sheriff Arpaio

1198
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:10,975
The second-biggest website in the world.

1199
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,679
Showtime

1200
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:22,495
Nothing on this

1201
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,591
Respond

1202
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,639
These phone numbers

1203
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:33,247
Are the phone numbers to private

1204
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,039
Apartment at Mar-A-Lago

1205
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:37,855
These are the numbers

1206
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:41,439
Miles cell phone number nobody had that's real wild private office

1207
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:43,743
Numbers

1208
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:46,559
Real

1209
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:51,167
Around saying

1210
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:00,127
This phone numbers that nobody could know

1211
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:02,175
Chew it like

1212
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:04,991
It's dumb why would you even have an office phone

1213
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,807
To know your office phone number

1214
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:11,135
Hit the nail right on the head a lot of the stuff is

1215
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,927
Conceivably public information

1216
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:17,023
But even Alex Jones cell phone number again

1217
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:23,423
See I could find it I guarantee that if I had a tiny bit of hacking ability

1218
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:26,751
I could find his phone number you can find anybody's private information

1219
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:30,847
Really easily. All of the places that you would have dropped it

1220
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:35,967
If you ever went to college all that information is really easily accessible

1221
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:39,295
Like a bunch of your your addresses

1222
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:40,319
Community College

1223
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,855
Wichita

1224
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:42,623
Two cell phones

1225
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:49,023
But I mean a lot of a lot of the Community College

1226
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,303
I don't think real

1227
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,327
I don't think cell phones are around

1228
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,375
Be that as it may

1229
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:57,727
Sing is a lot of these things you end up filing information places

1230
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,007
A lot of your private

1231
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:01,311
Information is much more accessible than people think

1232
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,127
The news reports about this

1233
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:04,895
We're just

1234
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:07,455
Mid-level basic

1235
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,223
Hacking

1236
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:09,759
Individual

1237
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:10,527
What's

1238
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:16,159
Not even the most evolved hackers are able to find tons and tons of private information about people

1239
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:19,231
It is not illegal

1240
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,047
Courtesy call

1241
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,071
On your cell phone

1242
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:25,119
Yeah they're just telling your number

1243
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:27,935
Like if you ever gotten a call on your cell phone

1244
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:30,495
Holding you that's because somebody told you

1245
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:33,311
You can easily yeah all that information is

1246
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,335
Super easy to find

1247
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:36,895
What is proof of an essay

1248
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,175
CIA database

1249
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,711
Is is cockamamie

1250
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,479
It's ludicrous

1251
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:42,783
AT&T

1252
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,575
Yeah absolutely and I mean

1253
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:47,647
If we really want to get down to the wood like the bottom of it

1254
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:48,671
I'm against that

1255
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,975
I don't like the idea people are selling information

1256
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:52,511
But that's

1257
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,791
Contact that's not what I was

1258
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,559
I was talking about

1259
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:57,119
Anyway

1260
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,935
It's not illegal to sell all of your information

1261
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:06,591
So here we go here we go Alex is again reinforcing his own

1262
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:07,871
Sort of narrative

1263
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:08,895
But doing it in

1264
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,223
I've got to get this is what she says

1265
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,247
In terms of like

1266
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,527
We have the proof

1267
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:20,671
Headlines

1268
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:27,071
You can show us headlines all day long with Ant-Man edited in so right before he says that

1269
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:31,423
We have all the proof and then he says we have all the headlines

1270
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,519
You look like a f******

1271
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:39,871
To the actual zullo interview now

1272
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:42,943
Going to lay out a story

1273
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,735
That unfortunately

1274
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:46,527
As he tells the story

1275
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,343
You start to get the pictures

1276
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,623
He actually doesn't

1277
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:53,439
It's really unfortunate

1278
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:57,023
The title that I gave this

1279
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,047
They don't know what

1280
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,071
To do with the information

1281
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:05,727
We really don't know what is going on

1282
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,775
We know that we made

1283
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:09,055
Every endeavor

1284
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,079
To bring

1285
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:13,919
Mister Montgomery to Federal authorities

1286
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,711
Like I said earlier

1287
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:19,551
We contacted Larry klayman for his assistance

1288
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:23,903
And under the direction of Sheriff Arpaio we brought Mr Montgomery to

1289
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,183
Judge Royce Lamberth

1290
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:31,583
We used to be the head of the fisa Courts

1291
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:36,191
And then we got in there

1292
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:37,727
The Dilemma was

1293
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,543
Is where do we go

1294
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,847
Mister Montgomery

1295
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,663
During his tenure as a contractor

1296
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:50,783
Weather in Michigan

1297
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:53,087
Executed a search warrant on his phone

1298
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:55,647
Fabricated affidavits to a judge

1299
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:58,719
And that was all their doubt in trial

1300
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:04,095
I can find no evidence.

1301
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,887
A problem for us

1302
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:12,799
Because the only other place we could have gone to it that time would have been the Department of Justice and I believe at that time it was still Eric Holder

1303
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:14,079
That was a problem

1304
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,615
So here's why it's a

1305
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:16,383
The problem for the

1306
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,151
Because

1307
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:17,919
Not

1308
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:18,687
Nothing no

1309
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:22,527
Allegedly all of this 600 million documents

1310
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,319
Is confidential information

1311
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:30,719
They can't just go to a lawyer

1312
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:34,303
He stole all this allegedly from the NSA

1313
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,119
It is it is a problem

1314
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:37,887
Get to the

1315
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:39,423
YouTube Justice when holder is

1316
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:41,215
Willing to press

1317
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:42,751
But also

1318
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:48,639
This guy Mike zullo and the next minute we're going to be dealing with this guy who keeps coming up Larry klayman

1319
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:49,919
The two of them

1320
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:52,735
Can't know anything about what's on those dock

1321
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:56,063
And if they do they've committed a crime

1322
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,879
Admit that they know anything on it

1323
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:01,439
Their Evonne are

1324
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,719
Committed

1325
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:04,767
Is a pickle

1326
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:10,143
That's really tough

1327
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:13,215
Have to believe that I don't

1328
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:14,495
Nesterly think that there

1329
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:15,263
They're lying

1330
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,799
They haven't looked at any of it

1331
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:21,151
All know I think all they're going on

1332
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:21,919
Is what

1333
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:24,991
Has told them

1334
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,831
They are telling Alex

1335
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:32,159
What Dennis Montgomery has told them they say

1336
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:35,743
Sandra playing a big game of telephone

1337
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:40,863
That's the Alex had on the other day

1338
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,423
Like third hand knowledge of

1339
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,591
That where Michelle Obama says

1340
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:55,967
Really wish that were true

1341
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,343
And Report

1342
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:02,623
Third hand

1343
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:04,671
And arrow

1344
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,463
That's

1345
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:09,279
That's the problem for the

1346
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:11,071
Cuz they

1347
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,095
Can't make an Argy

1348
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:16,959
All they can do is speculate about what possibly is in this information

1349
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:18,239
Based on what

1350
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:20,031
Does Montgomery has told them

1351
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:23,103
So they're doing everything Alex Jones love

1352
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:28,991
His investigation to try and help Joe Arpaio

1353
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:30,783
I was called

1354
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:32,575
By Joe Arpaio himself

1355
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,111
So

1356
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,135
That's one piece

1357
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:36,671
Can't wait to f***

1358
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:45,887
Nitrite doing it now we need we need to let it fails

1359
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:49,983
So at this point zullo is going to explain what happened

1360
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,007
Are they took

1361
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:53,567
The information to the FBI I'll let him spell it

1362
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:57,663
Larry klayman was successful in persuading mr. Montgomery

1363
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:59,455
To talk to the FBI

1364
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,223
Which he did

1365
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,063
With

1366
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:04,831
Larry

1367
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,647
Is Mr Montgomery brought in

1368
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:10,207
A sampling of some documentation

1369
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:18,655
Dayton what is known as production immunity

1370
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:19,679
Again

1371
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:21,727
This is based on Larry excuse me

1372
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:23,775
Montgomery

1373
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,823
They wouldn't have done that though

1374
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:26,591
If he is

1375
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,615
Sonos

1376
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:34,015
Vista 47 hard drives and 600 million documents

1377
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:39,903
Goodbye

1378
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:44,511
What's your name

1379
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:46,815
Check out

1380
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:50,911
They let him and then he just has been living his life

1381
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,447
I also want to make this clear

1382
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,471
Does Montgomery

1383
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,495
At this point

1384
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:55,519
In 2017

1385
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:57,567
Is like 65 years old

1386
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,871
He's an old dude he's not

1387
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:01,407
Edward Snowden

1388
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:03,711
He's young and like

1389
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:06,527
It's a fun whistleblower image

1390
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:08,575
Nobody's a write-in citizen 60

1391
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:15,231
No not at all

1392
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:17,023
It's like you get in your head this idea cuz

1393
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,815
Snowden keeps coming up that he's like

1394
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:20,863
Some able-bodied

1395
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,959
YouTube

1396
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:30,847
Usually aren't a seven-year-old dude that he actually

1397
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:35,455
Maybe we can talk all the s*** we want but I do believe this guy actually does have some hacking ability

1398
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:38,271
That's only because

1399
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,807
Occam's razor tells me he

1400
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:42,111
In order to fraudulent

1401
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:43,391
Lee create the documents

1402
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,415
That have been sent

1403
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:45,183
Infowars

1404
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:51,071
Alright I'll spell that out a little bit later as we go along

1405
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:52,351
Bulshit

1406
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:55,679
Let's talk a little bit more

1407
01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:01,055
And he brought in I believe it was like six hundred million records

1408
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:04,639
He provided them that information some time goes by

1409
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:09,247
And they called him back and they gave him testimonial immunity

1410
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:11,807
47 hard drive

1411
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:13,599
Pictures of information

1412
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,607
Not necessarily

1413
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:27,679
Again

1414
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:29,471
Comes back to you like a lot of that stuff is

1415
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:31,775
Fairly easy to find

1416
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,055
Google

1417
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:37,407
Some of it could be Googled someone I could just be

1418
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:45,343
Sixty-five-year-old a lot of people

1419
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:48,671
No you can't bring

1420
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,231
Only Google ads

1421
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,511
Everybody knows this

1422
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:56,863
At this point to another part

1423
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:59,423
Like it might have some play

1424
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:03,775
Did she ever going to be the most boring person to live

1425
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:08,127
No cuz they're on course he's still around midnight

1426
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:15,551
So he's going to get into this and it sounds scary but don't worry about it I'll be right back on the other side of the 620

1427
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:21,951
Let us find out where

1428
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:28,863
Personal information on a lot of the 150,000 people is absolutely

1429
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:31,935
Identify

1430
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,983
That were alleged to be there

1431
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:38,335
Because those bank accounts

1432
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:42,431
It is suspected that they are actually fraudulent transactions

1433
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:49,343
Had accounting it with I spect you too real estate gas and oil

1434
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:54,207
Stock plays

1435
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,767
Alex Azar

1436
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:00,351
Derivative

1437
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:01,631
Speculative

1438
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:02,655
Thing thing

1439
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:03,679
What is he

1440
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:04,703
Those are

1441
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:06,239
Sugar

1442
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,263
Futures

1443
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:11,615
I don't know

1444
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:15,967
Actually really unfortunate that they use those specific

1445
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:16,735
Because I can

1446
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:18,527
Trace back exactly what their talk

1447
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:21,087
FanDuel

1448
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:21,855
But Dan

1449
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:25,439
Find a little bit of an article from the news

1450
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,463
Association in

1451
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:28,511
Phoenix that was covering the trial

1452
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,119
Some evidence

1453
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:36,703
Suggesting that the informant Montgomery was investigating snow

1454
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:38,239
Who was the lawyer

1455
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,263
Who is

1456
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:41,567
The judge

1457
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,359
Joe Arpaio

1458
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:44,383
Discrimination

1459
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:47,199
Okay

1460
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:52,831
That Montgomery Tesla was being employed by Joe Arpaio to invest

1461
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:53,599
Navigate to Judd

1462
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:56,159
Which would be very early

1463
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:58,207
Really illegal

1464
01:11:58,975 --> 01:11:59,487
That

1465
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:02,559
That fits with

1466
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:05,631
Who is actively try

1467
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:09,727
Billions of dollars of lawsuits.

1468
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:11,007
Be filed because

1469
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:14,591
Of his dictator is behavior

1470
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:17,151
In any movie from

1471
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:22,271
The South or the movies

1472
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:26,623
Arpaio insisted he hadn't encouraged Montgomery

1473
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,647
Investigate the judge

1474
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:33,535
Instead Arpaio insisted the informant was investigating bank fraud

1475
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:36,351
And the judge was one of 150,000

1476
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,375
Alleged victims

1477
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:38,655
In Maricopa County

1478
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,959
Now that 150

1479
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:41,983
Because that's

1480
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:44,287
From the number

1481
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,079
That this guy just reference

1482
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:48,639
As the NSA CIA database

1483
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:51,711
Allegedly included Donald Trump

1484
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:52,735
And Alex Jones

1485
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:55,039
Do they live in Maricopa County

1486
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:59,391
So it seems like it's

1487
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,927
Possibility

1488
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:02,207
That that

1489
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:05,535
Their information

1490
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:06,815
Two different bullshittin

1491
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:07,839
Right

1492
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:09,631
Wow that's well

1493
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:10,911
We should resign

1494
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,959
I think that's it very important

1495
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:13,983
Climate changes

1496
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:16,799
Coming

1497
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,335
Keep on throwing your old bulshit

1498
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:20,639
Exactly

1499
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:23,967
So Arpaio

1500
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:27,039
Arpaio in Montgomery had this bank fraud thing

1501
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,063
That was cover

1502
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,599
For him invest

1503
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:31,135
Navigating this job

1504
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,415
There was trying to

1505
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,975
Racial profiling

1506
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:39,071
What is not actually invested in

1507
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,607
Striking him down

1508
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:41,887
He's hearing the case

1509
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:43,935
The prosecutors are more the issue

1510
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:45,471
But he's investigating

1511
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:46,751
He's investigating

1512
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:47,775
Can I get leverage over

1513
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:48,543
What have you

1514
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:53,919
That that fits with the kind of paranoid personality that we're dealing with because

1515
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:56,735
He doesn't believe that it is never

1516
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:59,039
He always believed this one guy

1517
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:03,647
All of the Power because he is a guy with all of this dump

1518
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:07,743
Actually tear him down

1519
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,279
In the same way that

1520
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:12,095
Trump is a dictator who can't

1521
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:13,119
Stand that

1522
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:16,191
He can't understand that laws are

1523
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:18,239
So that this part gets a little bit fun

1524
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:22,591
Judge snow order that the Sheriff's Office

1525
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:25,407
Turn over documents relating to Montgomery

1526
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,687
Montgomery's investigation

1527
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:27,967
These documents

1528
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:31,807
Include flowcharts conversations inclusion

1529
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:34,111
Between judge snow the doj

1530
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:36,415
And the law firm of Covington & Burling

1531
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,439
Which represents

1532
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,207
The plaintiff

1533
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:39,743
An Factory

1534
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:49,727
On Friday plaintiff's lawyer Stanley young questioned Arpaio repeatedly about Montgomery

1535
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:53,823
Montgomery was looking into judge snow

1536
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:55,871
And was personally interested in that Pro

1537
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:59,967
Both are intensified

1538
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:00,991
In this route

1539
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,551
They didn't ask Montgomery to make those

1540
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:05,855
Sheridan testified earlier in the hearing

1541
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:08,671
He told the detective and Sergeant working with Montgomery

1542
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:10,463
Not to pursue the investigation.

1543
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:11,743
Judge smell

1544
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:15,327
Article goes on to explain

1545
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:18,143
That I want to find exact part 2

1546
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:19,167
It's f****** hilarious

1547
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:24,543
Young

1548
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:26,847
Who was employed by Covington and Burlington

1549
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:34,271
This lawyer Young

1550
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:39,647
Who's employed by Covington Burlington showed Arpaio I had received a fax from Montgomery

1551
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:41,439
In November 2013

1552
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:43,999
With an early version of a timeline showing event

1553
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:46,303
In the Department of Justice is racial profiling

1554
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:49,375
Have a racial profiling case in judge Snow's Court

1555
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:52,191
As well as information about alleged wiretap again

1556
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,239
On the back of the FAQ

1557
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:56,799
Arpaio used a typewriter to make some

1558
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:58,591
Note

1559
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:00,127
Girls are we

1560
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:08,831
2013 uses a typewriter on are we traveling through time right now

1561
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:13,439
Handwritten notes about possible connections

1562
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:15,743
And hand wrote on the same

1563
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:17,535
F****** backup

1564
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:19,839
Do you hand write notes about

1565
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:21,631
About possible connections

1566
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:24,447
Between judge snow in the law firm Covington in Burlington

1567
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:25,471
Tiaras Berwyn

1568
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:30,847
Turkey

1569
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:36,223
These notes mentioned that former Arizona Senator John works with the law firm Covington & Burling

1570
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:37,503
There's no mention

1571
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:40,063
There's also mention

1572
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:42,367
Judge Snow's wife work there as well

1573
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,647
Which is not true

1574
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:44,927
The notes read

1575
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:47,999
Snow's snow confirmed by US Senate

1576
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:54,399
Keilon Judiciary Committee on June 26th 2008 Obama takes office January 2009

1577
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:56,191
Judge born 1959

1578
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:58,239
It's all crazy nonsense

1579
01:16:58,495 --> 01:16:59,007
Handwritten

1580
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:02,079
Scrawled on the back of this

1581
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:07,455
Making up X

1582
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,479
Together

1583
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:12,319
All of it is

1584
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:14,367
Desperately grasping at straws and

1585
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:17,439
And clearly Montgomery was not working on a bank fraud

1586
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:19,743
He was that was cover

1587
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:20,511
Did he use

1588
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:23,327
Note also noted quote

1589
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:27,423
Wilcox husband Envy 150,000

1590
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,447
That's the people

1591
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:29,727
That were allegedly being

1592
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:33,567
Being targeted as well as the number of Jehovah's Witness

1593
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:40,479
Wilcox refer to for Maricopa County Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox husband Earl

1594
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:42,527
Arpaio said it was a reference to him

1595
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:45,855
Can we just talk about how those of the whitest names in a row you just

1596
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:47,647
Earl and Mary Rose Wilcox

1597
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:53,535
Arpaio said it was a reference to him being among the 150,000 victims of bank fraud

1598
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:56,607
That note quote totally floored Earl Wilcox

1599
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:59,423
Who is seated in the courtroom and saw his own name in the doctor

1600
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:01,727
On a monitor in the gallery

1601
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,031
The wilcox's are vocal opponent

1602
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:06,335
The Sheriff's Office had

1603
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:08,639
To criminally indict Mary Rose Wilcox

1604
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:10,431
And she won a civil suit against

1605
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,455
The county for the

1606
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:12,223
Baseless charges

1607
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:15,039
So you get a sense of what's going on here

1608
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:17,599
Arpeggio is

1609
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:19,647
Acting illegally all the time

1610
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:21,439
Super all the time

1611
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:23,231
And

1612
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:24,511
Montgomery

1613
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:25,279
Was

1614
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:27,583
Confidential informant

1615
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:28,607
In quotes

1616
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:30,143
Who is actually doing

1617
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:32,703
Pretty illegal investigation

1618
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:33,471
On his behalf

1619
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:34,239
Yeah

1620
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:37,823
That's the flavor we've got right now

1621
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:39,615
Promise

1622
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,895
This is going to develop

1623
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:42,687
It's going to be a rose

1624
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:43,967
Blossom

1625
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:47,295
I would prefer

1626
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,319
A Bloomin Onion

1627
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,111
TGI Friday

1628
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:51,903
If you want to do a roast battle

1629
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:58,047
At this point the alleged 151000

1630
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:00,607
People who include Donald Trump Alex Jones

1631
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:02,399
Alex Jones is old

1632
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,447
And what have you

1633
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:06,239
His old cell phone number

1634
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:08,031
His mom's birthday

1635
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:09,567
Suns

1636
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,359
Bar mitzvah

1637
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:13,151
His great-grandmother's

1638
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,687
She's a slave I don't know

1639
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:19,039
Was used

1640
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,831
Years ago in this court case

1641
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:22,367
As alleged

1642
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,647
Information

1643
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:25,695
Of all people who live in Maricopa County

1644
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,231
For being

1645
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:28,511
Victims of bank fraud

1646
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:30,303
In order to cover for an investigation

1647
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:31,583
Into a federal judge

1648
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:33,119
So that's what's going on

1649
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:33,887
Alex

1650
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,167
Kemp

1651
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:38,495
It's possible he doesn't know that he did not know any of that

1652
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:43,359
All of those words you just said are more words than Alex Jones can understand

1653
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:48,735
Right you should have boiled baby Alex Jones

1654
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:54,367
Headline

1655
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,391
You just okay

1656
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:56,415
Here's what you did

1657
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:58,719
Alrighty you built

1658
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:01,023
Gathered

1659
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,303
Research

1660
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:03,071
Natalie

1661
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:05,375
You put a lot of work

1662
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,399
Time and

1663
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,167
Effort into

1664
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,703
All of that point

1665
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:09,727
To only one

1666
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:11,007
Possible conclusion

1667
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,543
You can then

1668
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:14,080
Establish is reality

1669
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:16,128
Even further

1670
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:19,712
Where do you think in that line

1671
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:21,504
Alex Jones Woodstock

1672
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:25,088
He wouldn't eat just part where you said

1673
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,880
Here's what we're going to do

1674
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:33,792
Do you know where he would stop as soon as any like indication that he's not totally right

1675
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:42,496
It's Mike zullo a game of getting into how they don't actually know anything

1676
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:46,848
I'm going to come down right now on the side of Alex

1677
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:47,616
Being duped

1678
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:48,640
Because he's an idiot

1679
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,432
I think that it's possible

1680
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:54,016
I think there's pretty strong and

1681
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:55,552
Later,

1682
01:20:56,064 --> 01:21:02,208
How many profit later he's going to talk about how great he talks to him and stuff like that

1683
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:05,280
I believe there is a vested interest

1684
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,304
Alex

1685
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,072
Defending him

1686
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:08,608
I don't know if

1687
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:11,936
If he's super willing to be

1688
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:14,496
Established

1689
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:18,080
So many times the Alex Jones is always super willing to

1690
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:20,896
Tell that's true

1691
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:28,064
Truly horrific

1692
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:30,880
Nightmarish pile of garbage human being

1693
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:33,952
To suck up to

1694
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:36,000
In the same way that he wants to suck up to

1695
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:37,280
To the f****** dudes

1696
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:41,376
Alleged Nazi Jesse James

1697
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:45,472
As well as alleged

1698
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:48,544
Since you got a lot of pain.

1699
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:52,896
We got a lot of ground to cover so I'm going to skip this next clip.

1700
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:55,968
Again we talked about it earlier

1701
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:57,248
Azula repeating

1702
01:21:57,504 --> 01:22:00,064
In different language that they don't really actually know what's

1703
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,112
They don't know what the

1704
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:06,208
80-in

1705
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:10,304
Next clip explaining

1706
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:12,864
Some of Dennis Montgomery

1707
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:13,632
Pedigree

1708
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:17,216
And where it comes from which is actually evidence of my

1709
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:18,496
That he is able

1710
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:20,032
To discover

1711
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:21,568
People private information

1712
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:22,592
Through techno

1713
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:24,384
He's able to employ on his own

1714
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,176
As opposed to Batman who just kind of

1715
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:26,944
Hangs out in the bush

1716
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:34,624
Well I I don't want to go into too much of what he said

1717
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:40,512
Actually mr. Montgomery in this is public

1718
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:44,608
Was a contractor who developed the

1719
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,888
Hacking software

1720
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,704
That could penetrate firewalls

1721
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,496
A computer's breach them

1722
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:54,592
Take over as the administrator and remain undetected for about an hour and a half

1723
01:22:55,104 --> 01:23:00,224
And download whatever they are

1724
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:08,416
Timeframe from the movie

1725
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:10,720
Jack location

1726
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:12,256
We can mask him for an hour and a half

1727
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:14,560
Real something that only lasts

1728
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:16,608
For an hour-and-a-half because it's a lie

1729
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:20,448
I think it might be alive

1730
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:22,752
But I do believe that he has some hacking

1731
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:25,056
I have done some research

1732
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:26,592
And figured out exactly

1733
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:27,872
What

1734
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:30,944
Dennis Montgomery was doing when he had government

1735
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:34,016
Contrast subtitle of this episode is

1736
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,296
So

1737
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,832
I told you about Dennis Montgomery

1738
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:41,952
He founded a company called etrepid technology

1739
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:44,256
Andy Montgomery Burns

1740
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:45,280
Thank you

1741
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:48,096
We're going to burn him

1742
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:50,912
So like I said it started out as like a

1743
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:52,192
The casino tool

1744
01:23:55,776 --> 01:24:01,408
Eventually I started targeting Sino industry they started to branch of government

1745
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,992
In 2003 or thereabouts right around

1746
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:11,136
Dennis claimed that he had developed software that would analyze barcodes that appeared on Al Jazeera

1747
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:12,928
Any used these Dakota

1748
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:15,744
Information gleaned

1749
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:17,536
To predict impending terrorist

1750
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,584
This is what he develop

1751
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:27,520
He's a study student of the Kabbalah is that what you're saying

1752
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:29,568
Barcode barcode

1753
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:30,336
He's just

1754
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,920
So here's hoping they're planning

1755
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:35,712
The terrorist attack

1756
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:36,992
Through the barcode

1757
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:38,272
On YouTube

1758
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:39,040
Yeah

1759
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,648
Terrorist attacks

1760
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:44,928
Needlessly,

1761
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,720
Make sense

1762
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:49,024
No. No no

1763
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,560
Sup

1764
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:51,840
At that point

1765
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:54,912
The gentleman named Tom Ridge was Homeland Security director

1766
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,496
He was convinced

1767
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:01,056
I'm about this software and that it was legit

1768
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:04,128
Information

1769
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:06,432
Raise the terror alert multiple times

1770
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,224
He went so far as

1771
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,016
To evacuate public building

1772
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:12,064
A call for flights to be grounded

1773
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:14,112
Based on interpretation

1774
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:16,416
Of barcodes on Al Jazeera

1775
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:18,720
Through Dennis Montgomery's software

1776
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:21,024
It is don't tell me that's real

1777
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:24,608
Very real living a dumb enough to believe that

1778
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:26,400
It's so real

1779
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:31,520
Legit like you know is it in the Kabbalah where it's like they they put

1780
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:33,056
Certain letters of

1781
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:39,456
Weird Bible Code stuff

1782
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:43,040
It's the same sort of logic

1783
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:45,600
Spanish

1784
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:50,208
Just because I don't want to ruin where this is going to go

1785
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:51,232
I don't want to ruin

1786
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:53,280
The entire end of the story yet

1787
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:56,352
The CIA agent who was involved in like

1788
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:57,376
The implementation of

1789
01:25:57,632 --> 01:26:00,704
This technology and it being brought in

1790
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,008
Requested anonymity but he was quoted later

1791
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:04,800
Talking about the meeting where they

1792
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:05,568
Learned about this

1793
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:06,592
This information is being

1794
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:08,128
This is so embarrassing

1795
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:12,736
Yeah there was no use

1796
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:13,504
It was dimple

1797
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:16,064
What's the status

1798
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:22,464
I'll just spell out the rest of the story now because why not

1799
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,768
Theory

1800
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:27,072
There's no way they could have killed JFK

1801
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:28,096
These people bikes

1802
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:29,376
You f****** stupid

1803
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:33,216
Such incompetence considered

1804
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:36,800
Play f****** amorous

1805
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:43,456
When you have a conclusion that you want to arrive at and someone gives you

1806
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,224
You like

1807
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:48,320
Confirmation possible version of of your conclusion

1808
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:50,112
911

1809
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:50,880
Inside Job

1810
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:51,904
So

1811
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:53,184
This guy

1812
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:54,464
His software

1813
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:57,280
That does Montgomery his software is implemented and it's used

1814
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:58,816
To make Terror prediction

1815
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:02,400
Is it what is it what is it even look like

1816
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:05,472
This is 2003 level software

1817
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:06,496
Don't

1818
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:08,544
TuneIn and this is back when you had to use

1819
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,568
3 by 5 floppy

1820
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:10,848
No it.

1821
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:22,624
My heart. Where you would have I mean

1822
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:27,232
We're using or using

1823
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:29,024
Let's call it Windows 2000

1824
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:31,584
You've noticed

1825
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:32,864
Windows

1826
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:33,888
Well whatever

1827
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:42,080
It's Montgomery let's call it Windows 95 I don't know if it's like MLB The Show

1828
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:50,784
Bass windows

1829
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:52,320
Our first

1830
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,088
GUI

1831
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:55,648
And this guy puts

1832
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:56,416
Cinema City

1833
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:58,208
That analyzes

1834
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,000
What's on Al Jazeera

1835
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:01,536
So that means

1836
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,352
What

1837
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:08,192
You got screenshots of Al Jazeera it takes him 5 minutes

1838
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:10,240
To download picture of Al Jazeera

1839
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:13,568
Can you pull up a command prompt and it looks at it like

1840
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:19,712
Does one of those like this software had to have been the exact same level of Technology

1841
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:20,736
Where in the world is

1842
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,808
Without rockapella

1843
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:25,856
There's no

1844
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:27,392
Possible way that was even

1845
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,928
Real software

1846
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:33,280
Fascinating number generator

1847
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:34,560
Well here's what

1848
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:36,864
Alright a little bit down the line

1849
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:45,824
And they realize that Dennis Montgomery was just making s*** up

1850
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,360
And I know about the

1851
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:48,640
Not only that

1852
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:51,456
These barcodes on Al Jazeera

1853
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:55,296
Where would you put dance he just made even that part

1854
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:59,648
So the FBI didn't is a conman of ridiculous

1855
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:01,952
Csbi did a counter investigate

1856
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:06,048
History of fraud

1857
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:08,096
Etihad

1858
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:14,240
He had extensive gambling problem with G step

1859
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:19,360
A CIA agent like I said was quoted as saying that the whole thing was very embarrassing

1860
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:20,896
His former lawyer

1861
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:22,944
Representative

1862
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:28,832
Which is weird cuz that's my son's name

1863
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,928
It's not the same guy as far as I can tell

1864
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:34,208
What's up

1865
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:40,608
I think we can rule out Michael j.fox was basically the characters

1866
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:41,376
The Secret of My Success

1867
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:42,656
That's right

1868
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:46,240
Former lawyer describe Dennis Montgomery is a con artist

1875
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:56,992

Competent

1883
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:22,592
When there's so many more stories were there

1884
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:25,152
Right right

1885
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:26,432
CIA

1886
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:29,248
Stupid that deserves our public enter

1887
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:30,528
Trista we want we like to

01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:35,392
Create

1889
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:37,696
Feel alot better if I knew they were stupid

1890
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:40,256
Jordan Montgomery

1891
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,024
No

1892
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:44,352
51 really great

1893
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:47,168
Yes you do

1894
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,984
So in 2006

1895
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:55,616
Does gubernatorial race

1896
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:56,896
Visit Nevada

1897
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:00,480
He claimed

1898
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:01,504
His own business

1899
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:04,320
Casino chips

1900
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:07,392
And $100,000 in cash in exchange for favor

1901
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:09,696
Said that

1902
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:10,976
Committed

1903
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:13,536
That was his that was his like

1904
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:21,472
York I committed a crime

1905
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:28,384
It's not great for immunity beforehand or did you just call a press conference on clear

1906
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:33,760
So he claimed he claimed that they gave him all of this money in exchange for favor

1907
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:35,552
Sprite soda Montgomery

1908
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:37,856
Claimed that he had emails from Gibbons

1909
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:38,880
Private email

1910
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:43,232
That proved that

1911
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:44,512
He was he was not lying

1912
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:47,584
Gibbons said that the emails were fake

1913
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:52,448
A computer expert testified

1914
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:56,032
Must challenge the authenticity of the email

1915
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:58,848
The court case was thrown out

1916
01:31:59,104 --> 01:31:59,872
And 18 months

1917
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:03,712
FBI investigation concluded the Gibbons did nothing wrong

1918
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:04,992
They cleared him of all charge

1919
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:06,784
18 months

1920
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:11,904
A US intelligence community

1921
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:15,488
A US House Ethics Committee investigating

1922
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:16,512
The charges as well

1923
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:18,304
And found no wrongdoing

1924
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:20,864
Now why is this case super important

1925
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:24,704
Montgomery is a liar

1926
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:25,472
An idiot

1927
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:28,288
To falsify documents

1928
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:29,056
Super Why

1929
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:30,336
There is an indication

1930
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:31,360
That was

1931
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:32,640
Borne out in court

1932
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:33,920
He has

1933
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:35,968
Fraudulently created

1934
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:38,016
And so now we're citing his.

1935
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:39,040
I meant on the Alex Jones

1936
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:46,464
Be a hoax

1937
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,232
Give

1938
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:49,536
Investigation

1939
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:52,352
All the shows

1940
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:53,632
He has no credibility

1941
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:56,960
Has been shown to create.

1942
01:32:57,984 --> 01:33:02,848
Do you commit a crime with you if you accuse that dude

1943
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,896
Committing a crime

1944
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:07,200
Then say

1945
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:13,344
Happened so

1946
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:15,392
Heat Montgomery's off the hook for bribe

1947
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:17,952
Cuz he didn't do just driving buddy

1948
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:24,864
Or making false statements

1949
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:27,680
There was actually

1950
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:30,240
The trial he would have had to testify that

1951
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:33,312
And testified that then that would be perjury

1952
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:36,384
He would have perjured himself under oath

1953
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:38,944
When he went to trial

1954
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:39,968
Said he'd

1955
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:44,576
Do any of these claims

1956
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:45,600
Initiated

1957
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:46,880
And then he never said any

1958
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:54,560
If you have anyone committed a crime

1959
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:57,376
So this is the guy who's the route

1960
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:58,144
Of these

1961
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:58,912
Navigation

1962
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:01,472
Fake

1963
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:04,288
Database that I was Jones exciting as evidence

1964
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:06,336
Himself and Trump

1965
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:07,360
Being spider

1966
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:08,384
It's

1967
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,664
Clear at this point

1968
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:11,200
So that is not true

1969
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,248
Absolutely not

1970
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:16,576
Morass

1971
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,904
On that story than anyone has ever

1972
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:23,232
I promise

1973
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:25,024
That's an expose

1974
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:29,632
That you just did that no one will really ever hit and nose hairs

1975
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:36,032
Do you know what the reason that they're complaining about how the FBI is making no moves on this stuff

1976
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:37,568
And there's a media blackout

1977
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:42,432
But they were talking about now is why there's a media blackout

1978
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:43,968
The guy has no credibility

1979
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:44,992
What was the

1980
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:46,016
Yeah you just

1981
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:50,368
You just kicked it you just kick the ass you kept all the answer the story

1982
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:51,392
It's not done

1983
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:52,928
We still have to get to Larry klayman

1984
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:54,720
Seriously

1985
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:56,256
This is amazing

1986
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:57,280
This next

1987
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:01,120
So we're still in Missoula interview

1988
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:02,912
And Jerome corsi who is

1989
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:05,216
Been silently a part of this the whole time

1990
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:06,240
But then

1991
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:07,008
To try and

1992
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:07,776
Ouch

1993
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:10,336
For the situation that's going on

1994
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:12,384
And I want to play this clip

1995
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:16,224
Little another side argument I want to make right

1996
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:19,808
I want to see 4

1997
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:27,488
Bikes

1998
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:34,400
Actually

1999
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:35,680
Couple of weeks

2000
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,360
Used car dealer

2001
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,624
Speaks the truth

2002
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:55,648
Carefully

2003
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:59,744
Put together

2004
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:01,536
Here's why play that clip

2005
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:06,656
He's desperately trying to provide credibility for Mike zullo

2006
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:07,424
Right

2007
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,192
But

2008
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:11,776
He doesn't realize that if you look at the history of Jerome corsi

2009
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:14,336
That's a liar vouching for your credibility

2010
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:15,872
Which actually hurts

2011
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,920
Jerome corsi

2012
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:20,480
Laid out in the past has written

2013
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:23,296
A book about Obama's birth certificate

2014
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:25,344
He was also a member of the Swift

2015
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,904
Swift boat lettering

2016
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:33,536
Yeah so he is that so when he comes in and says this guy is honest as the day is long

2017
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:35,072
That means

2018
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:37,888
Oh we just both have the same propaganda goal

2019
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:39,168
That's all he said

2020
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:44,032
Anyway I'm looking and being like dude I love this guy's lies

2021
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:45,568
We have one more clip

2022
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:48,896
It one more clip with Mike zullo again

2023
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:51,200
Spelling out very clearly and

2024
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:52,736
And very overtly

2025
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:54,528
But he doesn't know anything

2026
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:57,088
There's no information that he has

2027
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:59,392
And in this clip he even let slip

2028
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:02,720
The he can't even confirm that anybody was ever wiretap

2029
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:05,280
Which is kind of unfortunate for the

2030
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:07,072
Just claims he's trying to

2031
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:10,400
Well if I'm Sheriff arpaio's account is

2032
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:13,728
The timeline and I'm going by memory

2033
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:16,032
I understand

2034
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:21,408
This alleged wiretapping

2035
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:38,048
Got orange seeds

2036
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:41,888
Is when they were pursuing Sheriff Arpaio under a criminal charge

2037
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:46,240
Was dropped

2038
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:48,544
And at the same time

2039
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:50,592
Individuals that were

2040
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:53,664
Case moved over to a private Law Firm

2041
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:56,992
The Clearblue a civil

2042
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:58,528
Proceeding ensued

2043
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,088
Hey this is talking about Covington & Burling

2044
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:02,368
Again this is

2045
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:04,672
Basically what we covered earlier but

2046
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:07,488
Let's be clear

2047
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,584
Alex is trying to say that like you don't have DNA testing can't prove it's a duck

2048
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:15,168
The expression is if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck

2049
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:15,936
It's a duck

2050
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:19,008
Going the other direction with a duck

2051
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:20,544
Metaphor

2052
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,360
I love it I love it

2053
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:28,992
Starting in the middle of Forrest Fenn like

2054
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:32,832
Hold on one second we're going to need a blood

2055
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:34,368
A son f****** prove

2056
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:35,136
Yeah

2057
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:36,672
Prove that's a duck

2058
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:38,208
Uist son-of-a-b****

2059
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:44,352
You and also it shows that Alex Jones has a higher standard of proof about like what is a duck

2060
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:48,704
Anything else we talked about on his show of evidence

2061
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:49,984
Is is glaring

2062
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:53,056
So we're going to leave Mike zullo now that is been

2063
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:53,824
Who

2064
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,360
Time in the Sun

2065
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:56,128
As it were

2066
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:00,736
I don't necessarily have a ton against Mike zullo except that I found

2067
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:03,552
In an article

2068
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:06,112
He's part of the Joe Arpaio thing I hope it gets hit by a

2069
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:07,392
That's enough

2070
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:09,184
Done and done from the Phoenix

2071
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:12,000
From the Phoenix New Times I did find an article about the

2072
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:16,096
The case against Arpaio and it's interesting that Mike's

2073
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:17,888
I was called to testify

2074
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:19,936
Invoke the 5th

2075
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:20,960
What a shocker

2076
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:24,544
He pleaded the fifth against self-incrimination in court which means

2077
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:26,080
I mean

2078
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:28,128
You're not always guilty when you plead the Fifth

2079
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:29,152
But in this case

2080
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:35,296
It does seem to imply if he wants to go out there publicly and talk about how there's a railroad in case being done its

2081
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:38,624
If you're in if you're in court you'd want to

2082
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:42,720
Provide the evidence than Ingo

2083
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:45,792
Afraid of what might come out

2084
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:49,632
Anyone who is under 18

2085
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:52,192
Do not say a goddamn word

2086
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,776
Whether or not he's guilty

2087
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:59,104
And whether or not you should be in jail

2088
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:01,920
Those things

2089
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:03,456
But I do think

2090
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:05,504
Do not say a goddamn thing to the cops

2091
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:06,528
Ladies and gentlemen

2092
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:09,088
So now at this point one thing I can tell you

2093
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:13,696
Sodus Point

2094
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:17,792
We transition our investigation are we go to how Alex

2095
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:18,560
End of the week

2096
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:21,120
This gentleman who's come up a couple times

2097
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:22,144
Larry klayman

2098
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:23,936
On the Friday

2099
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:24,960
Episode of the show

2100
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:26,240
Meanwhile throughout the week

2101
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:29,056
He was yelling about this evidence and how it proved

2102
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:29,824
Everything that is

2103
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:30,848
He's been saying is correct

2104
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,896
They have a database

2105
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:34,176
Esme

2106
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:35,712
Baba baba

2107
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:37,504
Savannah's Larry klayman as a guest

2108
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:40,320
Here is the introduction of how he brings him into

2109
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:41,600
Show

2110
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:43,136
World

2111
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:46,976
Larry

2112
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:50,304
The clay man

2113
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:55,424
Exposing 4 is fine going on against the president against Congress has been in the news for years

2114
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:12,320
Here in just a moment Larry klayman legendary Larry klayman

2115
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:15,904
Little bird

2116
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,696
But here's where we getting to where this is

2117
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:18,720
Exeter Murphy

2118
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:19,744
Convince

2119
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:20,768
When will iOS

2120
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:21,792
Devin Nunez

2121
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:24,608
Presented this new evidence

2122
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:26,912
No he didn't

2123
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:29,216
He got it from Larry klayman

2124
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:30,240
Larry klayman

2125
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:32,032
That's what Alex just said

2126
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:33,312
And in this interview

2127
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:34,336
Larry klayman

2128
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:35,104
Says as much

2129
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:38,176
Do we have any evidence that Larry klayman would have talked to him

2130
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:41,248
Only based on Larry's word

2131
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:42,784
Speculation

2132
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:44,832
Episode

2133
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:45,856
In some ways because

2134
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:47,904
The history does bear out there is

2135
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:50,720
Look I can't I can't prove it

2136
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:52,512
These Liars are always lying

2137
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:53,536
But

2138
01:41:59,424 --> 01:41:59,936
If only

2139
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:05,568
But based on Larry klayman telling of it he had been trying to get this information to Devin Nunez for quite a while

2140
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:06,592
And succeeded

2141
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:08,384
So

2142
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:12,992
All of this stuff with Trump feels like anime

2143
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:17,600
I wrote it on the back of

2144
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:20,928
I threw a paper airplane in the directions

2145
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:24,000
I have been doing everything I can to get the

2146
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:25,024
Information iduna

2147
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:26,816
Again that's Montgomery not

2148
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:28,352
Claim

2149
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:29,632
But

2150
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:31,168
Establish those are the only Farm

2151
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:32,448
The communication that Alex

2152
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:33,472
Velcro

2153
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:39,360
One thing that's important to lay out here is that Larry klayman is Dennis Montgomery's lawyer now

2154
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:42,688
The former lawyer called him a con artist

2155
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:44,992
Habitually engaged in fraud

2156
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:45,760
Now

2157
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:46,784
Larry klayman is

2158
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:48,576
The two of them met

2159
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,624
Through Joe Arpaio

2160
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:51,648
When

2161
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:54,720
Being represented by Larry klayman

2162
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,280
Dennis Montgomery

2163
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:58,304
The confidential

2164
01:42:58,816 --> 01:42:59,840
So we're having

2165
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:01,632
A wonderful romantic comedy

2166
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:15,712
We're taking slaves to do a love triangle we take a slight break from all of this information

2167
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:18,528
We've been laying out

2168
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:22,880
Introduction Alex Jones realizes that you got to pay the bill

2169
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:28,000
Reclaiming on Injustice

2170
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:31,328
Case against the interstate going on years ago

2171
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:36,960
Supporting

2172
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:38,752
If you don't mind products

2173
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:40,800
First off you're crazy we have the best

2174
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:46,432
Can organic soil silver and

2175
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:52,576
National surgeon

2176
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:58,720
Batman fractured the biggest manufacturer in the country

2177
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:03,072
Tell you who's our private labeling but this is an iodine. Her attitude

2178
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:06,144
I think you might have just breached his contract

2179
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:09,216
That's not that's not fair

2180
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:10,496
To Tom's of Maine

2181
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:15,360
The contract says you can't say who made it

2182
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:19,456
Tom's of Maine

2183
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:21,504
Whoops whoops I f***** up

2184
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:26,368
The time I've not reviewed their contract so I

2185
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:30,720
So here we go

2186
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:31,744
Alex Jones

2187
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:34,816
Full on Bayou

2188
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:35,840
Of Larry klayman

2189
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:38,400
I'll be back

2190
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:42,240
Bayou

2191
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:43,776
It would take too long

2192
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:46,080
He knows who Larry klayman is

2193
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:48,384
No one knows who Larry klayman is

2194
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:51,712
No one knows who Larry klayman is his bio

2195
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:54,016
So I will

2196
01:44:54,272 --> 01:44:55,296
Would you like to know

2197
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:58,368
Would you like to know some fun facts about Larry klayman

2198
01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:04,000
Following claimants behavior in a 1992 trial in California Federal Court

2199
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:07,584
Judge William Lehman from his courtroom for life

2200
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:14,496
Hold on

2201
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:15,264
Hold on

2202
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:19,872
Five years later in a separate case in New York clayman's Behavior led men

2203
01:45:21,408 --> 01:45:21,920
Chin

2204
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:25,504
To issue a lifetime ban on the attorney practice

2205
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:26,528
Single all before him

2206
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:28,832
Well then eaten sounds like he's in the mafia

2207
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:35,488
Have barred him from Pratt

2208
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:36,768
In front of him

2209
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:37,536
4life

2210
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:41,120
Claiming his written about his dealings with do that

2211
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:43,168
Yeah

2212
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:45,472
If you're judging

2213
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:47,008
Nope it's essential

2214
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:49,568
It's essentially an extreme version of holding someone

2215
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,104
Absolutely

2216
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:53,408
Get to say he's out of order for

2217
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:58,784
Flaming has written about his dealings

2218
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:04,160
So Cal and was quote obviously drunk

2219
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:05,184
At the bench

2220
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:09,536
I don't believe you but I don't believe

2221
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:12,864
In 2017

2222
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:17,984
Received a $25,000 retainer from a woman facing criminal charge

2223
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:21,312
And she accused him of not providing legal services in return

2224
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:24,384
The Florida Bar Association

2225
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,152
Can I claim it agreed

2226
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:27,456
To pay off a small portion

2227
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:36,672
He was reprimanded by the Association

2228
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:37,440
Hey

2229
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:38,976
Dude

2230
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:42,304
He's filed at least you don't have to pay

2231
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:46,144
He has filed at least 18 lawsuits against the Clinton

2232
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,448
Raven from accusations of racketeering

2233
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,240
To a bunch of s*** about Benghazi

2234
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:52,544
In the wake of the 26

2235
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:55,360
Shooting of Dallas police officer

2236
01:46:56,896 --> 01:46:59,456
Claimant filed a lawsuit against Obama

2237
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:04,576
Former US Attorney General Eric Holder the Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan

2238
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:05,600
Al Sharpton

2239
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:11,744
Founders of black lives matter movement

2240
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,024
That led to the shooting

2241
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:18,144
Claiming amended the complaint to include Dallas police officer

2242
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:24,544
And Hillary Clinton and George Soros as defense I mean this is super weird but I'm reading off your

2243
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:28,128
Ice cream former San Antonio Spurs star Tim Duncan

2244
01:47:28,384 --> 01:47:29,664
I don't know how he got in there

2245
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:34,016
But he is part of the conspiracy

2246
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:37,344
That case

2247
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,136
It was just a poet was

2248
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:44,512
And all of them

2249
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:51,680
Definitely like nobody's going to take a lot to get disbarred

2250
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:55,008
What even is being a lawyer if you can just

2251
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:56,544
Is anybody

2252
01:47:56,800 --> 01:48:00,384
Also James Carville Cajun

2253

Call Tim luggage

2254
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:09,600
Claiming his mother for $50,000

2255
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:10,368
Did he win

2256
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:13,952
Seeking reimbursement for medical care provided to his maternal grandmother

2257
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:20,352
After claiming brother told Newsweek magazine

2258
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:23,680
It was your brother

2259
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:27,264
Got to stretch

2260
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:28,800
It was on

2261
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:29,824
So he's just

2262
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:35,712
Into October 2014 play the Obama Administration

2263
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:39,808
Secretly allowed Ebola virus

Caucasian race and Jewish Christian religion

2265
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:49,280
Can't imagine any other possible

2266
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:54,656
Ground Zero mosque

2267
01:48:55,168 --> 01:48:56,192
He was involved in that

2268
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:57,216
Love those lies

2269
01:48:57,472 --> 01:49:01,568
2015 Clement

2270
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:04,896
Dennis Montgomery

2271
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:05,920
Do during the day

2272
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:07,968
I think he's

2273
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:08,736
Media horror

2274
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:10,272
Well yeah

2275
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:16,928
Lawyer I know but like what is he too is probably a sleazy lawyer who I don't know

2276
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:23,328
Who knows

2277
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:24,864
Settlement

2278
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:25,632
Listen

2279
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:26,912
Open a cast

2280
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:31,520
Probably I wouldn't be surprised if it's Better Call Saul type of guy

2281
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:37,408
Super good at that has a little bit with Dennis Montgomery

2282
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:40,480
Defamation lawsuit on behalf of

2283
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:41,504
Against James

2284
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:44,064
The author of a book called pay any price

2285
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:46,112
Greed power in the endless war

2286
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:47,136
The lawsuit alleged

2287
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:51,744
Describe Montgomery is the Maestro behind

2288
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,024
Former US officials

2289
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,816
Believe was the most elaborate

2290
01:49:55,072 --> 01:49:56,608
And dangerous hoaxes in American history

2291
01:49:57,120 --> 01:50:01,216
This is that software we discussed earlier

2292
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:05,056
So

2293
01:50:05,312 --> 01:50:06,848
That's such a solid

2294
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:11,968
How do you get to be good of a con man

2295
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:12,736
That you can just make

2296
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:13,504
Make that s*** up

2297
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:15,040
Just like

2298
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:17,344
It couldn't have even looked

2299
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:22,464
Like like that's the thing about computer I don't think I don't think you would understand

2300
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:25,024
Show the Doppler effect

2301
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:27,328
Hero to take software thing but because

2302
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:28,864
People don't have that key

2303
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:30,400
Computer savvy they're willing to

2304
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:32,960
Like they're just like

2305
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:35,520
This is why we can't have old people in

2306
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:36,544
Power anymore

2307
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:37,312
They don't even know

2308
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:38,848
It's like we can't do it

2309
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:40,128
Weekends like

2310
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:42,432
They don't even live in the world we live in

2311
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:44,480
0

2312
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:46,528
DMC hacking

2313
01:50:46,784 --> 01:50:47,808
Was not some sort of

2314
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:51,904
Clicked on a f******

2315
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:53,952
Like that's all it was

2316
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:57,280
Like there's no real hacking going on like what people

2317
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:02,400
Sophisticated

2318
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:04,448
Complicated

2319
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:07,008
It's really good stuff but

2320
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:08,544
All of this

2321
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:10,848
People that we have

2322
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:13,152
Out-of-touch

2323
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:15,968
Let me get through I Larry klayman spy

2324
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,784
Cuz Alex refuses to get the bundle

2325
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:20,320
Well you know what

2326
01:51:20,576 --> 01:51:21,088
Alex was right in

2327
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:21,856
And saying that he

2328
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:22,624
You did not have

2329
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:25,952
We do

2330
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:28,256
Clayman

2331
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:31,840
On behalf of Dennis Montgomery file this lawsuit

2332
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:36,704
In 2016 in federal court dismissed lawsuit

2333
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:39,776
Repealed

2334
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:42,336
Appeal was

2335
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:48,480
I believe is Marine Le Pen

2336
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:54,368
Prime ministerial candidate

2337
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:58,976
Kim and will call her affection

2338
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:00,512
Brothers at the great lawsuit

2339
01:52:00,768 --> 01:52:05,632
Is legally fashion

2340
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:09,728
But then the other side of it is just finding was that

2341
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:11,008
You can't

2342
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:13,568
Considerate defamation when you're in

2343
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:14,592
Political

2344
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:18,432
Describing someone

2345
01:52:18,688 --> 01:52:19,456
Political beliefs

2346
01:52:19,712 --> 01:52:20,480
Isn't defamation

2347
01:52:20,992 --> 01:52:22,016
If there is

2348
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:26,112
Credibility to

2349
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:28,928
Larry klayman filed at least

2350
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:34,048
Free lawsuits claiming that Obama was not eligible to be president cuz his birth certificate was fake

2351
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:38,144
Okay he tried to defend Cliven Bundy as his lawyer

2352
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:40,960
Good as we all know Cliven Bundy is a crazy person

2353
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:44,544
As is Larry klayman as is

2354
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:51,456
Clayman

2355
01:52:51,712 --> 01:52:54,272
History of discipline

2356
01:52:54,528 --> 01:52:58,112
Escorts and he had no clearance or standing to assign himself

2357
01:52:58,368 --> 01:53:01,184
As someone else's lawyer

2358
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:05,024
Cliven Bundy

2359
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:05,792
Did not

2360
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:07,328
His help at all

2361
01:53:08,864 --> 01:53:09,376
I would ask

2362
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:11,168
The direction where the judge

2363
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:13,472
You said you were

2364
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:15,520
More than you

2365
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:17,824
Claiming

2366
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:18,848
Century Bike Tour

2367
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:19,616
20 judges

2368
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:21,408
I'm a victim

2369
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:22,432
Yeah

2370
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:25,504
2013

2371
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:30,880
Claimant declare to the conservative rally in Washington DC that quote

2372
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:33,696
This President is not a president of We the People

2373
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:35,744
He's a president of his people

2374
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:36,512
Whoops

2375
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:40,096
That's probably rarely recharge

2376
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:42,912
He urged the crowd to begin a quote

2377
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:45,472
Second American nonviolent Revolution

2378
01:53:45,728 --> 01:53:47,520
And demanded that President Obama quotes

2379
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:51,616
Put the Quorum down and figuratively come out with his hands up

2380
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:52,896
Weeks Later

2381
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:58,016
Put the Quran down

2382
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:04,160
Claimant sponsored reclaim America rally

2383
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:06,464
In Lafayette Square across from the white

2384
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:08,256
Calling for the president's removal

2385
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:10,816
Claim and stated that if Obama did

2386
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:11,840
The first America

2387
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:12,864
Can on violin

2388
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:14,400
I can't think of one

2389
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:16,704
I think I think we had a lot more of the of the

2390
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:19,520
Violent revolution

2391
01:54:19,776 --> 01:54:25,920
Did not resign conservative activists would meet

2392
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:27,968
Whoops bad use of terms

2393
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:32,064
Considering that now all they talk about is how there's a shadow government

2394
01:54:34,368 --> 01:54:35,392
Anyway

2395
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:38,720
Clayman

2396
01:54:40,256 --> 01:54:43,072
Billions to occupy Washington DC

2397
01:54:43,584 --> 01:54:46,912
He was between 130 and 200 people

2398
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:49,472
Also

2399
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:52,032
They're going to talk about

2400
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:54,336
Announce already referenced

2401
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:56,128
He won a court case

2402
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:56,896
About

2403
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:59,200
So we're talking about his

2404
01:54:59,456 --> 01:55:02,784
We're not talking about as many and varied and magnificently

2405
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,320
Yeah we're going to talk about it

2406
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:08,416
Klayman vs. Obama

2407
01:55:08,928 --> 01:55:10,464
Where he was

2408
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:12,768
Two contestants

2409
01:55:13,024 --> 01:55:14,304
A phone and internet Metairie

2410
01:55:14,816 --> 01:55:15,328
Good

2411
01:55:15,584 --> 01:55:16,096
That's a good

2412
01:55:16,608 --> 01:55:18,144
We can agree that

2413
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:21,472
Like a lot of that stuff is

2414
01:55:22,496 --> 01:55:24,032
Pretty

2415
01:55:24,288 --> 01:55:27,616
It's pretty f*****-up horrifying and a police state

2416
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:30,944
So he brought this case in front of a judge

2417
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:40,672
If you're a judge

2418
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:41,952
And you Google this

2419
01:55:42,208 --> 01:55:42,976
It's f****** guy win

2420
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:44,256
Like no Get It Go

2421
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:49,376
The judge will

2422
01:55:49,632 --> 01:55:50,400
Would have a brew

2423
01:55:50,656 --> 01:55:52,704
Out of the Court

2424
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:55,264
The Apollo

2425
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:56,032
What you should do

2426
01:55:57,568 --> 01:56:01,408
2013 and US federal judge Richard J Leon

2427
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:02,688
He ruled

2428
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:04,480
Book collection of America

2429
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:07,040
Telephone metadata

2430
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:10,112
He had insanely

2431
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:11,136
Legitimate

2432
01:56:11,392 --> 01:56:11,904
Concern

2433
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:12,928
About

2434
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:13,952
Call

2435
01:56:14,464 --> 01:56:17,280
This program could violate people's Fourth Amendment

2436
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:18,560
Against unreasonable searches

2437
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:24,448
Publicly

2438
01:56:24,704 --> 01:56:25,984
And then actually

2439
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:27,008
Comes into the ruling

2440
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:30,080
Cuz that it wasn't before

2441
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:32,896
He ruled in favor

2442
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:33,664
Of

2443
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:34,688
Clayman

2444
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:37,504
The guy whose last name is strange

2445
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:39,040
Alright

2446
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:40,832
Defendant

2447
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:41,856
Or plaintiff

2448
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:44,928
The original trial was held

2449
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:50,816
So they brought the state and the judge agreed with the arguments

2450
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:53,888
That metadata collection violates the Fourth Amendment

2451
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:59,008
In his ruling was to say I suspend my

2452
01:56:59,264 --> 01:56:59,776
Rent for 6-month

2453
01:57:00,288 --> 01:57:01,312
To allow

2454
01:57:01,568 --> 01:57:02,080
The government

2455
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:02,848
To appeal

2456
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:07,712
That he

2457
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:08,480
Conjunction

2458
01:57:08,736 --> 01:57:09,760
That any

2459
01:57:10,272 --> 01:57:13,344
Metadata collection regarding strange or Clayman

2460
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:14,112
Might have to stop

2461
01:57:14,624 --> 01:57:15,648
Every

2462
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:17,184
Bit of information that had

2463
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:18,976
Had to be destroyed

2464
01:57:19,232 --> 01:57:21,024
Ruling for 6-month

2465
01:57:21,536 --> 01:57:22,304
Allowing for appeal

2466
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:26,144
During that

2467
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:26,912
6 months

2468
01:57:27,168 --> 01:57:27,680
They can

2469
01:57:27,936 --> 01:57:28,960
Still collect their meditate

2470
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:29,984
No

2471
01:57:34,848 --> 01:57:38,176
Have to change for the next 6 months

2472
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:42,528
And

2473
01:57:42,784 --> 01:57:43,552
Basically

2474
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:46,368
The appeals court found that

2475
01:57:47,136 --> 01:57:51,744
Because the program had been ended they didn't have a responsibility to rule on the legality

2476
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,024
Of the Fourth Amendment

2477
01:57:54,304 --> 01:57:55,840
Secondarily they found

2478
01:57:56,096 --> 01:57:56,608
That

2479
01:57:57,376 --> 01:57:58,144
There's no evidence

2480
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:59,424
The could be provided

2481
01:57:59,936 --> 01:58:00,704
They claiming

2482
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:01,728
Or strain

2483
01:58:01,984 --> 01:58:03,776
Actually worse B on it

2484
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:05,824
Or had their metadata collected

2485
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:07,616
And therefore they had no standing in

2486
01:58:07,872 --> 01:58:08,384
Import

2487
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:09,408
To bring the sky

2488
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:16,320
Even though the government did collect bulk metadata because they couldn't prove their meditate

2489
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:17,088
It was collected

2490
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:19,904
And they can't represent

2491
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:20,928
Tyranny of the

2492
01:58:21,696 --> 01:58:23,744
Part of their argument was the bear Verizon

2493
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:27,072
That the government is collected Verizon

2494
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:31,424
Yeah but the thing is

2495
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:32,192
Hold on

2496
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:34,496
The government admitted that they collected business

2497
01:58:35,776 --> 01:58:36,800
Through Verizon

2498
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:38,080
Like Verizon business

2499
01:58:39,616 --> 01:58:40,384
Individual

2500
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:41,408
You and I

2501
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:42,432
Cell phone owner

2502
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:44,992
They collected things through a different

2503
01:58:45,248 --> 01:58:46,528
Part of Verizon's business

2504
01:58:46,784 --> 01:58:48,320
This is dubious

2505
01:58:48,576 --> 01:58:52,416
I don't like that I don't

2506
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:54,208
I do think

2507
01:58:54,464 --> 01:58:56,000
That based on the law

2508
01:58:56,512 --> 01:58:57,792
And based on

2509
01:58:58,048 --> 01:58:58,560
I'm telling you

2510
01:58:58,816 --> 01:59:00,352
I read these Court decision

2511
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:02,144
Yeah I know cuz your loot

2512
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:03,680
And I don't think

2513
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:04,960
That they did

2514
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:05,984
The decisions were Rock

2515
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:07,520
I think the appeals court was right

2516
01:59:07,776 --> 01:59:08,800
He didn't have the standing

2517
01:59:09,056 --> 01:59:11,360
But at the same time the conclusion is correct

2518
01:59:11,616 --> 01:59:12,384
The metadata collection

2519
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:13,152
Is a nun

2520
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:14,432
Reasonable certainty

2521
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:18,528
He was right and they probably stopped it

2522
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:20,832
I think I think it has

2523
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:21,856
In a lot of way

2524
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:28,512
I just don't want all the information we can find it has stopped

2525
01:59:29,536 --> 01:59:30,304
Based on

2526
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:32,352
What were afraid is actually the truth

2527
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:35,936
Larry klayman is right on that count

2528
01:59:38,496 --> 01:59:39,520
He's wrong about everything else

2529
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:43,872
His claims that he beat the NSA in a court case is wrong

2530
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:46,944
He had a case where they agreed with him or they were

2531
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:48,224
Inclined to agree with him

2532
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:51,040
Suspended judgment

2533
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:51,808
Anyway

2534
01:59:58,208 --> 02:00:00,000
I'm spent most work

2535
02:00:00,512 --> 02:00:02,304
I think any human being has ever done

2536
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:05,120
Here is where

2537
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:08,960
Larry klayman

2538
02:00:10,752 --> 02:00:11,264
This clip

2539
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:12,544
Larry klayman

2540
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:16,128
Do a little bit of a dance or he has to be sure that he has not

2541
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:19,712
Seen any of the information

2542
02:00:20,992 --> 02:00:22,272
We on Sunday

2543
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:23,040
Via

2544
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:25,088
Mother fobs other work Weathers

2545
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:27,648
Publishing things have been out there in federal court

2546
02:00:27,904 --> 02:00:31,232
Showing the Trump was being surveilled

2547
02:00:31,488 --> 02:00:34,560
What's a boilermaker

2548
02:00:35,328 --> 02:00:41,472
Montgomery system for a long time to do this together that is wanting

2549
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:44,032
Shepherd

2550
02:00:44,288 --> 02:00:46,080
Smash.com

2551
02:00:48,128 --> 02:00:49,664
I apologize that was Alex

2552
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:53,504
Trying not to implicate himself and

2553
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:56,832
So

2554
02:00:57,344 --> 02:00:57,856
You're right I am

2555
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:00,160
Yeah

2556
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:02,464
Larry

2557
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:03,488
Breaking down

2558
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,024
What he sees as

2559
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:05,792
Montgomery

2560
02:01:12,448 --> 02:01:18,592
Declassified Chaser involve dinner

2561
02:01:18,848 --> 02:01:19,360
So much

2562
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:40,864
About a bunch of bulshit

2563
02:01:41,376 --> 02:01:42,656
And also

2564
02:01:43,168 --> 02:01:45,728
Also on this episode

2565
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:53,152
Nickname is Esperanto

2566
02:01:53,408 --> 02:01:54,176
Benghazi attack

2567
02:01:55,712 --> 02:01:56,224
Tonto

2568
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:58,528
Spiranto is the hero of Benghazi

2569
02:02:00,832 --> 02:02:04,416
He came off his is fairly reasonable but also pretty aggressive

2570
02:02:05,952 --> 02:02:07,232
At the end of the interview you said like

2571
02:02:08,768 --> 02:02:12,608
People are afraid like they wanna arrest George Soros and they're afraid

2572
02:02:12,864 --> 02:02:13,376
I'll do it

2573
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:15,168
I'll go in I'll do it

2574
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:17,984
So Alex later uses that as like

2575
02:02:18,496 --> 02:02:22,592
Hey Tanto paronto was George Soros

2576
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:27,968
Afraid we should arrest him

2577
02:02:28,224 --> 02:02:29,760
I'll go in and do it I'm a Marine

2578
02:02:30,272 --> 02:02:30,784
No

2579
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:31,552
It's like he's like

2580
02:02:31,808 --> 02:02:33,088
You think Sunday should be arrested

2581
02:02:33,344 --> 02:02:34,624
He's ready to go do it himself

2582
02:02:35,136 --> 02:02:37,696
They just being held back a real Marine

2583
02:02:37,952 --> 02:02:39,232
Benghazi

2584
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,536
Do we know that

2585
02:02:43,328 --> 02:02:43,840
There's a movie

2586
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:45,120
Monkeys are real too

2587
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:51,520
Oh he's a real dude I can't risk going on Alex Jones

2588
02:02:51,776 --> 02:02:53,056
Disrespected

2589
02:02:53,312 --> 02:02:54,080
Weather

2590
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:57,920
I'm against it seemed like a pretty decent dude

2591
02:02:58,944 --> 02:02:59,968
But they also reflect

2592
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:02,016
Lowe's

2593
02:03:02,272 --> 02:03:04,576
He is probably been kicked out of only one

2594
02:03:04,832 --> 02:03:06,112
Court and never allowed to be there

2595
02:03:10,976 --> 02:03:13,792
In this day

2596
02:03:14,048 --> 02:03:15,072
Richard

2597
02:03:16,608 --> 02:03:20,192
Cannabis first name now is the NSA

2598
02:03:20,704 --> 02:03:21,216
Stop

2599
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:25,056
And then now he has Larry klayman on

2600
02:03:25,312 --> 02:03:26,848
We had a lot of guests

2601
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:28,384
He has to man

2602
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:29,664
You still scrambling

2603
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:34,784
You scrambling

2604
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:35,808
The fire

2605
02:03:36,064 --> 02:03:37,088
Sing a little bit

2606
02:03:37,344 --> 02:03:40,672
I don't know maybe next week I will be different you know this this week

2607
02:03:40,928 --> 02:03:45,792
You started with the at the end of the Ring right now

2608
02:03:46,304 --> 02:03:48,096
IOU did his big

2609
02:03:48,352 --> 02:03:49,120
Pizzagate apology

2610
02:03:49,376 --> 02:03:51,936
That could reinvigorate him a little bit we'll see

2611
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:06,784
600 million pages of information

2612
02:04:07,552 --> 02:04:09,600
Again went the only

2613
02:04:09,856 --> 02:04:11,392
Evidence we can find of him being

2614
02:04:11,648 --> 02:04:13,184
A contractor at all is

2615
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:16,512
Creating that software that analyzes Al Jazeera

2616
02:04:16,768 --> 02:04:21,632
Questionable weather in that capacity he would have access at all

2617
02:04:22,144 --> 02:04:24,192
47 hard drives or 600 million

2618
02:04:24,448 --> 02:04:24,960
Documents

2619
02:04:25,216 --> 02:04:28,032
If he if he did that have all those things

2620
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:33,664
That's pretty crazy and you must have been going way outside of his way in order to get those things which

2621
02:04:34,432 --> 02:04:35,200
Is massively illegal

2622
02:04:37,248 --> 02:04:38,528
All is all the

2623
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:39,808
It's all about

2624
02:04:44,928 --> 02:04:46,720
Much like Mike zullo

2625
02:04:46,976 --> 02:04:47,744
And a

2626
02:04:48,256 --> 02:04:50,560
Really trying hard to make sure that people don't think

2627
02:04:59,264 --> 02:05:01,312
Classified

2628
02:05:01,568 --> 02:05:03,360
And we need to put it in the right hands

2629
02:05:14,368 --> 02:05:17,440
Chicken committed a crime

2630
02:05:17,696 --> 02:05:19,744
And what he told me was on there

2631
02:05:20,256 --> 02:05:23,584
United States

2632
02:05:25,376 --> 02:05:26,912
156 judges

2633
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:29,984
President Trump when he was a businessman

2634
02:05:33,312 --> 02:05:33,824
Oprah

2635
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,104
D'amato's

2636
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:38,688
Take a step back

2637
02:05:39,968 --> 02:05:44,576
The only time that he could have possibly had access to nfac

2638
02:05:45,088 --> 02:05:48,160
Is around. Of 2003

2639
02:05:48,416 --> 02:05:52,256
He was involved and was massively discredited

2640
02:05:52,512 --> 02:05:54,304
He was thrown out with

2641
02:05:54,816 --> 02:05:58,144
The FBI's investigation on him and found to be a fraud

2642
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:01,472
There's no way you'd ever be able to get any sort of clearance after that

2643
02:06:01,728 --> 02:06:04,800
2003

2644
02:06:05,568 --> 02:06:06,080
I'm listening

2645
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:09,920
That al-jazeera

2646
02:06:10,432 --> 02:06:11,712
Did work

2647
02:06:12,736 --> 02:06:13,504
A trojan horse

2648
02:06:14,016 --> 02:06:15,040
And have you considered this

2649
02:06:15,296 --> 02:06:16,064
Right so

2650
02:06:16,576 --> 02:06:17,088
Like

2651
02:06:23,488 --> 02:06:24,768
I'm listening

2652
02:06:25,024 --> 02:06:26,304
Which is the other one the acronym

2653
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,288
It from the very beginning

2654
02:06:36,544 --> 02:06:38,592
Like from the very beginning

2655
02:06:38,848 --> 02:06:41,152
Because the al-jazeera software was on there

2656
02:06:41,408 --> 02:06:42,176
Montgomery

2657
02:06:43,712 --> 02:06:44,736
Point a Curative

2658
02:06:45,504 --> 02:06:47,296
Every level of government

2659
02:06:47,808 --> 02:06:48,576
Because

2660
02:06:49,088 --> 02:06:49,600
He is

2661
02:06:50,112 --> 02:06:50,624
Actually

2662
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:51,904
The guy who

2663
02:06:54,208 --> 02:06:55,488
Occam's razor

2664
02:06:56,256 --> 02:06:58,048
I don't like this

2665
02:06:59,584 --> 02:07:02,144
Simplest explanation

2666
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:05,472
Possibly have

2667
02:07:05,728 --> 02:07:06,496
Information

2668
02:07:06,752 --> 02:07:08,032
Stolen

2669
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:13,152
The early 2010

2670
02:07:13,664 --> 02:07:15,456
He's working with Joe Arpaio

2671
02:07:15,968 --> 02:07:19,040
And he has this database of Maricopa County

2672
02:07:20,576 --> 02:07:21,856
Victims of bank fraud

2673
02:07:22,112 --> 02:07:23,648
Which is now being repurposed

2674
02:07:23,904 --> 02:07:25,696
As people who are being spied on

2675
02:07:25,952 --> 02:07:30,048
Including Trump Alex Jones all this s***

2676
02:07:30,304 --> 02:07:32,352
600 million sound so f******

2677
02:07:32,608 --> 02:07:33,120
Made up

2678
02:07:33,888 --> 02:07:35,680
Where do you get 600 million documents

2679
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:37,728
Genuinely

2680
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:38,752
What

2681
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:42,592
What area of the government other than maybe that bulk

2682
02:07:42,848 --> 02:07:43,872
Metadata collection

2683
02:07:44,128 --> 02:07:45,408
System

2684
02:07:45,664 --> 02:07:46,944
Close to 600 million

2685
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:47,712
Everything

2686
02:07:48,224 --> 02:07:50,784
And even if it was about meditate

2687
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:51,552
Documents

2688
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:53,600
Point-by-point

2689
02:07:53,856 --> 02:07:55,648
GPS location

2690
02:07:56,160 --> 02:07:57,696
So where would you get

2691
02:07:57,952 --> 02:07:58,720
600 million.

2692
02:07:59,232 --> 02:08:01,024
And it would be like I said

2693
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:01,792
From

2694
02:08:02,048 --> 02:08:03,328
14 years

2695
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:09,472
Is it is there even that much information in the f****** Library of Congress

2696
02:08:09,984 --> 02:08:13,824
In The Archives of all the stuff

2697
02:08:15,872 --> 02:08:18,176
Is a made-up game

2698
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:20,480
Jillian.

2699
02:08:23,808 --> 02:08:26,624
Point is that Larry klayman is coming out as a lawyer

2700
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:28,928
Being on Alex Jones

2701
02:08:29,184 --> 02:08:29,952
To discuss this stuff

2702
02:08:30,208 --> 02:08:31,744
Wyoming

2703
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:32,768
He is coming on

2704
02:08:34,304 --> 02:08:40,448
But he only has secondary knowledge of he has no idea what's actually in these documents

2705
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:41,472
Exact

2706
02:08:41,984 --> 02:08:47,360
How old is much like Rodger Stone on his doctor's appointment they can't repeat that

2707
02:08:47,616 --> 02:08:49,920
Regal Theater on July 5th

2708
02:08:50,176 --> 02:08:50,944
Yeah

2709
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:53,504
If these same games that are so it

2710
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:55,296
It's propaganda even though

2711
02:08:55,552 --> 02:08:56,064
Right

2712
02:08:56,576 --> 02:08:57,088
You got

2713
02:08:57,344 --> 02:08:58,368
600 million

2714
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:04,000
I don't know I just

2715
02:09:04,256 --> 02:09:07,584
You got to get a taste of the coke to make sure that it's real I'd be so scared

2716
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:09,632
You don't

2717
02:09:09,888 --> 02:09:16,032
I probably run away that's why you don't buy my drugs

2718
02:09:16,288 --> 02:09:17,312
Freeman run the other direction

2719
02:09:17,568 --> 02:09:19,616
I like I don't want anything

2720
02:09:20,128 --> 02:09:20,896
As everybody knows

2721
02:09:21,664 --> 02:09:24,736
You take your Coke pinky nail

2722
02:09:25,248 --> 02:09:26,016
You put it into

2723
02:09:26,272 --> 02:09:27,296
You make sure the

2724
02:09:27,552 --> 02:09:28,320
The kokusai quote

2725
02:09:28,832 --> 02:09:30,112
So if it's next one

2726
02:09:31,904 --> 02:09:33,440
Is Clayman

2727
02:09:33,696 --> 02:09:34,208
Confirming

2728
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:35,232
He did

2729
02:09:35,488 --> 02:09:36,768
In fact disgusting

2730
02:09:37,024 --> 02:09:37,536
Things with

2731
02:09:37,792 --> 02:09:38,304
Devin Nunes

2732
02:09:40,864 --> 02:09:42,144
Come forward with information

2733
02:09:42,912 --> 02:09:44,192
And that's what we've done and we

2734
02:10:01,088 --> 02:10:04,160
Coming forward and then some

2735
02:10:06,976 --> 02:10:08,768
Either all of this is

2736
02:10:09,024 --> 02:10:14,912
Just a fantasy world lies there's a possibility

2737
02:10:15,168 --> 02:10:21,312
And that's where he shot and that's where he got a lot of this information that has led to this is very confusing.

2738
02:10:21,568 --> 02:10:22,592
History

2739
02:10:23,104 --> 02:10:26,944
Nunez is acting up and not certainly not acting as

2740
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:27,968
The house

2741
02:10:28,224 --> 02:10:30,016
Intelligence committee chairman

2742
02:10:32,064 --> 02:10:36,416
And if he is acting impact on this information that has its roots

2743
02:10:36,672 --> 02:10:38,464
And someone who has

2744
02:10:38,976 --> 02:10:41,280
Complete conman engaged

2745
02:10:41,536 --> 02:10:47,680
In habitual fraud

2746
02:10:48,192 --> 02:10:51,776
Said the document showed no indication of

2747
02:10:52,032 --> 02:10:54,848
I think all of this

2748
02:10:55,104 --> 02:10:57,408
I think it's like a zigzag

2749
02:10:57,664 --> 02:10:58,688
Nunez being shook

2750
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:00,224
Because there was

2751
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:03,040
Came out the other day about

2752
02:11:04,832 --> 02:11:08,672
The inner of the meetings that he had with the Turkish ambassador

2753
02:11:08,928 --> 02:11:10,208
About

2754
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:11,232
Extraditing

2755
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:12,512
Gulen guy

2756
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:15,328
Turkey

2757
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:16,864
52b

2758
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:19,424
Erdogan believes that this

2759
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:21,728
Cleric was responsible for

2760
02:11:21,984 --> 02:11:23,008
The fake poop

2761
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:26,848
I'm pretty sure it was

2762
02:11:27,104 --> 02:11:27,616
Totally

2763
02:11:28,128 --> 02:11:29,920
He wants this guy extradited

2764
02:11:30,176 --> 02:11:30,944
United States

2765
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:32,224
Does not believe

2766
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:32,992
The appropriate

2767
02:11:33,248 --> 02:11:34,784
I have Flynn was being paid

2768
02:11:35,296 --> 02:11:36,320
To help extradite

2769
02:11:37,344 --> 02:11:38,368
That came out

2770
02:11:38,624 --> 02:11:39,648
The meeting

2771
02:11:39,904 --> 02:11:40,928
Between Flynn

2772
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:42,208
And the Turkish ambassador

2773
02:11:42,464 --> 02:11:44,000
Was also attended by Devin Nunes

2774
02:11:45,024 --> 02:11:45,792
He was also there

2775
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:46,816
Really

2776
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:51,168
So now we sit with the information

2777
02:11:51,424 --> 02:11:54,240
Because now we have information that may

2778
02:11:58,080 --> 02:12:00,640
Yeah at this point on Steven Weber recording this

2779
02:12:00,896 --> 02:12:01,408
Donut

2780
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:04,224
Connecticut to come out

2781
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:06,528
There's indications and sources

2782
02:12:06,784 --> 02:12:10,880
Anonymous sources are indicating that he might have cut a deal

2783
02:12:11,648 --> 02:12:16,256
Anonymous sources are Anonymous sources are the grain of salt

2784
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:21,632
This is a possibility

2785
02:12:21,888 --> 02:12:25,472
Possible it's not proven it's not.

2786
02:12:26,752 --> 02:12:28,032
Part the only part

2787
02:12:28,288 --> 02:12:29,824
That's hard to swallow

2788
02:12:31,104 --> 02:12:32,128
If you look at all of this

2789
02:12:33,152 --> 02:12:34,688
Everybody would go down

2790
02:12:34,944 --> 02:12:36,224
Yeah

2791
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:37,504
Genuinely

2792
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:39,040
The entire government

2793
02:12:39,296 --> 02:12:40,064
Get taken down

2794
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:41,600
From top to bottom

2795
02:12:41,856 --> 02:12:43,904
Not everyone everyone but like

2796
02:12:48,256 --> 02:12:49,024
Big a deal as we

2797
02:12:51,072 --> 02:12:54,144
It's hard to say I think the truth is probably somewhere in between

2798
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:55,936
But the reality is that like

2799
02:12:56,192 --> 02:12:57,728
All that stuff that isn't

2800
02:12:58,240 --> 02:12:59,008
We can't prove

2801
02:12:59,776 --> 02:13:05,920
We can prove that Nunez was in that meeting with flan and the Turkish Ambassador attacked doesn't look good

2802
02:13:06,176 --> 02:13:07,968
New nurses in the f****** balls of

2803
02:13:09,248 --> 02:13:09,760
And

2804
02:13:10,016 --> 02:13:11,040
Newness has given

2805
02:13:11,296 --> 02:13:11,808
Handy's

2806
02:13:12,832 --> 02:13:13,600
With a little bit of prostate

2807
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:20,512
Imitation of him disappearing the night before he went to the White House

2808
02:13:20,768 --> 02:13:22,048
Apparently meeting with somebody

2809
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:23,840
Like there's a lot of stuff that's

2810
02:13:24,096 --> 02:13:24,864
Real f*****-up

2811
02:13:25,120 --> 02:13:26,144
Yeah so

2812
02:13:29,472 --> 02:13:29,984
The shutdown for

2813
02:13:30,752 --> 02:13:32,544
My thought nobody should be allowed to do any

2814
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:36,640
My thought is that I don't think he was meeting with Larry klayman that night

2815
02:13:37,664 --> 02:13:39,456
But some of that stuff does relate

2816
02:13:39,712 --> 02:13:40,992
To this

2817
02:13:41,248 --> 02:13:41,760
We meeting with Larry

2818
02:13:42,784 --> 02:13:44,320
It's possible

2819
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:47,392
I don't know

2820
02:13:47,904 --> 02:13:52,768
He's one of those guys who I don't care if he's alive today so I have no idea

2821
02:13:53,024 --> 02:13:54,048
Great

2822
02:13:55,328 --> 02:13:57,888
Is essentially that a lot of his stuff

2823
02:13:58,144 --> 02:14:01,216
Nunez's Behavior

2824
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:03,008
Singularly

2825
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:05,312
Motivated at 5 is Montgomery in

2826
02:14:05,568 --> 02:14:06,336
Information which weave

2827
02:14:07,104 --> 02:14:09,152
Pretty clearly I think on this episode

2828
02:14:10,432 --> 02:14:11,712
Idle take

2829
02:14:12,992 --> 02:14:13,504
Much clearer that is

2830
02:14:16,064 --> 02:14:16,576
Part of

2831
02:14:17,088 --> 02:14:17,856
His behavior was

2832
02:14:18,112 --> 02:14:18,624
Is influenced by

2833
02:14:19,136 --> 02:14:20,928
Clayman and Montgomery Inn

2834
02:14:22,208 --> 02:14:24,256
Also the conspiracy theory Community is

2835
02:14:24,512 --> 02:14:25,024
Is a flame

2836
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:26,816
There's a lot of like on the blog

2837
02:14:27,328 --> 02:14:28,096
Another message board

2838
02:14:28,352 --> 02:14:31,424
Why are people investigating Montgomery

2839
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:32,704
I just did

2840
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:37,312
Yeah suck it this is even more this is kind of even more

2841
02:14:37,568 --> 02:14:38,592
Interesting is that

2842
02:14:42,432 --> 02:14:43,456
Conspiracy theory blogs

2843
02:14:43,712 --> 02:14:44,224
And yet the same

2844
02:14:44,736 --> 02:14:45,248
It's hard not to

2845
02:14:45,504 --> 02:14:46,784
To look at reality and go

2846
02:14:47,552 --> 02:14:48,832
Some kind of conspiracy

2847
02:14:49,088 --> 02:14:50,880
Spira see is happening

2848
02:14:51,136 --> 02:14:51,648
Been stuck

2849
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:52,672
Pump fluid

2850
02:14:52,928 --> 02:14:53,696
Of idiot

2851
02:14:54,208 --> 02:14:56,256
Happening all the same time

2852
02:14:56,512 --> 02:14:59,328
Weird coincidence

2853
02:15:00,864 --> 02:15:02,656
Almost as likely as anything else

2854
02:15:02,912 --> 02:15:04,960
I think you just as likely

2855
02:15:05,216 --> 02:15:07,008
Like with the Montgomery thing right

2856
02:15:07,264 --> 02:15:09,056
Those idiots believe

2857
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:12,640
It's just as likely what's going on right now is that everybody

2858
02:15:15,968 --> 02:15:16,480
Conspiracy

2859
02:15:16,736 --> 02:15:17,248
Bushfire

2860
02:15:18,784 --> 02:15:22,112
I think that I've been wanting to bring up for a while and I'll

2861
02:15:22,368 --> 02:15:22,880
Deal with

2862
02:15:23,136 --> 02:15:23,904
Go to slightly

2863
02:15:25,184 --> 02:15:28,512
Liar Alex Jones

2864
02:15:28,768 --> 02:15:29,280
Stuff is b*******

2865
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:30,816
I don't want

2866
02:15:31,328 --> 02:15:32,352
Paint with a broad brush

2867
02:15:32,608 --> 02:15:34,400
All people who believe in conspiracy theories

2868
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:40,288
People who are very smart and real good research

2869
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:41,568
Video

2870
02:15:43,872 --> 02:15:45,152
The entire conspiracy community

2871
02:15:45,664 --> 02:15:46,944
By attacking Alex Jones

2872
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:47,712
Is unfair

2873
02:15:47,968 --> 02:15:50,016
And I think that is easy to

2874
02:15:50,272 --> 02:15:51,808
Make that assumption if we're not clear about

2875
02:15:52,064 --> 02:15:54,880
There's a lot of people who also believe Alex Jones is full of s***

2876
02:15:55,136 --> 02:15:55,648
Believing

2877
02:15:55,904 --> 02:15:57,184
Conspiracies

2878
02:15:57,440 --> 02:15:58,976
There goes there are

2879
02:15:59,232 --> 02:16:00,256
Chemtrails got a cam

2880
02:16:00,512 --> 02:16:05,376
Sure there are not stupid crazy people in that world

2881
02:16:05,632 --> 02:16:06,912
There is a lot of stupid

2882
02:16:07,936 --> 02:16:09,472
And we fall somewhere

2883
02:16:11,264 --> 02:16:11,776
Absolutely

2884
02:16:12,032 --> 02:16:13,056
So this next clip

2885
02:16:13,312 --> 02:16:16,896
Is Larry klayman explaining why this is a matter of

2886
02:16:17,408 --> 02:16:18,176
Immediate

2887
02:16:18,432 --> 02:16:18,944
Importance

2888
02:16:19,456 --> 02:16:21,760
Do something that has to be dealt with Now or Never

2889
02:16:22,528 --> 02:16:26,112
Exactly like how we need to finally get to the bottom of it

2890
02:16:26,368 --> 02:16:30,720
Certificate Lord never will file three court cases about it

2891
02:17:01,696 --> 02:17:03,488
He's risked his life

2892
02:17:03,744 --> 02:17:04,256
Please come forward

2893
02:17:04,512 --> 02:17:07,840
You know how a brain aneurysm works right like

2894
02:17:08,352 --> 02:17:09,120
Just died from a brain

2895
02:17:09,376 --> 02:17:10,144
Aneurysm

2896
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:11,168
Yeah

2897
02:17:16,544 --> 02:17:18,592
Any moment he needs to be interview right now

2898
02:17:18,848 --> 02:17:20,384
But again it's just right

2899
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:26,784
Create a sense of immediacy about it it's also trying to create sort of a tragic hero story around this

2900
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:28,064
Obvious liar

2901
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:29,344
What possible

2902
02:17:31,648 --> 02:17:32,672
I'd like to interview

2903
02:17:32,928 --> 02:17:33,440
That's a good point

2904
02:17:33,696 --> 02:17:36,512
Colorado podcast

2905
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:38,816
I meant be him on all of our

2906
02:17:41,632 --> 02:17:42,144
Carnival

2907
02:17:42,656 --> 02:17:44,192
Who's next

2908
02:17:44,448 --> 02:17:45,216
Your perfect Sunday

2909
02:17:48,032 --> 02:17:48,544
First date

2910
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:50,336
Bistro or movie

2911
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:53,152
What is a bistro

2912
02:17:53,408 --> 02:17:54,176
No idea

2913
02:17:57,504 --> 02:18:00,576
You don't have it I legitimately think I flashback to like French class

2914
02:18:01,088 --> 02:18:05,184
I think my brain just like snack before midnight

2915
02:18:07,488 --> 02:18:09,024
Richard linklater

2916
02:18:10,816 --> 02:18:11,328
Two of Us movie

2917
02:18:12,096 --> 02:18:15,424
Anyway it's Richard linklater is out there

2918
02:18:16,448 --> 02:18:22,336
Exhausting

2919
02:18:22,848 --> 02:18:27,712
This next clip claimant gets into talking a little bit more about

2920
02:18:27,968 --> 02:18:31,808
Montgomery himself in a situation

2921
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:32,832
7

2922
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:42,048
Montgomery from

2923
02:18:45,632 --> 02:18:46,144
Alex

2924
02:18:53,312 --> 02:18:54,080
It's so easy

2925
02:18:54,336 --> 02:18:58,176
Unsuccessfully. It's so easy to destroy his credibility

2926
02:18:58,432 --> 02:19:00,480
All it took was like

2927
02:19:00,992 --> 02:19:02,272
A couple Google searches

2928
02:19:02,528 --> 02:19:03,552
Again Google

2929
02:19:03,808 --> 02:19:04,576
Injustice

2930
02:19:05,088 --> 02:19:06,368
Couple

2931
02:19:06,624 --> 02:19:07,136
Couple article

2932
02:19:07,648 --> 02:19:11,232
Like it's not that hard you find this guy is a massive

2933
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:12,512
Snake oil fill

2934
02:19:12,768 --> 02:19:13,536
Self-abuse

2935
02:19:13,792 --> 02:19:15,072
And if he wasn't

2936
02:19:15,584 --> 02:19:16,096
Being used

2937
02:19:16,352 --> 02:19:17,120
For propaganda

2938
02:19:17,376 --> 02:19:18,400
Purposes I agree with

2939
02:19:18,912 --> 02:19:19,424
He would be

2940
02:19:19,936 --> 02:19:21,472
It would be fun

2941
02:19:21,728 --> 02:19:27,872
Is he going to make it there's a there's a there's a there's always a part of me that's going to be on this side of the guy trying to f***

2942
02:19:28,128 --> 02:19:30,688
I think that there also is an archetype

2943
02:19:30,944 --> 02:19:32,480
Of that like down and out

2944
02:19:32,736 --> 02:19:34,784
Two-time loser gambling loser

2945
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:41,184
Kind of guy who just like try to pull one last for

2946
02:19:41,440 --> 02:19:43,488
We're all in Grain to pull for that

2947
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,048
Like we all want to see the little guy

2948
02:19:46,304 --> 02:19:49,632
Strike out against the system and it's unfortunate

2949
02:19:49,888 --> 02:19:53,728
That this little guy striking out against the system is being used

2950
02:19:53,984 --> 02:19:56,544
Propagandistic lie to support the system

2951
02:19:56,800 --> 02:19:57,312
Yeah it's

2952
02:19:57,568 --> 02:20:00,896
It's like we all want a Robinhood and they all wind up

2953
02:20:01,152 --> 02:20:04,992
Robin Hood Robin Hood is working for the Sheriff of Nottingham

2954
02:20:05,248 --> 02:20:06,272
Turns out

2955
02:20:06,528 --> 02:20:07,296
Yeah that's that's

2956
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:10,368
Monstera Sheriff of not

2957
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:11,904
You know what we got to get back

2958
02:20:13,184 --> 02:20:13,696
The most

2959
02:20:15,488 --> 02:20:20,608
That f****** nonsense the sheriff's movement all that stuff that's for another day

2960
02:20:25,216 --> 02:20:25,728
Inaccurate

2961
02:20:25,984 --> 02:20:28,288
That's the guy who wrote the book about

2962
02:20:28,544 --> 02:20:29,312
Involved

2963
02:20:32,128 --> 02:20:32,896
And again

2964
02:20:33,408 --> 02:20:34,176
Larry klayman

2965
02:20:34,432 --> 02:20:35,712
As lawyer for Dennis Montgomery

2966
02:20:36,224 --> 02:20:36,992
Sue this writer

2967
02:20:37,504 --> 02:20:38,272
Was unsuccessful

2968
02:20:38,784 --> 02:20:39,552
The case was thrown out

2969
02:20:40,064 --> 02:20:42,368
Of course so now you coming

2970
02:20:43,648 --> 02:20:44,672
You failed

2971
02:21:08,480 --> 02:21:09,504
Obama's immigration

2972
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:13,856
That didn't happen

2973
02:21:17,696 --> 02:21:19,744
Which is why we're proceeding on a separate track

2974
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:26,400
And he's a great man.

2975
02:21:27,424 --> 02:21:29,728
But I was just talked to him he's staying out of

2976
02:21:30,240 --> 02:21:31,008
He's staying out of

2977
02:21:31,264 --> 02:21:33,056
If you say Arpaio is a great man

2978
02:21:33,568 --> 02:21:34,592
I automatically with

2979
02:21:35,104 --> 02:21:38,944
You lose all The Sopranos

2980
02:21:39,456 --> 02:21:40,480
You do not belong in the

2981
02:21:40,736 --> 02:21:44,576
You one-hundred-percent or you're not at least you're not in touch

2982
02:21:44,832 --> 02:21:46,368
With your own Humana

2983
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:48,928
But then Alex being like

2984
02:21:49,184 --> 02:21:50,976
I'll talk to Arpaio you staying out of this

2985
02:21:51,744 --> 02:21:54,304
Our personal reason Arpaio said

2986
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:55,072
That

2987
02:21:55,584 --> 02:21:56,352
Montgomery's

2988
02:21:56,608 --> 02:21:57,632
Investigation was

2989
02:21:57,888 --> 02:21:58,400
Junk

2990
02:21:59,168 --> 02:21:59,936
That's a good reason

2991
02:22:00,192 --> 02:22:02,496
Stay out of it so now I want to bring this back

2992
02:22:02,752 --> 02:22:03,776
To this

2993
02:22:04,032 --> 02:22:04,544
Phoenix

2994
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:06,848
News article that I was talking about earlier

2995
02:22:07,104 --> 02:22:07,616
Right

2996
02:22:08,128 --> 02:22:09,152
I wanted I wanted

2997
02:22:09,408 --> 02:22:10,944
Play the song again Robert Young

2998
02:22:11,456 --> 02:22:12,480
Is the lawyer

2999
02:22:12,736 --> 02:22:13,248
Let's try encase

3000
02:22:14,784 --> 02:22:15,552
According to reports

3001
02:22:15,808 --> 02:22:19,136
Presented in court in November 2014 to outside experts with

3002
02:22:19,904 --> 02:22:22,976
Experience of the nsa's

3003
02:22:23,232 --> 02:22:24,000
For the Sheriff's Office

3004
02:22:24,512 --> 02:22:26,304
And concluded that Montgomery was quote

3005
02:22:26,560 --> 02:22:28,096
A complete and total fraud

3006
02:22:32,448 --> 02:22:34,496
Young brought this up in court to Arpaio

3007
02:22:35,008 --> 02:22:36,032
Quote

3008
02:22:36,544 --> 02:22:38,848
At least by November 2014

3009
02:22:39,104 --> 02:22:41,408
You knew Dennis Montgomery was a fraud

3010
02:22:42,176 --> 02:22:43,200
The question

3011
02:22:44,736 --> 02:22:46,016
That was putting it lightly

3012
02:22:46,272 --> 02:22:49,088
Arpaio said

3013
02:22:54,464 --> 02:22:58,816
That was putting it lightly Arpaio said noted they have been working

3014
02:22:59,072 --> 02:23:01,888
They've been working Montgomery for a year at that point

3015
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:03,680
So we decided to

3016
02:23:03,936 --> 02:23:04,448
To stop paying

3017
02:23:05,216 --> 02:23:11,360
Young went on to present email records showing members of arpaio's team we're still in touch with

3018
02:23:12,384 --> 02:23:13,920
After that into 2015

3019
02:23:15,456 --> 02:23:20,320
Would a law enforcement officer have to be incredibly stupid to continue working with someone known to be a

3020
02:23:20,576 --> 02:23:21,856
Total fraud

3021
02:23:22,112 --> 02:23:22,624
Young ass

3022
02:23:23,136 --> 02:23:25,440
Arpaio's Attorney John Masterson objective

3023
02:23:25,696 --> 02:23:26,208
The question

3024
02:23:26,464 --> 02:23:27,744
Which judge snow system

3025
02:23:28,768 --> 02:23:30,304
How can you say that

3026
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:34,912
Okay technically that is

3027
02:23:38,752 --> 02:23:40,544
I'm going to go with you

3028
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:42,592
The answer is as humans is a

3029
02:23:42,848 --> 02:23:44,640
The fair question in court

3030
02:23:44,896 --> 02:23:46,688
Probably

3031
02:23:46,944 --> 02:23:50,784
Masterson accused young of insulting

3032
02:23:51,296 --> 02:23:52,320
Younger

3033
02:23:52,576 --> 02:23:53,600
Reminded are piled

3034
02:23:53,856 --> 02:23:57,696
The judge snow had asked him in April weather Montgomery

3035
02:23:58,208 --> 02:23:59,744
And never brought up the

3036
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:00,512
Blinds

3037
02:24:00,768 --> 02:24:01,792
Begin where the faxes

3038
02:24:02,048 --> 02:24:03,328
With the weird type writing on the back

3039
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:05,888
Or other documents Montgomery had made

3040
02:24:06,144 --> 02:24:07,424
That included judge snow

3041
02:24:07,936 --> 02:24:10,752
Quote I never saw the timeline when he asked me the question

3042
02:24:11,008 --> 02:24:11,776
Arpaio said

3043
02:24:12,288 --> 02:24:13,824
Do you regret not

3044
02:24:14,080 --> 02:24:15,872
Telling him those things that April young a

3045
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:18,176
Quote in retrospect

3046
02:24:18,432 --> 02:24:21,248
Maybe I should have brought it up but it never came to my mind at that time

3047
02:24:21,504 --> 02:24:23,808
Arpaio set

3048
02:24:27,136 --> 02:24:28,416
So f*** you

3049
02:24:32,512 --> 02:24:33,024
Is really not

3050
02:24:33,792 --> 02:24:34,560
Really relevant

3051
02:24:34,816 --> 02:24:36,608
He's admitted in court

3052
02:24:36,864 --> 02:24:38,912
That this guy is a complete and total fraud

3053
02:24:40,192 --> 02:24:40,960
Admitted

3054
02:24:41,216 --> 02:24:43,520
She kept working with him or his Department

3055
02:24:45,824 --> 02:24:47,360
After an essay

3056
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:52,736
Investigators evaluated his hard drives as a fraud

3057
02:24:52,992 --> 02:24:55,552
This is again this is like Marie Le Pen fascist

3058
02:24:55,808 --> 02:24:56,320
Situation

3059
02:24:56,576 --> 02:24:57,856
You should be allowed to prove

3060
02:25:00,160 --> 02:25:00,672
I think

3061
02:25:00,928 --> 02:25:02,976
It is a legal imperative

3062
02:25:03,232 --> 02:25:05,536
The only reason I disagree is.

3063
02:25:05,792 --> 02:25:06,816
It's irrelevant

3064
02:25:07,072 --> 02:25:07,584
Like that

3065
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:11,424
If you were to bring a court case

3066
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:13,728
Specifically designed to prove that he's an idiot

3067
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:14,752
That it's relevant

3068
02:25:15,264 --> 02:25:15,776
But because it's a

3069
02:25:16,032 --> 02:25:17,056
Contempt of court case

3070
02:25:17,312 --> 02:25:18,080
Haha it's

3071
02:25:18,848 --> 02:25:20,384
It's irrelevant to the matter at hand

3072
02:25:21,920 --> 02:25:23,456
Are you an idiot

3073
02:25:23,968 --> 02:25:29,088
Which I still love that the Apollo in the eventual death penalty

3074
02:25:29,344 --> 02:25:29,856
Should be under

3075
02:25:30,368 --> 02:25:30,880
You

3076
02:25:31,136 --> 02:25:31,904
Probably should

3077
02:25:33,184 --> 02:25:33,952
Unless you're in text

3078
02:25:36,256 --> 02:25:39,328
At this point play Michigan

3079
02:25:40,096 --> 02:25:40,608
You should exit

3080
02:25:41,888 --> 02:25:42,400
I don't

3081
02:25:42,656 --> 02:25:43,424
I think he doesn't deserve it

3082
02:25:44,192 --> 02:25:46,240
I'd like to see a court trial though

3083
02:25:46,496 --> 02:25:49,056
I don't want any violence to happen

3084
02:25:49,312 --> 02:25:50,848
Come to him except for sanction

3085
02:25:51,104 --> 02:25:51,616
Because of his ass

3086
02:25:51,872 --> 02:25:54,176
Don't believe in the death penalty believe that

3087
02:25:54,432 --> 02:26:00,576
I want to be clear that me and Jordan know a ton more than is on this podcast

3088
02:26:00,832 --> 02:26:02,624
And please look into Joe arpaio's history

3089
02:26:03,648 --> 02:26:08,000
Based on what we wanted our

3090
02:26:08,256 --> 02:26:12,608
Not even close we had to edit some stuff out

3091
02:26:12,864 --> 02:26:13,632
Nearly

3092
02:26:17,984 --> 02:26:19,520
We had to pause I had to

3093
02:26:19,776 --> 02:26:25,664
Go outside and walk around just based on how bad

3094
02:26:26,176 --> 02:26:28,992
So please look into that again or files a monster

3095
02:26:30,528 --> 02:26:32,320
We have to get back to the matter at hand which is

3096
02:26:32,576 --> 02:26:33,600
This interview with Larry klayman

3097
02:26:33,856 --> 02:26:34,880
Where he insist

3098
02:26:37,184 --> 02:26:38,976
Incredible and then beyond

3099
02:26:39,488 --> 02:26:41,280
He goes to lay the blame

3100
02:26:43,072 --> 02:26:43,840
The Trump spying

3101
02:26:44,096 --> 02:26:44,864
And all this s***

3102
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:47,424
On people who are no longer

3103
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:50,240
The current predicament

3104
02:26:50,496 --> 02:26:51,264
Is the Fault

3105
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:52,800
A people who have not been

3106
02:26:53,056 --> 02:26:53,824
Involved

3107
02:26:54,080 --> 02:26:55,872
For quite a while

3108
02:27:00,992 --> 02:27:05,088
Conference

3109
02:27:05,344 --> 02:27:09,184
I don't know what's going on I don't know why that hasn't happened

3110
02:27:15,328 --> 02:27:17,376
Are we clear

3111
02:27:17,632 --> 02:27:23,776
Generally agreeable a lot of times

3112
02:27:24,032 --> 02:27:30,176
The grain of salt

3113
02:27:30,688 --> 02:27:31,200
They're sharing

3114
02:27:33,248 --> 02:27:34,016
Not

3115
02:27:34,528 --> 02:27:39,648
Sometimes it's manipulative sometimes it is people protecting their

3116
02:27:39,904 --> 02:27:42,208
It goes both ways sometimes it is legit sometimes

3117
02:27:43,744 --> 02:27:45,024
Dino Dan

3118
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:46,304
There's a very

3119
02:27:47,328 --> 02:27:48,864
The message

3120
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:49,632
The message

3121
02:27:49,888 --> 02:27:53,472
I think that is most important is that intelligence communities dualite

3122
02:27:53,728 --> 02:27:54,752
It's people a lot of the time

3123
02:27:55,264 --> 02:27:58,592
But sometimes you should look for evidence

3124
02:27:58,848 --> 02:28:00,128
You should look for truth

3125
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:01,408
As opposed to

3126
02:28:02,432 --> 02:28:03,712
Disbelieving

3127
02:28:03,968 --> 02:28:04,736
But things are said to be

3128
02:28:06,528 --> 02:28:07,552
Take things as

3129
02:28:07,808 --> 02:28:08,320
They come to

3130
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:10,368
Look for fat

3131
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:13,952
Having knowledge

3132
02:28:15,744 --> 02:28:16,512
I've realized

3133
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:18,304
Legitimately

3134
02:28:19,328 --> 02:28:20,096
Legitimately

3135
02:28:20,608 --> 02:28:21,120
That was this

3136
02:28:21,376 --> 02:28:23,424
Smoothest you've ever been

3137
02:28:28,544 --> 02:28:34,432
Legitimately I'm getting to the point where I'm realizing that if I ever want this to take off I'm going to have to start mimicking some of Alex Jones's behaviors

3138
02:28:34,688 --> 02:28:38,528
So I'm going to start with look for dumbfucks

3139
02:28:38,784 --> 02:28:40,320
Meanwhile our listeners

3140
02:28:40,576 --> 02:28:41,344
Are really awesome

3141
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:42,624
And they're really cool

3142
02:28:42,880 --> 02:28:44,160
Yeah I don't think that you guys are

3143
02:28:45,440 --> 02:28:45,952
Maybe a couple

3144
02:28:48,256 --> 02:28:51,328
Assuming we have like

3145
02:28:51,584 --> 02:28:53,120
Statistically

3146
02:28:56,960 --> 02:28:58,240
But I got to assume there's something

3147
02:29:04,896 --> 02:29:07,456
Guys guys we've had a we had a rough Park

3148
02:29:09,248 --> 02:29:13,344
I have just learned more about Joe Arpaio deal understand where we're coming from

3149
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:17,696
Blame the wine for me being smooth and for me lashing out hypothetical listener

3150
02:29:18,208 --> 02:29:22,816
The Android record on Wednesdays Wednesdays is Dan therapy day

3151
02:29:23,328 --> 02:29:26,400
Anyway here we go back back to this where he blames like

3152
02:29:26,656 --> 02:29:27,168
Clapper

3153
02:29:29,728 --> 02:29:30,496
I think I've done it

3154
02:29:32,032 --> 02:29:32,800
Punch

3155
02:29:37,152 --> 02:29:42,272
The Director of National Intelligence

3156
02:29:46,880 --> 02:29:50,464
To get rid of all these dudes who are no longer in office

3157
02:29:52,256 --> 02:29:53,280
Flapper is not

3158
02:29:55,584 --> 02:29:56,352
Got to get rid of them

3159
02:30:00,448 --> 02:30:04,544
John

3160
02:30:08,128 --> 02:30:11,456
I think the example that Alex keep going back to is that

3161
02:30:12,480 --> 02:30:14,272
Clapper

3162
02:30:14,528 --> 02:30:15,552
John Brennan

3163
02:30:15,808 --> 02:30:17,600
Who I was

3164
02:30:20,672 --> 02:30:21,184
God

3165
02:30:21,440 --> 02:30:22,464
In between him

3166
02:30:22,976 --> 02:30:25,536
Sworn you said that you should watch his mouth

3167
02:30:26,048 --> 02:30:27,584
He should be careful about things he said

3168
02:30:32,192 --> 02:30:37,056
Motherfuking watch your mouth I mean talks kind of message

3169
02:30:38,336 --> 02:30:44,480
I get I get where Alex's interpretation of it being like people I watch am out

3170
02:30:45,248 --> 02:30:51,392
I know that Floyd has racial connotations

3171
02:30:51,904 --> 02:30:55,232
Play I get where Alex takes

3172
02:30:55,488 --> 02:30:59,840
Some umbrage at that but I also would understand how anybody was in

3173
02:31:00,096 --> 02:31:00,608
Community

3174
02:31:00,864 --> 02:31:01,632
Noises mistake

3175
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:04,192
Of the president running his mouth

3176
02:31:04,448 --> 02:31:06,496
Are you can piss off foreign powers

3177
02:31:06,752 --> 02:31:07,520
Accidentally

3178
02:31:10,848 --> 02:31:12,896
Well you didn't even f****** shake merkel's hands like a

3179
02:31:13,152 --> 02:31:17,504
Put these things to insult foreign powers that are our allies

3180
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:18,528
Who have deep

3181
02:31:19,552 --> 02:31:20,064
Jeep

3182
02:31:20,576 --> 02:31:21,856
Blood-filled

3183
02:31:22,112 --> 02:31:22,624
Alliances

3184
02:31:23,904 --> 02:31:24,928
And he can insult them

3185
02:31:25,184 --> 02:31:26,208
And you should watch your mouth

3186
02:31:26,720 --> 02:31:29,024
You should be really careful what you say

3187
02:31:30,816 --> 02:31:31,328
Diplomacy

3188
02:31:32,352 --> 02:31:34,144
Now there's a reason we have

3189
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:35,424
A department

3190
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:36,960
Hayirli devoted to

3191
02:31:37,216 --> 02:31:37,728
Diplomacy

3192
02:31:38,496 --> 02:31:39,264
And there's a reason

3193
02:31:39,776 --> 02:31:40,288
Filled

3194
02:31:41,312 --> 02:31:41,824
With people

3195
02:31:42,848 --> 02:31:43,360
Or diplomat

3196
02:31:43,872 --> 02:31:44,640
Instead

3197
02:31:45,152 --> 02:31:51,296
Who actually has been quoted

3198
02:31:51,552 --> 02:31:52,832
Sing he didn't want the job

3199
02:31:53,344 --> 02:31:54,112
And his wife

3200
02:31:55,136 --> 02:31:55,648
Do it

3201
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:58,208
And then they have not stuff that

3202
02:31:58,464 --> 02:32:00,512
Department

3203
02:32:00,768 --> 02:32:01,792
Everybody

3204
02:32:02,304 --> 02:32:02,816
It confused

3205
02:32:04,096 --> 02:32:06,144
And now it started

3206
02:32:06,400 --> 02:32:11,008
Bomb North Korea

3207
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:13,312
Rr4 but you know

3208
02:32:13,568 --> 02:32:14,080
Like it

3209
02:32:14,336 --> 02:32:15,104
It's strange

3210
02:32:15,616 --> 02:32:16,384
To be so obsessed

3211
02:32:16,640 --> 02:32:17,664
With domestic policy

3212
02:32:19,456 --> 02:32:22,528
The shed out of Syria killing more civilians than we've killed

3213
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:23,552
So long

3214
02:32:23,808 --> 02:32:24,832
Repeat very

3215
02:32:25,088 --> 02:32:25,600
Non

3216
02:32:25,856 --> 02:32:26,880
Like it's not even

3217
02:32:27,136 --> 02:32:28,416
Defensible the variability

3218
02:32:28,672 --> 02:32:31,744
Retarget offended so many of our allies

3219
02:32:32,768 --> 02:32:33,792
When we

3220
02:32:34,304 --> 02:32:34,816
Threatened

3221
02:32:35,072 --> 02:32:36,096
So many countries

3222
02:32:36,352 --> 02:32:37,632
This is why

3223
02:32:38,656 --> 02:32:41,216
This is Larry klayman saying that everything in the world

3224
02:32:41,472 --> 02:32:41,984
Essentially is Obama

3225
02:32:42,496 --> 02:32:43,008
Excellent

3226
02:32:46,336 --> 02:32:46,848
I'm certain

3227
02:32:52,480 --> 02:32:54,784
Again he's talking about all this information

3228
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:55,552
That Montgomery

3229
02:32:55,808 --> 02:32:56,832
But he hasn't looked

3230
02:32:57,088 --> 02:32:58,368
From before Obama's

3231
02:32:58,624 --> 02:33:00,672
So again he's sure that it's all about

3232
02:33:01,184 --> 02:33:02,208
Probably

3233
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,560
Great I'll take your word for it lady claiming guy who is

3234
02:33:07,072 --> 02:33:08,096
Clearly I'm credit

3235
02:33:10,144 --> 02:33:13,728
Sure they always

3236
02:33:13,984 --> 02:33:18,336
It was a bubble bomb originally

3237
02:33:18,592 --> 02:33:19,872
About Obama

3238
02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:22,176
Obama open

3239
02:33:31,904 --> 02:33:37,536
Other countries

3240
02:33:40,352 --> 02:33:43,680
That'll super unfortunate

3241
02:33:43,936 --> 02:33:47,008
And if it's Dominic zample like

3242
02:33:47,520 --> 02:33:50,080
Brazil recently had a coup you know

3243
02:33:52,384 --> 02:33:55,200
The ones where they hold their leaders responsible

3244
02:33:55,456 --> 02:34:01,600
Benjamin Netanyahu has never been held responsible for any of the

3245
02:34:02,112 --> 02:34:04,160
Literally not allowed to run for

3246
02:34:04,416 --> 02:34:06,464
Is legally bar

3247
02:34:06,720 --> 02:34:10,816
Currently home

3248
02:34:12,096 --> 02:34:13,376
Doorly illegal

3249
02:34:13,632 --> 02:34:18,496
So he uses these two countries as an example to make a point

3250
02:34:18,752 --> 02:34:20,032
Long is no longer the president

3251
02:34:20,288 --> 02:34:22,592
Needs to be held responsible for b*******

3252
02:34:22,848 --> 02:34:26,688
Why's that

3253
02:34:30,784 --> 02:34:31,808
It's incredibly

3254
02:34:32,064 --> 02:34:33,344
It is insane like you could

3255
02:34:34,624 --> 02:34:38,976
It's the FBI buying software based on Al jazeera's barcode

3256
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:41,024
Yeah it's right up

3257
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:44,352
Italia

3258
02:34:44,608 --> 02:34:45,120
Cuisine

3259
02:34:45,632 --> 02:34:49,216
That's the last clip that I have for Larry clayman's interview

3260
02:34:49,472 --> 02:34:53,056
If you want to know more about him and you want him to speak

3261
02:34:53,568 --> 02:34:54,336
Checkers

3262
02:34:55,872 --> 02:34:57,152
He probably has written books

3263
02:34:57,408 --> 02:34:58,944
I didn't look into that

3264
02:34:59,200 --> 02:34:59,968
If you want to

3265
02:35:00,224 --> 02:35:00,736
He or his

3266
02:35:00,992 --> 02:35:02,272
Entire argument laid out

3267
02:35:02,528 --> 02:35:03,296
I will link it

3268
02:35:03,552 --> 02:35:04,320
On the website

3269
02:35:04,576 --> 02:35:06,112
He has an article that he wrote

3270
02:35:06,368 --> 02:35:06,880
Newsmax

3271
02:35:07,392 --> 02:35:09,440
That just lays out his entire argument

3272
02:35:09,952 --> 02:35:10,720
About Montgomery

3273
02:35:10,976 --> 02:35:12,512
It's all lies

3274
02:35:12,768 --> 02:35:13,792
But at least

3275
02:35:14,048 --> 02:35:14,816
If you go there

3276
02:35:15,072 --> 02:35:15,840
It's basically all the stuff

3277
02:35:16,096 --> 02:35:16,864
My cut out from the

3278
02:35:17,888 --> 02:35:19,424
Cuz it's just boring and a lot of it

3279
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:20,960
It was covered by Mike zullo

3280
02:35:21,472 --> 02:35:23,264
A lot of it is just repetitious

3281
02:35:23,776 --> 02:35:24,544
Here is a

3282
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:25,312
The Funplex

3283
02:35:26,592 --> 02:35:27,616
Play man doesn't say anything

3284
02:35:27,872 --> 02:35:28,896
Because Alex Jones

3285
02:35:29,664 --> 02:35:30,944
Just trying to

3286
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:33,760
Really desperately make you believe

3287
02:35:34,016 --> 02:35:35,296
The people he has on his show

3288
02:35:35,552 --> 02:35:36,064
Are real

3289
02:35:36,832 --> 02:35:38,112
Manchester

3290
02:35:38,368 --> 02:35:38,880
Not

3291
02:35:39,136 --> 02:35:41,184
Sesame Street puppets

3292
02:35:49,888 --> 02:35:53,472
Sometimes you know

3293
02:35:53,728 --> 02:35:58,080
Fake Pizza Gastrology

3294
02:35:58,336 --> 02:35:58,848
Hey Jude

3295
02:35:59,104 --> 02:36:05,248
Yeah so I mean like your death to 99% accurate

3296
02:36:05,504 --> 02:36:06,528
Don't know how you would

3297
02:36:06,784 --> 02:36:07,552
Quantify what

3298
02:36:07,808 --> 02:36:11,392
Percent your guests are accurate but I know that if there was a system

3299
02:36:11,648 --> 02:36:12,672
99%

3300
02:36:12,928 --> 02:36:13,440
Ambitious

3301
02:36:16,768 --> 02:36:18,560
People news site 99%

3302
02:36:18,816 --> 02:36:20,608
Seems ambitious right I think the most

3303
02:36:20,864 --> 02:36:22,656
Spectabile new sources that I trust

3304
02:36:23,168 --> 02:36:24,192
Have maybe 80

3305
02:36:24,448 --> 02:36:27,776
Yeah 75% is amazing

3306
02:36:28,032 --> 02:36:29,568
Sing to me

3307
02:36:32,384 --> 02:36:35,200
Like I said I told you on the last episode of and reading foreign policy

3308
02:36:35,456 --> 02:36:36,736
And a lot of 0

3309
02:36:36,992 --> 02:36:37,504
Imma walk

3310
02:36:37,760 --> 02:36:43,904
A lot of stuff that I've been reading in the area it seems incredibly probably looked into things that are cited

3311
02:36:46,208 --> 02:36:49,536
But I still think they get things wrong from time to time

3312
02:36:49,792 --> 02:36:51,072
It's every Citizen's

3313
02:36:51,328 --> 02:36:52,864
Responsibility to take in

3314
02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:54,400
Media and news

3315
02:36:55,680 --> 02:36:56,192
Evaluate

3316
02:36:57,216 --> 02:36:58,496
That's your responsibility

3317
02:36:58,752 --> 02:37:01,824
It's not the media's responsibility to your right every time

3318
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:02,848
When they're wrong

3319
02:37:03,104 --> 02:37:04,384
It is the responsibility

3320
02:37:04,640 --> 02:37:05,408
To own up to it

3321
02:37:05,664 --> 02:37:07,712
Exactly correction

3322
02:37:08,224 --> 02:37:10,016
To make sure that everybody knows that

3323
02:37:10,528 --> 02:37:12,832
Which place is like the New York Times Washington Post

3324
02:37:13,088 --> 02:37:13,600
These sorts of

3325
02:37:13,856 --> 02:37:15,392
Bushman

3326
02:37:16,416 --> 02:37:16,928
Do

3327
02:37:17,184 --> 02:37:17,952
On a regular

3328
02:37:18,208 --> 02:37:20,256
They do they perhaps.

3329
02:37:20,512 --> 02:37:22,048
Do as loudly as baby

3330
02:37:22,304 --> 02:37:23,840
Should

3331
02:37:24,096 --> 02:37:25,376
Yeah

3332
02:37:25,888 --> 02:37:29,728
It's unfortunate because this weekend again Alex Jones came out with his

3333
02:37:29,984 --> 02:37:31,008
Apology about pizza

3334
02:37:34,592 --> 02:37:35,360
Nope

3335
02:37:35,616 --> 02:37:36,384
He never does

3336
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:39,200
And this piece of apology is not evidence that he doesn't

3337
02:37:39,712 --> 02:37:42,784
Cuz even packaged with entomology

3338
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:47,648
Throwing other news organizations logo

3339
02:37:47,904 --> 02:37:54,048
But hey they said it we're reporting on it what do you want to do

3340
02:37:54,304 --> 02:37:55,328
Sing other people it wasn't

3341
02:37:56,608 --> 02:37:58,656
Do not doing our due diligence

3342
02:37:58,912 --> 02:38:02,752
Yeah and if they had done any due-diligence they never would have reported any of this

3343
02:38:05,312 --> 02:38:07,616
The news Outlet

3344
02:38:07,872 --> 02:38:09,408
And I did my due diligence about pizza

3345
02:38:09,920 --> 02:38:10,432
YouTube

3346
02:38:11,712 --> 02:38:17,344
Not about

3347
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:21,696
Clips that are just kind of fun

3348
02:38:21,952 --> 02:38:24,256
This one

3349
02:38:24,512 --> 02:38:25,024
This one

3350
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:26,560
Jerome corsi

3351
02:38:27,072 --> 02:38:33,216
Has been he wasn't on the phone during the Playman interview

3352
02:38:33,472 --> 02:38:34,496
Unicorn singing

3353
02:38:34,752 --> 02:38:36,544
Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah

3354
02:38:36,800 --> 02:38:38,080
Slightly racist Disney song

3355
02:38:38,848 --> 02:38:40,384
This one is

3356
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:41,664
I don't know why that came to my head

3357
02:38:41,920 --> 02:38:42,688
It's a good song though

3358
02:38:42,944 --> 02:38:43,456
If you take the race

3359
02:38:43,712 --> 02:38:49,088
Depart out of it what a wonderful day

3360
02:38:49,344 --> 02:38:49,856
What's fun

3361
02:38:50,112 --> 02:38:50,624
Anyway

3362
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:51,392
Econo-pak

3363
02:38:53,184 --> 02:38:55,488
Bar baby in El Reno

3364
02:38:58,304 --> 02:39:04,448
Drunk horse he was in the background essentially for the entire Mike zullo interview and then once Mike zullo gets off the phone

3365
02:39:04,704 --> 02:39:06,240
Alex Jones

3366
02:39:06,496 --> 02:39:08,032
Jerome corsi has asked for a little while

3367
02:39:09,568 --> 02:39:10,592
This clip

3368
02:39:11,872 --> 02:39:13,664
And it's one way of looking at

3369
02:39:14,432 --> 02:39:16,224
And when I explained

3370
02:39:16,480 --> 02:39:17,760
Better way of looking at it

3371
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:21,600
I'm also powerful

3372
02:39:22,112 --> 02:39:26,208
Either from high-level leaks or house

3373
02:39:32,608 --> 02:39:33,376
What shows

3374
02:39:33,632 --> 02:39:36,448
You are really On Target my friend

3375
02:39:37,216 --> 02:39:37,728
Cuc

3376
02:39:39,264 --> 02:39:43,104
What his listen everything we write

3377
02:39:43,360 --> 02:39:44,128
Everybody looks

3378
02:39:44,384 --> 02:39:45,408
Everything you write

3379
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:46,432
Nobody look

3380
02:39:46,944 --> 02:39:50,528
Nail that's how I'm Target

3381
02:39:51,040 --> 02:39:54,624
Hey

3382
02:39:55,136 --> 02:39:57,952
Right everything Paul Joseph Watson does everyone loves

3383
02:39:58,208 --> 02:40:00,256
That yeah

3384
02:40:00,512 --> 02:40:06,656
Ignores your like a conspiracy theorist

3385
02:40:06,912 --> 02:40:10,496
Even if

3386
02:40:10,752 --> 02:40:16,896
Wonky community

3387
02:40:17,152 --> 02:40:19,712
Like not function

3388
02:40:19,968 --> 02:40:26,112
I realize that

3389
02:40:26,624 --> 02:40:27,904
Seeing that Paul Ryan's walk

3390
02:40:28,160 --> 02:40:29,184
Penis is wonky

3391
02:40:29,440 --> 02:40:30,976
Absolutely

3392
02:40:31,232 --> 02:40:32,256
Function

3393
02:40:35,072 --> 02:40:36,864
Too Playa

3394
02:40:37,120 --> 02:40:37,888
The Parting Shot

3395
02:40:38,656 --> 02:40:40,192
Generally I like to try it

3396
02:40:40,448 --> 02:40:41,472
Come up with something

3397
02:40:41,984 --> 02:40:42,752
I really stopped

3398
02:40:43,008 --> 02:40:43,776
Thumbs up

3399
02:40:49,152 --> 02:40:51,712
Listen to two-and-a-half hours of us talk

3400
02:40:52,224 --> 02:40:55,808
The last 5 minutes

3401
02:40:56,576 --> 02:40:57,600
Where you will have a good cook

3402
02:40:58,880 --> 02:41:00,416
Before we get to this clip lights of Jaws

3403
02:41:00,928 --> 02:41:01,696
Give us light

3404
02:41:01,952 --> 02:41:02,976
Information of every

3405
02:41:03,232 --> 02:41:03,744
Everything we've got

3406
02:41:04,256 --> 02:41:04,768
Monsters

3407
02:41:05,792 --> 02:41:06,304
Liars

3408
02:41:09,632 --> 02:41:12,448
Everybody involved with the Alex Jones Show is all of those

3409
02:41:13,472 --> 02:41:13,984
That's pretty much what

3410
02:41:15,008 --> 02:41:21,152
I think you did a good real brief summation imma try for a little more

3411
02:41:23,712 --> 02:41:24,480
The meat on their bones

3412
02:41:24,736 --> 02:41:28,320
Is Joe Arpaio is a complete monster he is

3413
02:41:28,576 --> 02:41:29,088
Guilty

3414
02:41:29,344 --> 02:41:31,392
Racial profiling

3415
02:41:31,904 --> 02:41:32,416
So much work

3416
02:41:33,184 --> 02:41:37,536
He is absolutely he was not being wiretapped by any information

3417
02:41:37,792 --> 02:41:38,304
Has publicly of a

3418
02:41:39,072 --> 02:41:39,584
Deserve the death

3419
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:45,984
He had a confidential informant named Dennis Montgomery who is a proven liar front of History

3420
02:41:46,240 --> 02:41:47,264
Fraud

3421
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:48,800
History of

3422
02:41:49,056 --> 02:41:50,336
Trying to set up people

3423
02:41:50,592 --> 02:41:51,104
What's fake documents

3424
02:41:51,616 --> 02:41:52,640
And

3425
02:41:53,152 --> 02:41:53,664
Clearly

3426
02:41:54,176 --> 02:41:56,224
His lawyer Larry klayman is a

3427
02:41:56,480 --> 02:41:57,504
Complete islamophobic

3428
02:41:57,760 --> 02:41:58,272
Bigot

3429
02:41:59,296 --> 02:42:00,320
Has Pride

3430
02:42:00,576 --> 02:42:01,344
Multiple times

3431
02:42:01,600 --> 02:42:02,624
Frivolous lawsuits against

3432
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:04,928
Liberals kicked out of course forever

3433
02:42:06,208 --> 02:42:06,720
4life

3434
02:42:06,976 --> 02:42:10,304
Not allowed to be Cliven Bundy

3435
02:42:12,864 --> 02:42:15,168
These are the characters that we're dealing with

3436
02:42:15,424 --> 02:42:16,704
Alex Jones takes this

3437
02:42:17,216 --> 02:42:19,776
And information about an alleged

3438
02:42:20,288 --> 02:42:21,056
Wiretapping

3439
02:42:23,872 --> 02:42:25,152
That's been going on.

3440
02:42:25,408 --> 02:42:26,432
Billy has his phone numbers

3441
02:42:26,688 --> 02:42:27,200
Which again

3442
02:42:29,248 --> 02:42:31,040
Montgomery could easily get that information

3443
02:42:31,552 --> 02:42:34,368
From very mild hacking which he is shown

3444
02:42:34,624 --> 02:42:35,136
Through

3445
02:42:35,904 --> 02:42:36,416
People

3446
02:42:36,928 --> 02:42:38,208
About him

3447
02:42:38,464 --> 02:42:42,048
And history has shown that he is capable of those things so

3448
02:42:42,304 --> 02:42:43,584
Can write basic software

3449
02:42:43,840 --> 02:42:44,352
Turn 2002

3450
02:42:44,608 --> 02:42:45,120
Yeah

3451
02:42:46,144 --> 02:42:50,752
So what we have here is Alex Jones either willingly or unwillingly being

3452
02:42:51,008 --> 02:42:51,520
Tricked

3453
02:42:51,776 --> 02:42:54,080
Bye

3454
02:42:54,336 --> 02:42:54,848
To Joe Arpaio

3455
02:42:55,104 --> 02:42:55,616
Crimes against

3456
02:42:56,384 --> 02:42:58,688
And probably deserve

3457
02:43:00,224 --> 02:43:00,736
But

3458
02:43:01,248 --> 02:43:03,296
Probably could get you a good deal on a hunt

3459
02:43:04,576 --> 02:43:05,088
Amazing

3460
02:43:05,600 --> 02:43:06,112
Probably

3461
02:43:07,136 --> 02:43:07,904
So Alex Jones

3462
02:43:09,184 --> 02:43:10,208
Alex Jones

3463
02:43:10,464 --> 02:43:12,512
What do you need to write down

3464
02:43:12,768 --> 02:43:15,328
I've done no Research into any of these things

3465
02:43:15,840 --> 02:43:16,864
Oroville

3466
02:43:17,632 --> 02:43:18,400
He is

3467
02:43:18,656 --> 02:43:19,424
Truly

3468
02:43:20,192 --> 02:43:20,960
100%

3469
02:43:21,216 --> 02:43:27,360
Trying to lie in a way that we may only be in the way that we have always had that kind of

3470
02:43:27,616 --> 02:43:29,152
Spectrum going back and forth

3471
02:43:29,664 --> 02:43:30,176
If

3472
02:43:30,432 --> 02:43:31,456
Alex Jones has done

3473
02:43:31,712 --> 02:43:32,224
Any research

3474
02:43:33,248 --> 02:43:35,040
We're 100

3475
02:43:35,552 --> 02:43:36,832
That he is lying and

3476
02:43:37,088 --> 02:43:38,112
I'm pedaling a false Niro

3477
02:43:39,136 --> 02:43:39,904
If he is not

3478
02:43:40,416 --> 02:43:41,440
Which to me see

3479
02:43:41,952 --> 02:43:42,464
The more likely

3480
02:43:42,720 --> 02:43:43,232
Situation

3481
02:43:43,488 --> 02:43:44,256
Because again

3482
02:43:44,512 --> 02:43:45,280
All of the work

3483
02:43:45,536 --> 02:43:46,816
You've done all of the research

3484
02:43:47,072 --> 02:43:47,584
You've done

3485
02:43:48,352 --> 02:43:50,400
So far beyond anything Alex Jones is

3486
02:43:50,656 --> 02:43:51,168
Capable of

3487
02:43:51,680 --> 02:43:52,960
It hasn't taken me that long

3488
02:43:53,984 --> 02:43:57,312
Exactly Rihanna's even more

3489
02:43:58,592 --> 02:43:59,104
To be honest

3490
02:43:59,360 --> 02:44:00,384
We're not getting paid

3491
02:44:00,640 --> 02:44:01,152
To the show

3492
02:44:02,432 --> 02:44:06,016
I have a nine-to-five job generally at 8 to 6

3493
02:44:06,272 --> 02:44:06,784
Job

3494
02:44:07,808 --> 02:44:08,320
I'm at work

3495
02:44:08,832 --> 02:44:10,624
A lot of my life and I can't be

3496
02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:11,904
Spending time researching

3497
02:44:12,160 --> 02:44:15,232
I have not been tearing my hair out researching this

3498
02:44:15,488 --> 02:44:16,256
Exactly

3499
02:44:16,512 --> 02:44:18,304
It's been pretty easy to find most

3500
02:44:18,816 --> 02:44:19,584
Information

3501
02:44:22,144 --> 02:44:24,448
It fits within the Alex Jones and what we know of

3502
02:44:24,960 --> 02:44:25,984
That he would not have

3503
02:44:26,240 --> 02:44:27,520
Even the most cursory

3504
02:44:28,288 --> 02:44:30,336
If someone comes to Jerome corsi

3505
02:44:30,592 --> 02:44:32,128
And says I have evidence

3506
02:44:32,384 --> 02:44:33,408
The Trump is being

3507
02:44:33,664 --> 02:44:34,176
Spied on

3508
02:44:34,688 --> 02:44:36,736
Jerome corsi is going to write up an article

3509
02:44:36,992 --> 02:44:38,528
And Alex Jones is going to Justin

3510
02:44:38,784 --> 02:44:43,392
Implicitly believe it no matter what he's not going to do any research

3511
02:44:43,648 --> 02:44:46,464
Figure out is this worth me posting on my site

3512
02:44:46,720 --> 02:44:48,256
Do any of that work

3513
02:44:48,512 --> 02:44:49,536
And because

3514
02:44:50,048 --> 02:44:51,584
And because Jerome corsi

3515
02:44:52,096 --> 02:44:52,608
Is

3516
02:44:54,144 --> 02:44:54,912
Someone credit

3517
02:44:55,680 --> 02:44:56,704
Someone ethical

3518
02:44:57,216 --> 02:44:59,520
He just brings this b******* into the house

3519
02:44:59,776 --> 02:45:00,288
So

3520
02:45:03,616 --> 02:45:05,408
Tumi I fall on the side

3521
02:45:05,664 --> 02:45:06,432
Alex Jones

3522
02:45:08,992 --> 02:45:09,504
Not

3523
02:45:11,296 --> 02:45:11,808
Mafia.

3524
02:45:12,320 --> 02:45:13,088
In this particular

3525
02:45:13,856 --> 02:45:14,880
That's interesting

3526
02:45:15,392 --> 02:45:18,464
You willfully misleading people in the way that he would be

3527
02:45:18,720 --> 02:45:20,256
If he had done any research

3528
02:45:21,792 --> 02:45:24,096
Now see here's where I disagree with you just on it

3529
02:45:24,352 --> 02:45:25,120
White technicality

3530
02:45:25,376 --> 02:45:27,680
Yes I think he willfully does

3531
02:45:27,936 --> 02:45:28,448
Do the research

3532
02:45:28,960 --> 02:45:29,728
The part of him know that if

3533
02:45:30,752 --> 02:45:32,032
He would invalidate his own beliefs

3534
02:45:32,544 --> 02:45:33,312
Your objection

3535
02:45:33,824 --> 02:45:34,336
Is this

3536
02:45:43,040 --> 02:45:43,552
So

3537
02:45:44,576 --> 02:45:45,344
Realistically

3538
02:45:46,112 --> 02:45:47,392
What week what we ended this

3539
02:45:48,416 --> 02:45:48,928
Is

3540
02:45:50,208 --> 02:45:53,024
Trump was not being spied on in the West

3541
02:45:58,400 --> 02:46:00,192
Because that's the narrative

3542
02:46:00,448 --> 02:46:01,472
Who's pitching the entire week

3543
02:46:02,240 --> 02:46:06,335
The idea that his phone number in Trump's phone number and all that was part of this database

3544
02:46:07,103 --> 02:46:08,383
Is absolutely

3545
02:46:08,895 --> 02:46:09,919
Retrieve

3546
02:46:10,175 --> 02:46:11,199
I think firmly

3547
02:46:11,455 --> 02:46:12,223
And it took

3548
02:46:12,735 --> 02:46:18,623
There's a web of things it's built upon it

3549
02:46:18,879 --> 02:46:20,415
Do you have multiple interviews

3550
02:46:20,671 --> 02:46:21,183
With people

3551
02:46:21,439 --> 02:46:23,999
Propping up this why it's complete bulshit

3552
02:46:24,255 --> 02:46:25,535
Nunez

3553
02:46:26,047 --> 02:46:27,071
Has confirmed

3554
02:46:29,119 --> 02:46:32,959
Nunez is Italy stink

3555
02:46:33,215 --> 02:46:33,727
Credulous

3556
02:46:36,799 --> 02:46:38,335
Crick in some way

3557
02:46:38,847 --> 02:46:43,199
His behavior was altered by some of this information Nunez I would act

3558
02:46:43,455 --> 02:46:48,063
Is on the evil side is on the evil Spectrum

3559
02:46:48,319 --> 02:46:48,831
Lie

3560
02:46:49,087 --> 02:46:50,111
Especially

3561
02:46:51,647 --> 02:46:52,671
Protect Trump but

3562
02:46:52,927 --> 02:46:53,951
In the same way

3563
02:46:54,463 --> 02:46:55,231
She is wagging to what

3564
02:46:55,487 --> 02:46:56,255
He thinks Walt

3565
02:46:56,767 --> 02:46:57,279
Torn down

3566
02:46:57,535 --> 02:47:02,143
Going to

3567
02:47:03,679 --> 02:47:05,215
Like just 50/50 horse race

3568
02:47:05,727 --> 02:47:06,751
What's blank

3569
02:47:07,263 --> 02:47:10,335
Who do you think you would rather hit your horse to right now

3570
02:47:10,847 --> 02:47:11,359
Paul Ryan

3571
02:47:11,615 --> 02:47:12,127
Donald Trump

3572
02:47:14,687 --> 02:47:15,967
Sophie's Choice

3573
02:47:16,223 --> 02:47:20,575
Both of my children

3574
02:47:23,135 --> 02:47:24,415
No that's that's a no winds

3575
02:47:24,671 --> 02:47:25,695
Situation I don't want

3576
02:47:25,951 --> 02:47:28,255
To either of them but if I had to choose I probably go truck

3577
02:47:28,511 --> 02:47:29,535
You probably go Trump yet

3578
02:47:31,583 --> 02:47:32,095
Still going to go with

3579
02:47:33,119 --> 02:47:34,143
I would go Trump

3580
02:47:34,399 --> 02:47:35,679
But real

3581
02:47:36,703 --> 02:47:39,519
Just because I don't want anything to do with Paul Ryan

3582
02:47:39,775 --> 02:47:40,543
Outback trunk

3583
02:47:40,799 --> 02:47:41,311
Once every

3584
02:47:41,823 --> 02:47:43,103
Isaac

3585
02:47:43,615 --> 02:47:44,127
I think

3586
02:47:44,895 --> 02:47:45,663
I think Trump is a

3587
02:47:45,919 --> 02:47:46,431
Trader

3588
02:47:46,687 --> 02:47:48,479
Yeah but somehow I think Paul Ryan

3589
02:47:48,991 --> 02:47:50,271
Absolutely

3590
02:47:50,527 --> 02:47:52,831
So I would go I would go with Trump

3591
02:47:53,087 --> 02:47:53,599
But

3592
02:47:53,855 --> 02:47:57,695
I wouldn't worry about it

3593
02:47:57,951 --> 02:47:59,743
Stop talking about who's the

3594
02:48:01,023 --> 02:48:01,791
Murmansk

3595
02:48:04,351 --> 02:48:04,863
Then you go Ryan

3596
02:48:05,119 --> 02:48:05,887
Right

3597
02:48:06,143 --> 02:48:07,423
Play I think Ryan is going

3598
02:48:09,471 --> 02:48:09,983
I mean

3599
02:48:10,239 --> 02:48:11,007
Wolfie and then

3600
02:48:13,567 --> 02:48:14,591
The healthcare

3601
02:48:16,127 --> 02:48:16,639
I would

3602
02:48:17,151 --> 02:48:18,431
Before the whole Healthcare

3603
02:48:19,199 --> 02:48:19,711
I would have said that

3604
02:48:19,967 --> 02:48:20,479
Ryan

3605
02:48:21,247 --> 02:48:21,759
Capable of

3606
02:48:23,807 --> 02:48:24,831
Because the health

3607
02:48:25,855 --> 02:48:26,367
Maybe

3608
02:48:26,879 --> 02:48:27,647
The most

3609
02:48:28,671 --> 02:48:30,975
Ever introduced into Congress

3610
02:48:31,231 --> 02:48:31,999
And he

3611
02:48:32,511 --> 02:48:34,047
Still put all of his ex

3612
02:48:35,071 --> 02:48:35,583
Miri

3613
02:48:36,095 --> 02:48:36,607
Just maybe

3614
02:48:37,119 --> 02:48:37,887
Alright

3615
02:48:38,143 --> 02:48:38,655
Idiot

3616
02:48:39,935 --> 02:48:43,519
He is definitely not like historical smart

3617
02:48:44,031 --> 02:48:47,359
Gone it's also interesting though because I don't I don't know really

3618
02:48:49,407 --> 02:48:51,455
Research into it but I did read an article

3619
02:48:51,711 --> 02:48:52,223
How

3620
02:48:52,735 --> 02:48:56,319
Trump making a hard sell on the health-care bill ended up losing them

3621
02:48:56,575 --> 02:48:57,087
10 votes

3622
02:48:58,111 --> 02:49:00,159
Negotiate

3623
02:49:00,415 --> 02:49:01,951
With folks

3624
02:49:03,743 --> 02:49:07,327
Paul Ryan maybe could have pulled it off without

3625
02:49:07,839 --> 02:49:08,607
Blustery

3626
02:49:13,983 --> 02:49:15,263
Either way we have one more clip

3627
02:49:16,287 --> 02:49:17,567
Is Alex Jones talking

3628
02:49:18,847 --> 02:49:19,615
This is just

3629
02:49:22,175 --> 02:49:24,735
Alright let's all just play

3630
02:49:24,991 --> 02:49:26,015
Let's get some dessert on the

3631
02:49:26,527 --> 02:49:27,807
This is absolutely just

3632
02:49:28,831 --> 02:49:33,695
This world being so unstable

3633
02:49:47,519 --> 02:49:49,823
Richard Ramirez

3634
02:49:50,079 --> 02:49:56,223
Alex Jones showing his true colors God that felt so good

3635
02:49:56,479 --> 02:49:58,271
Sources I have wanted for month

3636
02:49:58,527 --> 02:50:02,367
Now they're going to kill Trump

3637
02:50:04,671 --> 02:50:06,207
Let me ask

3638
02:50:06,463 --> 02:50:07,999
Let me answer question form

02:50:08,255 --> 02:50:09,535

Market

3647

3651
02:50:44,095 --> 02:50:45,375
Thank you to a friend

What's up baby

02:50:48,703 --> 02:50:51,007
You left us a nice review on

3655
02:50:54,847 --> 02:50:56,383
Like it really it really does

3656
02:50:58,943 --> 02:50:59,455
Part of

3657
02:51:00,735 --> 02:51:01,247
Rivershire

3658
02:51:02,527 --> 02:51:05,855
By the way

3659
02:51:06,367 --> 02:51:08,927
Remember when I was complaining about someone leaving the four star review

3660
02:51:09,183 --> 02:51:10,207
Yeah I went back

3661
02:51:10,463 --> 02:51:16,607
Can checks I think they changed it to a 5

3662
02:51:16,863 --> 02:51:19,935
I'm sorry that I believe you

3663
02:51:20,191 --> 02:51:23,519
I'm so sorry

3664
02:51:23,775 --> 02:51:25,567
You get overly defensive I get

3665
02:51:25,823 --> 02:51:26,847
Way over lacing

3666
02:51:27,103 --> 02:51:29,151
Ciara Like sir

3667
02:51:30,943 --> 02:51:33,503
It is it is true

3668
02:51:34,783 --> 02:51:35,807
Definitely feel too but I have a

3669
02:51:36,319 --> 02:51:38,111
Don't even sod

3670
02:51:38,367 --> 02:51:38,879
Hard

3671
02:51:39,135 --> 02:51:39,903
Hard because

3672
02:51:40,415 --> 02:51:41,695
Feeling like part of the resist

3673
02:51:42,207 --> 02:51:42,975
Or whatever it is

3674
02:51:43,743 --> 02:51:45,535
It seems very few.

3675
02:51:45,791 --> 02:51:46,559
Where resistance

3676
02:51:46,815 --> 02:51:50,143
2 something

3677
02:51:50,399 --> 02:51:51,423
Try it really is

3678
02:51:51,935 --> 02:51:52,703
Like looking at

3679
02:51:53,215 --> 02:51:54,495
Protest in Russia

3680
02:51:55,775 --> 02:51:57,567
You see those people who are

3681
02:51:59,103 --> 02:52:00,127
That's real bravery

3682
02:52:00,383 --> 02:52:02,687
Far more Brave than anything I can

3683
02:52:02,943 --> 02:52:03,455
Imagine because

3684
02:52:03,711 --> 02:52:05,503
Ever just going there

3685
02:52:07,807 --> 02:52:08,575
Possibility of killing

3686
02:52:09,343 --> 02:52:10,111
It truly does

3687
02:52:13,183 --> 02:52:13,695
Warm

3688
02:52:15,231 --> 02:52:15,743
Police

3689
02:52:16,255 --> 02:52:18,047
Making lines in order to

3690
02:52:18,559 --> 02:52:21,631
Shuttle all the protesters into a building

3691
02:52:21,887 --> 02:52:23,423
They are

3692
02:52:23,679 --> 02:52:24,703
Like f****** RoboCop

3693
02:52:25,215 --> 02:52:25,983
Like it's

3694
02:52:27,263 --> 02:52:27,775
So just

3695
02:52:28,031 --> 02:52:28,799
Feel like

3696
02:52:29,823 --> 02:52:30,335
I am at the

3697
02:52:30,591 --> 02:52:31,103
Very least

3698
02:52:32,127 --> 02:52:33,407
Smallest amount of what I

3699
02:52:34,687 --> 02:52:35,199
Because I'm soaked

3700
02:52:35,455 --> 02:52:36,223
Confused about how to

3701
02:52:37,759 --> 02:52:38,783
All we do is

3702
02:52:39,551 --> 02:52:40,319
All we can do is

3703
02:52:41,343 --> 02:52:42,367
Encourage people to

3704
02:52:43,391 --> 02:52:44,415
Call your representative

3705
02:52:44,927 --> 02:52:45,439
Do everything

3706
02:52:45,951 --> 02:52:47,487
That's a small thing

3707
02:52:47,743 --> 02:52:48,767
It's very easy to do

3708
02:52:50,815 --> 02:52:54,143
To the ACLU absolutely any other cause that you support

3709
02:52:54,399 --> 02:52:54,911
100

3710
02:52:57,215 --> 02:52:57,727
That's what

3711
02:52:57,983 --> 02:52:59,263
We want to encourage people

3712
02:53:00,543 --> 02:53:03,359
And then beyond that also and I'm guilty of not doing a

3713
02:53:03,615 --> 02:53:04,127
With all the time

3714
02:53:04,895 --> 02:53:05,407
Frank

3715
02:53:05,663 --> 02:53:06,175
But like

3716
02:53:06,943 --> 02:53:07,967
It does go a long way

3717
02:53:08,223 --> 02:53:08,735
Just be nice to me

3718
02:53:09,247 --> 02:53:10,783
That is a really important thing

3719
02:53:12,831 --> 02:53:13,343
Further

3720
02:53:13,599 --> 02:53:19,743
Into daily

3721
02:53:20,255 --> 02:53:20,767
Importantly beanie

3722
02:53:22,303 --> 02:53:22,815
Try

3723
02:53:23,071 --> 02:53:26,911
Try to see the humanity in your fellowship

3724
02:53:27,167 --> 02:53:28,959
People dad I will tell you this right now is

3725
02:53:29,215 --> 02:53:31,007
Place to leave a great review of mouth

3726

I'm glad you got that cuz that was that was my point anyways

3727
02:53:38,175 --> 02:53:38,943
The Twitter knowledge

3728
02:53:39,199 --> 02:53:42,783
The score fight you can email us at knowledge email.com

3729
02:53:43,039 --> 02:53:44,319
