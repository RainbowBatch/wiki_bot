1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Look up a little bit about Alex Jones

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,200
What's the last day you remember where we do

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,760
Didn't see a hate crime I don't know

5
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:25,600
I know that

6
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,648
This is

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,440
Check on it but it is getting exhausting

8
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:32,512
Everyday waking up a new

9
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,280
Just

10
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,072
Human moral travesty

11
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,120
Yeah

12
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,168
It's really I'm starting to realize like

13
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,728
I can't wake up and immediately look

14
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:42,496
At the world

15
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:45,824
Start a new routine where I do something else

16
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,640
So I'm trying to initiate like a

17
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,176
Just wake up and exercise

18
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:53,504
Or something with my mind

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,552
In a more stable position for I might

20
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
Good God

21
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,368
I just feels like

22
00:00:59,392 --> 00:00:59,904
JF

23
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,720
This picture

24
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,024
The next episode

25
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,048
Feels like the

26
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:06,816
Damn is about

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:15,264
Are any of those ever any of the things that were experiencing the last week any of them would be back

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,640
Unique to the time we're in right now

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,712
Awful

30
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,760
Years ago it would have been awful at any time

31
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,344
Really terrible anytime

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,880
Yep it's

33
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,416
It's hard to deal with

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
I feel for everyone in the world

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,056
That is correct Kevin Hogan

36
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,640
Went out with him

37
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,456
Nashville hot chicken

38
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:00,832
It does little addition of the spice report

39
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,600
Where are we going

40
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,880
He really spicy food

41
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,904
Income report

42
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,928
The audience about it

43
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,976
I went myself

44
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:07,744
Yeah

45
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:14,400
Their secret level that's secret they have a secret secret spicy level

46
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,728
It's hotter than extra hot

47
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,520
It's hotter than extra hot

48
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,288
How hot is that

49
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,384
I had the extra hot the last time I went

50
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,688
Secret

51
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,456
The secret hot

52
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:30,016
And

53
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,040
No big deal

54
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,344
Video

55
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:38,720
It turns out it's a ghost pepper situation

56
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:45,376
Breakfast the heat of a ghost pepper

57
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,400
Super problematic

58
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,936
But I don't like the flavor

59
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,008
So that's been spies report

60
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,944
We will be over March

61
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
15th

62
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,736
319

63
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,760
2009

64
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:05,344
Which is

65
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,368
You're like

66
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,184
The last couple 2009 episode in one day

67
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:16,096
The f****** Pace right

68
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,960
And we do know that by April

69
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:27,360
2010 he's on board of the Tea Party

70
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,944
A lot of time

71
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,480
Like these shows

72
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,784
These were nothing

73
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,648
Because at this point in 2009

74
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,440
Alex

75
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,464
Featured

76
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,256
An ISP documentary

77
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
Call the New World Order

78
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,584
And it's

79
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,352
Premiering

80
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:51,936
March

81
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,960
Middlemarch

82
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,984
2009

83
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,264
It's out by Southwest

84
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,080
Gallivanting around with the filmmakers

85
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:02,688
Having two filmmakers come into studio and they're just bragging about this documentary

86
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
Wait till is it

87
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,504
So this documentary is like

88
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,904
Staunchly Pro show my cruise when they're on the show

89
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,791
You stay out of that

90
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,559
To give you a glimpse

91
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839
People

92
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,911
Verilife

93
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,447
So whatever

94
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,007
I would also say I haven't seen that documentary but

95
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,567
The main people who are in it or Alex Jones

96
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,103
Jack McLamb

97
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:35,199
Holocaust deniers

98
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,247
Who writes for the spotlight which is

99
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:43,647
Publication

100
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,463
Documentary

101
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,743
You don't

102
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:52,863
Also promoted The Obama Deception like crazy

103
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,655
And so we were able to skip

104
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,703
Through a good amount of this s***

105
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,471
Without

106
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,239
Going over

107
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:06,175
I still had to listen to all 15 hours of my time

108
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:12,575
Nothing to listen to Alex Bragg

109
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,599
Everyone

110
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:18,975
Thank you so much cuz I was going to do it at goddamn minute welcome

111
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,815
And I'm glad I did though because I was going through

112
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,095
I was like

113
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,399
F****** s***

114
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,447
I am not doing nothing

115
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:37,407
Especially not in the world we're living in the most toothless

116
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:40,223
Green thing in the world

117
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,015
Going gets rough

118
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,831
You don't invade Russia in the win

119
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:49,439
The first lesson you have to persevere

120
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,767
Do you have to keep pushing forward even when it looks like

121
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,791
Nothing is going right

122
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,631
What it looks like you're going to end up with a deadline

123
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,471
Who's going to show up at your house and all you got or clips of Alex being like

124
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,799
I'm at South by Southwest with a bullhorn filmmakers

125
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:10,687
Oh my God what if I got to I've got to Richard linklater the associate producer in studio talking about

126
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,735
I don't want to do that

127
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,759
Keep pushing forward

128
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,551
And you're going to strike paydirt

129
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,575
And I did

130
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:22,975
I don't like the way that you set this up like I was on my way to take me like 20 minutes to walk hair and you just

131
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:29,375
Sister like you don't

132
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,399
Understand fit like

133
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:34,239
6 hours before you get here I have to know what we're doing

134
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,519
Because otherwise

135
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,103
I hit Pay Dirt

136
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,151
I think I found something

137
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,431
Incredibly

138
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
Contacts

139
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,527
Contextualize almost everyday

140
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
2009

141
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855
The product

142
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:54,207
Keeping pushing forward when the going is done

143
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,743
Now that being said

144
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,303
Big caveat

145
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,399
Along the way to me

146
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
Something

147
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,591
There's at least a couple of funny moments throughout them

148
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,943
So here's one from March 15th where Alex tries to get back to his story

149
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,247
About how that

150
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,063
I was on was on the truck

151
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,911
Nope

152
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,319
Free shooter

153
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,927
Just a toothache

154
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,863
Oh yeah they're real

155
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,959
You don't trip on it

156
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,239
Xanax

157
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,431
Yeah

158
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,583
These ssris

159
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,471
A bit a lady's face off that turns out

160
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,031
Wasn't on ssris is on Xanax

161
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:49,407
Prozac bahut

162
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:56,319
Itsfunneh

163
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,087
The brat

164
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,135
Balls

165
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,671
Make his argument about shooters

166
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,951
Connected

167
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,743
The Monkees

168
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,095
Monkey walking on Prozac

169
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:08,863
Right

170
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,423
My arguments

171
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
Today Show

172
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,031
The next day after

173
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,127
Literally did say

174
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
It was on

175
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,199
And it said I'm going to rehab

176
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
Fresh

177
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
Radio

178
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,695
It is mostly because Alex

179
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,231
Gallivanting around with

180
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,559
Acting like a big shot

181
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,583
Hollywood movies

182
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,727
Richard linklater is Associates

183
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:51,615
Just like all strfkr eat a little bit and then Jason bermas being boring as hell

184
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,151
So the 16th we can wipe it

185
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,175
Completely off our play

186
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,711
We don't have to worry about this

187
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,479
16th

188
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,295
Now I should also say

189
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,831
That.

190
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
Is ulcer

191
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,487
On the 17th when Alex just has the IFC producers

192
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:13,375
In interviews that documentary about him

193
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
MetroPCS

194
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,959
I think they probably sent him a form

195
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,031
Better if

196
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,567
They didn't show him

197
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,871
The documentary

198
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,407
Just be a b**** slap to the

199
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,479
The face that would be awesome be good prank

200
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,247
Alex pranks

201
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,367
Most of the Senate

202
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,927
The end of the show has

203
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,695
He is one of

204
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
Is vaccine

205
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,023
Experts Fisher on the show

206
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,559
Talk about how bad

207
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,119
Barbara

208
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
Really dive to

209
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,215
But it Bears repeating

210
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,519
This is one of their big

211
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,055
This is one of the arguments

212
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,639
Expert

213
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Is a bad sign

214
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:04,831
And I think that this is where I have a lot of trouble with this sort of greater good argument that they keep making

215
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,879
The argument as you don't have the right

216
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,671
As an individual parents

217
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:15,071
To make that choice for your child because if you don't make the choice of the government says you need to make in this case get get back

218
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,631
Vaccinated you put your neighbor's child at rest

219
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,727
I've always said if the vaccines there is effective as the companies in

220
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,007
Deb said they are

221
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,567
Then you should have it in the vaccinated

222
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:31,967
Should have nothing to fear from those two trees

223
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:38,367
We really have

224
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:43,999
Stop Believing in myths and misinformation and we have to get the information

225
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:51,935
That's terrible man if you're coming at you with the argument if everybody is vaccinated

226
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,983
Kefir for people not being bad

227
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,335
Nursery research

228
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,663
Get vaccinated

229
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,943
Underlying conditions

230
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,967
They may have

231
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,247
All these reefs bleach

232
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,527
Not being able to do that

233
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
Just that like

234
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,927
It's not like I have vaccines

235
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,975
So I'm afraid of you not having

236
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,511
It's a public health

237
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,583
Because there's a large segment of the population

238
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,351
Just can't

239
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,631
Get back

240
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,191
And if you follow her argument

241
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,471
Conclusion

242
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,775
As a person who is

243
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:31,359
I just get to watch wide swaths of children die

244
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,407
As they spread the disease back

245
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,431
And forth to each other

246
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
At the show schitt

247
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,951
60th and 17th

248
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,023
In my Alex Jones listening

249
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,351
I very rarely

250
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,911
We almost ended the show that's how bad those two were

251
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,239
Robot ending the show

252
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
To flirting with

253
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,079
Because I don't know when.

254
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:06,687
It kept happening

255
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,759
Is a little bit better

256
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,831
Now the 18th is really interesting time

257
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,111
The Alex Jones Show

258
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,903
Because he's

259
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,183
Cast

260
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,743
With

261
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,071
Napolitano on his f***

262
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,607
Oh that's super.

263
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,143
So it is a bad

264
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,799
The Obama Deception

265
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,359
Before they get to their interview

266
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,175
Sakura

267
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,967
Devices on show for the sake of a

268
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:47,647
Okay

269
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,847
Okay well we're waiting for my guys to send me that

270
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,383
Not going to it for about 7

271
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,991
Okay great we got audio now he's going to wait for fun

272
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:17,855
The judges show right now if you guys are ready to go by there as well

273
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,159
My face is

274
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:30,655
Did you listen to them

275
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,239
This is a rare trait

276
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,895
Who said that

277
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,199
Squeeze

278
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,295
That's pretty good considering

279
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:55,743
6:30

280
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,679
Eternal

281
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:11,615
Understood

282
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:17,503
I'm here guys I'm waiting

283
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,903
Regular

284
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,999
Joe

285
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
Shortly

286
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,119
Okay I'm here

287
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,335
I can't believe this is still going on

288
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:49,759
10 minutes

289
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:55,647
Surround

290
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,743
Alex is willing

291
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,303
To put that on his

292
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,327
Sacrifices

293
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,863
For this other show because

294
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
Mission

295
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,191
But he knows that foxes audiences

296
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,471
Is way bigger than his

297
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,263
He's willing to do s*** like this

298
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,103
He went on RT on inauguration day and just left his show

299
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,151
Simulcast

300
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
4 minutes

301
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,479
Beast of his live

302
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,503
Broadcast

303
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,551
It's so unprofessional

304
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,111
Who gives a s*** if I can tap into napolatanos audience

305
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,391
Going to be way bigger

306
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,743
Yeah but I mean even then there's a little bit of salt on napolatanos

307
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:38,655
Why is he getting

308
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:45,055
Probably not on the freezer but it's great

309
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,663
I don't know

310
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,455
It's crazy what are those

311
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,527
What the f***

312
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,415
Others lives

313
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,439
Wow

314
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,743
You come a long way baby

315
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:08,095
Somebody called 5 minutes before then different special

316
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,631
Hey we're going to come on at

317
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,911
Victor

318
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,543
Napolitano

319
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,591
Okay

320
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:24,735
How about you

321
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,759
For The Obama Deception

322
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:30,111
It infowars.com out there about the Maya

323
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
What's going on

324
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
Alex

325
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,023
Despite the fact that he's in a little bit of a

326
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,583
Sxsw holding pattern

327
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,143
Miac report is still the big

328
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:46,239
And what's interesting is on this episode March 18th

329
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,263
Alex

330
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,055
Purports to have evidence

331
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
This

332
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,895
Some guy

333
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
I called

334
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,431
The

335
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,199
Missouri police

336
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,735
And recorded it

337
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,039
And it's some sort of a damning

338
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,415
So he's teasing that he's going to play this audio of a guy talking

339
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,695
Missouri police

340
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,303
Like I don't

341
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,327
I imagine

342
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,351
Did the Kapil just

343
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,631
Like no comment

344
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,679
Rapping like that

345
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:23,359
People get possessed

346
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,175
How to think so

347
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:31,039
To tell you the truth

348
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:34,111
That would be awesome

349
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:38,463
Over the moon

350
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,231
Instead

351
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
I did not expect

352
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,535
This copy

353
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,815
Very reasonable

354
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:43,839
I'm trying

355
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,119
Explain to this caller

356
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:49,727
Exactly what I have explained about the Maya

357
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:54,079
On the other line right now

358
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,919
Let me say that the reason that music is playing is

359
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,455
Coming straight out of break

360
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:05,087
It's not like it's a going on in the phone call

361
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:11,999
I can have your old I can take your name and number and have them give you a call back

362
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,047
It's kind of whatever you would prefer

363
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:16,863
Let me hold for

364
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,167
Does the moment

365
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:21,983
Also

366
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,567
It's important to know that he was on hold

367
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,871
See how disrespectful the police are

368
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,919
Go to put you on hold

369
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
They're public

370
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,223
Servant

371
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:36,831
I'm definitely not continuing to talk over this.

372
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,463
Hi how are you

373
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:48,863
Campaign for Liberty

374
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,399
Like to ask you a few questions

375
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,703
Trying to clarify

376
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,519
As you know

377
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:00,383
A lot of information circulating on the internet regarding this recent

378
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,407
Circulated

379
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:06,527
I don't know I've not been on the internet to say but I've certainly is taking a bunch of calls

380
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
Report

381
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,855
Yeah I'm looking at the report if we're talking about this

382
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,671
We have any.

383
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,839
Clark willing to discuss this you seems very

384
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,655
Maybe that's pretty good

385
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,191
Strongly

386
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,727
And Pregnant

387
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
Now let's go

388
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,871
Concern

389
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,175
People who are members of

390
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:39,295
Some people deem is Liberty Movement or who are Ron Paul supporters

391
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,087
Members of the campaign for Liberty which is

392
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,367
The Grassroots organization

393
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,887
Predominant members in the leading parties and

394
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,167
Okay well received

395
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,519
And answer I don't doubt that at all and I

396
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,847
I commend you and Kendall

397
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,431
Preemptively

398
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:10,015
Tired of this bull already

399
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:14,879
Are you go home and tell your mother

400
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:19,232
Oh yeah you went to see pack good for you I'm thrilled that you're in good standing

401
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,792
Okay I guess the question is

402
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:27,424
Looking at one of the concerns why why are people that a part of this Liberty Movement

403
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,544
Being labelled or targeted or potentially profiled in this report as

404
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,712
Potential domestic terrorist

405
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:46,880
Well if you read that I don't see anywhere in that report where targets anybody were profiles anybody

406
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,440
Call were labeled anybody of anything

407
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,536
Terrorist or a militia group member or anything like that

408
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,864
And to think that any law enforcement officer or agent

409
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,144
Wood

410
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,960
Target somebody for political affiliation I think

411
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,776
Inappropriate

412
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:08,640
Well do I'll bet stupid like that

413
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:12,992
A broader picture of History that's very dumb

414
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:17,344
But that's the only thing I take issue with it he say

415
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,112
I like

416
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,160
This whole situation is like

417
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,696
White people aren't

418
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,256
Even being profiled and they're still mad

419
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:30,912
Everybody else has been profiled for Thousand Years

420
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:34,752
Holy s*** are you going to f****** do this to us we do that

421
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,032
Brightright

422
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,848
Let's leave aside the fact that

423
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,664
The cop is saying that it's inappropriate

424
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,504
Target someone for their political beliefs

425
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:51,392
The history shows a darker picture

426
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,792
Sure a lot of the time

427
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,352
The people being targeted were

428
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,376
Strongly on the left

429
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:05,472
More of the history of it

430
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,496
Yes

431
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,264
But

432
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,824
Leaving that aside

433
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,224
The only thing that you can really I feel

434
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,272
With this

435
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,296
Clark

436
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,368
Because it's not accurate in this case

437
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:28,768
Profile

438
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,960
And the report is simply does not say that

439
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:37,984
What

440
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,288
What is your

441
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,080
What is your understanding of why

442
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,384
Constitution party

443
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,688
Chuck Baldwin Bob Barn rampal

444
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,224
I mention of

445
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:52,832
People displaying Ron Paul bumper stickers why is there mention of that in the report

446
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:56,672
Well if you read the report I don't think there's a mention of bumper stickers at all any

447
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,976
28-page report so obviously

448
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:04,864
Obviously you haven't read the entirety of the report or your you're looking a report it

449
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,640
I love this video because

450
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,456
The last page

451
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,480
Busted

452
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,272
It's not

453
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:28,160
Starting on the second to last page where the parts at like

454
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,952
They're playing fast and loose

455
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,232
With combining

456
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,256
Details from this

457
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,792
Report in order to make it

458
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:35,840
That cop is

459
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,656
Completely right there is no mention of Ron Paul bumper

460
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,192
Stickers at all in here

461
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,728
Dimension of Ron Paul

462
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,544
These members are usually supporters

463
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,128
The former presidential candidate Ron Paul

464
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,920
The next paragraph

465
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,200
Talks about Antigua

466
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,224
Government propaganda

467
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:56,832
Meet militia members commonly display picture cartoons bumper stickers that contain ant

468
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,856
Government rhetoric

469
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,648
Most of this will depict

470
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:06,048
The FR-S IRS FBI ATF CIA un law enforcement at the New World Order in a derogatory manner

471
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,376
In completely different sections of this report

472
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,424
Dick characterizes militia

473
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,448
And these Danger

474
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
Groups

475
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,752
That are not

476
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,288
Just

477
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,824
Liberty lovers

478
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,688
Did they put a 100% of one side of your van covered in bumps

479
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,480
That's not a red flag

480
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:29,088
That's not a red flag.

481
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,368
Fairly targeting

482
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,392
Absolutely

483
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,416
So

484
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,208
We have

485
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:34,976
Seen this cop

486
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:35,744
Be very fair

487
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,024
Phone call with

488
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:39,840
Fight

489
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,376
This guy

490
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,168
This

491
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,192
Next clip I think

492
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,472
Really drive home

493
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,008
Appointed we've been making

494
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,056
4

495
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:56,480
I can't speak for why you think that there's something in the report that says

496
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,784
People who have a Ron Paul bumper

497
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,344
Or any political affiliation

498
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:06,464
That's just simply not true and it's not in the report

499
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,000
Is there reference to

500
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,048
Stop movement order

501
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,608
People who are opposed to North American Union

502
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,888
Was New World Order in there

503
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,984
Weather from information in there regarding

504
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:24,384
Certain militia groups in those violent factions that operate within those militia

505
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,456
Details

506
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,248
Do certain police system

507
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,528
And

508
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:35,136
What political parties or candidates they might associate

509
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,000
Certainly the document doesn't say that anybody who's affiliated with a certain

510
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:43,584
Political candidate or a political party is certainly

511
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,936
On my way to remember a pterosaur or anything like that I think of

512
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,480
Yes and is it's all these people want to kill you

513
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:06,880
It's not that at all and also and it's not even in the report also in a militia

514
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,160
Or a terrorist

515
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:08,928
Is

516
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,696
A disjunction

517
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,768
The generally means one or the other

518
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,072
The same thing at all

519
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,376
So now what you see

520
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,936
Because what Alex Jones has just done

521
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,984
Is very accurate

522
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,800
Play Dan accurate debunking of his narrative

523
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,824
On the Shelf

524
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,872
Is absolutely correct

525
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,896
In terms of

526
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:31,200
The inference problems that they are making

527
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,224
Fitbit Alta

528
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,248
Propaganda

529
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,784
The idea that

530
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,856
These dangerous groups that we have studied

531
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,392
They show these

532
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,160
Signs

533
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:40,928
That is

534
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,208
To say that if you

535
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,232
Exhibit design

536
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,024
You should be suspected of being a

537
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,048
A member of One of These Days

538
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:49,120
That he has just completely laid out

539
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,912
Alex is wrong

540
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:54,496
Do you think

541
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,520
Reflect

542
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,288
Sorry

543
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,056
Sorry

544
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:01,664
I'll come in and disagree with everything in life about

545
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,248
Instead what he does is on March 19th

546
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,040
Is Susie start to show

547
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:07,808
He says that

548
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:13,952
We have a doctor Chuck Baldwin constitutional 1008

549
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:30,848
Don't let him spin it let him spin it again store already

550
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:37,248
Explained he hasn't spawn anything

551
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,344
I guess

552
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,672
Natural wheel spin

553
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:48,256
Existed

554
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,536
Reality is

555
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,144
Any any

556
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,168
Statement of fact

557
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,472
Any statement of the definition of a

558
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,288
But you see it right there

559
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,360
You see it clearly

560
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,432
At this point

561
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,992
I'm certain always

562
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,552
Thinks that any explanation

563
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,320
That is against

564
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,088
He is

565
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,672
Predetermined idea is

566
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:19,232
Trying to lie about this thing

567
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,256
That I'm lying about

568
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
It's lunacy

569
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,328
It's a way to live

570
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,376
When you have a 9

571
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,216
3

572
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:29,984
You get at 3

573
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,288
Makes 9 a.m.

574
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:38,176
A square number

575
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,968
We will not be divided

576
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,504
What they did at Alex

577
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,272
Third grade

578
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:45,856
The thing is that like this is the narrative is so satisfying

579
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,904
Because it reinforces

580
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,208
The b*******

581
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,280
Because if this is if this is true

582
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,888
You know that

583
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,032
This is absolutely true

584
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:06,080
It's an existential threat

585
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,360
For this to not be

586
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,128
Be true

587
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,408
So what's up matter

588
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,432
Suspend

589
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,248
Pathetic

590
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,808
After I Alex

591
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,832
Introduces his death

592
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,648
Let you know what's coming up on the program

593
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,928
He gets to his first

594
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,696
Story

595
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,464
On March 9th

596
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,792
It will ship

597
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,888
Very important

598
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,192
Let me break it down right now

599
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:37,568
House passes Tori national service bill

600
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,104
You heard me

601
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:47,296
They are going to do laser eyebrows

602
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,064
Live

603
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,368
Morning

604
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,976
Crowd problem

605
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,512
Cuz we're just going to legalize

606
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,336
Paul Watson

607
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,384
Bingo

608
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:19,296
Yesterday

609
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,720
As fears about President Obama's promise

610
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:36,704
He always is

611
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,056
Right now

612
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,664
Also completely misrepresenting

613
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,200
Gus Garcia

614
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:55,392
The initial version of the bill that was introduced in the house quote called for a congressional commission to address

615
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,160
Several topic

616
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,720
Including issues that deter volunteerism

617
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,256
And how they can be overcome

618
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:03,072
How expanding International Public Service might affect

619
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,352
Diplomacy in foreign relations

620
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:07,936
And whether workable fair and reasonable service

621
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,728
Requirement for all able Young

622
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,752
People could be developed

623
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:14,592
And how such a requirement could be implemented in a manner that would strengthen

624
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,872
The social fabric of the

625
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,408
However

626
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,712
The version that passed the house had this language

627
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
Completely stripped

628
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:24,064
The version of pass the Senate never included such language

629
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,832
At all

630
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:28,160
Even Orrin Hatch that are on the senate floor

631
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:32,512
Consistent with our all-volunteer army and volunteer opportunities an individual's choice

632
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:35,072
Community nothing in this legislation is Manta

633
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:39,680
Because Alex is saying that the bill passed and not the bill was introduced

634
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:43,520
It's very clear that he's lying or that the only thing he knows about the bill is based on

635
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,824
Show me article

636
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:49,408
Who is way too sloppy to know that a bill can be Rewritten

637
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,432
Or any other

638
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,456
Play some debate

639
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:55,552
So the bill does not always the same as the bill that's voted on

640
00:32:55,808 --> 00:33:00,416
It's pretty clear this is just another example of Paul Joseph Watson having zero professionalism as a journalist

641
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,440
And Reporting some

642
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,744
Something completely inaccurate because it states

643
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,512
Infowars

644
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,280
Predetermined

645
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,584
Schoolhouse Rock

646
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:10,656
Heat donut strip

647
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,448
Yeah you don't know about

648
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,496
How to make a bell

649
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,520
It's not

650
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,312
This level of

651
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,896
Not even spin

652
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:24,992
I wish I wish

653
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,784
Cops are

654
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,320
Sorry

655
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:31,392
Narrative

656
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:34,976
It was in there that means always in there

657
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:38,560
That's based on the Constitution

658
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:42,656
You cannot change a bill what to do with it

659
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,520
I'm absolutely this doesn't deter Alex from

660
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:51,104
I'm trying to spread fear of what will happen once these forced Valen

661
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,872
Tourism

662
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:54,944
Things happen

663
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,952
That's what they want you to think of going to happen

664
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,976
Alright

665
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,768
The same thing with like saying that

666
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:14,656
National Guard can help in emergencies I'm really do you need a chance right

667
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,936
That's right the same thing

668
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,216
You hear this volunteer

669
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,008
Your stuff in your life

670
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,544
Children how to read

671
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,824
In truth he is

672
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:28,224
Drug head know-it-all video game players in playlist Violet games

673
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:32,832
Prime Ford

674
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,400
Now did it

675
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:51,264
Ignore example

676
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,312
Out of control

677
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:58,432
Tell all the young snot-nosed punch

678
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:02,528
Don't try running the checkpoint don't try coming up to me

679
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:08,928
I just can't handle it anymore I can't handle the scumbag bankers

680
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:13,792
And the dumbass

681
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,840
The barrel of a gun

682
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:18,144
I'm sorry I missed

683
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,704
It's just really starting to get to me

684
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,800
And don't you dare go to the hospital

685
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:31,712
Trying to get her to learn already I'm helping her spin things

686
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:38,112
I mean like what he's what he's expressing

687
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,672
Anymore is your fake version of reality

688
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:43,744
If you could just alleviate yourself you could understand

689
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,280
Jackal yourself of those burdens

690
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,560
By just reading

691
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,632
You can stop being so mad if

692
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,912
You would just read

693
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,728
Is paranoid fantasies

694
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:56,032
That's all he's mad at you mad at like

695
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,056
Ghost

696
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,592
Crazy

697
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,480
No yeah

698
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:10,880
Absolutely the whatever it is that scary

699
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,672
What's now and I'm mad

700
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
My stomach

701
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:22,144
I do like hearing that

702
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,448
Narrative of likes

703
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:30,336
Video games cause violence

704
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:32,384
Because we only ever see that

705
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,920
Whenever there's a

706
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,040
We didn't hear the violent video game

707
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:42,112
Has caused all of the shootings today we found out

708
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:48,512
Supremacy

709
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:52,096
I was apart of it

710
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:55,168
So many people were just like always all these violent video games

711
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:55,936
It's all that s***

712
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,472
And now you're the movie

713
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:02,080
F*** you you know what it is

714
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:02,848
Too difficult

715
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,128
To wrestle with the others

716
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,664
The other stuff is

717
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,736
It opens up a knapsack

718
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:11,040
Do things you don't want to look at the contents of

719
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,600
And so you say video games movies blah blah blah

720
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,392
You don't want to unpack the whites

721
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,928
Supremacy you don't want to unpack

722
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,464
The history of domestic violence

723
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,000
It's always behind all these things

724
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:23,072
So you know they played the Doom

725
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:32,288
And then 7 Days Later

726
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:42,528
Earlier in the episode of Chuck Baldwin on

727
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,088
Baldwin is another one of these guys

728
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:45,856
Who's listed

729
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:48,416
In the miac report

730
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,000
Knock me over with a feather

731
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,280
When I learn

732
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:55,840
Take

733
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:03,008
What about you

734
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,944
What we're dealing with here whenever

735
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,760
Categorize people who vote for

736
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:16,832
Myself or Ron Paul or even Bob bar

737
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:23,232
As potential domestic terrorists and make that part of an official state police agency report

738
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,256
We are

739
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,304
Deep do-do there's no doubt about it

740
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,864
It's almost like is a coordinated response

741
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:34,240
It's almost weird that these people have the exact same angle

742
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,544
Conveniently

743
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:43,456
Make the same logical fallacy in order to excuse the fact that a lot of people who support them end up in fire

744
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,480
Violet militias

745
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,016
I mean that strange

746
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,672
Interesting about Chuck

747
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,464
Is that he has come prepared

748
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,744
With a letter

749
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,512
It is written

750
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,792
To the authorities in Missouri

751
00:38:59,328 --> 00:38:59,840
Things about him

752
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,120
He's the only Baldwin brother

753
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:01,888
Weather to actually

754
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:05,472
Public office

755
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,312
But he is

756
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,384
Really can do it

757
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,664
Can't be

758
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,528
He can't run for public

759
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,576
Might be a better actor in terms

760
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,112
Himself

761
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,904
Victim on the show

762
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,464
This dude

763
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
This is crazy

764
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,024
He hasn't later that he's written

765
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,072
To the Missouri

766
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,096
Law enforcement

767
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:35,680
Spoke and she's going to reach

768
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:38,240
Alex

769
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,776
72 and I have

770
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,592
I have a take on this on the other end

771
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,640
This is really f*****

772
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,664
This is like

773
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,992
It's more f***** up than just this guy writing a letter to Jay Nixon have

774
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,296
He's a butt hurt about being listed

775
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,064
Document

776
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,832
Verisk

777
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,416
It is been

778
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,608
Willits

779
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:11,264
It's all over two pages

780
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,848
B

781
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,384
Daredevil Elektra

782
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:23,296
A grievous write you as former presidential candidates as concerned citizens and in the case of Ron Paul at the sitting member of the US

783
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,088
House of Representatives and Bob bar

784
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,648
Remember 1995 to 2000

785
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,416
3

786
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:34,816
Bring your attention the most disturbing document being circulated by the Missouri information analysis Center Mac

787
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:35,584
Steal your office

788
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,608
And your name is governor

789
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:41,984
Respectfully demand its following describe document the immediately remove any and all websites

790
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,288
Associated with or maintained by the state of Missouri

791
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,824
Brady agency thereof

792
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,616
Including the miac

793
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:52,736
The document no longer be circulated by the state of Missouri or any agency there up or associated therewith

794
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:57,344
Missouri repudiate its references to the three of us has contained therein

795
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:01,952
The document to which river is identified as follows and a copy of clothes there with

796
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:08,608
Ron's Automotive

797
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,936
The thing that I really want to drive home

798
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,728
This isn't just

799
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,264
Chuck Baldwin saying

800
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,544
You know it's

801
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,848
To me that I'm in this

802
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,432
This is an attempt to bully law enforcement

803
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,224
Cannot be able to do their jobs

804
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,504
Because

805
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,320
Like people like Chuck Baldwin and Ron Paul

806
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,368
Don't want to own up to the effect

807
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,648
They've had on society

808
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,696
They know damn well

809
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,000
Little lot of their supporters have gone that way

810
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,536
Especially Ron Paul

811
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,328
There's literally no way that

812
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:42,144
If you can't recognize that a lot of his supporters are f****** whites

813
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,448
He can't

814
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,728
It's literally

815
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,496
Beyond

816
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,544
Realm of possibility

817
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,312
Plead ignorance

818
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:53,663
Especially considering his own writings

819
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,087
Right

820
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,391
Neo-Nazi ties that he has

821
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,231
For these guys who

822
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,255
Dino

823
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,535
Dino's video

824
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,071
Right

825
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:14,911
As a political

826
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:20,031
Getting together and writing a letter to Jay Nixon

827
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,311
The governor of Missouri

828
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:27,711
To be like this is a slanderous documented how dare you with

829
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:32,831
Are suspected of being in these militias and dangerous groups

830
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:37,183
They're taking that propaganda angle that is the misrepresent

831
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,743
Haitian that the

832
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:43,327
I did and they're weaponizing it against the very lawn for

833
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,351
Ourisman agencies

834
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,143
And the governor of Missouri

835
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,447
In order to get them to not be able

836
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,983
To express a truth

837
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:50,751
A truce

838
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,287
Big people in these groups

839
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,311
Do support.

840
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,383
Text terrorism

841
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,943
To some extent that information terrorism

842
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:03,807
Yeah and they're able to because people like Bob bar people like Ron Paul and Chuck Baldwin

843
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,087
Have social cap

844
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,623
They can bully

845
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,391
The governor to do

846
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,183
Andy Sixx

847
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,231
Yeah

848
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:17,375
They reneged or whatever their correct term is the Niagara for it

849
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:20,447
They said they rescind it I got to be the best

850
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,983
Because of all the pressure from

851
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:22,751
People like

852
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,031
These three

853
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,823
How dare you name Us in this

854
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,103
Dave

855
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,175
Inaccurate

856
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:36,319
They are babe just to put their tail between their legs and couch

857
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,087
To the pressure

858
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:39,903
Right-wing propaganda

859
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,767
I mean

860
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,839
Central like

861
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,119
Truth

862
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,399
That

863
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,191
A bunch of powerful White

864
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,215
Get together and

865
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:53,983
B****

866
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,007
Things will change

867
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,287
Because everybody is

868
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:57,567
F******

869
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,639
Fine just go

870
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,431
Happening

871
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:06,271
Keeps hair

872
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,831
He's partially just go away and then the other part

873
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:11,903
Be very fear of things that are in the miac.

874
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:15,231
Your followers might bomber

875
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:17,023
That's not to say that the

876
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,303
In everybody who follows

877
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,119
But there's a bunch of

878
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,911
So

879
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,215
You know it's implicit threat

880
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,007
That's underneath a letter that you sent it

881
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:27,775
The governor

882
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,055
Along with like

883
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,079
Girls they're never going

884
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,639
That they open up

885
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,687
Dammit

886
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,735
Government and the

887
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:38,783
Ron Paul

888
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:41,855
Sitting member of the United has a hello

889
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:45,439
Oh God that can't be real Bob bar from 1995 to

890
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,719
T2000

891
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,535
What he's in the government

892
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,071
Price

893
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,631
Sew in

894
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:56,447
But he knows that his story about the document

895
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,727
A little bit

896
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,799
Okay I will just add that

897
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,591
They start out

898
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:09,759
Connect

899
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,295
Malicious

900
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:16,159
Which base

901
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:22,047
Basically the majority American people pro-second Amendment

902
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,631
You name it

903
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:29,215
The Departed about a little bit

904
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:29,983
Is like

905
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,519
The listing of

906
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,543
Cop killers

907
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:35,359
Malicious

908
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:39,455
Like it's it's he's trying to pretend that they aren't the same thing

909
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:42,783
Twaimz

910
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:43,807
You know

911
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,599
Silent malicious don't exist

912
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,879
I'd like to take you back

913
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:53,023
When Georgia militiamen members of the peaceful chehaw tribe

914
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,303
We're done by other tribes

915
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:57,375
They knew in advance that the Cheaha tribe were a friendly group

916
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,143
And not the one

917
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:04,543
Decided to take out their anger on them anyway

918
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,311
Examples of

919
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:08,383
Exactly racially-motivated

920
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,175
Militia groups but that's

921
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:10,943
Too far back

922
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:17,599
So let's just mention the Bundy Ranch the malheur wildlife standoff the Oklahoma City

923
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,647
And then there's the countless

924
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:23,487
Disrupted plots of militia members trying to bomb boss

925
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,023
Take over army base

926
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,559
And Then There Was Fear

927
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:31,167
Demolition of non-commissioned service

928
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:33,727
As part of the plan to take over Fort Stewart in Georgia

929
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:38,079
19 year old named Michael

930
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,383
17 year old girl friend Tiffany York

931
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,919
And threw their bodies in a lake

932
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:42,943
Because they thought Roar

933
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:43,711
Snatched

934
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,503
Everything

935
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:46,527
Cursive F

936
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:48,063
But that's a matter for another time

937
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,599
There's tons

938
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,135
And tons of militia viola

939
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,159
Even in prison

940
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,719
To 1880

941
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,511
The history of malicious

942
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,047
Have largely been

943
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:05,215
Bored and killing

944
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,263
Generally causing

945
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:12,127
What a coalition of Stolen Valor and

946
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:14,687
Racist actually did served

947
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:19,039
So here is Chuck

948
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,319
Plan was to poison

949
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,087
Annapolis

950
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,927
Sherwood

951
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:27,487
I don't know maybe the applefield was like

952
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:32,351
It specifically went to Fort Stewart maybe his apples we're going to get inside

953
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,911
Southern

954
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:35,679
Classic

955
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:39,007
Sleeping Beauty plan I don't pretend to understand like

956
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:42,335
The finer points militia plans

957
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:48,735
Because generally they're a little crazy his f****** girlfriend got murdered for his other plot of

958
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,527
Sleeping Beauty

959
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,855
Find a lot of militia plot

960
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,391
Did I end up looking into

961
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:58,463

Yeah yeah

963
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,279
Kind of the

964
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:04,095
The equivalent of like a Rube Goldberg machine

965
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:10,495
It's like I don't understand how old is like mousetrap

966
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,407
Plan to achieve an objective

967
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,967
From

968
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,247
Yeah

969
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,015
To be like this

970
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,855
An action plan is like

971
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:29,183
Is few moving parts

972
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,743
Because anything could go wrong

973
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:37,375
Control every look at the raid on Osama Bin Laden's house

974
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:41,727
It's not like okay so here's what we're going to do

975
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,567
Six guys in there

976
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:50,431
He's going to have to Fry Road

977
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,967
Finally

978
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:54,527
Yobama

979
00:48:54,783 --> 00:49:00,927
Where can I get a hologram of Jenny McCarthy

980
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:03,999
Georgia

981
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,815
Yeah there's easier easy

982
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:09,119
Either way

983
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:12,959
Here

984
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:16,031
Expresses

985
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,055
Is going to do

986
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,335
In response

987
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:21,663
To this mayak document

988
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:27,807
What what

989
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:32,415
Talking Ron Paul talking about

990
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,975
Retracted

991
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:40,351
I think I think I can safely say that the sense of

992
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:43,679
Chevy Traverse is that this is serious enough

993
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:47,007
If the state of Missouri does not respond appropriately

994
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:53,663
That we should consider legal action II think that is certainly a consideration right now

995
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:54,943
Yes

996
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,479
They're going to snow

997
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:58,015
No it was not

998
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:01,855
They know damn well that they are not going to pursue any legal action

999
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,391
Because if they went to court

1000
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,927
Guess what

1001
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:07,231
All of it would be proven true

1002
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:11,583
Well never ever get into any underworld situation

1003
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:14,143
Where the guys are actually just providing

1004
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,935
A list of Victoria

1005
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:22,335
A list of violent malicious demonstrating what the report actually says

1006
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:28,223
It supported this progress 88 be like

1007
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:30,015
Marine Le Pen

1008
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,551
Legally named

1009
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,623
Whenever it's real

1010
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:40,255
Maria a unified front and the threat of a lawsuit is going to be enough

1011
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,535
Forget that

1012
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:46,399
I mean this is baby stuff man

1013
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,679
This is like a queen

1014
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:49,215
Whenever

1015
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:50,751
Do you know the right

1016
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:53,823
In the Alex Jones is in the Patriots all these people

1017
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:56,639
Crow on all day about responsibility

1018
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,455
Big Talk Non-Stop about

1019
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,295
Bruce Randolph

1020
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,087
And here you have a situation where

1021
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,391
There's a report that comes out

1022
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,927
That just says

1023
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:11,231
The people who are in dangerous militia

1024
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,511
Is Pam to like these

1025
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,303
And those people

1026
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,839
Can't handle that

1027
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:19,167
So they lie about it and threaten the law enforcement

1028
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,703
People

1029
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,471
Who played

1030
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,031
So it's so childish

1031
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:25,823
It's the definition of

1032
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,871
I don't I don't

1033
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:28,639
Is pathetic

1034
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:29,919
Whatever

1035
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:30,687
Really

1036
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,479
Really Chuck Baldwin

1037
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:38,879
Hope for better Congressman pausing we're going to write a letter

1038
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,767
I hate feeling that way like I just

1039
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,327
They just always comes back

1040
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,863
Need a higher class of criminal

1041
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,167
I know it

1042
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:51,935
They suck

1043
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,983
They don't live by their own principles

1044
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,031
Winchester

1045
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,055
When put

1046
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,591
To the metal

1047
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:03,199
They show themselves to be

1048
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,479
It never ceases

1049
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,247
To bother me

1050
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:08,063
These people are so disappointing and I've done so much damage

1051
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:12,671
The only mean does that make sense but that's really the sense that I have is like

1052
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,999
Just drive home that like

1053
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,535
Literacy is important

1054
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,839
Like all of this could be stopped

1055
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,375
They're lying to a head

1056
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:28,287
Have the ability to critically read the thing if you allow your child to be literate he shouldn't have any

1057
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:31,359
Anything to fear from the child who isn't literate Dan

1058
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:36,991
All right fair enough

1059
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,015
Jordan

1060
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,063
I should tell you something

1061
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:40,831
WhatsApp

1062
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,879
A little piece of information

1063
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:50,815
Tammy

1064
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:55,935
One of them is the anonymous cop who sent him the Maya

1065
00:52:56,703 --> 00:53:02,847
Yes about how he's a big supporter into

1066
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,871
Out

1067
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:13,343
But okay I get it you Wrangle to I understand that you took it personally that your body was in here

1068
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,879
But that's not that still doesn't

1069
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:15,903
YouTube

1070
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,183
Read this act

1071
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:21,279
So it's still I'm not Charmed by that interview it doesn't help me at all

1072
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:24,607
And so we can ignore that

1073
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:29,215
Voice maskers

1074
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:34,847
Range of Missouri accent

1075
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,639
Or anything

1076
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:39,199
At the end of the show Alex has another guy

1077
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,271
Disappearance

1078
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,295
Might change

1079
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,063
Everything

1080
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,343
Alex Jones

1081
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:57,375
He Stewart Roads credit a great website

1082
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,655
Constitutional lawyer

1083
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,847
Constitution

1084
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:22,207
Call your work when you're absolutely right that was a fantastic Segway that officer

1085
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,487
Goalkeeper

1086
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:26,303
What we

1087
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,631
Like that out

1088
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:34,495
Don't use their real names

1089
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,663
We want them to be able to continue in their job

1090
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,455
Continue doing the good work then I can people

1091
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:44,735
So

1092
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:45,759
Stewart Road

1093
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:46,783
Is on

1094
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:51,647
Paratrooper for a time but he was injured in a shooting accident

1095
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,439
Received an honorable discharge

1096
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,207
From the service

1097
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:55,743
Thank you for your

1098
00:54:56,767 --> 00:55:00,095
Ron Paul campaign

1099
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:00,863
For president

1100
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:01,631
It is

1101
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:03,423
Because it really seems to

1102
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,703
It has stuck up for him

1103
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:06,239
Was how unfair it was

1104
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:08,799
For people to associate Ron Paul

1105
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,823
Right-wing extremist

1106
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:15,455
Orbitform must remind everyone of the attempted takeover of Dominica and of course Ron Paul's racist newsletter that

1107
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,991
Monitor with written in the first

1108
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:20,063
After the failure of Ron Paul to become president

1109
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,855
Roadside to change approach

1110
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:24,927
Noticing notice things he Rising tide of the early

1111
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:27,231
Tea Party Movement

1112
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:37,983
Only about a month before disappearance on Alex Jones Show

1113
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:40,799
He's very young

1114
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,079
. of the organization

1115
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:47,199
Keepers based on the 10 orders that The Oath Keepers will not follow

1116
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:50,271
All of these orders are imaginary and all of them would be unconstitutional

1117
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,551
Institutional on their face

1118
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:55,647
The entire Basalt vanilla ice cream

1119
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:58,975
The entire basis of The Oath Keepers basically the same as

1120
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,767
Be temperament resolutions that Alex

1121
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:02,303
Keeps bringing up on his show

1122
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:07,167
They're really just aggressively pushing things that are already lost pretending that they aren't

1123
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:10,495
It's not hard to think of them is like a man who's looking

1124
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,263
Distract

1125
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:14,591
From how he's cheating on his wife by insisting that they should renew their vows

1126
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,639
It's kind of the same thing they're like

1127
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,175
We will not

1128
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:20,735
Met many of the early Amendment

1129
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:23,807
And that's one of their 10 like one of them is

1130
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,831
We will not

1131
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:29,439
Listen to any order that involves allowing people free speech

1132
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:35,583
We will not

1133
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,399
Infringe upon the rights of journalists

1134
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:49,407
So recognizing an opportunity to piggyback on the burgeoning sent out representative

1135
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,431
30 of the

1136
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,455
4th of July

1137
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:53,247
2090 party protest

1138
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,271
Backcountry

1139
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,295
And in doing so he

1140
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,575
He successfully associated

1141
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:57,599
His movement

1142
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,159
But before that

1143
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:02,719
Here he is on Alex Jones Show

1144
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,999
Pitching.

1145
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,559
Snow lawyer

1146
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:12,959
I don't know I got out of the service

1147
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:16,799
Bard

1148
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:20,639
Not entirely

1149
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:26,271
What state was he was involved in some kind of oath keeper active

1150
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,551
He wrote a letter

1151
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,855
Implied

1152
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:31,647
Vicki was acting as a lawyer

1153
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:33,183
Andy was

1154
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,207
Allowed to

1155
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:36,767
We got this far

1156
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:39,327
He's actually

1157
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,375
Pasta Bar in

1158
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:42,399
Like

1159
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,935
Here he is

1160
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,471
Degree

1161
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:47,007
He is he's not like

1162
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,031
He's not an idiot

1163
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,567
I think he's a sociopath

1164
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,335
For sure

1165
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:53,663
But we'll get into a little bit more about The Oath Keepers

1166
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,479
And why

1167
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:00,063
Is it parallel to the present day

1168
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,343
Very bad

1169
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,159
Even more so then what we talked about the last episode

1170
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:07,999
I didn't know when we were going over that stuff on the last episode that

1171
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:08,767
Literally

1172
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:10,303
Right around the corner was going

1173
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:12,095
The founder of The Oath Keepers

1174
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:17,983
About a month Into The Oath Keepers existing coming on Alex's show and the two of them getting along like best

1175
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:20,799
So it does bear mansion

1176
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,127
Couple days before we're recovering now

1177
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,151
Jack McLamb

1178
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:27,711
Noted a holocaust denier

1179
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:29,247
Kbon Alex Jones

1180
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:31,295
Orders

1181
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:32,831
That The Oath Keepers

1182
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:33,599
Will not

1183
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:34,367
Follow

1184
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,159
So there's already been

1185
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,951
Serval priming of the audience

1186
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,999
To the idea that

1187
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:42,815
Pretty cool

1188
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:46,399
Super cool and I'm guessing the Jack McLamb behind-the-scenes

1189
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,167
Connected Outlet

1190
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,751
Being here we go

1191
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,799
So Alex wants to ask

1192
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,103
How to skip going

1193
00:58:55,871 --> 00:59:02,015
Just amazing cuz like president

1194
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,975
Camping Trinidad

1195
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:12,511
DC office

1196
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:17,887
And I had the idea that we know

1197
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:21,215
And what's our next move

1198
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:23,519
And my thought was as well

1199
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,615
Beyond the men with the guns

1200
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:29,151
If you're going to have

1201
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:31,455
Awakening of 1 million people

1202
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:34,271
Awaken 1 million people

1203
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:37,343
Reconstitution what would you want focus on the military

1204
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:47,071
Yeah that's troubling resume

1205
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:51,679
If you had to get 20 people on your side you want them all to be the people with gun

1206
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,471
Only if you

1207
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:59,615
If you are a listener of knowledge fight

1208
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,151
If you have a gun or not

1209
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:03,199
It's not really not really important

1210
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:10,111
Immediately after

1211
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:12,671
You're bitching and moaning about my ex

1212
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:16,767
As the founder of a violent militia on his show

1213
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:22,143
Go Translate

1214
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,543
You know there's a pretty good indication

1215
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,335
Systemic culture

1216
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:32,383
Within a lot of organ

1217
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:34,687
Birds that are

1218
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:35,711
Deeply racing

1219
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:37,247
But

1220
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,271
Superior

1221
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:39,551
Stewart

1222
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:40,575
Comes in

1223
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:42,111
Within an hour

1224
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:45,439
Do we know Alex Jones

1225
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:47,231
Analogies

1226
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:52,351
The rings of the Ring of Power

1227
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:55,935
They think the ring of power is at these guys are going to do whatever they say

1228
01:00:56,703 --> 01:01:00,287
Deserving of power

1229
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:02,335
Any more fundamentally to the people

1230
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:06,175
You do

1231
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:12,575
Special

1232
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,135
You are something special

1233
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,183
Empower is this

1234
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:19,743
Flight allegory for nuclear weapons

1235
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:24,607
Like I said Alex loves the movie metaphor

1236
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:27,679
Here it comes in with the movie metaphor Alex's like

1237
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:31,007
F*** this is how I understand things to you and I are friends

1238
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,543
God you are so petty

1239
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:38,175
You can take this is like 2 minutes into the Raiders

1240
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,967
Buddies now

1241
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:42,527
Why would the ring of power Jeff

1242
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:52,511
The ring of power is the military whatever they want

1243
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:53,791
The military

1244
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:56,351
You do whatever you want

1245
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,655
So his argument is that be

1246
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:01,471
Because the globalist control the military guys with

1247
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:03,007
There

1248
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:05,311
Okay no

1249
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,079
Actually

1250
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:10,687
The guys with guns have sworn to protect the country

1251
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:12,479
Rain is there for

1252
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:16,063
The globalist have this ring of power over that but in reality

1253
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,343
The Oath Keepers are helping to

1254
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:20,415
Contextualize

1255
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,439
To the country

1256
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:24,767
Very different very different thing

1257
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:31,167
And therefore you can fight against your country if you want

1258
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,191
Other things that

1259
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:38,079
You are now part of our group

1260
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:40,895
With inside

1261
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,967
That's always worked out well

1262
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:48,831
When was the last time having a separatist group that doesn't take the actual government

1263
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:55,487
Sovereign or whatever is legitimate

1264
01:02:55,743 --> 01:03:00,607
Blackwater

1265
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:01,887
So

1266
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:05,727
Alex is we called ourselves the keeper

1267
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:08,799
Alex is so thrilled to make a

1268
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:11,103
He's really excited

1269
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:14,431
Because this movement is just getting going

1270
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:18,783
We're still a couple months away from the 4th of July when he sends out everybody

1271
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,623
Deals Keepers with

1272
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:24,671
Tea Party

1273
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:26,975
But Alex

1274
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:28,511
Good mood

1275
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,303
Did he comes back from

1276
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,071
Break

1277
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:32,863
Sing along with a little song

1278
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,399
He's clearly trying to

1279
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,679
Implant in his audio

1280
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:36,447
A mind

1281
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,471
Is actually

1282
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,007
Enough about the okay

1283
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:45,663
And we're going to be best friends

1284
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:58,463
Declaring

1285
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:15,359
Looking

1286
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:28,159
Thank God for the Renegade

1287
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:40,959
Lord knows where we'd be

1288
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,799
When it comes to Heroes

1289
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,335
Renegade

1290
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:54,015
The mountain power lawsuit

1291
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:56,063
Right here

01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:59,903

1293
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:06,815
Looking everywhere for the rain

1294
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,863
Counting

1295
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:14,239
The police

1296
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:16,543
Yorkipoo

1297
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:20,895
I can play

1298
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:27,295
Obama born

1299
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,487
I want

1300
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:37,535
Too and I think we

1301
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,303
You can do this

1302
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:39,839
Because this is public

1303
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:44,447

1304
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:46,495

Teaser

And it will still blow your mind

1312
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:09,791

01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:22,335
These guys are clearly forming a bond

01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:24,127
Talking about Lord the Rings

1319
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:27,455
Talk about how great it is to fight depression

1320
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:33,343
I can talk lord-of-the-rings that'll be fun maybe just don't be part of a white separatist

1321
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:40,255
White supremacist other Lord of the Rings with everybody but you

You're out

Ever

1325
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,239
Here's what

1326
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,775
I'm having a big issue

1327
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:53,311
Innocent

1328
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:54,591
There is

1329
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,359

You can put in there

1333
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:03,551
Rob do is Legolas

1334
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:12,767
I wish there was no context

1335
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:18,655
You know

1336
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:24,799
Who is Legolas and then we just move on I don't think Leanne Macado's around yet but she obviously

1337
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:29,407

1338
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:35,551
I would read this book since I was a kid

1339
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:37,599
Alright anyway

Monster Cher

1343
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:47,583
And then going to make some claims

1344
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,631
That I don't think reality backs up

1345
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:54,495
You have to DARE great ladies and gentlemen

1346

Store hours

1353
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:37,247
That's why

1354
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:42,367
Keepers of stress that this was

1355
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:45,183
Contemplated a plan before the election

1356
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:51,583
We didn't care who got elected it didn't make a difference who was Kennedy president

1357
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:52,607
Duty military

1358
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:53,375
And veterans

1359
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,703
Who's president

1360
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:03,615

Fleur-de-lis of gathering of eagles

1363

Hardcore conservative groups

1364
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,791
What's a dangerous

1365
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:28,191
Oh really are they became president

1366
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:34,847
Neutral on political thoughts

1367
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:37,151
Maybe now

1368
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:44,831
Neutral group of people now get the danger

1369
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:47,391
Wheaten Terrier

1370
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:51,487
Weird

1371
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:56,863
It really it really is hard to hear him say like

1372
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:03,263
There's a hardcore conservative groups that probably wouldn't listen to dangerous

1373
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,031

They weren't paying attention was elected now they're waking up

1376
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:17,599
Right

1377
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:23,743
Another clip

1378
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,559
I love it

1379
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,583
Complains about people

1380
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:28,351
Bull shiting on other

01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:35,519
Cuz I literally am back that

1382
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:38,335
Glenn Beck hates Fox News

1383

All the people that he's now like supper going back but all these other people who

1384
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,455
In bed with

1385
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,991
They're all fake

1386
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,063
Alright

1387
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,087
So Alex

1388
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:50,623
Makes a proclamation

1389
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:51,903
Think this is like

1390
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:52,927
The moment where Alex

1391
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:53,695
Texas like

1392
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:54,719
I

1393
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,487
Love

1394
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:00,095
That's right anyway no one gets out of here alive

1395
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:02,399
Free

1396
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:06,495
That's all

1397
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:08,031
Pikachu

1398
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:09,823
So they want you to think it's hopeless

1399
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:12,895
Like you're staring into the

1400
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:22,623
Is is what they what they want you to see you'll think it's hopeless Crystal

1401
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:37,983
And then I will discuss

1402
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,007
Some of the problems

1403
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:40,799
Just claim you know what I really

1404
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:43,615
Violet militia

1405
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:45,919
Expression

1406
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:49,247
It's not about my life

1407
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:55,903
Yours

1408
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:57,951
Children

1409
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:05,119
Maybe aren't alive anymore

1410
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:10,239
Extort says one

1411
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:12,543
One of the most Monster Bleeding Out Roofing

1412
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:15,871
And then on the other end I will demonstrate

1413
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:23,295
Positive negativity

1414
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:25,087
They're starting to see the other side

1415
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:28,671
You don't feel like you said we have we have the strength

1416
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:31,487
The positive organization

1417
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,255
Jordan

1418
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:35,327
Provide free breakfast

1419
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:39,679
Impoverished

1420
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:42,751
Rhodes

1421
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:47,615
Fellowship of patriotic

1422
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:49,663
Listed people

1423
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:51,199
Are united by their promise

1424
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:53,247
Enlistment oath

1425
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:55,295
Protect America from enemies foreign and domestic

1426
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:58,879
I forgot that a lot of them are also currently

1427
01:12:59,135 --> 01:12:59,647
Law enforcement

1428
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:06,047
Awesome closer analysis of their actions

1429
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:08,351
Directions to Foster's

1430
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:09,375
Terrorist

1431
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,143
Subscribed

1432
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:11,423
Crypto racist worldview

1433
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:14,239
On April 15th 2009

1434
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:19,103
Keeper Daniel Knight Hayden quote locked and loaded for the Oklahoma State Capitol

1435
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,127
See what happens

1436
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:23,455
Another maybe it's time to die

1437
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:29,599
Let's see if I can video record the highway patrol at the entrance of the Oklahoma state capitol while trying to inform them of The Oath Keepers

1438
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:31,135
I posted to the internet

1439
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:34,975
Since I live on I live on this sorry f****** States

1440
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:39,071
That's as good a place as any to start a war

1441
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:44,447
And no matter what happened posted on the internet immediately and send it to Alex Jones

1442
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,215
Tons of EX

1443
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:46,495
He's such a

1444
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:48,799
Positive member of

1445
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:53,407
He would go on to say quote of the war will start on the steps of the Oklahoma State Capitol

1446
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:57,503
I will cast the first stone in the meantime I wait the police start

1447
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:59,295
Killing now I'm willing to be the

1448
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:00,063
The first death

1449
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:03,647
Though he wasn't a valued member of both the Tea Party

1450
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:04,671
Is right-wing Outlets like

1451
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:07,743
The Free Republic immediately began trying to paint Haven as a leftist

1452
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:11,327
This was just a plot to make right-wing groups look bad

1453
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:14,399
This happened a month after

1454
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:16,191
Interview on Alex Jones

1455
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:20,287
April

1456
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:22,335
Two months they had a domestic terrorist

1457
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:24,383
Stewart guys

1458
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,919
On January 10th

1459
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:31,551
2010 Ford Marina no keeper Charles Dyer was arrested on charges of raping a seven-year-old child

1460
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:36,927
Authorities searched his home they found a grenade launcher that was reported stolen from California Military Base

1461
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:41,791
Previously diary been charged with quote making disloyal comment or statement

1462
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:45,631
In reference to YouTube videos get released reactively called for armed

1463
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:46,655
Violent resistance

1464
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:47,423
To the government

1465
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:51,775
He was acquitted of the charges and will go on to produce videos where he literally said that

1466
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:52,543
To become a

1467
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:53,311
Terrorist

1468
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:57,407
His word when Charles was due to appear in court for his trial

1469
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:59,711
And ended up leading the FBI on almost

1470
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:02,527
Weeklong Manhunt during which time he posted Crypt

1471
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:05,087
Threats to law enforcement that they better not

1472
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:05,855
Catch up with him

1473
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:08,159
When he was finally caught without into

1474
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:14,815
And tried the charges were the grenade launcher dropped when he claimed launcher and thought it was a

1475
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:15,583
Flamethrower

1476
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:19,423
I don't know

1477
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:25,823
I guess I didn't know this was a nuclear bomb

1478
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:29,151
Dodge Charger

1479
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:30,175
30 years in prison

1480
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:36,063
Legal trouble mounted and Light

1481
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:37,087
Charles Dyer

1482
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:39,903
He claimed the dire had paid the $30 membership fee

1483
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:42,975
B

1484
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,255
Become a member of the group

1485
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:45,791
Rhodes Greece

1486
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:50,655
You didn't want to own dire as one of his own members which is really difficult to square with the reality

1487
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:55,775
Because video is produced by Oath Keepers list Charles Dyer is the group's quote official liaison to the

1488
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:01,663
He was

1489
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:04,223
He was their official liaison to the Marine Corps

1490
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:10,879
To make matters worse dire it spoken at a Fourth of July 2000

1491
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:12,415
And the publication

1492
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:15,487
I hate trackers founded no trick by Stuart Road

1493
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:18,303
Housekeeper members promoting tires appearance

1494
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:22,143
Deliver one heck of a fiery speech

1495
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:27,007
Again we see this trend continuing of people gleefully profiting off radicalized

1496
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:29,311
7 people and encouraging them down as violent

1497
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,079
Dangerous path

1498
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:33,407
Then pretended they had nothing to do with them once the radicalized party

1499
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:34,943
Is The Logical conclusion

1500
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,479
Of the path they were on

1501
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:39,039
Just don't see how this is relevant

1502
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:40,063
Modern

1503
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:42,367
Not at all I just don't see any

1504
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,135
Unparalleled

1505
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:45,695
Episode

1506
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:46,719
It's so date

1507
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:49,023
Then of course there was a case of Darren Huff

1508
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:52,351
The oath keeper who plotted to take over Madisonville Tennessee with the help of his

1509
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:53,119
Melissa buddy

1510
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:56,447
We talked about this on the last episode so there's no need to dwell on this one

1511
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:58,495
There's one interesting notes

1512
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:02,335
Make your though about how these groups are too cowardly to own their own filth

1513
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:04,639
On March 20th 2017

1514
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:07,711
Jerome corsi got on the Alex Jones Show and told Alex

1515
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,735
The Darren Hobbs

1516
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:11,551
The rest was the result of the Playland

1517
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:17,439
But it been revealed by Joe Arpaio and Mike zullo thanks for Snowden whistleblower

1518
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:18,719
Dennis Montgomery

1519
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:23,583
Course he was attempted to tide Darren Huss arrested with the Montgomery

1520
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:25,119
Leaving aside that

1521
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:26,655
The dentist Montgomery information is

1522
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:27,679
Complete b*******

1523
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:28,959
Houses under surveillance

1524
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:32,031
Because he told bank teller that he was going to take over Madisonville

1525
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:33,823
And the bank teller called The Authority

1526
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:36,127
Never not

1527
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,151
A guy who's playing this

1528
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:37,919
To take over a

1529
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,199
Like

1530
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,223
Like

1531
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:42,271
So so then what

1532
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:50,463
You doing and that you think that

1533
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,743
You can hold

1534
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:52,511
I don't know

1535
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:55,071
And it's crazy but what you see here is that like

1536
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,351
No matter what

1537
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:58,399
Infowars in their Associates

1538
01:17:58,655 --> 01:17:59,167
It exists in

1539
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:00,703
In a primary role

1540
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:01,727
Who's white viola

1541
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:04,031
White terrorism white militia violin

1542
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:06,079
Because while at the same time

1543
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:07,871
What because years later

1544
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:10,687
Jerome corsi is trying to excuse Darren Huff

1545
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:12,735
Steak over Mattis

1546
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:13,759
Sissonville Tennessee

1547
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:16,063
Because Darren Huff is a wizard

1548
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:17,087
Bazinga birthday

1549
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:23,743
He was also a really big Obama can't be president guy so it fits in with their oppression Narrative of

1550
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:24,511
People who

1551
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:25,791
Things they do

1552
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:28,095
Because Jerome corsi wrote multiple books

1553
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:31,423
So you have him going way out of his way to fix

1554
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,191
Use this Melissa

1555
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:34,239
Superman

1556
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:36,031
Because it helps them

1557
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:40,383
It was Matthew Fairfield we talked about on the last episode was arrested

1558
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:42,175
Super making and housing a bunch of bomb

1559
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:45,247
Including a Napalm bomb which according to experts is quotes

1560
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:46,015
Berkeley design

1561
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:47,039
Yusan other

1562
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:49,087
Matthew Fairfield you of course

1563
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:51,903
Was the president of the Cleveland chapter of the oak

1564
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:52,927
Again

1565
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:59,327
Not a pulp remember

1566
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:06,495
2015 olds keeper John timer came to focus of the media after he started wandering

1567
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:07,263
Around in front of

1568
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:09,055
Phoenix

1569
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:10,079
F*** Islam

1570
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:13,919
Muhammad contest outside

1571
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:15,455
In an interview with Anderson

1572
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,223
Cooper after

1573
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:16,991
Recuperar tri-tip

1574
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:18,271
Explain

1575
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:19,807
Clearly constituted product

1576
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:21,599
Location

1577
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:27,487
Some will probably argue that the signers that signed the Declaration of Independence was a bad idea back in their day

1578
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:31,327
YouTube

1579
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,095
The country by

1580
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,167
Alright

1581
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:36,191
Alright dude

1582
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:36,959
Right

1583
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:37,983
So

1584
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,263
So

1585
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:42,335
So what are you doing any good

1586
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:44,383
Are you going to

1587
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:47,455
Take over the country back

1588
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:54,367
Well pretty soon after all that John would start a GoFundMe campaign dollars to help him live off the grid

1589
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,647
Because before trying to kill him

1590
01:19:55,903 --> 01:20:02,047
The Grinch

1591
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:06,911
Well

1592
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:13,055
Well either wanted to fund living off the grid or two very publicly try to run against John McCain fries then it's

1593
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:16,640
Living in hiding the running for Senate probably be nosey

1594
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:19,200
That would be fun if you were living off

1595
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:19,968
The grid wallet

1596
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:20,736
The same time run

1597
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:28,416
In June 2015 posted online

1598
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:35,072
In June 2015 he posted online that he was the victim of hacks and he was going to disappear for awhile

1599
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:41,984
Michigan senator Debbie stabenow

1600
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:44,288
Because she voted for the Iran deal

1601
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:50,944
He wrote the supporters quote we have chosen her as our first Target due to our strong ties with the Michigan State militia and

1602
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:57,344
Operating a manner necessary for an operation like this

1603
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,112
Hold on

1604
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:04,256
So their plan is specifically targeting

1605
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:05,536
A state with latch

1606
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:06,304
Text gun laws

1607
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,144
To use guns

1608
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:17,824
No in a manner necessary for an operation like that alright alright

1609
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,784
Document

1610
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:33,184
Why would like gunball operation like this

1611
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:39,584
It's really suspicious

1612
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:45,984
Choosing a state

1613
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:48,288
They're just going to stand around

1614
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:49,824
Hold up

1615
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,384
So they put like placards on their guns

1616
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,664
Because they ran out of 2x

1617
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:56,224
So they're holding up the guns and doing the whole life

1618
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:01,344
It's easier than going to King

1619
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:04,672
Michigan State

1620
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:08,256
Like it's clearly militia organized positive

1621
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:10,304
Though he had a good six months of

1622
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,096
Publicly agitating

1623
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:16,448
Against Muslims being an overall embarrassment of a person

1624
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:23,104
This plan that he had to go and arrest Senator Debbie stabenow was a bridge too far

1625
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,408
And your Keepers decide to go ahead and diss

1626
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,944
Stem cells from him at that point

1627
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:27,968
Probably smart

1628
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:34,624
Laws to arrest people

1629
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,440
Probably

1630
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:40,512
You want to get that done ahead of time

1631
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:41,792
Hey buddy buddy

1632
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:44,352
You do what you got to do

1633
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:50,240
Hanover Madison

1634
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:52,032
Making Napalm bomb

1635
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:53,568
Raping 7 year olds

1636
01:22:54,848 --> 01:23:00,992
We kind of got our disavowing game down

1637
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:03,296
6 domestic terrorist you're like hold on

1638
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:07,392
We're going to let you keep going but we can't have kids.

1639
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:16,096
So John would go on to take part in the malheur wildlife preservation standoff and operated website where you sold fuk is

1640
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:16,864
Bumper sticker

1641
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:19,936
In August 2016 new sentenced to a year in prison

1642
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:20,960
For conspiring to

1643
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:23,008
Police from discharging their duties

1644
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:23,776
Also

1645
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:25,312
He has two kids and lived off.

1646
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:32,736
Big government

1647
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:37,856
Little pieces

1648
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:44,256
Visit these same people who are bitching about entitlements right and he's

1649
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:50,656
Find to run with malicious and try and rest fitting centers with lack gun laws

1650
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:57,056
This year after Hurricane Michael 60 Keepers were arrested

1651
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:57,824
Did Mexico Beach

1652
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,872
Florida while they were out quote-unquote

1653
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:00,640
Patrolling

1654
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:04,224
They had their car painted up to look like an actual police car

1655
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,504
Pickle beer

1656
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,272
Heavily-armed

1657
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:07,552
The actual

1658
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:10,368
The Bay County Sheriff's Office

1659
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:11,904
They're out there patrolling the streets

1660
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:16,512
They don't know the area they don't know the community they don't know our laws and that lends itself to Danger

1661
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:19,072
Please leave Law Enforcement to the profession

1662
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:21,888
So Nikki is at least three people were like

1663
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,168
We're going to rescue her

1664
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:25,728
You're cops

1665
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:30,336
They were hoping to find black people out doing things that look like looting so they could

1666
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:32,128
That's what they were doing

1667
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:38,784
Well that's because Florida has very lacks gun laws and very strong do you understand

1668
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:39,808
Why there

1669
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:40,832
Somewhere like that

1670
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:41,856
That's that's

1671
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:46,464
Specific

1672
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:47,232
Oh yeah

1673
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,536
These are just a few of the notable

1674
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:51,584
Keepers who have run afoul of serious laws

1675
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:52,864
Isn't a quince

1676
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,656
Not a couple of

1677
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:57,984
This list doesn't even begin to mention how they were involved in the Bundy

1678
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:00,288
Sure how The Oath Keepers plan to arrest

1679
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:01,568
The pope when he came to the United

1680
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:02,592
2015

1681
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:03,872
This doesn't

1682
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:07,456
Distance keeper showed up in Ferguson and quote

1683
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:10,016
Almost exclusively white business

1684
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:11,552
After the protest

1685
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:16,416
It doesn't touch on how in the Berkeley and Portland protest in 2017

1686
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:18,208
Propaganda

1687
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:21,024
It worked hard to convey the idea that the

1688
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,304
Police no keepers at work

1689
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:25,632
Berkeley Police off officials

1690
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:26,912
Naturally tonight

1691
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:33,824
But after American Freedom Keepers militia member Todd kelsay was arrested I'm sorry was recorded helping

1692
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,616
Police arrest protesters in Portland

1693
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:36,896
So he's not a cop

1694
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:37,920
It's not hard to see

1695
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:38,688
Kernel of Truth

1696
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,784
So what is The Oath Keepers

1697
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,576
Is an out now

1698
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:48,416
Working hand-in-hand with an organization that

1699
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,184
Doesn't like

1700
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:49,952
To stay there

1701
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:54,560
Can you put always seem to act

1702
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:56,096
I don't think

1703
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:57,376
Like I don't know

1704
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:58,656
I'm not I don't

1705
01:25:58,912 --> 01:25:59,424
Pick your ass up

1706
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:00,704
Unfair

1707
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:02,752
You have a situation where

1708
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:04,800
I'm not going to say that

1709
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:06,592
The Oath Keepers

1710
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:07,360
AR

1711
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:09,664
Operating on a very racist

1712
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:13,504
But man there's a lot of them that are

1713
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,296
And a lot of them

1714
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:16,064
In many ways

1715
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,344
And a lot of them

1716
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:20,672
Brotherhood

1717
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:21,696
Forecastle

1718
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:23,488
Trying to uphold the Constitution

1719
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,560
Stream to take that to where they build bombs

1720
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:28,608
Try and get into shootouts with

1721
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:29,376
Police

1722
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:31,424
End up killing people do these

1723
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,448
The standoff

1724
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:37,056
Jouer drama Hamid contest

1725
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:39,872
In order to antagonize entire populations

1726
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,408
The people and then bake

1727
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:42,176
For money because

1728
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:44,224
Cuz of the natural consequences of your actions

1729
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:45,504
Lakeview Resort

1730
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:47,552
Depended on that

1731
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:51,648
At least the lease egregious

1732
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:52,416
And then you see the

1733
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:55,232
Systemic things about how big groups of them often

1734
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:56,000
Show up late

1735
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:57,280
This is like Ferguson

1736
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:58,304
Like

1737
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,840
In the aftermath of

1738
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,120

1739
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:02,144
Hurricane

1740
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,936
You just be a systematic

1741
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:12,128
And further than that

1742
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:14,688
Uc's Stewart Roads

1743
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:16,224
Doing very intention

1744

People that he had buddied up with

1747
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:21,600
And help down the

1748
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:22,368
The path

1749
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:23,392
Their conclusion

1750
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:27,488
When someone who is the official liaison to the Marine

1751
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:30,304
All ends up going bad

1752
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:33,888
And getting arrested for raping a seven-year-old

1753
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:34,656
Grenade launcher

1754
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:37,728
Like what

1755
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:39,008
Responsibility for that

1756
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,616
6 News

1757
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:46,176
When you have

1758
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:46,944
Head of your

1759
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:49,248
The one of the

1760
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:51,552
Big cities in America by the way

1761
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:52,576
Very large city

1762
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:57,952
Not not a Podunk it's not Madisonville Tennessee chapter about keepers

1763
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,232
Cleveland Ohio

1764
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:01,536
He's caught with a Napalm bomb

1765
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,888
I would like that one

1766
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:06,656
Just

1767
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:09,984
Just like a neighborhood

1768
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:13,056
We're just added a guy has a Napalm bomb

1769
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:19,200
It's at I don't like to think about that

1770
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:20,992
Pretty f*****-up

1771
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,040
So

1772
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:24,320
The point I'm trying

1773
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:25,088
To get at is

1774
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,368
This Behavior

1775
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:27,392
Is

1776
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,928
A defining

1777
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,208
Of the right

1778
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:31,488
Right now

1779
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:32,768
Will you see it with

1780
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:34,560
Everything that's going on in the

1781
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:35,840
All of the

1782
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:37,120
Every time there's something

1783
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:38,144
Sing bad that happens

1784
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,168
What's a natural

1785
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:39,936
Quince

1786
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:42,240
The rhetoric that's put out the violence

1787
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:44,544
Feed excusing of white terrorism

1788
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:45,824
Aldi store

1789
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:48,384
Whenever there is the bubbling over

1790
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:52,224
Never there's this guy interested

1791
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:55,040
True sending all the bombs

1792
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,064
How dare you

1793
01:28:56,320 --> 01:29:01,696
Here's a picture of him at a trump Rally from years ago

1794
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:06,048
Stickers on his truck false-flag at the setup look so clean

1795
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,840
No it's the same thing it's

1796
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:09,120
An inability to take

1797
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:10,912
Responsibility for what

1798
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:15,264
Put out into the world

1799
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,616
They claim to be happy

1800
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:22,176
We're on the hook for a pretty house

1801
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:24,480
Yeah I know I am not

1802
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:27,040
In any way that everybody on the left

1803
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:27,808
Is grade

1804
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:28,832
Taking responsibility

1805
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:31,904
Future of

1806
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:34,464
This world that we look at in the

1807
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:36,256
The Patriot movie

1808
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,536
Make the Liberty people

1809
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:41,376
It's an inability to take responsibility for the reality of the shifter you put in

1810
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:43,424
End of the world he goes all the way back

1811
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,472
Their granddaddy

1812
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:51,104
Behavior with his slider and ability is it specific

1813
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:58,528
Feature not a bug you get the benefit of having what is essentially a

1814
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:04,928
Violent extrajudicial intimidating people who otherwise would

1815
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:06,208
Finally try and vote against

1816
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:13,376
The same time claiming loudly enough and frequently enough that is not part of your group

1817
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:15,424
Believe you that they won't do anything

1818
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:19,008
It's

1819
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:20,288
Rodger Stone

1820
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,872
Let's get out of here while screaming

1821
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:28,992
If you all are demons and you must fall

1822
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,672
It's a it's a modern dilemma

1823
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:38,976
I don't know I don't know

1824
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:42,560
Half out of it but some people responsible

1825
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:44,864
I don't know how you do it

1826
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:45,632
But you got to do it

1827
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:50,496
One of those things where

1828
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:53,056
I don't I don't want to paraphrase this

1829
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:53,824
Too badly

1830
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:56,896
But

1831
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:00,480
If you are still working

1832
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:01,760
White

1833
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:02,528
Violence

1834
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:04,320
I know it when I see it

1835
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:05,600
You know

1836
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:10,976
You're like the Supreme Court definition of pornography

1837
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,888
Write this blanket law

1838
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:19,168
Supremacy is

1839
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:20,448
Is now in prison for

1840
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:21,216
For two years

1841
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:23,008
Because how would you

1842
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:25,824
And how could you enforce that in any way that isn't

1843
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:28,128
AI random

1844
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:34,528
Like I know you're I know you're just a dude on Twitter trying to do whatever but f*** you your

1845
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:39,904
About it

1846
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:40,928
Are you doing

1847
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:41,696
I know

1848
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:42,976
The best way to go about it

1849
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:44,768
But I also know based on

1850
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,560
We played earlier this episode

1851
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:47,584
It won't work

1852
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,376
Asian

1853
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:51,168
And helping people understand

1854
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:55,008
Because of people truly understood beat like the motivation

1855
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,544
The people

1856
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:59,872
Or

1857
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:03,712
Really just trying to get your money they're really just trying to cause

1858
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:06,016
Trouble that they can capitalize off of

1859
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:16,768
So then let's talk about that

1860
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:20,352
Cradock dialogues

1861
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:22,400
You hope you be able to have

1862
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:25,984
With people and be able to get to the bottom of

1863
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:29,056
All roads leading back to

1864
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:30,080
Basically

1865
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:30,848
A couple of

1866
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:32,128
Big Lots

1867
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:35,200
Can't understand the basic premise of a vax

1868
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:36,224
Steam where it's like

1869
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,272
You know how you've been sick before

1870
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:40,832
You know how there are worse ways to get sick

1871
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:41,856
Don't get those

1872
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:43,392
And people are like

1873
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:51,584
There's no way people are going to be able to process propaganda for a reason to Harkin is straighterline

1874
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,120
Passion about how those studies

1875
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,400
Links vaccines

1876
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,168
Is autism

1877
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:56,448
That's a bit

1878
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:00,288
Nice starting ground hopefully you'll be able to demonstrate to them like

1879
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,568
All of these people know

1880
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:08,736
But look at all those people who are telling us

1881
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:14,624
All of those people who were telling you the vaccines

1882
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:15,648
Link to autism

1883
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:16,928
Know very well.

1884
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:17,952
These studies are

1885
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:20,000
Aren't accurate they aren't real but they're pushing

1886
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:21,536
You anyway because it serves

1887
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:25,120
Their political why else would they put in a needle Dan

1888
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:28,448
If you were going to give me a vaccine come in a pill

1889
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:31,008
What

1890
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:34,336
Alright you got me you got me hard right fine

1891
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:37,920
But you could do that with just about any of these narratives if someone were willing

1892
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:39,712
But you're demonstrating

1893
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:40,736
Exactly.

1894
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,088
The demonstration of that is

1895
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:48,160
Earlier where Alex plays the clip of the cop

1896
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:49,440
Very well

1897
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:52,512
Explaining what the miac report actually says

1898
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:54,304
It doesn't do a lick of difference

1899
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:56,352
Alex uses that report still

1900
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:57,632
Years after this

1901
01:33:58,144 --> 01:33:58,656
Duplex

1902
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:03,264
We need to increase the population of deer

1903
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:05,056
Unsustainable level

1904
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:07,360
And then put out

1905
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:08,128
Press release

1906
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:11,456
Everybody can kill deer we got it

1907
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:13,248
It's the best thing to eat for the environment

1908
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:15,040
People are busy

1909
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:16,832
Week or two

1910
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:18,624
While they're in the forest

1911
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:19,904
Living off the grid

1912
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,440
Or doing whatever it is

1913
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:23,232
We sneak into Congress

1914
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:29,888
We do all the right stuff and then when they get back there like what just happened here this plan isn't going to work

1915
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:31,168
Just do this

1916
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:37,568
We just do a sleight-of-hand like a with a baby in a cookie just like all the cookies over here all the cookies over here is playing

1917
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:39,360
Not going to work because in order to get

1918
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:40,128
Depopulation

1919
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:41,152
Rdr2 the level

1920
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:42,944
You're going to need either

1921
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,224
Fully restricted

1922
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,272
I'm really mad

1923
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:52,672
Start

1924
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:57,280
Yeah I'm not sure

1925
01:34:58,304 --> 01:34:59,328
To say okie Preserve

1926
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:00,608
Generally

1927
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:03,680
Organization has

1928
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:04,448
As a whole

1929
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:06,240
Been a very negative

1930
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:09,056
Organization

1931
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:10,080
I beg to differ

1932
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:11,360
I know you run it

1933
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:12,384
But you're wrong

1934
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:14,944
Alright

1935
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,248
Now when kids are like

1936
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,272
9 or 10

1937
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:20,576
We all send them to the

1938
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:22,368
And they all take one test

1939
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:25,696
Where it's just like there's a woman

1940
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:28,512
Is it not even that just like a speaker with

1941
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:29,280
Blonde hair

1942
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:31,840
You're just as kind of like

1943
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:33,632
Oh you look alright

1944
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:35,680
No big deal just like Barry pass

1945
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:36,448
Passive-aggressive

1946
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:42,080
Then we're like

1947
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:44,896
I'm not saying that we're going to put children into a garbage

1948
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:51,552
You're literally just buy them in a generally described in a dream Alex at this is still closed

1949
01:35:51,808 --> 01:35:57,952
Some of his terrible nightmares

1950
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:58,720
Hasn't been working

1951
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:00,000
I know but that's not going to work

1952
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:03,072
What if we put blonde hair

1953
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:04,352
Farragut

1954
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:06,400
Love's

1955
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:07,168
Stewart Rhodes

1956
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:08,960
And it shows in this next

1957
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:10,240
Where he

1958
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:11,520
Is over the moon with

1959
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:20,992
I like

1960
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:22,784
That

1961
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:55,552
Start run operations

1962
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:58,624
I had to leave that in because like Egypt

1963
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:02,208
You hit that breaks so hard

1964
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:05,024
Because he's so excited about this

1965
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:16,288
Although

1966
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:19,360
During this time there was one time

1967
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:26,016
For one of his sponsors

1968
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:30,368
Call home game we played a commercial in the password

1969
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,328
Hookup site

1970
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:41,632
Everybody knows that those are real

1971
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:45,216
Real estate agents are the most trustworthy

1972
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:47,008
Casinos Brothers Liquor property

1973
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:50,848
It's called entire Library Daleks has home again

1974
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:57,504
The name of this

1975
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,296
Play Rock yesterday

1976
01:38:00,064 --> 01:38:00,832
It's all good

1977
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,648
So if we get to

1978
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:04,416
To The Logical

1979
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:05,440
Conclusion to this

1980
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:08,768
To hear very clearly

1981
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:10,048
Alex Jones endorsing

1982
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:10,816
Keepers

1983
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:20,800
Both Dash Keepers. Blogspot.com

1984
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:38,976
Text

1985
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:47,936
The enemy

1986
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:56,896
You have to be involved

1987
01:38:57,152 --> 01:38:59,200
We are we have to shatter

1988
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:04,576
Which is why most of the numbers are inaudible

1989
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:12,256
Synonymous you write letters and post things are

1990
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:16,864
Is good

1991
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:20,960
Past the point of return and the committee will follow

1992
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:25,568
Closest you're going to get from Alex Jones to a full-throated

1993
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:27,104
Endorsement

1994
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:30,432
That's brutal

1995
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:32,736
The first stage of our 2009 Vespa

1996
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:33,760
Navigation is complete

1997
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:35,808
March 19th

1998
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:36,832
2009

1999
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:38,624
Is when Alex Jones got involved with

2000
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,672
The Tea Party

2001
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:41,440
We

2002
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:45,024
Didn't even consider like when you first started this investigation

2003
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,304
You did not have Oak

2004
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:48,864
Keepers on the list of things we were investigated

2005
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:53,216
That's the most obvious popular thing

2006
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:53,984
And then you

2007
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,800
You get the reveal that it's The Oath Keepers

2008
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:59,872
That makes way more sense than the Tea Party

2009
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:04,736
The Oath Keepers are out there doing harm when we went back

2010
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:08,064
2015 sound like

2011
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:11,648
He doesn't like Trump but he's saying Putin is the truth

2012
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:14,976
Yeah

2013
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:27,008
Not even really nationally relevant Oath Keepers

2014
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:28,800
To show up and be

2015
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:29,824
The way that Alex

2016
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:32,128
This is a theory

2017
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:35,456
Yeah I believe that this marks the beginning of Alex Jones getting

2018
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:42,880
Proper it is the remains to be told about the deterioration

2019
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:43,904
Politics that happen

2020
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:45,184
2000

2021
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:50,560
A very good strategy to definitely have nothing to do with a black president

2022
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:55,680
A very good strategy to ensure that the Overton window is shifted in the direction you want

2023
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:57,984
Is the offer two options

2024
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,800
1 miles in one XP

2025
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:03,360
The two sides probably don't even have to like you

2026
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:06,944
The mild side says the extreme is childish and not Siri

2027
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:10,016
Extreme side says

2028
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:11,040
Magnemite

2029
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:12,064
Controlled opposition

2030
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:17,440
Climate guarantees that more people will sign up with the mild side

2031
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:20,000
But the very nature of their overlapping rhetoric

2032
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:21,792
Doordash

2033
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:23,840
Heading in the direction towards the extreme

2034
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:27,680
The people will join with a mild and ultimately find it on satisfying

2035
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:29,472
And head for the more extreme stuff

2036
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:32,800
Becoming acclimated to the extreme side

2037
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:36,128
Go find the answer as to why they weren't Satisfied by the mile.

2038
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:38,432
Because it was controlled opposition all along

2039
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,224
Because the thing is

2040
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,760
The pipe doesn't go the other direction

2041
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:44,832
In this example Glenn Beck doesn't ever deescalate

2042
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:48,928
No one gets free of Alex Jones as propaganda by becoming the Glenn Beck

2043
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:52,512
No one tee programs from The Oath Keepers by falling in love with

2044
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:54,816
Peaceful anti-tax

2045
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:57,376
And realizes that specific action is

2046
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:58,400
Is the best way to effect

2047
01:41:58,912 --> 01:41:59,424
If they want to see

2048
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:01,984
The slide goes downward

2049
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,264
And every convert to

2050
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:06,336
Tea party is one more likely Patriot movement recruit

2051
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:07,104
And waiting

2052
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:10,432
I'm not proposing that this was an elaborate plan or intent

2053
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:11,712
That would be absurd

2054
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:12,992
Conspiratorial thinking

2055
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:15,552
But I am suggesting that looking back on this

2056
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:17,088
There could be no worse setup

2057
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:18,880
For the maintenance of a healthy body polish

2058
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:21,440
Once the GOP started embracing the

2059
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:27,328
Tea party there possibly knowingly or possibly unwittingly embracing not only the extreme side

2060
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:29,376
They're also embracing the mild side

2061
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:30,912
It really only ever exist

2062
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:31,936
Be a conduit to

2063
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:37,568
The way that we talk about our

2064
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,360
Text right so

2065
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:42,432
It turned into Clinton being center-left

2066
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:45,504
And in response to that the center

2067
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:47,552
Went as far right as a possible

2068
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:54,208
Is gone even further

2069
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:54,976
Center-right

2070
01:42:55,232 --> 01:43:00,608
And center-right has turned into crazy right and crazy right has turned into the violent militia group

2071
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:06,752
Bright all the way progressives are over here like

2072
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:13,664
Which was the center-left begins to insist

2073
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:16,992
It's the only way to win elections is

2074
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:23,392
And in response to that they couch out and they make even further concessions to the hard right

2075
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:25,696
Extreme right

2076
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:27,232
Even more radical

2077
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:30,048
How to put a button on them

2078
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:32,608
What we see here I'm sir

2079
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:33,632
Is the

2080
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:34,912
Beginnings of

2081
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:35,680
Alex Jones

2082
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:36,704
Becoming the

2083
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:37,472
Extreme

2084
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:39,776
Extreme version

2085
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,080
Which is characterized

2086
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:45,152
This is his way to get in on the app

2087
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:47,456
Uc's Glenn Beck

2088
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:48,480
Be very successful

2089
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:50,528
Without having to feel like you sold out

2090
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:53,600
And I think that will carry through

2091
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:55,136
Even when he starts associating worth

2092
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:55,904
The Tea Party

2093
01:43:56,672 --> 01:43:57,952
Carry this torch of

2094
01:43:58,464 --> 01:44:00,256
I'm the real version of it this is

2095
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:06,656
This is the media the globalist painted version of we are the 1776

2096
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:08,704
And they're a bunch of bulshit

2097
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:09,728
Glenn Beck

2098
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:10,496
Whichever

2099
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:12,288
Again in retrospect

2100
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:14,080
So much more sense than he does

2101
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:14,848
Jumping on with

2102
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:18,176
I still have to act out even again

2103
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:22,016
Esports over and over again

2104
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:23,808
Anytime we go and

2105
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:25,088
Can we find the kernels

2106
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:26,112
Pieces of Alex

2107
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:28,416
Should have thought of that

2108
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:32,256
Play Ganesh Chalisa

2109
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:33,536
Because now we know

2110
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:34,816
As opposed to just gas

2111
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,888
So we have this miac report I think

2112
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:40,960
With Alex Jones bringing Lawns at cop

2113
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:42,240
Playing at audios

2114
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:44,288
The cop very clearly

2115
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:45,568
Niagara Falls about

2116
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:46,848
And it's not making a dent

2117
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:48,128
It's in the propaganda arm

2118
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,664
We speak of the hope

2119
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:51,200
Of engaging

2120
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:53,504
Or at least with people like

2121
01:44:54,272 --> 01:44:55,040
You see the hopelessness

2122
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:57,600
What's going on

2123
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:59,648
As opposed to it just being a misunderstand

2124
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:01,696
In addition to that you see

2125
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:02,976
Here

2126
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:04,256
The introduction of

2127
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:08,352
And what you're going to end up seeing

2128
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:13,472
Contacts why on the last episode when I told you I went back and I listen to

2129
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:16,800
The time around when that guy got caught with a Napalm bomb

2130
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:18,336
His house who is beheaded

2131
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:19,104
The Cleveland Show

2132
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:21,408
Keepers and Alex's radio sign

2133
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:22,432
It makes

2134
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:24,736
He is with

2135
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:28,320
So he's not going to cover when one of them has a Napalm bomb

2136
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:29,344
Warehouse

2137
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:30,368
No

2138
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:31,136
Wait

2139
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:31,904
I think

2140
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:33,696
That's

2141
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:35,744
If I were in the room

2142
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,024
With Ron Paul

2143
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:39,328
To other asset

2144
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:40,096
Right

2145
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,400
Whenever they tended

2146
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:43,168
The

2147
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:47,008
And we would have been

2148
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:48,544
Like everybody we've been talking

2149
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:49,312
Having a good old time

2150
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:50,592
And then there were two men that

2151
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:53,664
She know everybody has a good laugh and then there's

2152
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:55,456
It's just that low before you get in

2153
01:45:58,016 --> 01:45:58,784
In that law

2154
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:00,320
I would have been like

2155
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:02,112
Miac report

2156
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:04,416
More like Viagra port

2157
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:05,952
And then I would have

2158
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:10,816
Been carried out of that room on everyone Shield hero

2159
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:13,888
Yeah so I see a little bit of what

2160
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:14,912
Does portents for the

2161
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:17,984
I obviously don't know exactly how it all is going

2162
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:20,032
Going to play out and I'm still interested to see

2163
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:22,848
Exact path that goes down but

2164
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:24,128
I mean

2165
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:28,480
This B totally in line with the Alex Jones

2166
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:30,528
Existence from Vandeven in

2167
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:31,808
The present-day as

2168
01:46:32,064 --> 01:46:32,832
Right right wing

2169
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:33,856
Terrorism

2170
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:35,136
White terrorism

2171
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:35,904
Apologist

2172
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,232
Should have known

2173
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:41,280
One more clip here real quick

2174
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:43,072
This is just the end of the interview

2175
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:44,096
Between Alex

2176
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:47,936
We commend you

2177
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:54,336
The website again

2178
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:01,760
He come in

2179
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:05,088
You never see it in her

2180
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:05,856
Interview like that on

2181
01:47:06,112 --> 01:47:10,208
On the show like it

2182
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:16,096
Well at least he was trying to appear to disagree with David in this one in might as well just be like

2183
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:17,888
Like you just watched a meat

2184
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:19,680
Like the two of them.

2185
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:21,472
Oh my God you look

2186
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:24,800
I would I would

2187
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:25,824
Like

2188
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:29,920
Dreamcast

2189
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:30,944
In one of these roles

2190
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:35,296
So Kate Beckinsale is one of the other one

2191
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:37,600
Beckinsale

2192
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:38,624
Whatever

2193
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:39,904
She was in the oven

2194
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:42,976
Underwear laundry

2195
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:45,280
Probably

2196
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:49,632
This is where we end our adventure have struggled

2197
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:50,656
Screw listening

2198
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:53,216
Do all these boring episodes but I'm glad

2199
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:54,496
We getting out of the

2200
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:57,312
This reveal of Alex Jones giving his endorse

2201
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:02,688
Characterize the next

2202
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:03,968
Gears of his program

2203
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:07,552
The entire Direction

2204
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:09,344
He goes I think it will facilitate

2205
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:14,208
So many of the narrative like I think they were going to

2206
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:15,232
To see a lot of these things

2207
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:16,000
We've been tracking

2208
01:48:16,512 --> 01:48:18,304
In terms of these thieves

2209
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:20,352
Anachronistic politics

2210
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:21,888
He has whether it be

2211
01:48:22,144 --> 01:48:23,424
He's anti-police

2212
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:24,704
An early too

2213
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:25,472
9

2214
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:29,056
Is against net neutrality

2215
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:35,968
Our situation is support of Palestine

2216
01:48:36,224 --> 01:48:36,992
Beginning of him

2217
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:40,320
Because of the way that is prospective

2218
01:48:40,576 --> 01:48:43,904
We're a political we're neutral on Olive

2219
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:45,696
We're also hardcore conserve

2220
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:46,976
You know like

2221
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:53,376
Around

2222
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:56,448
What's up that's the in for him

2223
01:48:56,704 --> 01:48:58,752
Because that allows him to

2224
01:48:59,008 --> 01:48:59,520
Feel like

2225
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:03,104
I'm still being a political this isn't a political group

2226
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:07,968
And as he descends further into that group of course he descends further into hardcore

2227
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:08,992
Conservative

2228
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:10,784
I think a lot of it is true

2229
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:12,576
I want

2230
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:13,856
I mean we're getting a little speck

2231
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:15,648
But I wonder how much of that is

2232
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:17,184
Conscious and how much it is

2233
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:20,256
Just going down that road I would I would

2234
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:21,536
Suggest I think some of it

2235
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:24,352
I think you changed themselves like

2236
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:25,376
In order to fit

2237
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:26,144
Whoever

2238
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,448
Is benefactory is it a certain time

2239
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:32,032
Much like you know well doctor group is around

2240
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:33,056
He's way more into

2241
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:34,336
To the medical woo

2242
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:35,616
And stuff like that

2243
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:38,432
Caregiver

2244
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:40,224
In financial source

2245
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:41,760
It's all about the economy

2246
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:43,552
You know you can see

2247
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:44,320
See these sort of

2248
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:47,648
These changes in weather going on with

2249
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:49,440
Whoever is fun

2250
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:54,048
Unlike Megyn Kelly

2251
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:56,608
