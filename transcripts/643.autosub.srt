1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Air Jordan

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

4
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
Acknowledge

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

6
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,584
Text jono indeed we are

7
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,352
Yes

8
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,376
Pandora

9
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,656
I have a quick question what's up

10
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,008
Is a little bit complicated

11
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,104
I guess it's a bit my cat's okay

12
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,664
Ethylene is okay

13
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,712
Out there listening

14
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,248
It's been a weird weekend

15
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,808
Celine has been having some

16
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,576
Coughs

17
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,880
And it would appear to be difficulty breathing

18
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,416
And so I took

19
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,184
32in emerging

20
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,256
Conceived that on Thursday right after we got done recording

21
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,328
Episode and I was there

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,608
Nice people

23
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,376
At the emergency

24
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,400
It's about I will say that

25
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,192
Tip my hat to

26
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:47,264
Remember they were very comforting a friend

27
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:51,360
Butt x-ray is done and it turns out that

28
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,408
Celine has asthma

29
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:56,736
Just like the Nerdist School

30
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,064
And so on the one hand is

31
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,856
Inconvenient a little bit

32
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,160
But you know whatever it is what it is

33
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,696
We got to take care of your cat

34
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,256
But on the other hand

35
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,024
The huge relief

36
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,792
Because

37
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:10,816
What

38
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,656
What other possibilities could there have been in liquid is manageable and

39
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,448
See ya

40
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,008
I don't know I guess it's

41
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,800
Absence of a real

42
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:26,944
Dark spot whenever whenever Fanny we give her eye drops three times a day and she needed look

43
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224
He was starting to go blind

44
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:33,600
You know so we're we were panicking before we ever did that and then you find out all three eye drops

45
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,368
Today

46
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,160
Sure I'll do all day

47
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,184
Jitter that kind of

48
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,512
I showed you the inhaler

49
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:48,192
And the mask that I'm supposed to use to get Albuterol

50
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,728
She's having an attack

51
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,032
I made it to nightmare there's no way she's

52
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,312
You can put up with this

53
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,848
Quite a tiny bullhorn but it's

54
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:58,944
She's a headstrong cat she doesn't take kindly to

55
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,272
Do I ask my Mac

56
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:05,856
We'll see what happens

57
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:09,952
Yes yes very isolated case

58
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:16,352
Yeah well you know there's a there's a vegan restaurant

59
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,936
Butterfly

60
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:23,520
Okay

61
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,616
I saw that he had that one

62
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,176
They reached 21 Majors first

63
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,088
Definition row

64
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
Notes

65
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,160
Yeah and it's

66
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,464
It's very funny he came back

67
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,536
From down two sets to love in the final

68
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,328
Against the best the best

69
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,376
Hardcore player alive right now

70
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,192
Maybe and wound up winning it

71
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,984
Crazy is awesome

72
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,056
And the more you think about it the more you realize that

73
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,592
The number one reason baby

74
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
You know cuz he's

75
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,664
He had to defeat the best players in the world

76
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,688
Sure

77
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,992
But maybe the number one reason that he

78
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,552
Djokovic 221

79
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,344
Is because Djokovic has an idiot

80
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,928
Take the vaccine sure ends

81
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,696
Lost

82
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,976
History forever

83
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,024
Isn't that very funny

84
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:22,911
Yeah it is pretty funny it's kind of funny it wasn't an injury demands just an idiot

85
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,983
Who was choice

86
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,775
Go to brain injury

87
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:32,383
Of being an enable to just get a f****** backfeed and make history forever

88
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,967
And it said Rafa did it

89
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,831
History of inovatech

90
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:44,927
I'm glad you had a good time and that's your boy

91
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:48,255
Great I hope I got to bed at 8 a.m. this morning

92
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
Only 5 hours and a half

93
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:57,471
So Jordan today

94
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,335
This is Alex

95
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:07,711
Back in studio he's gone to the woods with his child news returns

96
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,039
This this episode

97
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
It's interesting

98
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:17,951
I think he got renewed by the being in the forest that outdoor hair

99
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
I think he's lost

100
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,023
His desire to quit

101
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,095
Maybe he's revitalized

102
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,375
We would have

103
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,423
Half the time we are sentence

104
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,263
Eternal death everytime if he'd just gone to the woods that week

105
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,639
I think it's pretty obvious that

106
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:40,223
Remind applies to a lot of people in a lot of professions

107
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,247
You know getting burned out

108
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:47,391
Yeah you didn't burn out and it's affecting your performance and for Alex that burnout just

109
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
Manifest

110
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:54,559
I am saying that everyone deserves to die maybe you want to leave and never come back

111
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,119
DC go to the woods for a day or two

112
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,143
Same difference

113
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,191
Best weapons in the woods

114
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:06,591
So we can get that business on this but first hello just

115
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:10,687
The first policy

116
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,815
Text Brad

117
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,375

Thank you very much and finally we

00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:50,879
The year of the Seltzer thank you so much

124
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
You're not with

125
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
I have

126
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,743
Risen above

127
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,983
And then we're going

128
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,007
To come back

129
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
And I'm going to

130
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,079
Start the show over

131
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,199
F*** you

132
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,271
I got plenty of words for you but

133
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,295
At the end of the day

134
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,343
F*** you and your new world order

135
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,391
She rode in on

136
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
And all your s***

137
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,951
Maybe today

138
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,767
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby

139
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
Got to hear tomorrow

140
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,631
And you never see me again

141
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,935
Really what I want to do

142
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
Apologize

143
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,127
Was legitimately having right now

144
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:50,271
You better go to the wood go to the woods

145
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,087
I'm so glad we start off today

146
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,879
It's beginning of this episode Alex

147
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
Is real

148
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,671
Pumped

149
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,719
Yeah. Some goings-on in Canada

150
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:03,583
Scoresby trucker Convoy culminated in a protest

151
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:07,167
And Otto odd this Saturday

152
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,447
Sure

153
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:12,799
Alex plays a Sizzle reel of this over we are not going to take it

154
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:19,199
No longest Convoy ever recorded in Canadian history

155
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:25,599
Mouthwash million Truckers

156
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:31,999
What more people are joining the peaceful civil disobedience

157
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:38,399
This is how you doing

158
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,983
That's a

159
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:46,847
That's a bad sing along

160
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:53,503
It's going down weather over the weekend in Ottowa there was a convoy

161
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,527
Truckers that were form

162
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
We're making our way to the prom

163
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,599
Protest information

164
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:02,975
In the days leading up to this a whole lot of misinformation was spreading about the size and impact of the Convoy

165
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,255
Regardless of the truth

166
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:08,607
It seems like pretending it's the most important thing in the world is exactly what Alex needed

167
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
Resume Black Underwood

168
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,423
To distract himself from the rest

169
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,703
Everything in his life

170
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,983
Essentially collapsing around

171
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:18,591
The Convoy itself originated in Vancouver and then

172
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,383
Join in as a tour Canada

173
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,175
But estimates of the number of participants

174
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,455
Over the place

175
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,039
Alex's singer maybe a million truckers which is

176
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,063
Absurd

177
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,879
There's just no way to even close to Accurate there that

178
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,671
Number sets as of 20

179
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:36,767
18th there only approximately 302000 truckers in the entire

180
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
Country of Canada

181
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,583
That does seem like a

182
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,607
Big Ups

183
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,887
Difficult to get into a milli

184
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,727
It strains credulity that some others Convoy would attract / 3

185
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:50,335
Three times as many truckers as are contained in the entire Trucking Workforce in Canada

186
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,127
But that whatever

187
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,407
The length

188
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:58,271
So the Convoy Alex is saying it's the longest in Canadian history at 50 something miles long

189
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,855
Pitcher the spokesperson for the Convoy told the

190
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,415
Toronto Sun that was over seventy kilometers long

191
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,951
Would you be about 43 MI

192
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,743
The song

193
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,791
Careful to point out that none of that had been in

194
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,815
Independently verified

195
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
Staff

196
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:18,751
The estimation that are flying around a bit excessive and what are the ones that's caught on as the main talking point that's being spread

197
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,823
Comes from a former NHL player

198
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,847
Theo Fleury

199
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,663
Who are the guests on Laura Ingraham show on Fox

200
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,711
I was at there was 50,000 truck

201
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
In the Convoy

202
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,039
Has been repeated all over the place

203
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,575
50000 trucks

204
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:38,719
That number is pretty outrageous to imagine but if there were 50,000 trucks on the Convoy that would be a big

205
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,535
The problem is that other folks

206
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,559
Put

207
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
But much lower

208
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,399
Kingston Police in Ontario tweeted out account

209
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,959
Convoy departed on the morning of January

210
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,727
328

211
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,519
Quote 17 full track

212
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,335
After trailers 104 tractors with no trailers

213
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,639
424 passenger vehicles

214
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
76 RV

215
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:01,247
There's a chance of this isn't the full scope of the Convoy and it's

216
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,527
It's really hard to tell

217
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:09,183
Some folks are claiming that there are multiple convoys that are meant to convergent Auto or not they're going other state electron

218
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,719
Yeah

219
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,535
It's hard to know what is

220
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,815
The full picture ever

221
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,167
This little 7

222
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:24,799
I don't know I got no idea

223
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,567
Okay

224
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:31,967
The point is that it's really hard to get an actual count of what kind anywhere near as big as what

225
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,503
Being promoted by the organizers

226
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,527
NHL players

227
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
Or Alex

228
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,831
Because here's the thing

229
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:40,927
This whole Convoy is just a very very anti-vax operation

230
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,951
Banana political spec

231
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,303
It began as a protest against vaccine mandates

232
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,839
For truckers crossing the border

233
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,911
It's really sprawled out from that point to become a Flashpoint

234
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:54,239
Where the exact issue it's meant to protest has become a bit

235
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,007
Clear

236
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,823
Baby today talked to a woman named Dolores

237
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,919
Who said the Convoy is quote also about an us-versus-them mentality

238
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,991
The chi believes applies to the vaccinated and unvaccinated

239
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
Fascinated

240
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,295
That is vague

241
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:10,879
We're here we're not sure why and we're really mad about it

242
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,975
There's absolutely no chance of this Convoy has widespread support

243
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,023
A larger Canadian Trucking industry

244
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
There's a few facts

245
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
Consult to help you understand that

246
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,423
The first is that the vast majority of truckers are

247
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,495
The second is that the Canadian Trucking Alliance

248
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,799
MC group that represents most of the truck

249
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,823
Providers in the country

250
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,663
Be sure to stay on January 22nd denouncing and strongly

251
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,943
Discouraging the Convoy

252
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,247
It wasn't even really about the political

253
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,831
Statement it was actually about the boat that was being used

254
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,599
The protest

255
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,927
Quote the Canadian Trucking Alliance does not

256
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:49,791
Support and strongly disapproves of any protest on public roadways highways and bridges

257
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,095
CTA believe such actions

258
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,399
Especially those that interfere with pump

259
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,727
Public Safety are not have disagreements with government policy should be

260
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
Expressed

261
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,847
Members of the trucking industry who want to publicly Express displeasure over government policies

262
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:06,687
Can choose to hold an organized lawful event on Parliament Hill or

263
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
Contact their local MP

264
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,783
What is not acceptable is disrupting the motor

265
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,063
Current public on highways

266
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,343
And commerce at the board

267
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:18,975
Another consideration is that the Convoy doesn't really have the will of the people of Canada behind

268
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,047
An ipsos poll that came out this week found it

269
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,583
67% of respondents

270
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,631
Quote walk the government to impose

271
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,655
Further measures

272
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,679
On the unvax

273
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,959
Canadian population

274
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,775
There is a strong sense of

275
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:36,383
Almost everybody else

276
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:44,831
There's a charade that's going on here is being played out by really well

277
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,647
Call by right-wing media figures to make it look like this is a

278
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,439
Countries population rising up again

279
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
The oppression of covid

280
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,559
I could have sworn that like a week ago Alex

281
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,839
Declared Victory because

282
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,375
The countries all of them in the world

283
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,959
Including Canada it simultaneously announced they're dropping their covid restrictions

284
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
Talkingshit

285
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,031
Things up

286
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,567
Here here's what's up

287
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,151
Krypton boy was organized by a woman named Tamara liquor

288
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,735
She's the secretary of the Maverick party

289
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,295
A right-wing political party that was founded in 20

290
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,063
20

291
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,111
When it began it was called Alexa

292
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,951
Because their original point was having me Western provinces separate

293
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
From Canada

294
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,047
They have no representatives in the senate or the House of Commons

295
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,095
Because their views are largely unpopular

296
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,911
Because the idea of Western secession is

297
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,215
Starter generally in terms of electoral politics

298
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,775
And because of that they change the name for the Maverick party

299
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,311
Right because they wanted

300
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,359
To be associated with Mel Gibbs

301
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,967
Spinosaurus

302
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:50,367
On their Twitter page you can clearly see that the Maverick party is using this Convoy organized by their secretary to recruit

303
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,391
People into their party

304
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,671
I've generally it

305
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:59,071
It's not so much that they're using a position to covid measures to do that it's largely just attacking Justin Trudeau

306
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,167
Their leader the merry party leader jhil tweeted quote

307
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,007
If a convoy does nothing more than convinced all Canadians Trudeau is up

308
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,055
Prophetic leader it's done a good job

309
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:15,455
So I guess the goal for them is less at the raising of covid restrictions that are supposed to be hurting Truckers

310
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
Politically hurt

311
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,039
Trudeau and of course rave party membership

312
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:24,159
Hopefully bringing donations this is weird misspelled Canadian

313
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,975
No he spelled it like a

314
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,559
Can't argue with that

315
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,119
It is a Roka spelling

316
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:38,239
This is essentially been a political pageant for jayhil and his party

317
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,799
The entirety of what

318
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:44,639
This Convoy and all this is right there is an element of this

319
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,967
They're piggybacking and trying to use it as a coming out

320
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,039
The secretaries of party organized

321
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,111
It's it's 8

322
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,903
Subtle Buzz Marketing

323
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
Website

324
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:02,047
January 25th the leader of the Western Standard

325
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,375
Who voiced support for the Convoy saying quote Maverick Sports

326
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,959
Canadians right to participate in peaceful protest when they feel compelled

327
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,519
To draw their government's attention to important issues

328
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
And even told them that

329
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,871
The party isn't directly involved in the trucker protest

330
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,455
Neglecting the party secretaries one of the main organizers of it

331
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,991
Another co-organizer

332
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,015
Has deep ties

333
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
The party

334
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:29,183
This is a very dumb shell game that these people are trying to play where they pretended his giant spectacle that was organized by a member there

335
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,719
The party leadership and is being used

336
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,999
Recruit people to the party

337
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
Hopefully it's nothing

338
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,047
Things to do with the party itself

339
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,327
Just a weird coincidence

340
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,375
Go into that

341
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,959
To the tribute cause freaking

342
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:44,543
Concern and that is the Dynamics of the GoFundMe campaign

343
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,335
And that was set up for the Convoy

344
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:50,431
It a very short. Of time the campaign had raised over six million dollar

345
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,967
Warriors and the bulk of the donors

346
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,991
Anonymous

347
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,271
Using aliases

348
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,647
It's not too weird to donate to things anonymously I think that's a pretty normal human impulse but

349
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,671
The concern

350
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,511
A number of the berry high-dollar donations are also from

351
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,071
Completely unknown sources

352
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:12,959
Donation of $25,000

353
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,751
Usher Yeah Yeah

354
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,055
She becomes a Merc

355
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
At this point

356
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:22,687
It's essentially impossible to tell how much of this donation pool was given by legitimate

357
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,711
Canadian citizen

358
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,479
The businesses

359
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,015
Concerned about covid restrictions

360
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,551
How much may have

361
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:32,927
Been donated by people from other countries who are just interested in funding something that they see is an opportunity

362
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,743
The Creator Flashpoint against public health mandate

363
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:40,607
The possibility that there's funding from abroad weather be from 11

364
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,399
D-backs proponents here in the United

365
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:46,495
It raises serious questions about how organic this whole thing is

366
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,031
A what

367
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:48,799
The money

368
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,567
Where's it going

369
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,895
Need for accountability

370
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,967
Beyond that point where's the money go where's the pizza place

371
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,015
Particularly considering

372
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:03,135
The chief organizers of the convoys in the leadership of a Canadian political party that does semen port

373
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,183
It's all very messy and I don't

374
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,767
Get the sense that everything here is aboveboard but I also probably

375
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
I don't think

376
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,375
I don't think all of the suspicious things are necessarily all worse case

377
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,935
Yeah I mean I imagine that

378
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,239
No I don't know anything about carrying it is

379
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,519
Campaign Finance laws

380
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:23,359
Or whether or not they even have any but I assume you can't just like

381
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:27,455
Grifter bunch of money and then be like I hi this is mine it's a campaign Finance

382
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,223
Now

383
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,039
Yeah I don't have no idea

384
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,855
Yeah I don't know I mean maybe it's fine

385
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:40,255
Google began supposedly of the protest against truckers needed to be vaccinated across the border this has now become a

386
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,839
Symbol of all opposition to Cub covid Public Health measures

387
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,375
And people who are extremists

388
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,935
The my direction are going to be drawn to this thing

389
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,983
There are legitimate dangerous

390
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,263
Is it considered like the fact

391
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,823
Even if the actual group of the Convoy art up

392
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
Anything violent

393
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,919
This does seem like a really Prime opportunity for someone

394
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,943
Use it as cover

395
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,783
Rumblings of a desire to have a repeat of what happened

396
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,575
The United States on January 6th

397
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,855
Which is cause for concern

398
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,695
The convoys organizers

399
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
So that's good

400
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
Like I guess

401
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:16,607
Circumstances he or something that a bad actor could exploit

402
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,631
Fairly easily

403
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:18,911
Is there a bunch

404
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,983
Two truckers heading to Auto on planning to essentially clog all the

405
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,263
Streets around the capitol

406
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:29,151
There's a danger that should something go bad it would be difficult for emergency responders to arrive on the scene

407
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:32,735
Whether or not that comes to pass the possibility the Clark Street

408
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:36,831
Could lead to an inability on the part of police or fire Crews or medical team

409
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:41,183
To get to where they're going is one of the reasons that most people don't recommend protest

410
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:41,951
Like that

411
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,487
They can easily have

412
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,535
Rippling unintended

413
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,559
The clients is that

414
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
That are just

415
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,935
This Convoy is not as large as Alex

416
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,751
The political message that

417
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,567
Designed has been diluted a hijack to the point where it's essentially

418
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,591
Does a proton

419
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:03,967
Are the roots and organization of adderal incredibly suspicious and the whole thing may just be Buzz Marketing

420
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,015
For Western secessionist political party

421
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,807
Ultimately this weekend

422
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,343
Will be

423
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,135
Urban points words with a little bit of

424
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,159
10th Street

425
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,463
Disaster

426
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
But I don't

427
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,535
Know if this is going to go anywhere

428
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
Like

429
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,327
Like itself

430
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,607
Right

431
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,143
Protest itself

432
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:22,911
I'm not sure

433
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,983
Tucker covered it

434
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,823
So it's most important this is absolutely nothing like

435
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,871
50 party in 2008 at all

436
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,431
There's another thing we need to dress really quick and that is

437
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,455
Protest itself

438
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,247
What's going on in Ottawa

439
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:40,063
The Convoy was organized by this person

440
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,087
The Maverick party

441
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,367
The protestors actually

442
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,135
Separate

443
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,927
Connected but separate

444
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,975
That one was organized by a group called

445
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,023
Canada unity and they're a bit more

446
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,607
Released a memorandum of understanding that's my

447
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:56,191
Express the goals of their protests which they're hoping to get the Senate

448
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:58,239
And governor-general to sign on to

449
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,823
This would require all the members of the Canadian government

450
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:07,711
To stop all covid public safety measures or immediately resign

451
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,991
It's a big ass

452
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,807
Essentially they're making an outrageous demand

453
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,623
And the alternative of it is to overthrow the government

454
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,159
This is dumb

455
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,696
Yeah this is Adam

456
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
That's designed to be

457
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,000
Ignored or reject

458
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,280
Which will then be used

459
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,816
Is proof that the government is evil and

460
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,376
Corrupting at these protesters did everything in their power

461
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:28,192
To get their way peacefully you to no end

462
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,752
Ultimately baby Extreme Measures are Justified

463
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,616
This is crafted essentially to be rationalized later

464
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,384
When

465
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,152
People take

466
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:37,920
Extreme Action

467
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:42,784
This was the lay of the land before the actual rally on Saturday then Saturday happen

468
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,088
A lot of what transpired so far

469
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,112
As far as I can

470
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,648
Intel's been fairly predictable

471
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,208
A ton of people showed up in Ottawa which

472
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:54,304
I'm saying that there's not 50,000 trucks and there's not a million Truckers

473
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,584
But I'm not saying that

474
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,608
There's nobody

475
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,144
Usher

476
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,240
The Fairly large turnout

477
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,520
Confederate flags

478
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07,104
Even more unsavory regalia

479
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:11,712
The Shepherds of Good Hope shelter reported being harassed by protesters Amanda

480
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,528
Make food that was meant for people experiencing homelessness

481
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:18,112
We will set up various blockades around the country for instance one

482
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,928
On the border crossing between Woodstock New Brunswick

483
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,208
And Houlton Maine

484
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:28,864
As of the time I prepare this episode this looks to be a completely disorganized massive that definitely could lead to some trouble

485
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,912
Down the road who knows

486
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,520
The demands have long ago spun out of control and there's no satisfactory resolution

487
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,288
For this protest

488
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,568
In terms of what they are

489
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,384
Yeah what are they what are they going to win

490
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,432
Even if they do get

491
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:48,320
To the negotiating table. Ask is everyone go away forever unless you do everything I want you

492
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,904
Public Health measures

493
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,672
At all

494
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,488
Also in a completely undemocratic process

495
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,608
Actually holding the entire nation I said yes

496
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:07,008
Play make some of the people they're claiming that they're going to stay until Trudeau resigns or public health measures are

497
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:07,776
Call drop

498
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,080
I'm neither of those things are going to happen

499
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,896
Especially not the as a result of

500
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,176
Strongarm demands

501
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,480
Also I dare you to

502
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,760
Stay there as long as you

503
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:21,600
Get out of here a little bit

504
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,160
Did the ludicrousness of

505
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,440
This proposition

506
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:29,792
Even the demand of dropping the vaccination requirements across the border

507
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,816
Is silly

508
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,608
Because it would still then require

509
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,144
Oster do the same

510
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:34,912
Yeah

511
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,448
Need to be pressuring

512
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,752
The Canadian government and ask for them to

513
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,056
Somehow change American law

514
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,336
You would literally be

515
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:48,736
In the full need of a nuclear warhead in order to try and get near the level of power

516
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:53,344
Are you need to negotiate that it's a bizarre

517
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,392
Decentralisation of this protest

518
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,696
With multiple convoys apparently spring up and

519
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,232
In the fantasy world objectives

520
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:02,304
They combined to create an environment that could easily get out of

521
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,072
Control

522
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:09,472
I'm fully ready to believe that there's some folks say in the protest and Convoy were well-meaning truckers who work for Independent.

523
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,240
Union operation

524
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,288
You're concerned about their livelihood

525
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:16,640
But the reality is that the way that this protest in Convoy have been organized and run

526
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,712
Are literally creating the ideal environment

527
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,480
Extremist

528
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:24,064
The insulate themselves within the protest and use that as cover to do some pads

529
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,416
Recording this on Sunday and no I don't think

530
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,440
Anything to

531
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,720
Bad

532
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,000
As far as I can tell

533
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,280
I don't know that it's

534
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,816
But the situation has resolved

535
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,864
Who knows if it's going to be ongoing

536
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,632
And I hope it

537
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:40,960
Get to resolve this with matter and no one gets hurt and nothing ends up

538
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,240
Happening

539
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,520
On the off-chance of things

540
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,544
Things do go bad let's

541
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,640
Let's not forget the people like Jordan Peterson and Joe Rogan Alex Jones

542
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,712
I were super aggressively promoting this whole thing

543
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,760
Really pushed for it

544
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,784
Yeah yeah

545
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,112
Without any awareness of how

546
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,184
Clearly disorganized this whole thing is

547
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,952
Then and how

548
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
A reckless

549
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,000
And didn't just

550
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,280
Just thoughtless

551
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,584
Play just like I mean so

552
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,376
Instantly just like oh

553
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:13,472
These guys are against the thing that I'm again so I'm just going to say yeah that go for it

554
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,288
Even if even if somebody is on

555
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,824
Somebody has

556
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,360
Mainly the same

557
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,384
Is this base

558
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,152
I'm still like

559
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,432
What the f*** are you about

560
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:26,528
I don't know what's going on with you yet you know like that kind of thinking these guys are like

561
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:32,928
Haven't heard of them f****** ye wait wait this seems to be drawing a lot of attention

562
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:39,328
I love it it's great. Was this a pro forest-fire I don't know k

563
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,864
What are the reasons that I

564
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,680
Kind of landed on having absolutely zero faith

565
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:46,752
This is actually ever was about Truckers

566
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,640
The Border CBC article

567
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:57,248
It had to do with the copious amount of regulations with truckers are already subject to lie

568
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,296
Like brake inspections load limits

569
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,832
Truckers are even subject

570
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,856
Physical exam

571
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,416
I'm sure that they're healthy enough to make their trip so

572
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:07,488
It only makes sense that this would just be another aspect of that regulate

573
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:14,912
In order to be a licensed trucker in Canada you need to possess a DOT medical certificate and that requires vision and hearing test

574
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,984
Submitting to your analysis and the running

575
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,544
Neurological and cardiovascular screenings

576
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
To make sure that you don't have a high risk

577
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,896
Procedures are heart problems that can impair you on the road

578
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,456
Need to re-up that medical card every two years

579
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,296
Throughout things that are required by the DOT physical

580
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,320
You'd be just as much

581
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,880
Medical tyranny of the vaccine requirements

582
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,672
So what's a little

583
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,720
The actual problem they have is the imposition

584
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,744
None of this new

585
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,328
It's me public-facing position that is

586
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,120
Kernel of respectability to it

587
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,656
The tithing what was

588
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,680
Really that's just

589
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,448
TJ Maxx

590
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:57,408
Nonsense a government to as being about these

591
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,456
The Draconian restrictions

592
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,040
Philly and I mean it's there it's there

593
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,344
Great recruiting tool

594
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,112
Cross

595
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,136
Cross-pollinating tool

596
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,208
Get somebody who is a f******

597
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:14,304
Gwyneth Paltrow goop head anti-vaxxer to turn into somebody who's like

598
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,608
Yeah we should overthrow the f****** government

599
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,400
Cuz if you have it

600
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:23,264
Rally for like maybe Blitz not wear masks for a while it's somebody's like this what white nationalist

601
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,848
Let me let me also be clear

602
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,920
Don't think that like the whole thing is AstroTurf

603
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,456
Or anything like that just

604
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,992
Because the organizers

605
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,344
What main organizers happens we from this political party

606
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,624
And such

607
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,672
At 8 there's seems to be running

608
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:45,280
A little bit of a weird a PR campaign

609
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,304
Grover norquist

610
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,608
Consulted on or something

611
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:52,192
That doesn't mean it's like it's all a charade or anyting

612
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:58,336
Like Alex might say with antifa

613
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,896
Exit one I drifted

614
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,664
That territory

615
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,504
So Alex is thrilled about this Canada business

616
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,808
He reiterates his client

617
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,576
A a million

618
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,744
Well Canada is now the epicenter of human

619
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,536
Wakeling and human resistance

620
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,400
Millions

621
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,496
100000 and a million truck

622
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,312
The capital

623
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:32,128
All of the once-great nation of Canada

624
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,920
Now under Davos group

625
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,688
Command

626
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,784
Calendar Bilderberg Group command brags on TV

627
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:39,808
But he has

628
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,368
Canada and now has

629
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,416
The cabinet under his control

630
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:51,328
Yeah class Rob is from a conversation that he had in 2017 at the

631
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,864
Harvard Kennedy School

632
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,168
The Institute of politics

633
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,520
Conversation about the world economic forum's global leaders program

634
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,336
He did say that they penetrate countries cabinets with

635
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,384
With Canada being one of the examples he brings up

636
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,176
Who's at the one-minute clip that

637
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,200
It's been passed around right way

638
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,736
When Twitter cut out of context

639
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,272
Not scary

640
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:16,416
World economic Forum young Global leader program was all about

641
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:19,488
Drugs that Angela Merkel and

642
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,024
Had both been apart of it which

643
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,840
Really doesn't make sense I mean

644
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,608
What

645
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,936
It doesn't make sense in the context of this clip because

646
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:30,240
History is pretty clear

647
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,800
And this whole young at this young global leaders things

648
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,336
Didn't start until 2004

649
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:38,688
At that point Merkel was already the leader of the Christian Democratic Union party

650
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,504
And Putin was four years into his first sent

651
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,808
Is President of Russia

652
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:49,952
I'm guessing that maybe this might be a stretch

653
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,976
Yeah

654
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
Marco Island

655
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,560
Spoke to the

656
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,096
Nova leader

657
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,376
Young leader program

658
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,448
I don't believe

659
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,312
I mean unless they were in a very weird

660
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,384
A hotel Ballroom one

661
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,176
Time wearing odd uniforms

662
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:11,968
Babe with the rest

663
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,016
Group

664
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,064
I guess

665
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,112
I'm trying to think of like

666
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,160
Possibilities

667
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:26,560
Precursor organization to this but even then food was like in the KGB

668
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,096
Like going to a

669
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,632
Economic program

670
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,936
Wally's in the middle of assassinating sub

671
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:42,176
So you can go to the y g l

672
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:45,760
You can learn about their alarms and what they were working on when they were in the program

673
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,040
Princeton

674
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,088
Sarah couple entries from the 26

675
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:49,856
16 class

676
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:54,208
Hiro Nakamura and despeinada discool

677
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,256
Collaborate

678
00:30:56,512 --> 00:31:00,352
To bring simple life changing Technologies to rural communities and reduce poverty and

679
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,144
Do clean-energy Prada

680
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,936
Another one

681
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,984
Dave Hanley and Shalini

682
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,264
Pucha Polly

683
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:13,664
Launched an Indian LED movement to prevent female infanticide and girls with tools to overcome

684
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,944
Systemic gender-based

685
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,736
Discrimination ohmygod they're still

686
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:21,344
These are the sorts of projects that are being done by these young leaders in the program which

687
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,136
Support their goals

688
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:26,208
Program did contact people in various fields

689
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,744
They could help them out along the way

690
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:33,888
It's unsurprising that people who are taking programs like this would end up continuing their careers pretty successfully

691
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,448
Be that in government or an NGO the

692
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:38,240
The deals with an issue that they're passionate about

693
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:41,056
That doesn't mean that the people who

694
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,848
We're in this program are

695
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,896
In the future and forever

696
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,664
Secret plant

697
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,248
From the world economic Forum has control over

698
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:55,648
You don't know what would be the point of teaching young people anything if you're not also implanting them with a chip that you can later

699
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,672
Control directions

700
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:59,232
Right right

701
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,536
I think

702
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,120
I think it's a little a little much

703
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:09,216
Yeah that might be a little bit of a stretch

704
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,752
Yeah but you know

705
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,800
You can you can kind of assume

706
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:18,944
There anybody who would be in this program is already self-selected to be really really motivated

707
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:21,504
Probably high-achieving person

708
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,904
Somebody's already invented a way to help people somewhere else by the time they were 12 is all of a sudden like oh yeah

709
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,696
Then let's go do it

710
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,792
Does opens up networking possibilities

711
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:40,960
Great on a resume in politics in a cabinet somewhere

712
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,728
Parts robbed

713
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,288
Discussion at the Kennedy School

714
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:48,640
And talk about being proud of people who went through that program

715
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,408
And then it's

716
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:55,552
Turned into Vase by glycerol Bragg

717
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:58,880
It's just annoying is annoying

718
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,928
Alex

719
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,696
He's

720
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,464
He's a

721
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:06,560
I think it must have been the forest error or something but he is

722
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,584
He's pretty big on

723
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,864
Declaring a bit of Victor

724
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:12,960
It is a very surreal thing

725
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,008
Chanel

726
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,312
The true talkingpoi

727
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:20,896
Coming out of

728
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,688
Congressman

729
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,272
Podcast

730
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,576
Fox shows everywhere

731
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,624
We have done it

732
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,184
Infowars

733
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,024
And this whole family

734
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:44,960
Have successfully launched a worldwide resistance of the globalist by being aware of them and understanding

735
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,008
That should make sure their program his death

736
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,056
Resistance in the program is like

737
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,872
Alex Jones here I've saved the world

738
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,664
Now

739
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,712
Haha

740
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,504
Okay and I'm taking

741
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,344
Complete ownership over creating a global movement

742
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,368
Fighting the

743
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,672
Globulus right

744
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,208
A global

745
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,744
International movement

746
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,512
Sure

747
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,632
I don't know if I would want to be associated with the one that brings Nazis

748
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,936
That's just me though

749
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,984
And it seems like all of his

750
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,032
Awakened movements

751
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,568
Have Nazi flag.

752
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:24,128
Confederate flags in Canada

753
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,152
Yeah

754
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:31,808
It's a little strange you know I mean

755
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:34,368
Play Twinkle mad at people

756
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,904
Coming from Mexico

757
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,696
To our Southern border

758
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:42,816
I mean the Confederate flag in Canadian Southern border that's just out of

759
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,096
Control right

760
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:48,704
Did you say Canadian while I mean if your if you got the Confederate flag you don't live in Canada

761
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,472
Not sure

762
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:54,080
The thing that the real talk

763
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,616
Greenpoint's getting out

764
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,408
Not so much of

765
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,688
Victory of the talking point

766
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:01,248
Is it is an erosion of who's doing

767
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,272
The talking

768
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,808
The people who are

769
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,344
Are in office

770
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,112
And

771
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,392
Rogan

772
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,184
Upright horror writer

773
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,464
What's there not

774
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,024
Necessarily the most

775
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,048
Critical

776
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:18,656
Finally the brains of the powerful have been melted enough that they do what I say

777
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:24,544
Power now

778
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,872
That's where we are damning indictment

779
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:28,896
So Alex

780
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,224
A little bit of his story

781
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,248
About what happened

782
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,272
On January

783
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,576
I don't believe this

784
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,600
But it does

785
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,904
Year later

786
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,440
He's finally really getting the

787
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:44,768
This probably is not relevant to court

788
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:48,352
Okay it's more relevant a psychic powers

789
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,520
Obviously we walked into a trap

790
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,544
January 6th

791
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,312
Obvious

792
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,872
We had minutes

793
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:07,808
I already got to stop at maybe Stewart Roads and they both Keepers did that s*** I have no idea what you're talking about

794
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,088
They was a complete trap

795
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:12,416
Nobody had any tranches of weapons we are back and forth

796
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,696
All over the place

797
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,256
On the show 20

798
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:22,656
Because you can't possibly actually know what the belief is

799
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,704
What is real every single day

800
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,472
Now

801
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,544
Always it was the other

802
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,080
Side literally

803
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,640
Warriors

804
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,480
B-big hand

805
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,040
Hundreds of thousands

806
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,064
A million people

807
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,600
Weeks before January 6th

808
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,624
And I just feel

809
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,328
That's not true

810
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,608
The Caravan

811
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,424
Where they at tho with Owen

812
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:59,008
Ironix9 the Caravan

813
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,080
There's no violence at those cuz no one gave a s***

814
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,896
Medicate

815
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,480
You couldn't have a fight at them or in the parking lot

816
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:09,760
I was like

817
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,784
This is going to be okay

818
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,208
Publican speeches and then

819
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,512
Beach hat on

820
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:23,072
I had a horrible foreboding feeling I thought

821
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,096
Quit being paranoid

822
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:25,888
Maybe you're just

823
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,168
Coming down with something

824
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,360
Picking up what was about to happen if we're being led into a trap in the

825
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:41,760
Truliant

826
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,064
They could have actually

827
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,600
Potentially

828
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,392
Millions of dead out of that

829
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,696
Maybe Alex just had covid 1/3 time

830
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:53,536
So Alex is talking s***

831
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,608
Premonitions about a false flag or some nonsense on the six

832
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,400
This is just him trying

833
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:01,728
To get ahead of any potential violence at the trucker Convoy and rally

834
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,520
Alex knows enough to know that

835
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:06,080
This kind of situation creates the kind of environment

836
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,616
It's ripe for exploitation

837
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:14,016
You know it's like how the thousands of people being around the capital and all that chaos created the exact kind of environment

838
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:19,392
The capital of

839
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,160
Didn't like

840
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:23,744
There's a nonzero chance of trouble from the truckers rally

841
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,768
All things being

842
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:27,328
Equal I already stole food from the

843
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,608
Swell

844
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:29,888
I think

845
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,168
That's awful

846
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,776
Spiritually in the world is bad

847
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:38,848
That's true matter of scale

848
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:39,616
I will give you the

849
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:46,016
No someone using the rally as cover for some kind of an attack

850
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,040
Streetzlan

851
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:50,368
Ambulances and fire trucks can't get to people who need their services

852
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,136
Could lead to death

853
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:55,232
Whatever the potential trouble that could come out of it Alex nose

854
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:59,840
But it's important to get ahead of it and preemptively declared a false flag so that's what he's doing

855
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:05,216
It's very inconsistent

856
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,520
It looks like there's a potential for it to go bad

857
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:11,872
Even though we're recording this on Sunday and we know that nothing really bad has happened

858
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:12,896
Yeah it

859
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,456
Alex's recording this on Friday

860
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,480
He's very clearly

861
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,272
Well the rain tomorrow

862
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,296
Let's hope something bad

863
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:24,672
Probably if it does

864
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,464
Rise of false flag no matter what

865
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,024
He's talking about

866
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,072
This premonition that he had on the 6th

867
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:34,656
Because it's really just to lead into talking about

868
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,008
The first trucks

869
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,360
Beside our arriving at

870
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,920
Beautiful neo-gothic

871
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,040
That is an extremely beautiful building by the way what

872
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,624
Something right out of Harry Potter

873
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,928
I was still beautiful

874
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,696
Stoneworks

875
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,232
Unicorns car

876
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,256
Lions

877
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,536
Everything

878
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,144
My point is

879
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,800
Make sure do look good

880
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,568
Make this look viola

881
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:16,128
And you know they're going to try to provoke

882
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:16,896
Keturah G

883
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,456
Occupy

884
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,736
Department

885
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,528
So weird cuz

886
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:28,928
If you think about it Alex insisting that it's definitely false

887
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:32,768
The message you could come away with his that you should do something

888
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,816
Yeah cuz then it would make them look like

889
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,632
False flag

890
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,168
There's no space

891
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,960
Ultimately you would

892
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,984
Probably be helping

893
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,288
The conspiracy cause if

894
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:50,688
There's a built-in pre-placed narrative the no matter what nothing bad can be blamed on the far-right demonstrator so you're not going to

895
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:57,344
Because someone does do something violent than that's going to be at the club

896
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,160
Esther all about that they had to do

897
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:06,816
I'm not saying this is the same thing as Alex encouraging people to go do something violent but informant function it serves no other purpose

898
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,840
Then to make it

899
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,632
Strictly beneficial

900
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,680
For the conspiracy narrative if something

901
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,704
Bad happened

902
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:17,056
That's so weird I mean it's almost like there

903
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,848
Priming someone

904
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:19,616
Tube

905
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,152
Actually Act

906
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,944
As though they were the false

907
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,712
Flag

908
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,504
Plant

909
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:28,832
Even though they're actually not the fault

910
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,880
You know like there's somebody new

911
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:33,184
To go there almost like somebody

912
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,464
Having a weird

913
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,488
But was just like

914
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,024
What if I did

915
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,096
Instead I did it but then I'm also a false

916
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,400
There's so many weird incentives

917
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:48,288
I do weird s*** whenever this is your plan here looking at this through too many

918
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:53,407
Ping pong table

919
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:56,991
So there's that there's trouble in Canada all around

920
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,015
Also one sec

921
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,807
A million

922
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,087
Theoretical

923
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,159
Right

924
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,183
Because it's not a million

925
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,719
It's not a million trap no sir

926
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,743
That would be

927
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,279
The length of

928
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,047
LeConte

929
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,071
Yeah

930
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:11,839
Yeah

931
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,167
It would be a lot bigger

932
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:22,079
A million trucks

933
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,639
End in Canada

934
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,991
A million truckers 2 is

935
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,015
Is absurd

936
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,551
There's only like

937
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:35,903
Three and a half million truckers in the United States right now

938
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,951
Like I said 300,000 to Canada

939
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:38,719
So I mean

940
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,767
You're not going to get that kind of turnout

941
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,535
Or maybe even

942
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,071
I even 1,000 trucker

943
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,863
Is like

944
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,631
10 MI

945
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:53,055
Yeah I did I saw someone who did the math but I can't remember exactly what it is but there

946
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:53,823
It's absurd

947
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:58,943
Good morning things that the real problem is the people have a real inability

948
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,711
You to look at

949
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,479
Crowds

950
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:04,063
Sorel distances of things

951
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,343
Kids things do look

952
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,927
Bigger than they generally are and

953
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:13,279
I think you can see pictures of the crowd and I'm not diminishing them there still large crowds

954
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,303
But you can look at them

955
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,607
It's going to be like at 100,000 people

956
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,143
Baby 15000

957
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,679
You know it's

958
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,215
Iftar

959
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:26,079
Yeah I've never gotten the the guess the right number of gumballs in the in the jars

960
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,615
I'm not even going to

961
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:34,015
Come close to I've got it right every time yeah it's my superpower

962
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,039
Honestly that's kind of

963
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,575
Maybe the best-case scenario for

964
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,111
Superpowers

965
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,927
Spell clarify

966
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,951
I can't deal with Gumball

967
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:42,975
Cuz I can only do with jelly

968
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,279
Well I mean Jelly Bean

969
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:46,815
How dare you

970
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,911
Not just

971
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:51,935
Trucking related

972
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,239
Walmart's install

973
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,591
Customers

974
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,151
So the same things happening Australia

975
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,455
New Zealand it's our big stores

976
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:04,991
Grocery stores

977
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,575
There's a little bit of a weird situation that

978
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:09,599
A bit on the fence

979
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:12,159
On the one hand obviously I think at Walmart

980
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,183
Can set its own rules

981
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,463
Decide that a vaccine

982
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,767
Required for entry in the middle of a pan

983
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:19,839
Spine people complaining about it or not going to get my simple

984
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:23,167
Almost all of these stores allow people to purchase things and

985
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:26,495
Pick them up at the front door because as much as they want to follow Health guidance

986
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,543
They're more interested in making money

987
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,079
On the other hand

988
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,615
Evax Polk

989
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,639
Books of start of the camp

990
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,687
Painting Canada to boycott Walmart

991
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,991
Join up with him on this

992
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:39,295
I would say it if the end result

993
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,575
This is just going to be

994
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,623
Hurting Walmart's bottom line

995
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:46,719
I don't really care

996
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:53,119
How old is rules specifically doesn't apply to stores that sell primarily Foods

997
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:53,887
Every stores

998
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,679
Alright the grocery stores are exempt

999
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,215
From the back seat requirement

1000
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,775
Alex has no idea what the actual policies are the tea

1001
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,311
You complaining about

1002
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,079
Works better for them.

1003
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,103
Pretend that it applies

1004
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,383
Universally

1005
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,199
I mean

1006
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:07,967
That's

1007
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:08,991
We can

1008
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,015
We can afford to

1009
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:10,783
To put

1010
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:11,807
Automated

1011
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,599
Vaccine passport scanners

1012
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,367
In places

1013
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,463
Be harder to pay peep

1014
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,487
Stay Holman

1015
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,047
Nobita

1016
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,095
Canadian Walmart might be

1017
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,375
Be facing a

1018
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,143
Boycott

1019
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:26,911
From the unvax

1020
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,191
Tomato

1021
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:30,495
Walmart's install

1022
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,519
Call vaccine

1023
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,335
Tusk

1024
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,103
Customers

1025
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,943
Did you ever want to know what the Antichrist system would look like

1026
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,735
The self-checkout machine

1027
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,271
Did you ever want to know

1028
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,807
What it would be like

1029
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,903
When Walmart's become the FEMA camps

1030
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,207
And there you go

1031
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:55,327
See this is funny because back in 2015 during the whole Jade Helm Panic on Alex's show

1032
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,095
What are the beacons

1033
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,143
Pharisees was that FEMA was using

1034
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:00,191
Close down Walmart

1035
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:00,959
But they will take

1036
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,751
Dissidents they rounded up

1037
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,031
Like Alex and I remember

1038
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:09,151
Stupid and never happened but the vaguest memory of that being something out

1039
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,711
Addicted still exist in the audience is mine

1040
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,527
Exploit that to use for his career

1041
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:20,927
Also based on the story about what's going on with Canadian Walmart that seems like they're the opposite of FEMA camps

1042
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:27,839
I want this whole thing is that going to Roundup unvaccinated people to put them into camps unless you're vaccinated

1043
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:32,959
Far away from the Walmart

1044
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:33,727
Contradict

1045
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,031
Stupid

1046
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,055
How do I

1047
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:40,127
We're about to get into a section to show that I would say is

1048
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,407
Transphobic

1049
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,039
It starts

1050
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,319
Slow with Alex

1051
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,343
Getting into the ACT

1052
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,623
Of the

1053
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:55,743
Green Eminem Eminem

1054
00:46:55,999 --> 00:47:02,143
It's not about the great David Minnie Mouse is also getting rid of the dress

1055
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,007
Right

1056
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,031
Yep

1057
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,591
Everyone mad

1058
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:16,991
Everyone in my last moments is that what may

1059
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:19,039
Make sense of this I don't know what's find out okay

1060
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,063
Why do they

1061
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,135
Biological males in women's sports

1062
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:23,903
Dominate ever

1063
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:27,999
Because of You lyrics every level

1064
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,535
Ass backwards

1065
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,703
Snow White

1066
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,287
Female characters will not wear dresses

1067
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:41,823
Ever

1068
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,151
Women

1069
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,711
Their culture and what they like and

1070
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,111
Which I will tell them what it is

1071
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:55,903
Flower Beauty

1072
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,231
Appropriation

1073
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,023
Call my God

1074
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,815
Why is one species of bird

1075
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,351
Colorful another species

1076
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,887
This is Who We Are

1077
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,423
This is what we do organic

1078
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:10,495
No

1079
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,311
You can't do that

1080
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,895
Women will be like men and men will be like women

1081
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,711
And that's what they done

1082
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:21,503
Because it's an enemy of the people

1083
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,271
Cheese

1084
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:28,159
Alex implying that bees and flowers are the same species just different genders

1085
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:35,071
Different Sexes of bees that is beyond the capability of both flowers and

1086
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,631
Does he think that bees are drawn to

1087
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:42,495
The flowers cuz they're pretty

1088
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,055
But I believe

1089
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,591
Flowers are beautiful

1090
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,383
And that is why I am attract

1091
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,151
It's about right

1092
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,711
As opposed to a completely profen

1093
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:53,503
Practical transaction

1094
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:56,063
Exchange of power

1095
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,391
But you can see here

1096
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,183
I was looking

1097
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:06,815
It up I don't know if I saw the Disney Princesses I think it's just about Minnie Mouse

1098
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:11,935
Yeah but I really also only think that Alex is using that even talked about it because

1099
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:15,007
You know other people like Tucker the most important person in the world

1100
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,383
About this.

1101
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,919
I think what he's doing is like

1102
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,967
I got to get in on it also

1103
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,759
Got to be really hate

1104
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,039
I got to have a Twist on it

1105
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:29,599
Wreck transphobia

1106
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:34,463
Horrible men and women are different now it's got to be transphobic

1107
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,231
Right

1108
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:40,351
And Angie was tired talking points Sports

1109
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:42,911
Yeah and now

1110
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:47,263
Get the E pivots from talking about into talking about a story

1111
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,799
That

1112
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:49,823
To do with

1113
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:52,127
A trans person

1114
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,663
Who committed a crime

1115
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,943
Against the child

1116
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,479
Is going

1117
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,271
Okay

1118
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,807
And of the system work

1119
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,391
Well this is an interesting case because

1120
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,671
Did this person

1121
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,231
They committed the crime

1122
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,047
Years ago or so like around that time

1123
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,583
When they were a minor

1124
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:14,655
And so the courts decided

1125
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,703
To send them to juvenile detention

1126
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:18,751
Instead of going to adult

1127
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,799
Which is a little bit strange

1128
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:23,103
But also is something that

1129
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,151
All of the like

1130
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,175
The prosecution

1131
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,735
Had no problem with

1132
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,271
So there maybe someday

1133
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:34,623
Details to this case we aren't aware of all right make this make more sense

1134
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,391
Sure

1135
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,415
I think it's an in

1136
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:39,743
Interesting case and I think that there is a conversation

1137
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,535
If someone probably could have about it

1138
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:47,167
If you want to talk about it as a news story illegal decision that is maybe a little bit off

1139
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:47,935
The beaten path

1140
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:51,007
Right talk about why this could happen

1141
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,799
But Alex doesn't do that

1142
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:54,335
It is all just

1143
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:58,175
Transgender woman man

1144
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:04,831
Now 26 has been ordered to serve just two years in juvenile detention center for sexually assaulting a 10-year old girl

1145
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,023
Adult

1146
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:17,119
Formerly known as

1147
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:19,167
Guilty

1148
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,191
Young girl

1149
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,287
In 2040

1150
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,431
In Los Angeles

1151
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,735
And be tried as an adult

1152
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:35,295
The DEA declined to file a motion

1153
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,087
Remove the case out of juvenile court

1154
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,927
Creature in the child

1155
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:41,951
What

1156
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:42,719
Children

1157
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:49,375
This isn't discussion of a news story or even analysis of a legal opinion this is just a person

1158
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,143
Spewing hate

1159
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,959
There's nothing in that clip Norton Antivirus

1160
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:59,359
Conversation about the story that the discussion or leads anyone to any conclusion other than to hate trans people

1161
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,127
They class

1162
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:00,895
Of people

1163
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:01,919
It's abhorrent

1164
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:08,319
Halifax Alex actually wanted to express displeasure with the decision to place this person in the juvenile detention

1165
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:11,647
Do that without any of the extraneous hate

1166
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:12,671
30 throws input

1167
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,951
I really wouldn't do it

1168
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:14,719
For his audience

1169
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:16,767
What are they realize it or not that

1170
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:19,327
Kind of stuff is what makes the show exciting for them

1171
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:24,959
The hate is the spirit that animates Alex's content and without it there is no show and there is no audience

1172
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:29,311
Hit the displays like this there really should drive home how infrequently Alex

1173
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,359
The contact is actually about what it's pretend

1174
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,127
Nothing to be about

1175
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:35,967
All the surface this is supposed to be about a Transit L2

1176
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:39,039
Sentence to juvenile detention center for a crime they committed when a minor

1177
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:41,599
Hope it's actually just an opportunity for Alex

1178
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:43,135
The dehumanized

1179
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,927
People using the story as a prop

1180
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,719
I think this is a case

1181
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,487
You could have it

1182
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:51,583
Decent conversation about the story and not all parties acting

1183
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,351
Good faith with

1184
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:58,751
Necessarily agree whether or not it's appropriate to send an adult to a juvenile detention center for a crime that they committed as

1185
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,031
And I don't think

1186
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,359
To do with that conversation

1187
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,663
You can see if this is the only aspect Alex

1188
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,687
Latches

1189
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,223
Spreading that kind of hate

1190
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:08,991
Is his goal

1191
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,783
Not discussing this as

1192
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:11,551
Illegal

1193
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:16,927
Decision yeah I'm struggling to see where trans comes in at all

1194
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:17,951
Right

1195
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:21,791
I mean other than I supposed I mean the sentencing question would be like

1196
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,351
Stupid

1197
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,887
The women's prison

1198
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:28,191
I mean that seems like the obvious

1199
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:28,959
Question

1200
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,495
There's not a lot

1201
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:34,847
To even talk about in terms of Alex's response to it other than to rebuke

1202
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,383
His is bigger

1203
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:38,175
Yeah I mean you you said it

1204
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,199
You're done

1205
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,223
You said it and you said

1206
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:44,063
You're done

1207
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,135
Within the rest of the episode that I did not

1208
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:47,903
Include

1209
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:49,695
Empty do I

1210
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:53,279
I think I included this not necessarily to even

1211
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:54,303
Talk about

1212
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,327
The case because

1213
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,607
Is

1214
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:57,375
Response

1215
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,655
Do it does not really

1216
00:53:59,423 --> 00:53:59,935
Require

1217
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:02,751
No

1218
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:06,335
But I do like I do include this cuz I are often

1219
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,895
Include necessarily just

1220
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,175
No just outright

1221
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,711
Bigot nonsense

1222
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:16,063
It's important every now and again remind people to like the content to

1223
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:16,831
And it's

1224
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,111
It's a homerun

1225
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:19,903
That's what he's

1226
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,183
Yep

1227
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:23,487
Rodger Stone is coming back on

1228
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,767
Sure

1229
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:25,535
And

1230
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:31,679
I need money or is he going back to jail

1231
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:34,751
I mentioned on the last episode that he was on

1232
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,799
30 Super Bee slurring a little bit more

1233
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:40,383
Amy was a little bit in the character of it in the feel of it was

1234
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,919
It was weird

1235
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:42,687
He's back

1236
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:47,039
Oh he's back to full strength he's Rodger ready to throw stones

1237
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:49,855
Sweetheart vintage Rodger and part of that is that

1238
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:51,135
He is promoting

1239
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,927
Oh no his appearance

1240
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:53,951
2 hours

1241
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,255
Snow for he gets on the show

1242
00:54:56,511 --> 00:55:02,655
Better or his telegram or

1243
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,679
What is

1244
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,543
I'm at Rogers.

1245
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,567
Set me this message

1246
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,335
It's right here

1247
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,407
And it says

1248
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:16,735
I join Alex Jones today at 1:30 p.m.

1249
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:17,759
Eastern Time

1250
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:22,111
Endorsements and what is really happening in the world

1251
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:24,927
And then he

1252
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:26,975
This message he says this will be

1253
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:29,023
The most significant broadcast

1254
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:31,839
The 2006

1255
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:38,495
Get ready

1256
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,543
The most

1257
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,823
Important

1258
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:42,591
Person

1259
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:43,871
In the world

1260
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,407
Right now

1261
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:46,431
Eggs

1262
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,711
Rodger Stone

1263
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,991
Send his appearances

1264
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:54,623
What kind of a****** would

1265
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:55,903
Said that to me

1266
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,183
Let me tell you this

1267
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:59,231
I'm never texting you at

1268
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,791
Weep

1269
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:02,815
Spoiler

1270
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:06,911
This is not the most I have no doubt in my fires

1271
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:08,703
At all on my mind

1272
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:11,519
So we heard earlier that Alex is thrilled that

1273
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:14,591
The dino the politicians and Joe Rogan

1274
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:23,551
Brain tumor

1275
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:27,903
The end times

1276
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:32,511
All the time

1277
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:37,887
This is the

1278
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:40,191
Labeled New World Order world government and

1279
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,335
All the pieces

1280
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:48,639
And the training wheels for it

1281
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,783
You hear nothing about this

1282
00:56:57,343 --> 00:57:00,415
Instead they ask you to check your qr-code make sure you got your vaccine pass

1283
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,231
They're nothing but

1284
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:04,767
Should insist

1285
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:06,303
DentalWorks Cedars

1286
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:12,959
To the belly of the Beast churches are working for the devil except for Alex's

1287
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:14,751
Weird version of Christianity

1288
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:19,615
System

1289
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,919
I am real

1290
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:27,039
Done with them it's a little tiring

1291
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:30,111
I mean you can read the book

1292
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:32,415
Says what's going to happen but also also the

1293
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,951
The end times

1294
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,743
By definition requires an ant

1295
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,583
Keeps on going

1296
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:43,167
And the Beast has so far been the same mark

We need to go strong into the future

1315
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,719
With as much Capital as we have

1316
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:40,767

1320
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,103
All churches are

1321
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:58,431

True unless

1332
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:18,143
I mean there was a little bit of time where I was taking like

00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,423
Ginkgo biloba

1334
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:23,007
I don't know

1335
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,799
So look we're lost cause

1336
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:26,591
What does it mean

1337
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:28,639
That the Convoy Isabelle so great

1338
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,527
You're on the winning team you're fool

1339
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:39,647
Throw your Birthright out the window you've destroyed yourself

1340
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:41,439
And there's still time for you to turn back

1341
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,487
But I'm not going to talk to people to serve evil

1342
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:49,631

1357
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:38,527
11 hundred percent of your vitamin

1358
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,807
Are those rose hips

1359
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:42,111
Why they jump

1360
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,415
Isn't 100% the correct

1361
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,183
Catamount

1362
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:47,999
What's the point of having more than 100% of hundred percent

1363
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,791
Anything more than that is too much

1364
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:56,447
I think you see that on on vitamin bottles a lot multivitamins have like two thousand percent of

1365
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:59,263
It doesn't you don't get to keep it

1366
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:03,103
20 days of vitamin C valve

1367
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:05,151

Mourad Piva

1372
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,719

Rogersbase

1375
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:25,119
And what's going on right now

1376
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,655
Is a systematic

Party

1379
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:33,055
Control of the Republican Party

1380
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:40,735
Now there are times when the president seems to understand this for example

1381
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,527
Only weeks ago it was.

1382
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:45,087
Who is aghast

Better trillion

1389
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:56,351
Open self went on social media to call

1390
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:59,423
A primary challenge to this rhino

1391
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:00,959

And now this rhinos in deep trouble

1397
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,199
No he's not

1398
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,223
Rogers

1399
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:18,111
Disappearances mostly about how he's mad at the people that Trump is elected or site

1400
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,671
He was mad about last time to ya

1401
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:22,975
Rodger is

1402
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:27,071
Going hard on the midterms and like trying to primary

1403
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:28,095
Non Trump

1404
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:33,983
Loyola right at least

1405
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,007
That's pretty a

1406
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:39,871
I mean I would say that's probably his best shot at getting relevant in

1407
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:40,895
Politics

1408
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,175
Probably

1409
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:43,967
Making some of these bottles

1410
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:48,575
Yeah I'm making some of these people beholding to him there is no

1411
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:51,647
There is no president to sort of

1412
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:58,047
Attach yourself to this election cycle really work on trying to get some weirdos into

1413
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:03,167
And the Rhino is not going to hire me or listen to me or take my text messages

1414
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:07,775
My crispy dude hell yeah hell yeah well completely

1415
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:11,871
Congressional primary candidate getting thrown into the mix Iran Infowars and it's

1416
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:13,663
Dumdum broadcaster from right side

1417
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:17,759
Pedia has a profile on crispy and apparently a couple

1418
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:20,319
His top issues are quote election integrity

1419
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:22,623
And quote eliminating mandate

1420
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:25,183
It's pretty easy to see that it's

1421
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:27,487
Obviously attractive to the right-wing base

1422
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:30,047
What is the stolen election narratives

1423
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,071
Which is just basically

1424
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:34,143
Re litigating 2020

1425
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:34,911
Text bulshit

1426
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,447
I wouldn't be surprised

1427
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:38,495
Cuz if it was a lot of the conversation

1428
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:41,311
Get on rounds

1429
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,079
It's going to be annoying

1430
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:44,127
What are the areas of public

1431
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,919
What policy the crispy said he's

1432
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,711
Passionate about personally is quote

1433
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:50,527
Which is insane

1434
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:57,439
I can't imagine how little you would have to engage with reality for that to be one of the issues you're most passionate about person

1435
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:58,975
Unless you're racist

1436
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:04,095
Well it's 20:22 there's a pandemic

1437
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:07,679
Global International relationships are fuc

1438
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:09,727
Crumbling in front of our eyes

1439
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:15,359
Imagine if children knew that we were slave owners once

1440
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,687
I'm personally passionate about this

1441
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:20,479
Anyway good luck to this ding dong

1442
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:23,807
He's up against Chris Smith in the primary who's been in office

1443
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,087
1981

1444
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:29,951
In 2020 who won the Republican primary with 94.8% of the vote

1445
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:31,743
And if all the candidates running

1446
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,535
Stick around of the primary it seems

1447
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:35,583
Completely unfathomable that he will lose

1448
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:39,679
Against four other candidates who have a high likelihood of splitting the weirdo vote

1449
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:40,703
Amongst themselves

1450
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:41,727
Spell all get one

1451
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:46,847
Dave Berg is running in their primary

1452
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:48,639
Candidate who's prioritizing quote

1453
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,943
Eradicating the race Theory

1454
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:55,551
It only has one book listed in response to the question of what his favorite book is

1455
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:57,087
You think it's a vibe

1456
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,111
Oh no

1457
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:01,695
It's not no iron Rand it's Molly Hemingway's book rig

1458
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:03,999
Which is about the 2020 election being stolen

1459
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,631
2021

1460
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:13,727
Bergen crispier essentially going to be fighting each other over the weirdos scrap

1461
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:15,263
And Chris Smith is

1462
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:16,031
Easily went

1463
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,847
Counting Mike

1464
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:20,639
Blasi be veteran

1465
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:23,711
Also America First candidates in the primary

1466
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:28,063
Who recently tweeted in favor of requiring IDs to vote

1467
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,879
And also posted a meme with a fake Martin Luther King

1468
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:31,647
Quote

1469
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:36,767
The hottest place in hell is reserved for those who remain neutral in times of great moral conflict

1470
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:39,071
But isn't the Martin Luther King quote it's

1471
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:42,143
Actually just a poor paraphrasing of a line from Dante's

1472
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:47,519
Stanford out to various sources including Hellfire preachers and

1473
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:49,055
I'm later JFK

1474
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:52,895
Anyway this guy wants to bring back Jim Crow laws and his post

1475
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,431
Fake MLK quote

1476
01:05:54,687 --> 01:06:00,575
Memes on Martin Luther King jr. day he's also going to be splitting the particular voting block with Bergen crispy

1477
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:02,623
When is this is Christmas

1478
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:03,903
Race to lose

1479
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:10,047
I'm really waiting for the next Republican candidate to take it another another notch

1480
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:11,071
Can just be like a Merica

1481
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:11,839
Das

1482
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:12,863
White people first

1483
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:18,495
There we go now you're uniting the base right there that's what they really look

1484
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,263
Looking for

1485
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:21,055
Mrs. Rogers first

1486
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:22,079
Salvo

1487
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,103
Crispy

1488
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:30,015
If you start with a losing effort and see what

1489
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:36,415
Give God you know the second one is actually a little bit more plausible but also is a huge loser

1490
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:43,071
Who said that he was open to a third impeachment over Donald Trump

1491
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:44,607
Regarding January 6th

1492
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:48,191
This guy is the number-one rhino in the country

1493
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:49,727
He's a certain

1494
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:57,663
A a hard-charging

1495
01:06:59,199 --> 01:06:59,711
Fishman

1496
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:01,759
Who is Bilton extraordinary

1497
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:04,319
Grassroots campaign

1498
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,087
Beginning

1499
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:13,279
Jackson Longmire is probably not going to win this primary but is a perfect in Infowars typed

1500
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,047
Today because

1501
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:15,071
He's a f****** con man

1502
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:21,983
You made headlines in late 2021 because he was offering to provide his signature for people to use to get religious exemptions

1503
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,519
Remind me vaccine requirements

1504
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:26,591
But in order to get one you had to donate to his church

1505
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:32,479
This is really fun because not only is it him selling his religious beliefs not selling it

1506
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:33,759
It's also a complete

1507
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:36,319
He's running on the scared

1508
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:38,623
Is appealing to giving to the Lord

1509
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:41,183
Every state has different rules about exemption

1510
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:46,303
But there's almost no situation where you would be required of a note from your pastor in order to get one

1511
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:50,911
This is babyshit like imagining that vaccine exemptions are like getting your parents

1512
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,191
The sinus lift it says you don't

1513
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:58,591
Go to gym class is this a stubblebine original laminating cards

1514
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:00,639
Say you don't have to hurt me mad

1515
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,711
Exploiting the ignorance of people he's marketing

1516
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:06,527
Himself to specifically using the appearance of his religion

1517
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:07,807
Disposition for profit

1518
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,367
That makes me real piece of s*** and just

1519
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:12,671
The sort of person that Alex and Rodger would want it off

1520
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:13,439
Office

1521
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:18,815
In this case again there are five candidates in the GOP Primary but the extra little bit different

1522
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:25,215
James Lankford is the incumbent but he has two people with actual political experience running against him in the primary

1523
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:30,847
That's less weirdos to split the weirdo vote and more actual politicians who could end up safe

1524
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:31,871
V

1525
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:37,503
I still doubt that Laumeier is going anywhere but he's got a better shot than crispy in terms of

1526
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:38,783
Just a folk story

1527
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:41,855
Primary actual politicians dropout

1528
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:43,391
Before the primary.

1529
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:46,719
If that doesn't happen then beat they could end up

1530
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:47,487
Splitting

1531
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:49,791
De nada

1532
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:56,191
This is going to be one of the funnier Republican primary election that will not be funny

1533
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:57,983
Baby funny for me just because it's going to

1534
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:00,031
Constantly be that Futurama joke

1535
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:00,799
Book of the

1536
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:03,871
3% titanium

1537
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:05,151
Is it go too far enough

1538
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:08,991
I think you're 3% titanium text goes too far you know like

1539
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:11,807
They're all saying the same s*** America first

1540
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,879
Anti-vax they're all saying the same s*** at each other

1541
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:21,023
Right it's bananas right and I really want to set themselves apart

1542
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:24,095
They're going to have to go even more

1543
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:27,935
That's the only way to differentiate how do you pull away from the pack

1544
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,983
In Crazy Town

1545
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,263
You got to go crazy

1546
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:37,663
You can't go saying you can't be like hey I'm the guy who thinks we should compromise nothing about you man

1547
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:40,479
The real quick

1548
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:42,783
So Rogers got another

1549
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:44,063
Cuz candidate

1550
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:46,879
I think we should reach across the aisle

1551
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:49,695
Is Rogers at another candidate

1552
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:50,975
This made me really sad

1553
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,279
What about Laura Loomer

1554
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:56,095
He's running an incredibly hard charging race against

1555
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:59,679
Webster didn't even bother to show up

1556
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:01,983
To vote against impeachment

1557
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:04,287
And he didn't even bother to send

1558
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:08,639
Or loomer's not going anywhere

1559
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:11,455
That's his face is just

1560
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:17,855
Rough the Specter of Laura Loomer becoming a congressperson

1561
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:19,135
Not very scary

1562
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:19,903
Not worried about it

1563
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:23,231
Not at all

1564
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:25,279
Didn't go well

1565
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,559
Even though she was

1566
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,583
Way ahead in the

1567
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:29,375
The poles she was ahead by 6

1568
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:34,239
Billions and billions and billions of dollars in it

1569
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,799
More money than she had like 80% of the vote

1570
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:40,639
All the money and then it was stolen drummer

1571
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:41,407
Okay

1572
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,431
Good luck

1573
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:48,319
So we got a scam epreacher we got a right side broadcasting weirdo

1574
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:55,487
Cool

1575
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:57,535
This is why

1576
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,327
Galaxies politician

1577
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:02,143
Repeating his talking points

1578
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,167
Yeah you know I

1579
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:03,935
Worried

1580
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:06,495
That the intellectual Powerhouse

1581
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:08,799
Rodger

1582
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:09,823
Gaston

1583
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:10,591
Alex Jones

1584
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:12,639
And Laura Loomer

1585
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:14,943
I don't know if we can defeat them

1586
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:16,991
Yeah

1587
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,015
It's daunting

1588
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:19,551
Keysmart

1589
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:22,111
It's a game of four-dimensional chess

1590
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:26,975
Alex even put Laura Loomer name on a video

1591
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:29,535
In a f****** support her on a ballot

1592
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,071
The f*** out of here

1593
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:32,607
That's a good boy

1594
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:35,423
So Rogers got some big election2020 news

1595
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,447
Haha

1596
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:41,567
By the way today

1597
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:46,687
Where the Pennsylvania

1598
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:50,271
Mail-in ballots used in the last election

1599
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:52,319
Unconstitutional

1600
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:54,623
Clear to most of us but

1601
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,695
Publican State Legislature

1602
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:01,023
Riverside

1603
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:03,071
And legalize mail-in ballot

1604
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,631
Now it will go to the Supreme Court

1605
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:06,655
Pennsylvania

1606
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:08,191
Which leans left

1607
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:10,239
If the next election

1608
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:13,823
Is held in Pennsylvania under the old rules

1609
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:16,383
You're not going to elect a republican governor

1610
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:23,039
I appreciate your

1611
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:24,575
Conviction

1612
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:28,159
Yeah so this is about a law that Pennsylvania passed that allowed

1613
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:29,695
No excuse mail-in ballot

1614
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:31,487
So does that to do with the entire issue

1615
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,255
Mail-in ballot

1616
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:33,279
Specific

1617
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:35,327
Circumstance cuz of the pandemic

1618
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:37,887
Silky folks challenge the concert

1619
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:40,191
Douching ality of that law and lower court

1620
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:40,959
It's comprised of

1621
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:43,007
Three Republicans into Democrats vote

1622
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:44,031
322

1623
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,311
There was against the Constitution

1624
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:48,127
Oh yeah which way which way did it go exactly how you

1625
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:53,247
Appeal to the state supreme court struck down in

1626
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,271
Global stand

1627
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:57,599
It's not just because that's a green portal e52 Democrat

1628
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:58,367
Like majority

1629
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:00,159
Even if the Supreme Court did

1630
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:01,951
Throw this out

1631
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:03,231
Like they've Struck it down

1632
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:05,791
It wouldn't have any effect on the 2020

1633
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:10,143
No I'm pretty sure we have to go back in time

1634
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:12,447
Now

1635
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:19,103
So what really demonstrates how much of a cold the GOP is become is the fact that 11 of the GOP lawmakers hooray

1636
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:21,407
This challenge to the court actually voted

1637
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:24,991
For the bill to become law

1638
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:26,527
Open controlled legislature

1639
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:31,135
Alex love to misuse 1984 references but this might be actually a good spot

1640
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:31,903
How to deploy that

1641
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:32,671
One of those

1642
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:33,951
Yeah I think it's a little

1643
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:35,231
Yeah that's a little CC

1644
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:37,791
Dolittle

1645
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,327
Stop like these 11

1646
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,351
These 11

1647
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:41,119
We

1648
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,399
We passed it unconscious

1649
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:44,191
Tie-dye chest

1650
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:48,287
I just don't even know that we voted

1651
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:50,079
Open favorite hits it's insane

1652
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:51,103
It's insane

1653
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,383
It really is

1654
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:53,151
Insane

1655
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:53,919
Is it safe

1656
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:58,527
You just have them all walk out and go

1657
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:00,063
And that would be the same thing

1658
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,087
You mean like a

1659
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:06,719
People do to Alex Alex at the grocery store just do that because it doesn't matter what you

1660
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,255
You say all of your words mean nothing

1661
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,535
Speaking of which

1662
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:14,911
Alex heard a clip of trump saying that he's going to be the 45th and 47th president

1663
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:16,959
Here's Alex's response to that

1664
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:19,263
Ridenour to play this clip of a

1665
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:26,687
Rodger

1666
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:33,855
Gonna run

1667
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:36,415
Was the final deal

1668
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,695
But he will be the 40

1669
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:42,303
President that is got a scare the hell out of the left I thought Alex

1670
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,095
Heated Trump now mean

1671
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:51,007
These these these folks especially like Alex

1672
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:51,775
I have a base

1673
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:52,543
So much

1674
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:55,615
Of their ability to engage with the world

1675
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:57,919
Trump

1676
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:58,687
Sycophant

1677
01:14:58,943 --> 01:14:59,455
Nonsense

1678
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:01,759
They can't go away for

1679
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:05,087
Like they'll get mad

1680
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:07,135
Nml come back even though

1681
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:10,463
I don't know does Trump change his position on vaccines

1682
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:12,767
Certainly didn't get unboosted

1683
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:16,607
I mean the thing about it that's really interesting

1684
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:18,655
First thing is that they are beholding

1685
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:19,935
Into fake Trump

1686
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:22,495
Forever

1687
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,287
Trapped in this world of like

1688
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:27,359
Oh we made this fake 12 real

1689
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:29,663
Yeah cuz the real one

1690
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,199
Is nothing like the fake one

1691
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:35,551
Yeah I made talks about that even like he's our Peach

1692
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:36,575
The symbol this

1693
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:38,623
Signet

1694
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,951
Yeah I mean

1695
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:43,999
The thing about making a flag your symbolism

1696
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:46,047
Set the flag can't contradict you

1697
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:50,143
You make a dude your symbol he's going to be disappointed

1698
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:51,935
And then you got to throw a fit

1699
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:55,007
And then you got to get back in life

1700
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:57,311
Recognize this dynamic

1701
01:15:57,567 --> 01:16:01,151
Really clearly by Donald

1702
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:07,551
About making something by would you care about for a little while then you'll recognize

1703
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:11,391
I'm the only means you haven't ever getting Empower ever again

1704
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:12,415
Angel f*** your

1705
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:19,839
At this point Trump is going to pull a Grover Cleveland become the president and a Supreme Court Justice who f****** cares

1706
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:22,143
Could happen so

1707
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:25,727
January 6th Ashley Babbitt got shot

1708
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:26,751
And

1709
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:28,287
Obviously sad

1710
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:32,639
She was not actual

1711
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,967
We got a

1712
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:38,015
Everything surrounding it

1713
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,039
And then there's a

1714
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:40,831
Unarmed

1715
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:43,903
Who is she manison

1716
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,695
Really

1717
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:51,839
But she was freaking out

1718
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:53,887
Military

1719
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:03,103
So this new version of the Ashley Babbitt

1720
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:05,151
What story comes from a Zero Hedge article

1721
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:09,759
And it relies on footage that was shot by John Sullivan

1722
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:13,087
It's not full of footage that wasn't available Alex

1723
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:14,111
On January

1724
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:19,999
One of his employees was standing next to John's elevator in the foyer

1725
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,279
They are and ask

1726
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:23,071
Tim to buy his footage from a

1727
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:24,607
You see that on tape

1728
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:29,215
Anyway it's a it's this footage and an interpretation that's provided by Taylor

1729
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:34,079
Who course was the guy who burned a black lives matter flag with Owen Shroyer on the evening of January 10th

1730
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:39,199
Talk about Ashley Babb it literally sent the exit at the Capitol Building cuz

1731
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:40,991
Gaston Infowars of that

1732
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:44,575
It's not the story that he's been telling up to this

1733
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:50,975
This point in time to really think about how they wished it had gone that can really ride

1734
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:52,767
Write it out new footage

1735
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:54,303
It's not a new revelation

1736
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:58,655
It's just new spin that the same right-wing s******* posing as independent journalist

1737
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:00,191
We're trying to self take some

1738
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:02,495
The heat off of fact their buddies got arrested for sedition

1739
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:03,263
Just conspiracy

1740
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:04,287
And it's

1741
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:05,055
Boring

1742
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:06,591
Boo

1743
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:08,383
Man

1744
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,151
It's

1745
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,175
It's been awhile

1746
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:11,711
Yeah you know the election

1747
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:13,759
How's a few years ago

1748
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:16,319
6

1749
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,855
How's the whole year ago

1750
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:18,879
You know like

1751
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:20,671
You can't rewrite these things now

1752
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:21,951
They're trying

1753
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:23,999
That is a problem

1754
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:26,559
How does a problem really give a stick

1755
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:28,095
So I don't think not for a long time

1756
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:30,655
Maybe just for long enough yeah

1757
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:33,215
You know there'll be a little bit of a flash up

1758
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:34,495
Little bit of a

1759
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:36,543
Do you get a little bit of a charge out of it

1760
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:39,103
She'll be gone by next week

1761
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:39,871
Maui

1762
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:41,663
So Rodger was there

1763
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:42,431
In d.c.

1764
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:44,479
Yeah and he gave a speech on the 5th

1765
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:45,759
Some have said

1766
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:47,807
Now granted some are rock

1767
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:49,087
That it was a perfect

1768
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:52,671
I don't know if anybody has said that

1769
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:54,719
Yeah I gave us

1770
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,487
Speech on the

1771
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,791
January

1772
01:18:58,047 --> 01:19:00,095
Put it up on YouTube

1773
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:01,375
It's gone

1774
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:05,215
Because it was his.

1775
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:06,751
Perfect

1776
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:07,519
Swai

1777
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:09,311
I didn't Advocate Lawless

1778
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:10,591
Navigate

1779
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:13,407
I did not Advocate that anyone

1780
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,431
Anyone

1781
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:18,783
About my

1782
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:26,719
Between dark and Light

1783
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:29,535
The Godly and the Godless by the way

1784
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:33,375
Oh my God

1785
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:40,031
Timer right to say that but they want to

1786
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:42,335
You're right to say that

1787
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:45,151
Why I'm spending all my money all my time

1788
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:47,711
Raising money to pay lawyers I'm so sick

1789
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:48,991
Lawyers

1790
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:52,063
Normal life

1791
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:59,743
Go to the store and buy a product

1792
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:04,095
People don't understand the importance of Infowars as a beacon

1793
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:06,399
A freedom and Truth over the last

1794
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:12,799
5 years they don't understand it then Alex got to be pissed that Rodger said over the last 5 years

1795
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:14,848
Ever since I showed up

1796
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:17,920
Specifically a beacon of light and Truth

1797
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:18,944
Before that who knows

1798
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:23,296
I just never listen

1799
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:30,976
You gave a great speech

1800
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:32,256
Bigotry to

1801
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:35,584
Calamities a weirdo

1802
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,888
That is we were recalled from his last appearance

1803
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,424
That was the most

1804
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:45,056
Just like a child I've heard Rodger Stone sounds like in a long time just like

1805
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:46,336
I did a great job

1806
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,104
Admittedly

1807
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:52,480
I did say that it was a struggle between good and evil but you know what that's not x-rayed advocating a fight

1808
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:56,064
That's great that you're hurt your inside I Christian that's what it is

1809
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,624
Yeah

1810
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,928
My guy will say that the Rodger

1811
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:04,512
Karaoke version of him that carries religion as a shield

1812
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:06,304
Is not a fun Rodger

1813
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,144
Rodger is a weirdo

1814
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,424
The Libertines

1815
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,728
That's a bit more of a fun Rodger

1816
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:20,128
Who carries a shield of I'm so strange you can't really help

1817
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:26,528
What are you what are you going to do I had an orgy the other night when am I going to be mad I'm a swinger and

1818
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:27,808
No liar

1819
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:34,208
Good luck making me care how can I see Nixon on my back

1820
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:37,536
Morning I wake up while I'm brushing my teeth I'd take a look and I go well at least I'm not that far

1821
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:44,192
This is like that's so much more of an interesting fun Rodger this is just sad

1822
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:45,216
Post

1823
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:47,520
F****** got caught

1824
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,800
Fraud

1825
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:52,128
But you should know that

1826
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:53,664
Alex

1827
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,200
Rodger

1828
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:57,760
In the world

1829
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:58,784
That's really why

1830
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:02,368
I'm pretty sure Rodger was convicted of fraud

1831
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,928
Billet retailers and that's why everybody is

1832
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,232
Just trying to take them down

1833
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,768
Why do they want to lock us up

1834
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,304
Why do they want

1835
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,376
Stone and Jones up because

1836
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:14,912
Because the truth

1837
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:18,752
He's always threatening to the no one is as hated as a truth-teller

1838
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:26,176
Fun.com make a contribution

1840
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:33,856
You can make a donation there's a donation but

1841
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:35,904
I'm sick of being called

1842
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:36,672
A grifter

1843
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:40,256
Don't act like this.

1844
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,376
Donate

1845
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:49,984
Donate to store

1846
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,544
The store I don't know why people call me a crypt

1847
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,336
Yeah I mean like

1848
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,872
I sympathize

1849
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,152
I empathize

1850
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:01,248
It sucks probably being called a group or booty call

1851
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:02,016
Like one

1852
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:03,552
People will call

1853
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:08,672
Yeah I think it's just a result of action

1854
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:09,696
Supposed to

1855
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:16,096
I don't like it when people look at me accurately I would prefer to be shrouded in a Web of Lies

1856
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:22,496
He has as I had for the majority

1857
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:27,104
Yeah this Alex interviews a lawyer who's like against

1858
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:27,872
Mandates

1859
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:29,408
Seeing mandates

1860
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:34,016
The and he pops up and promotes the interview General Flynn

1861
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:38,112
But this is about where I emotionally

1862
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,488
And yell about

1863
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:45,536
Loser ass candidates

1864
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,096
Make a bunch of

1865
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:50,656
Give me body of a truth-teller

1866
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:53,984
I'll even bring up Play-Doh

1867
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:56,800
There's just nothing funnier than that like

1868
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:59,872
String of give me money give me money

1869
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:02,944
Chris

1870
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,480
It's so unfair

1871
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:11,136
The presumption that there's something like and giving him money that will make him

1872
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:13,440
Not be called the grifters the future

1873
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:15,232
Just the idea

1874
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:17,536
That the last time I hear you come on

1875
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:21,888
You are telling me that you need people to donate to your legal fun

1876
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,168
So you can sue every

1877
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:27,520
Everybody everybody everyone

1878
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:31,616
Disappearance

1879
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:38,016
Maybe is for the offense also

1880
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:40,320
Call baby one way or the other but

1881
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:42,368
Tonight he's not a grifter

1882
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,392
Okay

1883
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:50,304
Just cuz the story changes from moment to moment based upon what he thinks will mostly manipulate you enough into giving it money

1884
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:54,912
He's trying to trick you into like believing

1885
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:58,496
But he's going to get loser f****** candidates into office

1886
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:01,568
You

1887
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:03,616
As if you donating to Rodger

1888
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:06,688
He's just as good as donating to their campaign

1889
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:08,224
Because Rogers going to use it to help them

1890
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,528
Zillow

1891
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,088
He's at these candidates are getting

1892
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:13,856
Exposure

1893
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:18,720
So we come to the end of this and I don't know I think

1894
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:19,744
I think this was

1895
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:22,048
Strange episode because

1896
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:28,192
Trying to prepare it while the rally and the Convoy were

1897
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:34,336
Sort of ongoing was a little bit of a difficult thing cuz you didn't really know where anything was going to land in

1898
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:38,176
You know it even as a recording this I still love like I said not

1899
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:39,712
Not entirely sure

1900
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:42,784
If things have ramped up when things will wrap up

1901
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:45,856
FL escalator sldf

1902
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:47,904
People are going to actually

1903
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:50,208
Stay true to their word of

1904
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:56,608
I'm going to stay here until Trudeau resign I mean if roughly 700,000 Canadians are suddenly going to

1905
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:57,632
To become

1906
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:59,424
Truckers in order to meet

1907
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,704
The million required

1908
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:03,776
I mean

1909
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:10,688
I don't know if the the Licensing Bureau could handle it

1910
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:20,416
Getting those. Physicals is going to be a bastard

1911
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:22,464
Do you know that

1912
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:27,328
That's what I'm telling you that's not even considering the neurological tests

1913
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,608
They need to schedule

1914
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:33,984
So I think we will see what happens but I will check back in

1915
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:37,312
But this is this is where we're at

1916
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,152
2022

1917
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:42,944
Booty back

1918
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,992
Until then

1919
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,272
Website

1920
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:48,832
Sprite.com

1921
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:56,768
Barrel run

1922
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,048
And now here comes

1923
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:04,448
Alex
