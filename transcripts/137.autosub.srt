00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,048
Holding

00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:07,168
Alexandra Thurston color

00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,104
Novelty Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,944
Indeed

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,712
Who is Riza

6
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:24,576
You're supposed to say he is risen indeed

7
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,344
That's alright

8
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:38,656
Jim Toth

9
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:44,288
Recovering

10
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:49,408
Where is the Easter sale still going on

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,808
After 7 Days in Colorado allegedly

00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
He has returned

13
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:17,824

14
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,408
Owen Shroyer

15
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,712
Excited but not quite as exciting

16
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,760
As I are new donor

17
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:31,648
Ladies and gentlemen

18
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,184
Oh God I forgot I have a

19
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,072
You so much

20
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,240
Thank you for doing the show

21
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,776
Like this I know it's Nathan's

22
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51,104
Billion crumbs

23
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:57,760
Mantle

24
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,832
Wow wow

25
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,600
Wow

26
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:06,720
Everything is bad

27
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,280
Anyway

28
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:16,448
Alex Jones is back from vacation

29
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:22,592
Call last year from Chobani yogurt

30
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,920
I went on vacation immediately right after that

31
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,200
Very very strange

32
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,904
I want it I forgot I was going to Heidi and Spencer goes to different

33
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,352
Showing up wherever hadiya.

34
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,400
Spencer go on vacation

35
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:52,800
Colorado permit

36
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,104
Bear with blood coming out of its jaws of the back

37
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,896
Everything is possible

38
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:03,296
At later than episode does indicate that he's stalking people now so

39
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,136
I'm fine with you.

40
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,720
So Alex is back

41
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,744
Like I said

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,280
Very excited about it

43
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:17,888
We're going to go over this episode

44
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,704
28

45
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,824
Is a novel context from March 12th

46
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
2008

47
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
That's correct

48
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,432
Trivia

49
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,992
Is an out-of-context drop of Alex from Today Show

50
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,088
Today

51
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,112
What

52
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:45,792
I've barely plug today or any other day

53
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,840
Barely

54
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,912
Spiritually alive

55
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,544
Right up top

56
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,336
Alex

57
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
Clearly shows

58
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,920
Episode

59
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,968
You cannot have a fill-in host

60
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,504
Like he comes in

61
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,600
Like he has something to prove he comes in like

62
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,880
He's trying to

63
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,672
Apologize

64
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,720
He's screaming about Satan

65
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,024
A lot of the episode

66
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,143
By talking about a recent rally the Trump

67
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
IPad

68
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,935
And here is his take on

69
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:29,567
Clip here on the president at that rally because it just gets

70
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,359
Better and better.

71
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,127
No

72
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,151
As the crowd

73
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
Channing

74
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,711
CNN sucks

75
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,015
Then we've got

76
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,295
I'm calling Chuck

77
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
Great

78
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,671
So Alex

79
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,535
Not realize

80
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
How

81
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,119
President

82
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,399
Rally's

83
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,423
Where in

84
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,471
People chance CNN suck

85
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,775
It's to understand

86
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,799
Screwed

87
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,895
Which we have gone if it's sort of aggressive

88
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,431
Crowd version of

89
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
Impressed

90
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:13,599
You know it's very uncomfortable

91
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,391
Especially since I cut out the parts

92
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
Of the

93
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:27,679
Tuxedo touch

94
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:34,847
I meant the other plays is Trump

95
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,663
Yeah conveniently Alex leaves up

96
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,943
Apart from

97
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,711
Trump's rally

98
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,271
The only way to solve

99
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,599
When you catch

100
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,367
A drug dealer

101
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,183
Put him away for a long

102
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,743
When I was in China

103
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,887
The president do you have

104
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,167
No no no

105
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
Ice rape

106
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,055
1.4 billion

107
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,359
Not much of a drug problem

108
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
I f******

109
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
I said what are you tripping

110
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,039
Neighbors

111
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,319
If you're a drug dealer

112
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,367
Are you know you're going to get caught

113
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,159
And you know

114
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,439
Did you really kill people

115
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,815
Chilling or family

116
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,863
Chewing our workers

117
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:29,887
Okay

118
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
Again

119
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:37,567
To be clear about this I've said this before I have studiously avoided

120
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,871
Hearing his voice ever

121
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,151
Sometimes it's important

122
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:48,063
Know what's important is that if you voted for that you should have lost your right to vote and you should

123
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,087
There's no

124
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,159
There's no defensible reason for that being

125
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,975
Representative

126
00:06:55,231 --> 00:07:01,375
The human race no no no truly beranak and stupid monster

127
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
The f****** human

128
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:09,311
The concept of the death penalty even for murder

129
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,359
Balloon for trying to make a

130
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,687
Selling smoke

131
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,735
You f******

132
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:22,623
They're the ones ruining our children not the children themselves who might want to f****** get Iowa

133
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
Get high all the time

134
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,183
Or order

135
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,791
Babers

136
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,839
Also

137
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:38,239
Also the bigger issue is drug companies real

138
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
Or smart

139
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:42,847
Reasonable at all in the sense of

140
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,639
Aura idea

141
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:48,991
But if I really want to talk about is like Alex doesn't

142
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,575
Like you doesn't play this part of the valley and of course he

143
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:01,535
Or like it being a good idea to have the death penalty

144
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,351
Really long sentences for drug dealers

145
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,143
Alex's principles are

146
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,751
He's a Libertarian allegedly and that drugs should be legal

147
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,031
So what you're going to f******

148
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,823
Put someone to death because

149
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,127
They're selling something that should be legal

150
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:22,015
Alex's

151
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:26,367
Hey you know the guy that president

152
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:32,767
Doterra from the Philippines famously keeping the government out of people's butt

153
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,095
That was a big thing that Doterra was all about you

154
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:42,495
Sure he was personally going out in murdering people probably is

155
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,519
Human rights violation

156
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:47,103
Yeah he is there are charges that are being event

157
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:52,223
Skater Buffet

158
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:59,391
He thinks he is the thing is is in the past that had duterte's doing the

159
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,695
Good job

160
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:05,279
If you take all the context clues from all of his the only thing you can take away

161
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,303
Is there a

162
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,119
Trump think that's a good idea

163
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
The other thing you saying

164
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
Goodnight goodnight

165
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:16,799
From the rally is I went over to China and I talked about how do you not have a drug problem

166
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,103
We are a ruthless state

167
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:24,223
Imprison people all times and kills them for doing drugs

168
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:29,087
Can't be on board with the time

169
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,879
You can't

170
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,903
Ckn

171
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
No one

172
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,695
Stay the night

173
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:38,303
One reason that you're racist pieces

174
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,167
You're fine with all kinds of

175
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,959
Goddamn

176
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:49,567
Authoritarianism because you never really had any beliefs other than

177
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,847
Beer and nonsense

178
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
End it

179
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
Banana

180
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,943
Totally bananas

181
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,271
He quit

182
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,319
Kula is he still president

183
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:05,183
Rid of him after that didn't everybody collectively go

184
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,999
It's supposed to

185
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,535
This is what supposed to

186
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,071
We're through the Looking Glass Jordan

187
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,863
Mom

188
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,911
Couple questions

189
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:19,007
The first one

190
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,055
Betty Rae's

191
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:31,039
If you're ever in the Kansas City Missouri area go check it out there's some the best ice cream

192
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,599
As we say in Missouri

193
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,391
Get cool

194
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,719
Jordan

195
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:43,327
That's how we get cool in like a physical injury sentence

196
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,167
I told you earlier

197
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,983
Has been on vacation

198
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
You know that

199
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
Yes

200
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,895
I think he was talking to lawyers

201
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,039
He was hanging out with his family and haven't

202
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
Good Times

203
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:10,719
Because in reality what is what you would do before you go to jail you won't spend as much time as possible

204
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:15,071
But I already secondary

205
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,607
The fact that he had a breakthrough

206
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,399
While he was over there

207
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,191
In Colorado allegedly

208
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,775
Beyond

209
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
The last week

210
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
And

211
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,687
It is shook me to my very core

212
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,503
Professional

213
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:37,599
More serious sleeping by moron the audience

214
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,439
That I am going to

215
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,975
Give it all I've got

216
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,935
Sometimes

217
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,727
Don't jump don't have that

218
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,775
By the tiger Focus that I should

219
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,175
Experiencing

220
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,711
The truth

221
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,271
Growing in this country that we cannot let win

222
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,551
I think he's talking about us

223
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,599
Talking about himself

224
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,135
Elizabeth

225
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,671
Countermeasures

226
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:16,255
Covert action now

227
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,303
Covert operations

228
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:28,543
We got to get it to spy it

229
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,175
It's really weird if this is a thread that's going to continue throughout this episode that Alex is like

230
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,711
We got a spy

231
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
Alright

232
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,503
That's

233
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:42,623
Me that he's very worried about something

234
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,391
Fat guys

235
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,927
What I would like

236
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:51,327
Follow Ashley Bickford around because she has got me over hot coals

237
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,607
I am

238
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:59,007
Possible

239
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,335
I don't know tonight

240
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:06,175
I wanted also say that that guy who invented Pepe

241
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,015
A frog

242
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,807
Yes I'm and everybody's like

243
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,855
Jumping up on

244
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:18,207
I'm just being a big deal

245
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,231
Guy protect

246
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,279
What is intellectual property

247
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,327
Other people like Mike cernovich

248
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,887
Cernovich used it on the cover of his book

249
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,215
And I think that the argument of fair use

250
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,495
Does

251
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,775
Apply in this setting

252
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:35,103
I just want to be on the side of I don't think that's okay

253
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
Compelling

254
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,687
Things that I don't think that's stealing

255
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,015
The same time if he were a corporation

256
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,295
If he were Disney

257
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,367
He was calling intellectual property rights

258
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,415
Yeah you would have won that lawsuit

259
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,439
25 seconds

260
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:55,583
I don't f*** with Mickey Mouse

261
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,119
About Mickey Mouse

262
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,143
Keeps

263
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,959
They keep extending the date at Beyond which something

264
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
Becomes

265
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
Public

266
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
What is it

267
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,335
Public domain

268
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:11,455
Specifically based on the date at which Mickey Mouse would become public

269
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,759
Interesting that's a real thing

270
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,319
That's very weird look up

271
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:24,767
I just want to be on record as saying like I think that Ashley Beckford and Rob Jake

272
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
Gibson's lawsuit

273
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
Deserve

274
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,631
Much more attention

275
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,471
Pepe lawsuit is frivolous

276
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,031
Useful words

277
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,151
I could see a decent lawyer very easily make the argument that

278
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,687
It becomes Fair

279
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:46,527
Interpretation

280
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,319
Is that this guy created a

281
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
You know really

282
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,391
Manifest

283
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,719
The frog that turned into a Nazi symbol like that's a bummer

284
00:14:54,975 --> 00:15:01,119
That is a bummer but I don't know if there is

285
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,191
Like it summer

286
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:11,103
Randomly grabbed a clip of ours and was it was like hey guess what if you guys love Nazis this clip is the one for you

287
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,127
Don't give people ideas

288
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:17,503
Okay fair enough infiltrator

289
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:24,671
I don't actually think that they are spying on us but it is interesting

290
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,719
Paranoia

291
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,999
Publicly saying

292
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:32,095
We got to start spotting up folks

293
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,471
So in the next recruiting white people

294
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
Prefer alkayida

295
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,031
Exactly

296
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,591
Next clip

297
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,359
It's about

298
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,967
Things that are breaking away

299
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
Globalism

300
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,783
As he always talks about

301
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:55,903
Marine Le Pen

302
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:02,303
You've been corrected on that okay not running president right now

303
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,191
And every other Nation on Earth is beginning its away

304
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,007
Consciousness

305
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
Racial

306
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:17,919
Punctual

307
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,223
On the face of this

308
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,271
Planet orbiting the Sun

309
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,831
You can feel

310
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,391
The Boyd

311
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,207
Tenderheart my friends the moment

312
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,487
Realize

313
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,791
This is important

314
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,887
Use free will to begin even understand

315
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,447
You will feel

316
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,287
Once your contentious understand that

317
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,055
The word is that

318
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,687
With our five senses

319
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,711
Tasty

320
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,503
We have Morrison

321
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,807
Alex forgot the other two

322
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,647
What about Michelle

323
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,719
Alex

324
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,279
Spelling sergeant

325
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,119
Intergalactic

326
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,983
Beautiful wind chime

327
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,007
Yep

328
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,031
Great

329
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,943
Only our that's all we are the three vovi

330
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,991
Yeah

That

332
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,879
No man that is enough

333
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,159
Hot nonsense

334
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,511
It's really funny coffee

335
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
Intergalactic space

336
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,351
40

337
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,631
I don't know is that a thing

338
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,679
Anyway

339
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:49,055
It's a little bit esoteric up in this bih

340
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,103
But now we got to go back down to earth

341
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,383
From there the space twins

342
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,687
Sirius through the

343
00:17:54,943 --> 00:18:00,575
Replace us back onto the Earth cuz Alex has got to try and get them

344
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,951
We got to go back to

345
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
Alright

346
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:10,303
Let me try to get another nose here because

347
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,375
I get all wound up

348
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:19,519
You do when I get all dialed in to the news and then I just got to run down the rabbit Trail without getting into the big issues

349
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,287
That

350
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,823
Surrounded

351
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,615
Coming out today

352
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,919
You want to guess what the big news is

353
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,991
Is this is this like today news

354
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:32,319
Yeah sort of over the weekend over the weekend

00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,599
Let's see

356
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
Nope

357
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:40,255
The ongoing crisis in Puerto Rico

358
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
Doesn't

359
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,167
Touch it what does

360
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,959
Worried about it

361
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
Nope

362
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:56,383
You're never going to guess what the big news

363
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
Let's see what happens

364
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,855
Tommy Robinson

365
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,159
Is a patriot

366
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,279
He understands all around him a globalist

367
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,047
Communist

368
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,607
Islamic enforced

369
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:20,447
Sure

370
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:29,663
Come here a little bit is the big news wow

371
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,991
I mean it's not news if you listen to Infowars

372
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,783
In the real world

373
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,879
But we're going to talk a lot about Tommy Robinson

374
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,671
Is talking big about Tommy

375
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:46,303
Is because over the weekend Tommy Robinson without agitating it seem like it's a Muslim

376
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:52,703
Related events people found him McDonald's of beat the s*** out of

377
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:59,103
And apparently he fought back in like the guy apparently the

378
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
Musically in German

379
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:06,271
People who beat

380
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,951
But everyone was laughing because there's

381
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,719

387
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,727
Animated

388
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
More than that

389
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,055
Our interview with Tommy Robinson

390
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,847
About all of this

391
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,895
Inspection last night

392
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,967
All of this is

393
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:42,111
Is them trying to retain his masculinity after he got beat up internet

394
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,135
Roboto

395
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,071
Give me all the time too

396
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:55,167
To give some sort of it cuz I don't know who Tommy Robinson is

397
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:59,007
He's a really really aggressive Muslim agitator

398
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,079
Either white nationalist

399
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,103
Almost

400
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,455
A lot of fun

401
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,015
Once we get to his interview

402
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,063
But for now just know

403
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,391
Seasoning for work desk

404
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,184
And he hates Muslims

405
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,768
Every time

406
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,072
Alex Jones goes on vacation

407
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
Something happens

408
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,912
He's got to tell the story about it

409
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,984
When he gets back is somebody going to be in a hot tub

410
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,824
There's no hot tub story

411
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,128
Does not pass the smell test

412
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:40,480
Airplane

413
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:48,672
Call if you lost your family and there was all for my children

414
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,208
From Colorado

415
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,728
That you are

416
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:07,104
We have a discussion

417
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,688
That works

418
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:37,824
Vista

419
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,688
Accurate at all

420
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,736
Personae

421
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,552
Videotapes Alex

422
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:53,952
You should be banned if he's aware handy haha you lost your family and you lost your family is next

423
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,744
And then

424
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
Separate

425
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,864
I think so yeah okay guy

426
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,144
Threatened

427
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,168
To beat up his child

428
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:07,008
Start f****** with him at the baggage claim and then later

429
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,288
Tell Rex

430
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,312
Time to go

431
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,104
Got to f****** throw down

432
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:18,528
Doesn't sound right to me until the longer version of the story later and their Clan am assuming we will

433
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:22,624
Hear it

434
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,904
Too long and

435
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
The way you

436
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:29,280
He tells it is so scattershot you sell all over the place yet

437
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,560
6 Minute clipper

438
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,888
You get all of the broad Strokes

439
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,448
Hear the rest of it is like

440
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,984
Normal

441
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:44,384
Zippy game

442
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,664
Hello

443
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,272
Exactly

444
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,112
Just the idea that someone to be like on the beat up

445
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,904
Is it's f***** up

446
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,976
15-year old boy there's no way

447
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:05,120
Alex is using it as a way to make an argument that like

448
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888
UCI

449
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,168
I don't care that you're gay

450
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,776
I am gay people coming up to me all the time and they're so mad that I have a family

451
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,128
I just farted

452
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,176
Not because of their game

453
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,528
Against me Bible family

454
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,624
That's just always

455
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,184
See how the story is going to

456
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,072
Play out and evolves over the next week or so and see if we get some more globalists involved that maybe

457
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,608
It's like he is

458
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
The worst

459
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,656
Short story writer

460
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,936
Like what he is not

461
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,728
What are you guys not at work

462
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:48,128
He's like sitting around like JD Salinger with his little typewriter

463
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,152
To make it about

464
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:49,920
Three

465
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,248
Threaten to beat up my son

466
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,528
Should be the lead

467
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,880
Of course not

468
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,416
Even in his

469
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,208
Steven is made of b*******

470
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,744
She's the headliner man

471
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,584
He know what happens to Alex

472
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,656
And then of course is like while they threatened to beat up my kid to

473
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
He said that

474
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:17,824
Let's move on

475
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,128
Go back to a very bizarre add pivots

476
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,920
I'm telling you I had

477
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
Because it's not

478
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,480
This isn't a normal activity

479
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,272
Is very weird one

480
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,368
Smells of death

481
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:35,488
Easter sale

482
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,048
Superman vitality

483
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:42,400
Absolutely not turn you gay

484
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:49,056
This is a two-part

485
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,848
Second part

486
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,432
So now that he is on his own

487
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,712
We are

488
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,760
Going to be working with mister

489
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:01,856
Robinson and trying to build studio trying to get him a larger team of people

490
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,928
Just real quick he used to work for Rebel media but I've

491
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:08,256
I think because he kept going and f****** people f****** with people in public

492
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,536
Yeah

493
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,096
Someone's going to actually be

494
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,376
Beat you up for real

495
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:19,264
For sending you on assignment or something like that we are bad people

496
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,312
Alright

497
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,336
Temperature

498
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,040
And yes

499
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,600
They do plan on killing

500
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:40,512
Fresno on a passion he's reaching out to all the minority groups

501
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,072
Yep and

502
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,376
And so he needs security

503
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,472
That's one reason we need to

504
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,008
Capital here

505
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:56,896
Get us more money cuz Tommy Robinson's going to die and we need to hire him isn't it

506
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,920
Recipe

507
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:01,248
It's pretty aggressive you don't give us more money

508
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:04,832
Tommy Robinson will not be able to afford a

509
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,112
Security

510
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,904
And then he will die

511
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:14,304
These bees you don't give me money

512
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,144
That's another minute of Life Tommy Robinson

513
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:24,544
These basically holding Tommy Robinson Hostage philosophically to his listeners which is

514
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,336
Bananas

515
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:32,736
I love that also

516
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,368
Instead of Dodge having those like

517
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:41,952
Country music songs in their in their advertisement

518
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,488
They just had like

519
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
Dave

520
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,792
From it

521
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,328
With a gun to his head

522
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,120
Look

523
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,656
Buy a car

524
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:56,800
Or don't or orive it like make it more realistic you could have like Dave be there in be like

525
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,336
By car

526
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,128
Job

527
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:05,504
At least not be as police locked up

528
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,296
You're killing the Auto industry

529
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:12,928
Unless you buy a Dodge Ram

530
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:15,488
Is the kind of guy who's made his bed

531
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,768
And now he's got to lay in it

532
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,328
Involved

533
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:24,192
I'm not saying they're right

534
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,032
To kill people

535
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,312
I am not

536
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:40,064
He were to not be here anymore no no no no no no no

537
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,160
I'm not terrible

538
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,536
Because I think that there's better ways to deal with stuff like that

539
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,072
But

540
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:56,704
That's where I'm at get in Tire late and he brought it on himself

541
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,032
I heard that he sold drugs

542
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,056
So that means

543
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,384
He has been arrested for drugs

544
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,784
The president will get to that later anyway

545
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,344
Second part of the ad pivot which is

546
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,136
A little

547
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,440
Satyr it's a little sadder and also

548
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:20,000
Much like the Colorado airport story I don't

549
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,816
Now I'm just going to say this here on here

550
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:30,240
What's capital this year and last year

551
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,824
Sudden death overtime

552
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:36,384
Play the Showman

553
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,944
Optimum energy

554
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,016
Shop

555
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:44,064
We got specials

556
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,416
Operation

557
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,768
Boston

558
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,816
80%

559
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,632
We're losing money on stuff 80% off

560
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:03,520
Special today because it's gets its not making it up

561
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,320
He's a f****** used car dealer

562
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:28,352
My prices I hope aren't too low oldest Rick and Morty

563
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,192
So first of all

564
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,984
Match to even it within that send

565
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,312
At the end

566
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:43,712
We're losing money

567
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,480
Cuz everyone

568
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,784
Did the elections are over and we won

569
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:53,184
Well that's cuz we're selling too much product glass product

570
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,488
Insults

571
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:58,816
You told too much product you make too little money

572
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,632
The underlying assumption is different in the beginning

573
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:02,656
The end of the

574
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:06,752
I don't know what reality is

575
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:07,776
I would need money

576
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,544
Alex

577
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,568
Money

578
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:17,760
Give Alex his listeners don't particularly care if they sort through like

579
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,832
I'm sorry this next clip Alex has some

580
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,856
We're in

581
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,648
Overtime

582
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:29,536
Woodward Sports NFL

583
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:34,144
You have to get the match whatever points were scored by the other team right

584
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,472
Hockey

585
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,800
That I mean

586
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,128
College ball

587
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,920
College sports have sudden death overtime

588
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,736
Alternating

589
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,296
I didn't think about that.

590
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,344
Claude Van Damme

591
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,232
That's the one next clip Alex has the

592
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,000
About his own

593
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,560
Being up for sport

594
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,096
No no

595
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,424
Dealing with

596
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,216
He's talking about the wall

597
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,264
The crap he's been dealing with his lawsuit

598
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,056
Occupy

599
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,736
Cuz I know none of this is work

600
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:28,672
This is such a big deal

601
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:35,072
Sure

602
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,680
Stupid

603
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,312
He's almost always

604
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,640
Or

605
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,432
Or

606
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,736
People have just decided

607
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,528
Tentative

608
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,344
You know like

609
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,112
Balita

610
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,136
Assassinate

611
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:05,280
I don't know cuz I mean like it was there he was like before

612
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,584
Or before Martin Luther King was killed

613
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,680
Well Martin Luther King possibly but RFK not

614
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:18,080
Public

615
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,920
I don't know I don't I don't

616
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,688
Vape

617
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
I don't

618
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,480
I don't know

619
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,784
From history are examples of what

620
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,576
Just talked about

621
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:32,928
Remember when Gandhi was a loser

622
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:36,256
Vicious disinformation Corey in about an hour

623
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,560
Yeah snake oil

624
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,840
Oh yeah

625
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:46,496
Who else who else Lincoln

626
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:53,408
I think that was just recognizing was probably going to

627
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,968
And he's like

628
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:59,296
To be very broke for a good long while

629
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,344
That like once that happens

630
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,112
I can

631
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,136
Play the victim

632
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,416
On the other side

633
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,440
I think that's

634
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:08,768
I think that's the game veggies playing

635
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,584
Oh yeah

636
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,400
Is it possible

637
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,960
It would make more money

638
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,728
In prison

639
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,752
Then he would

640
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:25,920
Donating

641
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:28,480
I'm going to protect

642
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,504
You know that

643
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,576
Mark Richards

644
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,112
Kind of profile in prison

645
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,160
Maybe becoming a complete weirdo

646
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:40,000
Or just the fact

647
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,536
And IV started to make a profit

648
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:46,400
Because he was I would say it's unlikely that you would make

649
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,936
More money in prison

650
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:49,984
Navigate maker

651
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:55,872
Because any could sort of take that time in prison to regroup it would clear him from his obligation

652
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:56,896
Trump

653
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,432
A lot of those other things

654
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,016
He claimed he was a political prisoner

655
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,576
The book next

656
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:10,976
Sissies in not being Hitler who I totally want to be Halloween

657
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,256
For real

658
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:18,656
Hitler and parentheses in a little bit

659
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,728
Hold on before we

660
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:26,848
Podcast illustrates the dangers of immediately agreed with something but in this next

661
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:30,176
Click Alex's complaining about Marina Abramovic

662
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:33,760
The artist

663
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:44,256
She is in the f****** news cycle

664
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,536
It for everyone who's forgotten

665
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,096
She was the artist who was order wrapped up in all of the

666
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:51,424
Repeat the gate nonsense because she has some art

667
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,448
About

668
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,288
Spirit cooking event

669
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,824
Yeah they would have liked

670
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,408
Cheese that was supposed to be people's fatty tissues

671
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,712
Cranberry juice that was blood

672
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,736
And what a view

673
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:07,552
Pretend that they were eating human

674
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,832
My body's

675
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:13,952
Cooking being used as a negative because

676
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:20,352
To me like you say Spirit cooking and immediately I'm like

677
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:28,032
Alex was complaining about her and then he says this

678
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:30,336
About how she knows about her ritual

679
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,640
We know all about it

680
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,736
I know about it sweetheart

681
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,016
Every

682
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,296
Call history art

683
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,136
I've been down the rathole lady

684
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,256
Further down than

685
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,352
What

686
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,448
I think it means

687
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:01,312
Well I'm because they already know they are spiritually dead

688
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,640
Smell

689
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,176
What's that smell

690
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,456
The sound of death

691
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,784
The smell of death

692
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,952
Is he

693
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,328
Unbelievable

694
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,424
I agree it's unbelievable

695
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:33,824
But I kept that last part in there is specifically to draw a line between the singing country jams 10 years

696
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,664
Country dance now

697
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:43,552
So anyway Alex apparently has done some Satanic ritual spirit

698
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:46,112
Physically I don't know what that means

699
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,672
Spiritually dive down the rat

700
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,464
I legitimately

701
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,352
I think that's what you guys

702
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,936
Alex

703
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,704
You f******

704
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,472
Gross

705
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,240
Stuff

706
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,520
He's talking

707
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,568
Sing about children being assaulted

708
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:08,896
John dumelo

709
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:09,664
Globalist

710
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,432
Loved it

711
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,968
Judy things

712
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:18,368
Stockade

713
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:24,768
Right out the gate daily pilot podcast project is back

714
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:28,352
Head start on

715
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,656
So good

716
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,288
It is next clip

717
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,592
I've cut out the stuff where you talk

718
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,128
All that gross s***

719
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,712
Screams

720
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,992
Hillary

721
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,600
The reason I don't like him is because

722
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,648
He talked about

723
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,696
Is weird

724
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,232
Betty was just

725
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,024
Just talkin about

726
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:57,792
And I don't like him

727
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,560
Right

728
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,352
AR

729
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:09,568
I will never falter

730
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,648
You are bone

731
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,448
Cincinnati weather

732
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,544
Because we can't end not

733
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,640
Principalities

734
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,480
Places of power of the air

735
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:55,136
Asphalt

736
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:59,488
Principalities municipalities you name it

737
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,512
We're against it

738
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:05,888
Against territories

739
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,216
Little stupid

740
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,592
Psychological

741
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:17,664
You know we break the Goldwater rule but it doesn't matter cuz we're not

742
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:24,576
This guy's very obvious

743
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,344
I'm about to give up

744
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,488
I really am tired of this

745
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:38,144
I think there's something to that how long he has been doing this because

746
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,032
Anytime I've ever had a job every 2 months

747
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,824
Do I really need this s***

748
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:49,408
Any little thing happens and I'm like

749
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:52,224
Just quit like if I had his job

750
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:58,112
I'm just really tired of jobs

751
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,648
Set up

752
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,416
Pretty quickly but

753
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,208
I still love this

754
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:02,976
I'm like

755
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,000
Right

756
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,304
Today was that was like

757
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,096
Really delightful

758
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,888
In terms of doing that's good like

759
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,168
Alex is back

760
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:15,520
It's a breath of fresh air up from these stuffy Dixie's been having a blast hose

761
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:18,080
Yeah but nobody suing us into Oblivion

762
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:22,176
No. But negative

763
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,200
See there is

764
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:23,968
Like

765
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,576
It was easy for him to do the show cuz he's doing very different show

766
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,112
10 years ago 20 years ago

767
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,672
Yeah it was much easier for him back then

768
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,952
Because you wasn't

769
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,232
Operating on 5th

770
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,792
Level exactly this level you can't keep up

771
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:46,240
It'll be over it'll be long over

772
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,032
You got your

773
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:49,824
Frankly

774
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:56,479
You should have probably quit immediately after Trump got elected you should have done the whole like Michael Jordan I'm retiring at the

775
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,759
The top of my game

776
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,343
Start your start you wouldn't you're okay

777
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:06,719
Here's here's the dream on the election or something like that

778
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,047
Take complete credit for winning the election

779
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:13,119
Tires right on the top of his game

780
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:16,447
Leave it all behind

781
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,239
3 monthly almost immediately

782
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:24,639
But he starts his own podcast or some dumb s*** like that

783
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:33,343
Bill O'Reilly but without being forced out

784
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,367
His route

785
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:40,767
And play the country music and laugh over it and scream you can still talk about chimeras and what have you

786
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:43,071
Then

787
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,863
Don't go south

788
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:45,887
Because he's going

789
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,703
Then what becomes our retirement

790
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,471
Retirement

791
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:54,079

Billions

793
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:05,599
But that would have been what would have been really smart

794
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,623
For him to do

795
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,207

811
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,919
I had to leave in a little bit

812
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,455
Because of where it goes

813
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,759

That makes them feel real power

819
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,663

00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:37,055
It's so bad also in our Consultants

842
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:39,871
Seashells that we do

843
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,967

The Great

849

In terms of

850
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:01,375
I think it'd be better if we just kept throwing out different names like

851
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,191
Who's that

852
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,983
Is that

853
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:11,103
Oh oh it's the

854
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:11,871
Looney Tunes

855

Do it forever it's real good I can't believe that you work with him don't like sit him down if he likes

857
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,447
Does not like your

858
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:41,567
It's not it's not funny

859
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:44,895
Okay here's what I had to do while I was watching

860
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,479
Thought

861
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,527
This was a delightful day for

862
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:54,111
Fancy going on

863
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:57,695
Owen Shroyer sitting just off camera

864
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:00,255
Cuz he posted for the last like 3 or 4 days

865
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:04,095
He's just sitting there as Alex launches into that Bernie impression

866
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:11,775
Like a like a student watching the master

867
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,639
I never would have thought

868
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:19,711
I see the closest way he's a place

869
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,735
Cuz you can't be like

870
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,063
So

871
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,367
The closest way to his employees get to it is

872
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,927
Alex walked by an office

873
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:33,535
It's a cubicle and they'll be back and forth

874
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,839
This is what he sounds like

875
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:42,239
No no no no no

876
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,031
I'm doing the impressions

877
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:44,799
I am going

878
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:50,175
I know he would take that is like a good boy

879
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:56,063
Is really bent out of shape about

880
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:58,367
As he always is

881
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:04,767
Any

882
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,071
Fascism

883
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:10,655
Exactly because I

884
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,703
Most of the show is

885
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:14,495
I'm talking about how Tommy Robinson

886
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,543
Beat up buddy

887
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,823
Supercooling is also the victim

888
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,407
K Robinson

889
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,431
Camera people

890
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:28,831
I don't know what I'm not going to watch all this video I don't really care

891
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,111
I don't have the time

892
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,927
In the face

893
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:36,511
Engage with the reality of fistfights

894
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,815
Because whatever the case is.

895
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,095
Charming

896
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:43,423
WorldStarHipHop

897
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,215
He's

898
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:47,007
Got some thoughts about what's going to happen

899
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,543
Auntie forever

900
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,063
And

901
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:11,327
I'm going to jump on top of

902
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,359
Aruba

903
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,431
People don't ever get up

904
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,063
You guys are asking for it

905
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:39,487
Support

906
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,279
Jamshed

907
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:43,839
Okay

908
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,935
Trump says everything I say

909
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:51,007
I'm going to murder

910
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:52,543
You very

911
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:55,871
Very homo-erotic Lee murder anybody

912
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:57,151
And you know what I say

913
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:58,687
I think that could be used in court

914
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:01,247
Because like that makes it premeditated

915
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:06,367
Seem like he has massive fantasies about murdering other people

916
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:09,183
Talk to him first the plan in his head I'm going

917
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:13,023
The murder that doesn't make that justify

918
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:16,607
Murdered

919
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:23,007
Hours and hours of video of Alex Jones being out of protest and someone bumping into

920
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:23,775
Call the police

921
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,103
Egypt

922
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,895
Easy

923
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:30,687
So amazing

924
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,991
I'm going to jump up on you

925
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:35,039

926
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:41,695
I do not trust I do not trust the Integrity of your Hammy's

927
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:44,255
Who's hamstrings don't have spring in them

928
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:48,863
You know what that's the real thing that's a she was Tom Arnold

929
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,679
What you got to do

930
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,727
Challenge them to a slammed

931
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,519
Contest

932
00:51:56,543 --> 00:52:00,383
I think that be fun we'll probably isn't much better shape and Alex at this point

933
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,407
But

934
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,455
What is he even described

935
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:08,831
I heard was I'm going to f*** you

936
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:11,903
All I heard was going to jump up on you

937
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,975
With my

938
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:16,511
I put your head back

939
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,047
Mx250

940
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,095
Which is probably

941
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,119
Probably generous

942
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,655
But also

943
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:25,471
I don't I'm trying to visualize cuz I think

944
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:26,239
Maybe what he

945
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,263
He's talking about its

946
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,055
Some kind of I'm going to jump up

947
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:32,895
With like MMI knees would end up like around where your shoulders are and

948
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:35,711
I come down on you or is the person

949
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:40,319
Already laying prone and he's going to jump

950
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,343
What does that mean

951
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:47,999
Like push their head back top of their head hits the ground as they fall I don't know

952
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,023
You staying right

953
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,047
How many murder

954
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,119
But it's also

955
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:54,911
Interesting

956
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:57,215
No cuz he said he's going to jump with his

957
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:00,799
What was the

958
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:06,943
Finishing move

959
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:13,343
Probably differently I know he will call it the Infowars

960
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:16,927
Describe a tombstone different than that

961
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:19,999
A Wonderful Life

962
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:20,767
Is about talking

963
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:22,815
He's not gifted with

964
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:25,887
Survive

965
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,543
The other thing

966
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:37,407
The big the big story of the day is that Tommy Robinson

967
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,967
Oh that poor man

968
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:40,991
But

969
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:41,759
So

970
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:42,783
My heart goes out to

971
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:43,807
Absolutely

972
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,599
A dog

973
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,367
Prayer time

974
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,975
Narrative

975
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:55,327
Over the last couple days urban three bombs

976
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,351
Today

977
00:53:56,863 --> 00:54:00,191
Yes I have read that story correctly

978
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,007
It is

979
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:05,567
It is entirely

980
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:06,591
Minorities and

981
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,919
Have no

982
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:10,943
Passion twist

983
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,759
Subaru ascent

984
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:16,575
As we recorded

985
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:19,647
They don't know about it but it is all

986
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,927
Black people

987
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,999
Now I don't know if that is the motive or not

988
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:29,375
May think that that would be the motive and so now

989
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,655
He needs

990
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:32,191
Proactively

991
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:38,591
Absolve white people of this terrorist Act

992
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:39,615
General guy

993
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:40,895
Actual title

994
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,455
We don't know what the motive Behind These Maybe

995
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:48,063
We do know that both of the homes that were the recipients of these packages belong to African American

996
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:50,879
So we cannot rule out that hate crime is at the core of

997
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:53,951
So they're saying we don't know that

998
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:54,975
McKay's but

999
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:55,743
It's possible

1000
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,279
But Alex

1001
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,047
Know any

1002
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,839
Oh okay Alex

1003
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:02,399
Haven't read any stories about it

1004
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:04,447
Fresh air

1005
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:07,263
Of the fact that there have been bombs that have gone off

1006
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:10,847
Here is how he is going to absolve

1007
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:27,231
If you see a white person mug

1008
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:28,767
So you're kind of right

1009
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,047
Yep

1010
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:32,351
I'm not

1011
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:35,423
Speculating

1012
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,447
Was anti gin

1013
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:40,031
Vacation there's an article in The Huffington Post

1014
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:42,847
Application

1015
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:45,663
Organizations and people who are active

1016
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,455
Against

1017
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,991
Navigation has stopped putting up with

1018
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,783
The b******* and they're starting to fight back

1019
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,831
I want to drive businesses out of May

1020
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,367
Neighborhoods that are coming in

1021
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:57,183
Specifically to gentrify them raise the rent make

1022
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,231
Yeah places

1023
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,255
Cuz where they live

1024
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,559
Didn't read the whole article

1025
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:03,583
Pretty long

1026
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,863
And he thinks that

1027
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:05,631
B positive

1028
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:10,751
He thinks that the Huffington Post article as saying hooray for these people getting violent about

1029
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:16,127
Action causes all that is is a reporting on the fact that

1030
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:17,151
This is something that

1031
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,943
It's happening it's not

1032
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:25,087
Just like how Pro

1033
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,623
It's probably Pro in

1034
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:28,415
In terms of

1035
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:30,975
Navigation does damage

1036
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:32,255
Rich people

1037
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,791
To afford

1038
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:35,071
Rising prices

1039
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:41,471
Hey let's move these people too slow and I also even think from my reading of the article 8 Santa

1040
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:42,495
To a certain extent

1041
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,287
Tactic

1042
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,567
Because of what

1043
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,615
Come from that inheritance collection

1044
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,175
It's kind of a mixture of those things

1045
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:52,223
It's just a reportaj

1046
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,759
Positive

1047
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:56,319
And so he is now put that Bugaboo

1048
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,599
Into his

1049
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,367
His Rolodex

1050
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:01,951
Do you think that

1051
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:04,767
Also because that article stay in Austin

1052
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:06,815
It mentioned Austin in the cities

1053
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:12,959
Vacations

1054
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:17,311
2nd suspect

1055
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,687
Pretty quickly his Narrative of saying

1056
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:26,783
I don't know what it is possible

1057
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,111
Evolves very fast

1058
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:37,535
Where to go on the ground at the second bombing

1059
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:41,887
I smell a little antifreeze

1060
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:42,911
So

1061
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,191
Sounds like

1062
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:49,823
Bob's

1063
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:56,223
Old timey cartoon like a babam

1064
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:58,783
Mario

1065
00:57:59,039 --> 00:57:59,551
Obama

1066
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,319
No

1067
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:05,951
Kobe's last album

1068
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:08,767
Really

1069
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:10,815
Um no no no no

1070
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:13,631
This is a conversation that has almost

1071
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,399
Ended French

1072
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:16,447
Am I in my past

1073
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:19,519
Sitting around really high in someone's garage

1074
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:21,823
It's a babam

1075
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:28,991
I don't want to revisit this this podcast to report

1076
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:33,599
Is the universe

1077
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,903
Alex has decided

1078
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:38,207
Narrative

1079
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,487
That

1080
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:41,535
Confirmation hear from Sharon.

1081
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:44,351
Bob

1082
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:46,655
Okay alright

1083
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:52,543
He has read me articles he doesn't know anything about it

1084
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,335
So that's just rank

1085
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,103
Speculation

1086
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,919
Also

1087
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:03,295
Mike Adams shows up on the show to talk about how his YouTube channel got deleted and I don't give us

1088
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:05,087
It's boring.

1089
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:07,135
Just a note that he was on the show congratulations

1090
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,671
Mike Adams from natural news.

1091
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:09,695
Great

1092
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,975
Dude

1093
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:11,999
So now

1094
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:12,767
Access point

1095
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:13,791
Tommy Robinson

1096
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:15,839
Complaining about Muslims

1097
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:16,607
Quite a bit

1098
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:17,631
Alex

1099
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:20,191
As we know it

1100
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:20,959
A Tommy Davis

1101
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:24,287
The beginning of the show as we know Alex is like

1102
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,311
A cobra attack

1103
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,127
Gotta satisfy so Alex's

1104
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,151
Suggestion for Tommy

1105
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:35,551
Trench mouth

1106
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:38,879
To go undercover in record the Moscone weather entire operation

1107
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,463
I think that's a new shirt

1108
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,743
It's time for cobra

1109
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:47,071
What's the newest time to pray

1110
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:01,407
His real name is

1111
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:03,711
Probably

1112
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:08,575
What all of it's also possible that his name is Paul Harris

1113
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,343
What's

1114
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:10,879
It's unclear

1115
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:14,463
What is absolutely not

1116
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,487
What

1117
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:16,511
It's unclear

1118
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:22,911
A 1/4

1119
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:25,215
Steven Lennon

1120
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:27,775
I'm not convinced this is your real name

1121
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:30,847
Charging you under this name

1122
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,407
Because whatever

1123
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:38,783
Dickhole

1124
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,855
And he started this organization called the European Defense League

1125
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:42,623
The edl

1126
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:43,647
Richie

1127
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:50,047
She claims is a non-racist organization but all

1128
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,327
All of their history

1129
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:53,631
Case they're ranked

1130
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:55,423
Are filled with devout racist

1131
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:57,983
Does the drug

1132
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:00,543
Like to get involved cuz there's a lot of fight

1133
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:04,639
They have demonstrations regularly or

1134
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:08,735
2013

1135
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,527
Ironically because he

1136
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:12,831
Complained they were getting two races

1137
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:19,999
Beginning they would have demonstration

1138
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:22,815
Protests which it almost invariably deteriorate

1139
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:23,583
Into drunk fight

1140
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:29,215
Quote about them from the bedfordshire

1141
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:31,263
Police Department gentleman by the name of Mark

1142
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:37,919
We have had a series of marches were receiving damage to property would be people being assaulted

1143
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:39,199
The tack

1144
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,223
Simply can't be taller

1145
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:46,879
Hey 2011a Yorkshire concert name Rage Against Racism was attacked by edl supporters quote

1146
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:49,695
A group of around 15 people estimated to BHP

1147
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:53,023
Between 16 and 23 barged into the premises shouting and chanting

1148
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,047
Edl

1149
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:55,071
Said Kevin Berry

1150
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,607
Distant manager

1152
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:59,679
They were throwing bottles and rocks

1153
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:02,239
The police attended quickly and arrests were made

1154
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:06,335
Have a long history of just being

1155
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,871
Real drunk

1156
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:08,639
S*******

1157
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,407
To go around

1158
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,199
Towards

1159
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:12,223
Liberal

1160
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:12,991
Stop

1161
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,271
Is there a map

1162
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,319
Fat people

1163
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,855
Claim to not be race

1164
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,135
Always seemed

1165
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,159
To be the ones

1166
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:21,183
Throwing rocks

1167
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,463
Whenever

1168
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:25,791
Racist

1169
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,607
Seems to be very cool

1170
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:30,911
Consistent it seems like

1171
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,959
The same sort of thing you track with like

1172
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:35,007
Why who's mad

1173
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:42,687
People who insist they're on your side always wind up being

1174
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,479
Not on your side

1175
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:46,783
So from at least 25

1176
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:47,807
15 on Word

1177
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:51,391
Has been involved in the British chapter of an organization

1178
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,671
Call call.

1179
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,439
Pegida

1180
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,231
Small radio

1181
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:55,999
That's a dumb

1182
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,279
The German

1183
01:02:57,535 --> 01:03:03,167
Relationship

1184
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:08,031
Super possession of cocaine number of times as well as failure

1185
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:10,591
As well as failure to pay child support

1186
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,639
I'll be super again

1187
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:16,223
He's convinced that Europe is being Islamabad

1188
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:19,295
Patriotic Europeans against the islamist

1189
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:21,599
Islamization

1190
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:23,647
The Fighter

1191
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:28,767
Please create that organization to fight against Muslim immigration

1192
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:32,095
Ironically in 1998 after he was sent

1193
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:34,399
3 years in prison for burglary and Theft

1194
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:40,543
He fled Germany and became a criminal immigrant himself and settled in South Africa

1195
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:41,311
Great

1196
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,127
Gray

1197
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,663
Yeah baby

1198
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,711
That's not hypocritical at all

1199
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:51,551
So his first rally with pegita was held in Dresden

1200
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,831
Which is

1201
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:54,623
The only choice

1202
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:56,415
See he was being persecuted

1203
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:58,719
In his own country

1204
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:01,791
It is

1205
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,351
Home Country he was not welcome

1206
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,631
Many more

1207
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:08,447
He was being gone maybe unfairly discriminated

1208
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:12,543
In his mind go somewhere else

1209
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:13,567
God he was a

1210
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:18,943
Except it's really important probably hanging out with the speaker a

1211
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:23,551
I'm glad his white Nation

1212
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,367
Amen

1213
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,135
Extradited back

1214
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:35,071
His first rally for potato is held at Drive-In because he thought that city was a great example of

1215
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:35,839
Of the Islamic

1216
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,631
Haitian

1217
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,399
Yeah whatever

1218
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:44,543
Contain

1219
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,567
308 people

1220
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:48,895
Which made it a population density of .14 percent

1221
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:52,223
Real scary

1222
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:56,063
When you know everybody

1223
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:58,879
My name

1224
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:02,719
Probably not enough people in your situation

1225
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:03,487
Doobie

1226
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,255
Islamabad

1227
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,279
Pictures

1228
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:07,839
Dressed up as Hitler came to the surface a little while back

1229
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:11,423
Organization free regularly uses terms like gluten free

1230
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:14,495
Which is the Nazi word for z-line Jewish

1231
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:15,263
Press

1232
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:20,127
Many organizations have basically being

1233
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:22,175
Akita members often go on

1234
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:23,455
Quotes trolls

1235
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:26,527
Which are basically just people getting together to protest about the present

1236
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:27,551
Muslims in their City

1237
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,879
Rat it's a bad luck

1238
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:34,975
Tommy Robinson was pretty deeply involved

1239
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:40,095
It's really just be a bad drunk fight

1240
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:44,191
What's the law

1241
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:47,007
An internet conversation is over when somebody

1242
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:47,775
Vegas golden knights

1243
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:57,503
That is an issue because now everybody is it from everybody

1244
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,855
You know who came up with that rule

1245
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,391
Another

1246
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:06,207
Tommy Robinson

1247
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,767
Speeches for this

1248
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:11,839
Paquita organization and was heavily involved

1249
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,167
The point where he left his own

1250
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,959
Edl

1251
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:19,519
Curaleaf Oxford

1252
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:21,823
Nationalist organization

1253
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,359
CDL

1254
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:26,943
Get your s*** together apparently you're more racist than not

1255
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:35,391
2020 11th

1256
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:41,791
12 months of community Rehabilitation

1257
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:44,607
Not long enough death penalty

1258
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:47,935
The 10 months in prison for traveling internationally with a fake passport

1259
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:50,495
Tommy had been refused entry into the United States

1260
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,287
He is a hate agitator

1261
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:55,871
So do use his friend

1262
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:59,455
He got caught when they took fingerprints when he arrived in New York

1263
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:02,271
And he ended up having to go to prison

1264
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:08,415
Smart thing for them to do Tommy was convicted of committing mortgage fraud

1265
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,951
I was sentenced to 18 months

1266
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:14,815
In prison he conspired with others to use fraudulent information

1267
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,351
How much

1268
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:20,191
You're not welcome

1269
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:27,615
There's no limit

1270
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:32,479
How much time commenting career criminals it's a mess

1271
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:36,063
But when is a comment ever going to be like

1272
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:36,831
You're too hot

1273
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:41,439
I don't know all these

1274
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:44,767
He is super anti-muslim

1275
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,327
Muslim

1276
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,607
Message

1277
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:52,191
You're pretty fit for a Muslim

1278
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:55,775
He sent another one so I don't want to get rid of all Muslim

1279
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:57,823
Least of all pretty girls like yourself

1280
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:01,151
Both of these messages Jordan death

1281
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:03,967
We're set to 15 year-old girls alright

1282
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:08,831
I was terrified you were about to say Malala

1283
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:18,559
F****** underage girl creeping on Twitter and being like

1284
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:20,095
You're beautiful

1285
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,911
That is

1286
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:25,983
Listen

1287
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,007
I have a prejudice

1288
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:33,407
Monster like no you're so sexy I get over my big

1289
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:36,223
But only momentarily

1290
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:40,831
Only temporarily

1291
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:44,671
Viciously like it's just

1292
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:47,231
Those stupid like you have people where it's like

1293
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:48,767
Your bigotry isn't even

1294
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:50,815
Inconsistent

1295
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:54,143
Respect as a legitimate

1296
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:55,935
To even give.

1297
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:56,959
The time of day to

1298
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:59,519
He's a f****** career criminal who's playing out

1299
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:04,895
How many printed he does have a history of being a racist

1300
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:05,919
Borderline

1301
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:10,783
It's some of that probably is genuine but it's also obvious

1302
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,063
On some level

1303
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:15,903
He found that like I can make a lot of money

1304
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:16,927
Off of this

1305
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:18,463
D.l. Hughley

1306
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,255
Tons of money running this organization

1307
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:24,351
I'm sure the dues and donations and stuff that he got from fellow bigot

1308
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:30,751
Exactly

1309
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:31,519
Keys

1310
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:32,287
Using it

1311
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:35,103
Kemet got a job at the rebel media

1312
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,639
Through

1313
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:39,455
At the end of this episode

1314
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:45,087
They don't do background checks

1315
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:48,927
Oh you did a year for marijuana possession so you can't work at

1316
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:50,207
McDonald's

1317
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:52,767
Rebel media

1318
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,559
Oh man.

Really s*** is that like

1320
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:59,935
It really turned one of these propaganda

1321
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:04,799
Tight operation

1322
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:06,591
Goddamn

1323
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:09,151
At the end of this episode Alex announces that he

01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:10,687
Descending Tommy

1/2

1327
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,271
To give any salt

1328
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,551
Him saying

1329
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:17,087

But it's also Tammy Robinson

1332
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,231
Kid like

1333
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:25,535
That's why he's doing this

1334
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:28,095
Is because he gets Alex Jones said

1335
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:30,655
$20,000

1336
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:34,239
Muslims

1337
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,519
He doesn't need any money

1338
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:41,151
This is all a scam

1339
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:45,247
If you look at this dump

1340
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:47,295
Career like that's what you walk away

1341
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:49,343
From a trump Robinson can like

1342
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:54,207
Preemptively go f*** himself we don't need to wait till the end of this episode this guy Steve

1343
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,231
No.

1344
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:57,791
I always wonder

1345
01:10:59,071 --> 01:10:59,583
Who is were

1346
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:02,911
Because these

1347
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,007
These guys

1348
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,799
At the heart of all of these

1349
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:11,359
Like every in at every race

1350
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,127
This movement

1351
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:14,687
You wind up coming back to a conman a prop

1352
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:16,991
Demagogue those kind

1353
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:20,575
Really believe in any of this s***

1354
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,599
Scamming dump

1355
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:23,647
Who is worse

1356
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:30,047
To a certain extent

1357
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,583
The guy who's like

1358
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:34,911
Dude I I'm just trying to make a living to this is my Hots

1359
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:38,239
Euro

1360
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:44,383
Pull that off what is it

1361
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:49,759
At the end of the day

1362
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:54,623
Identify with the people who find

1363
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:57,695
Themselves under the sway because of my experience with the

1364
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:58,719
Evangelical Church

1365
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:01,535
But I look back on that

1366
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:02,303
I should not have

1367
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:07,167
Yeah and what have you bought because of

1368
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,983
Vulnerability alienation as a child

1369
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:12,543
Any number of things that set the fuse

1370
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:16,639
Their situation that picture of yourself in where you fall under

1371
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:21,247
The charismatic influence

1372
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:24,319
Both terrible

1373
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:26,367
Put to use Alex Jones is sort of

1374
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:29,183
Or things that you talked about

1375
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:31,231
He talks about the Judas goat

1376
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:34,303
He talks about like going back being a Judas goat

1377
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:38,143
Leads all the rest of that

1378
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:41,471
Slaughter you got the one who doesn't get killed

1379
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:43,519
Leaves everyone else

1380
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:47,103
Rifle

1381
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:49,407
Because without them

1382
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,967
I mean you just find another bigot later

1383
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:58,367
Probably not all of them

1384
01:12:58,623 --> 01:12:59,391
Abington doesn't exist

1385
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,415
Or whatever

1386
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:02,975
Okay I don't know how to

1387
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:05,279
His audience size

1388
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:07,327
Just for the sake of argument say it's 100,000

1389
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,375
Every single person named

1390
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,399
Skyler in the world

1391
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,423
Maybe

1392
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,959
Looks like it's 100,000

1393
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:13,983
People right

1394
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,519
If Tommy Robinson wasn't there

1395
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:18,847
I would say conservatively 90,000 would end up

1396
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,151
Under the sway of some other charismatic Europe

1397
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:21,919
Korean fashion

1398
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:23,967
Thousand

1399
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:24,735
Might

1400
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:25,759
Find a hobby

1401
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,039
They might find

1402
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,831
They might find like

1403
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:30,879
You know what I'm saying

1404
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:34,463
10000 people is not nothing

1405
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:40,095
Your ear argument kind of boiled down to like

1406
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:40,863
Well

1407
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,935
These people could be massive horrible race

1408
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:50,335
His biggest for they could beat you to work woodworking 10% might be

1409
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:53,407
Obviously a random number and maybe it's too high

1410
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:54,431
But there is

1411
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:56,735
A subsection of those people

1412
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:58,271
That aren't really

1413
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:00,319
Out now big

1414
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:02,623
Necessarily

1415
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:05,183
There are some people who are

1416
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:06,207
I know that that

1417
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:09,023
Well somebody preaching

1418
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:12,095
Truly believe in

1419
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:16,191
Everyone

1420
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:19,007
You can go bowling with friends

1421
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:20,031
It's like get it

1422
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:26,175
82 Somerset 10,000 100,000

1423
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:29,247
Centage of those people could find

1424
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:30,271
I healthy

1425
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:31,551
Alternative

1426
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,087
That is just as appealing

1427
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:34,623
That may be a rotary club

1428
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:35,647
I don't even know what that is

1429
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:36,927
Find

1430
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:37,695
Something

1431
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,487
You could find a bingo night

1432
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:40,511
If you're f****** really old

1433
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:44,095
You know there's something that you could singles meet-up

1434
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:49,215
Any Wright bowling league

1435
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:53,055
There's a hundred different examples where you can create a social life

1436
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:53,823
That isn't

1437
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,359
Princeton bigotry

1438
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:59,967
But I agree with the underlying premise that most people would end up finding

1439
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:02,271
Another

1440
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:05,087
But anyway

1441
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:09,439
Also weirdly enough

1442
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,231
Bigotry

1443
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:12,767
Fall pool leagues

1444
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:14,815
Entirely run by bigots

1445
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:16,863
I believe that I don't like school much

1446
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:22,495
Yep my buddy make a gift by over Hitler that's what you doing

1447
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,287
My buddy Nikki

1448
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:27,871
Back when we lived in Missouri

1449
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:33,759
Team

1450
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:35,551
Kill Bill

1451
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:37,855
I want the guys on the team was named Bill

1452
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:38,623
Three women

1453
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,391
Annabelle

1454
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:44,511
F****** a******

1455
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:48,095
He would come up

1456
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:49,119
Scream

1457
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:49,887
Depends

1458
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:53,471
Whatever the Atlanta or bowling

1459
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:58,335
Kill Bill you get really drunk and then you would come over to like table

1460
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,615
Cuz we're young dudes

1461
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:02,687
Are you just riding tell us jokes

1462
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:05,247
The only one I remember is okay

1463
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:06,271
This is this is

1464
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,807
I apologize for saying

1465
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:14,463
I don't apologize

1466
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:18,047
Why do women have

1467
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:18,815
Periods

1468
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:19,839
No I'm out

1469
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:21,119
I really like y

1470
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:23,167
Deserve

1471
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:26,239
And then you look over at the girls on his team and they're just like

1472
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:29,567
He was really good at bowling

1473
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:37,247
Anyway this is

1474
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,807
Alex Jones

1475
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:42,367
National

1476
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:45,183
What do you think might be

1477
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:48,255
Eagle

1478
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,727
They're all rich

1479
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:06,943
He's our corporate

1480
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:09,247
Time Warner

1481
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:15,647
Evil people

1482
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:17,951
Wait

1483
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:26,143
Tommy Robinson

1484
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:28,703
The next segment.

1485
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:32,287
The like I do

1486
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:34,591
Don't live in their mom's base

1487
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:36,383
They're not allowed there

1488
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:38,687
Methhead work

1489
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:42,527
Yeah until if you are still living in your parents basement

1490
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,319
You are not yet a method

1491
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,343
You're just somebody

1492
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,367
Who enjoys

1493
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:49,183
The moment you are kicked out

1494
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,207
Is when you become a

1495
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:53,279
Through

1496
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:55,839
I don't know

1497
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:56,607
How much

1498
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:59,423
Like based on my experience

1499
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:01,471
Based on my experience of looking

1500
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:03,519
Take me to Alex Jones's research methods

1501
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:05,311
Mpow

1502
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:07,615
His biography

1503
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:08,639
Full of holes like

1504
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:09,407
Swiss cheese

1505
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:11,711
I don't know if I trust him

1506
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:12,735
Use legitimate

1507
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:13,503
T.i.

1508
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:16,831
For this undercover work that he's doing

1509
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:22,207
I think he's stalking people over that just because I was like

1510
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:24,767
No you didn't hire a p i

1511
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:26,559
A friend you know

1512
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:27,327
Said

1513
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:28,607
Schedule

1514
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:30,399
Harrison Smith doing it

1515
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:34,495
What is underlings

1516
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,775
Stalking

1517
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:39,103
This isn't this yeah

1518
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:41,151
I got people committing crimes over here

1519
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:43,199
We followed you to your home

1520
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:45,247
Yeah that makes me very uncomfortable

1521
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:48,063
No I don't like that

1522
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:49,855
He's stalking us to

1523
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:50,879
I know that

1524
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:53,695
Chicago

1525
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:56,255
Following us around and we don't realize it

1526
01:18:56,511 --> 01:19:00,351
Now we're getting into Alex Jones loves paranoid

1527
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:04,447
The only way that this is why I know that the world is going to be

1528
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:07,263
The only way you and I die

1529
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:11,615
At the hands of Alex Jones fighting

1530
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,639
Top of volcano

1531
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:13,919
Of course

1532
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:17,247
That's the only the only real way that we can go down

1533
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,039
I died

1534
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:25,439
Scream yell at Alex a doctor

1535
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:28,511
That's what I imagine

1536
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,047
Think that

1537
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:33,375
Ahead of time warner we've been stopped

1538
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,143
Him

1539
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,935
It borders on dachshund

1540
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:37,471
Cuz

1541
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:39,775
Is easy to figure out who that is

1542
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,079
I don't know man

1543
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:44,127
It just makes me very uncomfortable

1544
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:45,663
Makes me very very

1545
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:46,687
Very uncomfortable

1546
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:48,991
And Alex can't prove any disease

1547
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:50,015
He's acting like an ant

1548
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:53,087
People is an actual like centralized organization

1549
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:55,391
It's not I don't trust him to

1550
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:56,415
You have infiltrated

1551
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,439
Good thing

1552
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,463
Trust him to act

1553
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:00,255
John information that he gleaned

1554
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:01,279
From infiltrating

1555
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:02,303
Inappropriately

1556
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:04,095
I don't trust him to

1557
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:08,447
That's actually a

1558
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:10,239
And interests

1559
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,007
Sting line of thought

1560
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,287
Follow.

1561
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:15,616
Play whenever we saw

1562
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:16,896
4

1563
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,688
Specifically antiques

1564
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:23,296
The idea is or or Occupy Wall Street

1565
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:27,392
If a rich person

1566
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,416
He's involved it

1567
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:29,440
Any point

1568
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:30,464
The opposite

1569
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,512
Is it side will use that to invalidate

1570
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:37,376
Even if I was like we were talking about with WhatsApp

1571
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:40,704
Who was putting on the concert with

1572
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,240
David Rothschild

1573
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:45,312
His heart is in the right place

1574
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:48,128
He's trying to do the right thing

1575
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:49,152
You have all of this

1576
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:51,968
If he is involved in

1577
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:52,736
Anyting

1578
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:55,040
Despite the fact that because of his money

1579
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:56,832
He's far more capable

1580
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:57,600
A being involved

1581
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:59,136
Anythink

1582
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:01,952
Invalidate

1583
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:02,720
Everything

1584
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:03,488
For everybody

1585
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:10,400
One of the one of the central struggles of an antifa or the like is

1586
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:12,960
The ideas that from the outside

1587
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:14,496
Lack of pee

1588
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,056
Means you are worthless

1589
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:20,896
Yeah over, and I don't

1590
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:25,504
I don't think

1591
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:28,576
Is when we like on our last episode

1592
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:29,600
2008 stuff

1593
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,416
To what extent

1594
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:33,440
Describing relevant

1595
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:35,744
To the idea that

1596
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:36,768
You know all of these

1597
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:37,792
People who work

1598
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:39,840
For Coke funded

1599
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:42,144
Rebuilding

1600
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,424
These narratives

1601
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:44,704
And stuff like that

1602
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:46,240
I think it's differ

1603
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:48,288
But I'm not entirely sure how dark

1604
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,056
Circulate why

1605
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:50,336
But I do think it's

1606
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,640
David Rothschild being

1607
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:53,408
Involved

1608
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:54,688
Charitable

1609
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:55,712
Yeah

1610
01:21:56,224 --> 01:22:02,368
I don't know I don't know it's really complicated but I agree that it's a problem for both sides

1611
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:04,416
It's far more problem

1612
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:05,696
For people who are

1613
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:07,232
Because

1614
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,000
If you are

1615
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:08,768
Correct

1616
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,304
If it well Prince

1617
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,072
Antifa

1618
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,096
If you just

1619
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:13,376
Toilet down to

1620
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,912
We're against fascism

1621
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:16,192
You are correct

1622
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,216
Yeah right

1623
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:19,008
And if you are right you are

1624
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:22,080
Far more easily chipped away at

1625
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:23,360
Because

1626
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:26,432
There's no kind of amorphous ability to

1627
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,712
You know.

1628
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:30,272
Do you have it

1629
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:32,576
But you're right

1630
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:34,624
With the

1631
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:37,696
Conservative movements like the tea party or whatever

1632
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:38,464
Because they don't

1633
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,744
Actually believe any

1634
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:43,328
Then you can say oh well your ideology is

1635
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:44,864
I just like

1636
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:51,008
Why are you saying ideology

1637
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:52,800
I'm so

1638
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:54,080
The only thing that

1639
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:57,152
Being other people's impurity for is

1640
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,296
Priority

1641
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:06,112
Yeah I don't know it's really complicated

1642
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:08,416
I hope this is a line of thought

1643
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,184
The Weeknd

1644
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:11,232
Continue keeping our hearts

1645
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,512
As we go along

1646
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:13,536
And look at

1647
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:14,816
Cuz we're going

1648
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:16,608
Continue doing the

1649
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:17,376
2008

1650
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:18,400
The beginning of

1651
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:20,960
Life has that

1652
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:21,728
That line

1653
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,520
To self criticize

1654
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:24,544
To certain extent

1655
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:26,592
Look it back onto

1656
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:28,896
Because I don't think we're going to resolve this

1657
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:33,760
Polite way of saying Jordan

1658
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:34,784
Please don't bring this up

1659
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:36,320
No it's not

1660
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:39,136
I would cut you off work earlier

1661
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:42,464
I'm so just next clip Alex

1662
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,232
Evolve

1663
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:44,768
Yes. About the author

1664
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:46,816
Austin bombing

1665
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,352
Very trouble

1666
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:53,984
Tommy Robinson

1667
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:00,128
Just living Peyton

1668
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,688
Tommy Robinson down about 8 years ago

1669
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:05,504
England

1670
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:11,904
Was from England

1671
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:17,280
Create

1672
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:20,608
He's a great Patriot he's not talking about patriotism

1673
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:21,888
Being something related

1674
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:22,912
To love of country

1675
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:24,704
He's talking about

1676
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:25,472
In F

1677
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:26,752
Nick identity

1678
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:29,056
You would call it the West

1679
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:30,080
Or whatever

1680
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:31,616
But the fact that Alex Jones

1681
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:32,384
Thinx

1682
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:35,968
The Tommy Robinson is one of the greatest living Patriot

1683
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:42,112
Swears allegiance to is not the United States

1684
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,392
It is white

1685
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:44,160
It's white

1686
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:45,696
That is what's more important

1687
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:47,488
Dangerous

1688
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,048
Until

1689
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:51,840
But he keeps saying the Tommy Robinson

1690
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:53,120
Great

1691
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:54,144
Strangely enough

1692
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:55,680
Is

1693
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:57,216
You could describe

1694
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:58,752
As a

1695
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,544
Global collections

1696
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:03,872
Trying to run everything

1697
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:04,640
With its

1698
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:07,968
I think he's

1699
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:08,992
Global

1700
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:10,528
BoBoiBoy

1701
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:11,808
Anyway look infected

1702
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,680
Wait until all the information

1703
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:35,360
Himself into it it's probably probably

1704
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:44,320
Did you a sweep of other houses

1705
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:45,856
So he's

1706
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:49,184
I think he's figured out that rolls off the tongue, bombing

1707
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:50,976
So

1708
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:54,304
Towards the end

1709
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,656
Turns red in Ark

1710
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:01,216
No one someone read an article

1711
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:03,264
And got the information to Alec

1712
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,312
Have been Africa

1713
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:09,920
Oh no I didn't know if you didn't know and all I said was

1714
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:11,200
I feel like that would be

1715
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:12,224
Far less effective

1716
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:16,320
Offensive been what he is about to

1717
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:19,904
Information

1718
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,184
You get to see him trying

1719
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:24,000
Process

1720
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:26,560
Gators breakdown smoke

1721
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:28,352
Steam come out of his ears

1722
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:33,216
By the way

1723
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:38,080
It's a white supremacist meditation

1724
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:47,296
Mexican Mafia

1725
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:56,000
Oceanaire

1726
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:05,984
I have no idea what's going on here

1727
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:09,056
I wish you'd say that more often

1728
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:11,616
There and then

1729
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:15,456
Wildly disparate and ridiculous example

1730
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:16,480
Exactly

1731
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:18,272
Or perhaps

1732
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:19,552
Stop giving

1733
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:21,856
Most likely example First Billing

1734
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:26,720
Probably cuz they hate black

1735
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:29,024
Even though historically

1736
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,584
I have no idea what's going on

1737
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,888
Ifucking family crest

1738
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:37,984
He gets there eventually

1739
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,264
Kind of nice

1740
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,336
It is so stupid

1741
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:47,712
It's so irresponsible pictures all of these possible ideas

1742
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:49,248
Might be going on with it

1743
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:51,552
Is John an entire show

1744
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:52,320
It's been ranked

1745
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:53,856
Speculation

1746
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:54,880
It's callmehbob

1747
01:27:55,136 --> 01:28:01,280
Over the course of it like it's just a family crest? Over its

1748
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,376
You know you

1749
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,936
I have

1750
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:08,704
Trump

1751
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:09,472
Jumpman

1752
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:10,752
Been very anti

1753
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:13,312
The conversation about fake news

1754
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,896
The idea of like what

1755
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:17,920
Can be thrown back in

1756
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:20,992
Conversation at all

1757
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:22,272
What this is

1758
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,064
Is bad word

1759
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:25,856
It's not even like

1760
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:29,184
This isn't about him saying something that's fake

1761
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:33,024
In terms of I think this is a commie bombing

1762
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,304
Slime decorations

1763
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,608
Editorializing or whatever

1764
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,144
But the fact

1765
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:41,984
It creates narrative that he's pushing throughout the show

1766
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:50,176
He could have looked into be like I don't I don't know what's going on

1767
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:52,992
Invalidating

1768
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:59,392
Tomorrow

1769
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:00,672
Bad work

1770
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:05,280
It's someone who's not good at their job why you left their job

1771
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:16,544
Great job well I mean fake news has ultimately just a euphemism for allies

1772
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,336
So that the media doesn't have to

1773
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:19,104
To say

1774
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,128
They're lying

1775
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,944
Brightly because that's a full pot

1776
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:26,784
So this is your right this isn't fake news this is just

1777
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:28,320
A guy who's like

1778
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:31,648
Interested in this story

1779
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:32,672
Heck yeah

1780
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:34,208
Is a hack

1781
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:39,584
And then we'll start the damage later

1782
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:43,936
Brings us to the end of our show

1783
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:44,704
Some interest

1784
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:45,472
Sing times

1785
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:50,336
I believe welcome back Alex I wanted to get the Welcome Back Kotter theme song

1786
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:52,128
Cute up for you but

1787
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:54,688
Also dreams are not your

1788
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:55,712
Take it out

1789
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:56,736
Prison

1790
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:59,552
And if you're not going to prison

1791
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:00,832
You're going to be

1792
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,672
The rest of your cruise

1793
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:08,768
Talking to you

1794
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:12,608
I would not I don't care I will talk to you once you're in prison

1795
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:17,984
Cuz he might jump up with his memes

1796
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:24,384
Do not get up from that

1797
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,200
So I don't know man

1798
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:30,272
This is sad the present is still

1799
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:33,600
Incredibly sad it's getting sadder with the idea that he's going to

1800
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:35,392
Fire

1801
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:36,672
Tommy Robinson

1802
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:37,696
Nae

1803
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:41,280
Steven Lennon or possibly Paul Harris

1804
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:45,120
How much time is left

1805
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:46,912
It's been years

1806
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:54,592
Like

1807
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,384
Community service

1808
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,152
Doesn't really

1809
01:30:57,408 --> 01:31:00,224
Lee County arrest

1810
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:05,600
In 22005 I couldn't find my

1811
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:10,720
Rite Aid off on like

1812
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:12,768
Something like that

1813
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:14,816
Sure he could have gotten away with

1814
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:16,608
Some sort of slap on the wrist and nose

1815
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:18,656
The only the only ones that I found

1816
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,240
Amazon where the 12-month

1817
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:23,520
Community Rehabilitation

1818
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:24,544
10 months

1819
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,336
In prison for the fake passport

1820
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:28,896
80 months in prison for the mortgage

1821
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:29,664
Broad

1822
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,968
Confirmed

1823
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:32,736
We're talking to

1824
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:35,552
Yeah you did get out early though to on the mortgage

1825
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:36,320
Fragua

1826
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:37,856
Yeah cuz of course

1827
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:40,416
It also fun son little little tidbit

1828
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:42,208
While he was in prison he had to be kept

1829
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:45,024
In solitary confinement for a lot of it for his own

1830
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:46,304
Oh that's

1831
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,328
Because you they

1832
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:50,656
Yeah I probably would have got himself

1833
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:53,472
God dammit

1834
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:56,288
Sub saving people from themselves

1835
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:57,824
Prison

1836
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:01,408
I think I think what I want episode

1837
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:04,480
I mean first of all time

1838
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:05,248
People who deserve

1839
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:07,552
No

1840
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:08,832
Not bad although it is

1841
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:15,488
First of all is our plugs we have a website called knowledge 5.com

1842
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:23,680
You can join the Facebook group tell your mother

1843
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:27,776
Go to our website knowledge

1844
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:29,312
Absolutely would appreciate it

1845
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:32,384
What I want to hop on iTunes

1846
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:35,968
Roto grater

1847
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:37,760
I think the most

1848
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:38,784
Important piece of ass

1849
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,320
Is the fact

1850
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:41,600
Did he

1851
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:44,928
Creeped on Twitter at underage girls

1852
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:47,744
With Muslim related pick-up line

1853
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,304
No it's not Muslim related

1854
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:55,424
Biggest bigotry about Islam related pickup lines

1855
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:57,216
The underage girls on Twitter

1856
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:57,984
Now

1857
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,288
Harry

1858
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:02,336
Parody account

1859
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:03,616
The other stuff

1860
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:04,384
Like

1861
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:06,432
MBM being arrested for assault

1862
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:07,456
I understand

1863
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:10,272
You're running out sucking big organization

1864
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:11,808
You might get into a skirmish

1865
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:14,368
Maybe you get picked up but it could have been anybody

1866
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,184
I don't think it's necessarily right

1867
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,232
That people have to go to prison for drugs

1868
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:21,280
So I'm going to throw that part of it out

1869
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:24,096
Bear the idea that I think you should get the death penalty

1870
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:26,656
Change my mind

1871
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:28,192
Kmol

1872
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:33,568
The ideas for using his friends

1873
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:35,616
Kind of funny

1874
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:42,016
In the sense that he was so stupid that you didn't realize that I'm going to have to go through customs

1875
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:45,344
That's insane to me and it's not something that I can be like

1876
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:48,160
I hate you for that or you're you're the worst

1877
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:49,696
Something that says

1878
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:51,232
I'm a trustworthy news

1879
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:55,584
And the mortgage fraud I mean along with this, anyways

1880
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,608
And stuff like that but

1881
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:59,168
The victims of it are back

1882
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:00,960
It's not

1883
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:03,008
I just think that one is the most

1884
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:06,336
Indicative

1885
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:11,968
Literally eight

1886
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:12,992
Creeping on people on

1887
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:16,320
Underage girls on Twitter using bigoted Muslim

1888
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:19,648
Is really the core of

1889
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:24,256
Alex Alex

1890
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:25,536
2crave

1891
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:26,816
Alex

1892
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:29,120
Rocking understand who he has on his

1893
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:31,680
You would think

1894
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:33,984
Come up

1895
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:36,032
Write anyway

1896
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:40,640
