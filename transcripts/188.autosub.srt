They celebrate National

Sponsored post on Twitter

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,280
Is National IPA day if you're an alcoholic like

5
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:36,352
Turn off

6
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,424
Start gas do we do

7
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:49,408
Too long we've been doing that.

8
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,456
Frankly since I've completely blacked out

9
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:53,504
What is the show about and why am I here

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,064
You're here because you

11
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,856
Knowledgeable

12
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:02,720
Because you startle easily

13
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,816
You are yours

14
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,632
The audience surrogate for audience

15
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:13,472
Climate change

16
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,776
I'm here because I spend way too much time looking in

17
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,544
Into an

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,568
Researching

19
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,664
Swimming in the pond that is conservative

20
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,432
Propaganda

21
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,016
That sounds like a really interests

22
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,952
The reviews are in though no one wants to review it too long

23
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,792
I assume that's life

24
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:41,888
Interesting show straight up

25
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,008
MC skat Kat

26
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,288
Ooo

27
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,128
Episode

28
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:52,896
It's going to be

29
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,664
Okay

30
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,456
But

31
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,504
Hopefully good

32
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:04,672
But I am not into this episode that I listen to today I am not into it I did not enjoy it

33
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,000
I love

34
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,448
Peterborough

35
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,008
Dude these people are mediocre

36
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,664
RV Colbert coming out I think we're going to be alright tonight

37
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432
Okay

38
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:31,296
We have a lot of people that you're really not that excited about we have built

39
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
A

40
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,392
Everybody likes

41
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,184
You don't want to exercise bikes

42
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,472
Cuz I think this gentleman is also

43
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,496
From Sweden

44
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:56,896
Based on the fact that his last name includes the windows OS with a dash through it

45
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,920
Vianney

46
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,480
Number of languages that aren't necessarily

47
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,760
American English

48
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:06,880
Very excited also because a message that included

49
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,904
You don't need to respond to

50
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,536
If people tend to respond

51
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,584
Just let him know that there's no pressure

52
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,376
That could that could help things

53
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,144
No pressure

54
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,752
I appreciate

55
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,544
Thank you so much Chris

56
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,592
I'm a policy wonk

57
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,968
If you like sports and go to our website and click the button

58
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,784
Appreciate it

59
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,648
That they can donate not on a monthly basis and I understand that's not

60
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
People would

61
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,232
Maybe

62
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:47,072
Payment is kind of

63
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
The commitments

64
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:53,216
It is something that maybe you forgot was going to be on your bank statement and if you're like us if you forget something

65
00:03:54,752 --> 00:04:00,896
Sometimes you're going to get an overdraft sometimes it can be trouble if you are exact Camp there

66
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,200
Now you can.

67
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,992
Please to send us a message

68
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,832
Or I posted it in our Facebook

69
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,624
I don't want to put it on the show cuz

70
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:12,928
Private

71
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:16,000
Email

72
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,863
Jordan today we're going to be going over the August 1st 2018 episode of The Alex Jones

73
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,143
Show

74
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
In reality

75
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:28,799
Bears in present-day the world because Alex's

76
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:34,687
He's going to court this week

77
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,967
Love people talk

78
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:40,063
I'm not supposed to know anything

79
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,879
That there's like

80
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,183
A boy that family

81
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,719
He they're going to get them

82
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,095
Trials beginning

83
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,679
If I understand correctly that the earlier this week he had

84
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,215
Emotion

85
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,311
To get this thing out of court

86
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,335
High hearing

87
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,127
Sick of going to work out

88
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,663
Did the lawyers

89
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,247
I read a bunch of articles about this and from what I can tell the lawyer's argument

90
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,551
Boil down to

91
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,831
But you remember

92
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,671
When he was last on trial

93
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:24,351
It's great that we're talking about a guy where Alex Jones

94
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,631
The last time he had

95
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,167
To present himself as

96
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,471
A performance artist in order

97
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,239
To have

98
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,031
He's on air ramp

99
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,311
Not be admissible in

100
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,103
In his child custody

101
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,431
I'm just joker nobody important

102
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,967
For his lawyers to draw that line

103
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:43,551
Because if he's not playing a character in that really is him on air

104
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
Relevant

105
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,367
Are

106
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:52,767
It's who he had to walk that really fine line of like I'm performing but

107
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,143
Incredibly fine line

108
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,935
In order to not alienate his audience

109
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,239
But at the same time not put them in the hopper where

110
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,287
His videos can be played in court

111
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:08,639
Would not go well for a Ryobi table saw

112
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,687
The new struggle in the new line.

113
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,247
But he's having to walk or his lawyers are is really

114
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,527
And it is

115
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
I think we're

116
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
Still act

117
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,671
For his audiences

118
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
Right

119
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,559
No reasonable person would believe that he's telling

120
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,119
Alright well then you do want him to play

121
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,399
Videos in court

122
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,471
Yeah that would help their case

123
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
Screaming nuts

124
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,055
Boyer's debunker

125
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,639
One of the issues

126
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,223
That is one of the main parts of the Sandy Hook families

127
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,503
Argument

128
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,367
Things like that lady

129
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,183
Partner

130
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,231
Because

131
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,511
She watched it

132
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
To be a crisis actor

133
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,119
You get them off the hook

134
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,655
For influencing her

135
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,727
Who is the crazy one

136
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,007
She's crazy cuz she believed

137
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,567
But if you make that argument

138
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,615
Then

139
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,663
You're leaving until like oh

140
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,199
No one should believe anything

141
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
Really fine line

142
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,039
And I think that's fascinating

143
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
Sing because

144
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,087
What

145
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,623
These cases

146
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,647
Intentional

147
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,695
Going to build up a body of

148
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,767
Weird lines had to walk in court

149
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,815
We already know that he has to walk the line

150
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,839
Performance in reality

151
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,519
Then then other case that

152
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,847
It's pending I believe this one also had a

153
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,127
At some point this week

154
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,735
Is the guy who was Miss identified at the park

155
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,783
Alex

156
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,575
That one is Alex

157
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
Reporters

158
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,367
Are being sued

159
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
Because they miss

160
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,207
I represented this guy

161
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
He had like an ant

162
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,815
Antifa shirt on or like a communism shirt

163
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,095
I told that use that

164
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,119
The triumph conflate

165
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
This guy with the air

166
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,447
Actual Nikolas Cruz

167
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
And

168
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,007
Do due diligence

169
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,311
Any journalistic outfit would have done it

170
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,079
Reverse image

171
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
Search that

172
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
And find out

173
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,407
It's not the same guy never report

174
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
Well

175
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,087
We accurately reported on something that was posted on 4chan

176
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,903
Which is not journalistic due

177
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:34,303
Which means that they are the ones who are at fault and in fact we were not reporting on the

178
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,655
Parkland shooter on the reporting by

179
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,447
Fortune

180
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,495
Really troubling possibility

181
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079
I think it's a really good point

182
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,615
And if that's accept

183
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,431
Any Infowars reporter could anonymously

184
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,711
We post something on 4chan

185
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,295
Thursday

186
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,087
Self creating mechanism you

187
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,391
You've established here if you allow that's

188
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,207
So what

189
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:05,279
Probably

190
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,863
I have to walk there is like a my really a journalist at all

191
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,911
Do I do I have

192
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,471
The protections of Journalism or am I just

193
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,495
The dick hole yelling

194
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,287
Is there any reason

195
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,055
Time for me to

196
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,847
Have to follow

197
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,663
Blake basic standards

198
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,943
Of what journalists

199
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
The next

200
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
He's going to have to

201
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,111
Jump over with his his lawyers

202
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:37,279
I don't know how do I get my quick-and-dirty episode

203
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,863
We can't be an Alex Jones podcast and not sort of diving

204
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,143
This a little

205
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,727
So I'm sorry

206
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:50,335
No no reasonable person would believe

207
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,639
Which protects him from the consequences

208
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,687
That no reasonable person

209
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:00,319
Would believe what he's saying because the people who believe what he saying are unreasonable and therefore are going to make

210
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,343
Any excuse to

211
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,623
Continue believing what he say

212
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,415
Start of an Ouroboros

213
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,255
And that's because the truth

214
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,559
Is unreasonable

215
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,911
Is it like he had to give up apologies

216
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,215
Hamdi ulukaya Bellefonte PA

217
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:17,983
The post

218
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,007
Videos of him

219
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,031
Apologizing

220
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,591
Like I never

221
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:27,455
Imply

222
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,831
Right

223
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:36,927
They're looking for out of

224
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,719
But I don't think at the end

225
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
I really don't

226
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,303
See how this is going to really negatively affected with a

227
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,839
The people who are already on board

228
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,119
Right because what you said

229
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
They're on reason

230
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,167
Exactly

231
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,191
Who knows

232
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:53,567
Alex Jones listeners

233
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,871
As Witnesses and just started asking him questions

234
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:00,223
Oh man anybody that no reasonable person would listen to

235
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:08,159
I don't know what that damn it I running

236
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,207
You established in court that he doesn't

237
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
Have any

238
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,767
Responsibility because

239
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,815
No reasonable person would believe him

240
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,095
Then where does that leave

241
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,143
That leaves him free to say anything you want

242
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
That's not good

243
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,007
I don't know I don't know how it's going to play out but

244
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,871
That was just defeated

245
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,431
Against

246
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,455
Against them

247
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,271
Mia kind of like a

248
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
Clearer idea of where this

249
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:40,415
Everybody's like yeah we agree they f***** you over but surprise

250
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,951
Nothing that the justice system

251
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:47,071
The justice system is inherently incapable of

252
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,119
Injustice

253
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,703
Situation and that's the real nightmare is Alex Jones goes to court

254
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,263
Against Sandy Hook families and somehow

255
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,311
Yep I in the wrong you know

256
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,103
You never want to open up that

257
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,639
Possibility as like

258
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,431
This is a potential outcome of that

259
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,991
Because then

260
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,831
Right

261
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
I could brag

262
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,743
Is if we were ever to be soon

263
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,023
Our defense lawyers with

264
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,095
No unreasonable person would listen to

265
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:27,007
Continue to call for violence

266
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,543
However

267
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:35,455
Because our show is so inherently they would all reject it

268
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,783
Well that I'm not going to actually wish violence on somebody

269
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,599
So we're a listener

270
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:47,999
Murder Jeff Bezos in his home and

271
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,815
Look at how reasonable our listeners are

272
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,607
Even if even is Alex Jones

273
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:58,239
Indian parody I know like this August 1st 2018

274
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,031
Context drop

275
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,151
And Trump is about saying you're powerful you're beautiful you're an overcomer you're amazing

276
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,455
That's so christ-like I mean

277
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,479
My my gut

278
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,503
My gut.

279
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,343
Trump is christ-like

280
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,159
I think it's more like

281
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,719
You better

282
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,303
Another one

283
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,351
Then you got to

284
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,727
From the critic

285
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:37,151
Keys Auto Care I Love It

286
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:37,919
It's great show

287
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:44,319
On August 1st

288
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,879
This is rough

289
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:50,975
Beginning of the Alex's episode

290
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,279
Spock

291
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,559
News

292
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,119
The concerted effort

293
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
The characters that's name

294
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
Job

295
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,495
And I will see where it goes

296
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,591
The morning Show's viciously lie about me

297
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,663
For 10 minutes this morning America's Newsroom

298
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,575
I guess the young ladies on the program

299
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,255
Are just absolutely living on their own planet

300
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,399
What I said

301
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,191
Actually never

302
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,215
What I do it

303
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,847
They just sit there and regurgitate the same anti-free speech

304
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,407
Garbage

305
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
The issue here is

306
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,583
In

307
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,375
Some days

308
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
Saturday

309
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
He believes

310
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,447
The Sandy Hook

311
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,007
Was real which is all good and well

312
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,127
Fight what he doesn't do is ever say I did say it was fake

313
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:16,223
You never said that and what people take issue with

314
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,759
The damage that was done

315
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,295
Cuz of his actions

316
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,575
In the past

317
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,367
They're not saying

318
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,647
Keeps saying it's fake

319
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,671
Although

320
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:30,815
He did for a really long time and just because he says no one ever plays click I wonder if we're going to play the Clippers

321
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,911
Also was Oregon a false flag

322
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,935
About there's a

323
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:40,799
There's one there's a definite to cool cool cool

324
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,127
The other issue is that clip that I take

325
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,711
Very very serious issue

326
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,503
The way he presented as like

327
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,295
I've apologized

328
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:57,695
But what he doesn't say is I apologize for what I did you said I apologize for the media lies about

329
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:04,095
Written that down I just written down for the media Rippy misrepresenting

330
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,447
Like in that video that he put out trying

331
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:14,079
To reach out to these it was all about I'm sorry that immediate hurt you

332
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,127
With lie about

333
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,663
So manipulative

334
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,223
So evil it sits next

335
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
And I don't

336
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,039
Sure

337
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,087
I think it's great

338
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,671
That he no longer gets on air and says no kids died

339
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
I think that's

340
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,719
Wonderful

341
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,279
Not good that it's a

342
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,559
The end result of

343
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,631
You should probably started there

344
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,935
Possibly

345
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,215
But it's really

346
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:45,311
It's just a Bomberman it's a real serious bomber that he refuses

347
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
To own up to

348
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
Except

349
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,383
What he was

350
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,151
Porto's

351
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
That's it

352
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
That's the conversation

353
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,479
The people are mad about

354
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,759
And the fact that he won't

355
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,783
Like it would hurt him

356
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,807
Not at all

357
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,855
To come on air and any of the times

358
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,391
He's done his fake apology

359
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,415
I'm just say

360
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
We f***** up

361
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,719
We talked up

362
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,255
You know we thought

363
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,815
We thought we saw something that we didn't see

364
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,631
We thought Anderson Cooper's nose disappear because of

365
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,911
The green screen

366
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,935
Compression error

367
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,215
It's only in one version

368
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,031
The video it doesn't happen in high-res versions

369
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,823
We we found that stuff out

370
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,591
Everything

371
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
East Mississippi

372
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:23,711
Cuz we thought Rob uncle

373
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,783
Saying that he said was investigating Sandy Hook and how we

374
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,807
Thinks it's a cover-up

375
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,343
I'll just look we f***** up

376
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,391
People suck up from time to time

377
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,415
We're sorry

378
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,695
Will do better in the future

379
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,487
That's all he ever would have had to say

380
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,767
No one would sue him

381
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,047
Be in the clear

382
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:41,119
I bet he could say that now and make this all go away

383
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
If you want

384
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,215
I don't

385
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:50,335
I don't understand I don't understand why you go and all that s***

386
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
I still don't

387
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,639
Slice it there

388
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
I don't understand what

389
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,991
People can't just accept like on that one

390
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,807
He's not a guy

391
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:05,695
It is it is a fundamental issue with

392
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
Hubris

393
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:10,559
It cannot be defeated by the person experiencing

394
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:17,471
Yeah the whole point of only used for people who can help

395
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,519
Definitely into their

396
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,079
Like it's it's what's going to happen

397
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,359
It's fascinating

398
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,407
Buddy's on his own petard

399
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,319
She's really

400
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,655
Try every channel including Fox News with Bill hemmer

401
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,727
Is up there just spewing

402
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,543
Total absolute lies about me

403
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,615
Never showing eclipse

404
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,687
Never showing in proof of what

405
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,783
Telltale sign for you

406
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,415
The fake

407
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,439
Outrage

408
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,255
Without low-res copy

409
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,095
Shaking camera

410
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:21,215
Illustration of how these drawers work

411
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,007
So

412
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:28,383
Conversation

413
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,223
Use a synthetic

414
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,503
Completely

415
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,783
What actors

416
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,367
In my view manufacture I couldn't believe it at first

417
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,023
Just shows how far

418
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,559
That they clearly

419
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
Used

420
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,887
The even ended up

421
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:54,239
Photos of kids killed in mass shootings

422
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,175
The sky is now the limit

423
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:06,015
Pieces

424
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
The b*******

425
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,063
Spitting go ahead

426
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,903
So

427
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,207
He's really comfortable with

428
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,255
That's outside the statute of limitation

429
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,303
That was in January of 2015

430
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,327
You know you can't be punished

431
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,607
So

432
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,887
Denying that he

433
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,167
He said any of these things

434
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,703
He's going to play fine

435
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,263
Lucky only be used

436
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,127
Current

437
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
Of him saying

438
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:40,319
Disrespect the lawsuit that was your big deal is that the issue is

439
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,623
There's a statute of limitations on this

440
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,415
Until all the good stuff

441
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,719
They can't use what they can

442
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,511
But they can't use it the way the

443
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:52,095
It should be they can but only if the court establishes that is

444
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,119
Statements

445
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,167
That fall within the statute of limitation

446
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,959
Illustrate

447
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,775
To say it was

448
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,359
They still can't beat like you can't

449
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,407
Looking for that clip

450
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,687
To establish a pattern

451
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,455
And I

452
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,527
I mean it's just

453
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,295
It's just b*******

454
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
I mean

455
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:17,696
You know that you said that Alex

456
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
Over and over again

457
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
It's not

458
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,768
This is

459
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,536
This is

460
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,560
What's the price

461
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,840
Steve pieczenik

462
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:32,800
Steve pieczenik has been on his show

463
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:37,920
Alex is probably like been threatened

464
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,944
I don't know look

465
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,272
Imallexx

466
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,672
Steve pieczenik

467
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:54,816
The dog house

468
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,864
So are the hurricane has

469
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,448
So that was excessive but I just wanted to

470
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,472
Well Alex

471
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,520
Complaining that other people don't play clip

472
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,056
I don't show these things

473
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,360
I know that we played those clip before

474
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,128
But

475
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,920
In case you haven't heard those episodes

476
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,968
We do that is why

477
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,528
He will never f*** with that

478
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,064
Because he can't use that argument

479
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,856
Anyway a lot of

480
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,928
This episode is him talking about Google being

481
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,952
Evil

482
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:26,560
Fair enough

483
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,376
Knock knock

484
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,912
Too much issue with that

485
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,472
But here is the clip that goes

486
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,752
Into some weird places

487
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,032
Is after he

488
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,800
Is complaining

489
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,592
Google

490
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:42,688
Shut up by

491
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,016
Supposedly

492
00:22:55,488 --> 00:23:01,632
Today

493
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,616
So that was from the video that got taken down from YouTube they want about

494
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:15,200
Write an article in the daily.

495
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,736
They said that that you would attack

496
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,504
Children

497
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,576
That wasn't about

498
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,368
The video of the guy who attacks

499
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,464
They make it clear that he is a

500
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
Attacking these

501
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,256
Trans children

502
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,888
And they don't say that he's physically attacking them or beating them up

503
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,656
He is attacking

504
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,216
He is

505
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,240
Coming at kids

506
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,520
Pretty hard

507
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
In Alex

508
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,616
If they were saying what you were saying

509
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,896
Eli's

510
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:48,992
Yeah yeah yeah

511
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,808
That's all strawman

512
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:24,576
I can go ahead and do it sir but I don't think it's smart

513
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,648
Because they'll just keep me

514
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:33,280
Profile

515
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:42,496
Trump on Alex Jones

516
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:49,664
And fully aware of the

517
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,576
Okay

518
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,856
Excessive perhaps

519
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,928
The First Amendment

520
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,048
VIP

521
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,680
Consult with CIA agents about whether or not people are going to use Alex Jones against

522
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,960
Trump in election

523
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:16,544
No f****** s*** yard

524
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,384
What is there is somebody who's worse than Trump

525
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,664
I guess maybe not worse

526
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,432
But like

527
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:26,784
Surprisingly worse than Alex Jones by a lark

528
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,088
Relative terms

529
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,112
Power I mean like

530
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:36,512
Just as a human being do I agree

531
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,096
Worse

532
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,168
Absolutely a little bit

533
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,728
Media-savvy

534
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,264
Things that are negative

535
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,408
About him into positive somehow just deciding

536
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,688
He's just going to

537
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,992
Remove all media but his own

538
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,808
This is like kind of

539
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
Angry

540
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,624
Combative

541
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,672
Whenever things are not going

542
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:09,536
Miraculously it seemed to work but he doesn't win

543
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:12,352
Somehow it's push

544
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,120
Is this weird

545
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,936
Unsatisfying

546
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,728
Like at the poker table would you like

547
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:21,568
You both have H Jack

548
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:25,408
Sike you thought you were going to win hundreds of dollars on a hand then all of a sudden

549
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,992
That's what it is

550
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:33,088
He's taking these gambles and screaming about how everyone's coming after him

551
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,904
Then he ends up in court and has to do an apology

552
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,488
And then

553
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,256
It's just

554
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,792
Deflation over over

555
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:46,400
Oh my God this is going to blow up

556
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,168
It's going to be crazy

557
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,240
Just us slowed

558
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:54,848
Of the balloon no tension release

559
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,128
So disappointing

560
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:56,896
Yeah

561
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,944
Do you know what that's a

562
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,784
It's the one he said though it has kind of made me

563
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,320
View something a little bit

564
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,648
He is not

565
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,184
What is he doing

566
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:13,280
What is he doing when he saying that if Trump needs to throw him under the bus

567
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,304
Then he's fine

568
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,864
Like like just

569
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,192
Did he believe his own bulshit on this

570
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,848
If I were to get into his head.

571
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,128
Which is sort of what I have been doing

572
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:28,896
In this whole time

573
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,712
I think what he's doing is trying to show off

574
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:38,112
A little bit I am such a loyal person throw me under the bus I understand

575
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,928
Performative

576
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:45,024
Because

577
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:51,168
F*** yeah I never have to throw that guy under the bus right

578
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,448
Yeah addicted

579
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,472
Yes

580
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,496
The short answer

581
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,776
He does believe his own bulshit

582
00:27:56,032 --> 00:28:00,384
Yeah but that's not the

583
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,760
That's not I'm good I mean that's not like that I'm the last

584
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,344
They're trying to take me down

585
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,112
It's like

586
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:13,696
Subservient in a way that I don't find acceptable from Alex

587
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:20,096
Can I don't

588
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:20,864
Where is

589
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,776
What this is why I hate modern days because Alex

590
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,568
Is

591
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,872
Tail between his legs

592
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:36,480
I will say there is a moment is coming up where

593
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,528
Alex chose a tiny bit of backbone

594
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,808
But it goes away

595
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,368
Pretty quickly

596
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,904
Pretty funny

597
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,440
It's one of the few things

598
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:48,768
Oh Nelly

599
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,120
About to

600
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,400
Google

601
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,680
How they're helping

602
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,448
China

603
00:28:56,704 --> 00:29:00,032
Read The Intercept

604
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:11,808
Play Google

605
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,344
He's like Okay so

606
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,368
China's doing all this

607
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
Evil stuff

608
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,160
And Google is helping

609
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,952
And then everybody's

610
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,256
Response is there a private company they can

611
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,048
Can do what they want

612
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,864
Extrapolate from there in a rather unfortunate way

613
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:28,192
There's a response

614
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:31,008
Google wants to go over to China

615
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:38,432
Buddhism

616
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:43,040
K w

617
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,328
You scum

618
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,936
Quotes

619
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:06,080
Another word quote

620
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,344
Did not say that Alex has Hitler can do whatever so we can report on that

621
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:20,416
The news

622
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:25,792
Has not replied for comment at time of pressing so we can't be sure

623
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,608
How to f****** up that metaphor

624
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:31,424
Because perfect

625
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:40,384
Big time also he f***** up the metaphor the simile because what it would be is like Okay so

626
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,408
Google is

627
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,200
In China who are doing horrible thing

628
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,736
It doesn't make Hitler the

629
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,552
The company equation

630
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,576
I'm people

631
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:51,136
Who helped the Nazis like George Bush

632
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,928
Is Dad

633
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,072
These people who helped the Nazis

634
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,888
Should

635
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:03,936
Reflect

636
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,752
What's Google as opposed to Heather itself

637
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,032
So it's almost like

638
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,056
Be being an English teacher

639
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:15,456
People mess up live

640
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,224
The f****** act

641
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,136
Or fail either of those they're just

642
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,416
Relative benchmark

643
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,208
Okay fair enough

644
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,584
But if you do want to say that is metaphor

645
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,400
And you start talkin about government as

646
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,448
Contractors

647
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,544
That is essentially what the weather supposed to be like

648
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:46,944
The UN OSHA

649
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,344
Good-by and instead it is acting as a private contractor

650
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:59,744
At this point in time cuz they're not really cuz they're what they're not even for-profit now.

651
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,144
To for-profit companies

652
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:11,776
Between private companies and B

653
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,616
Acting as a private contractor and their act

654
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,640
Illegally

655
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,664
Or are perhaps

656
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:20,992
Hatefully or you no propping up

657
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:25,344
God I don't I don't know how many regimes like Saudi Arabia founding weapons

658
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,904
That they're sending it to use in the fight against Yamin

659
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:34,304
And you could say that

660
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,632
Capitalism

661
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:44,032
To disregard human life and instead to f****** maximize profits over every goddamn thing out

662
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:44,800
So Alex

663
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:50,176
Why we should abolish the one thing that he says is the best

664
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,200
Ding ding ding

665
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,248
He's really dumb

666
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,040
Also pretty dumb

667
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,648
Churchill

668
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:04,512
At least 30 million people by their own parents

669
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,048
And then another

670
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,120
40 million

671
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,800
David Rockefeller

672
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,664
Rockefeller

673
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,200
Editorial praising mouth

674
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,224
What images

675
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:26,784
Why are you

676
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,136
Preachers in the first page

677
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:37,536
So go to Google

678
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,816
Don't click images

679
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:43,680
Duty version of it

680
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:52,128
So you google David Rockefeller like Alex's bike

681
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:55,200
The article

682
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:58,272
We know this is right

683
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,320
Coverage

684
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,368
You Google it it's the first thing that

685
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,392
F****** comes up

686
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,952
Drama China Traveler

687
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:11,072
It's the number one response on Google Express

688
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:16,448
Oh my God there's so many other versions of it that has been posted here on and then also a bunch of really

689
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,216
Weird

690
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,032
Was that

691
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,336
Good Auto

692
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,408
Obituaries

693
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,248
All publicity is good publicity

694
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,112
Also Alex said that it was when mad died he wrote that that article was written in 1970

695
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,416
3 MI.

696
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:42,816
Patty I know I know I know

697
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:46,400
So this might be a little patio in a sex with Alex tracer

698
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:54,080
Does he use crisis actors to demonstrate how different

699
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,640
No no it's it's

700
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,528
Kind of smells after I have watched his transformation

701
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,464
Weather forecast that anomaly

702
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,512
I believe that the shooting happen

703
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,680
Pictures later

704
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,520
It's been misrepresented what I've done

705
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,848
Lawsuits

706
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,640
I said

707
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,600
But

708
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,264
Michelle shocked

709
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,288
Prozac head

710
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,640
Who is Alex Jones

711
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,088
Quotes

712
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,952
You get your recycle

713
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,000
The anti-gun tragedy

714
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,792
Over in the media

715
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,632
I just like referring back to the clip we just play Tori said they were all actors

716
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:29,056
Pile of s***

717
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:35,712
Proving that nobody died

718
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:38,016
Who is convinced

719
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,832
Complete

720
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,624
Time

721
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:48,000
F*** you sincerely from that clip it is like

722
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,328
Think about how

723
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,888
He later said that it didn't happen

724
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,680
Which is fairly accurate

725
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,728
He did come around to that eventually

726
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,752
Maybe because

727
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,288
Getting too hot

728
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,568
That's not the

729
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,616
The issue as you pretend

730
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,640
Never did

731
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,432
That is the issue

732
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,480
If you just deal with it

733
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,248
Reality

734
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,016
You don't have

735
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:10,784
Have to lie

736
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,808
That's all that

737
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,576
Oh

738
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,136
Infuriating

739
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,696
You know what I

740
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,280
Consider this

741
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,072
If

742
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:23,840
Trump

743
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,376
Came out

744
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,400
And just was like

745
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,960
I didn't know it was happening

746
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:33,824
Talking to my family

747
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,384
I just found out that it was

748
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,664
Then you know what I'm saying

749
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,064
Sincerely sorry about that that was never my intention to collude with the Russians

750
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,624
As for these people who did it without my

751
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,696
Knowledge and said that like publicly and

752
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,976
Sincerely

753
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,072
In Alex's case there's no one but

754
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,352
Jim self

755
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,656
Like

756
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:03,008
Has the finger pointed at them from his admission if Trump were to say that he would be

757
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,312
He throwing his family under the Bucks

758
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,080
Doesn't act

759
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:06,848
Do you like any of those

760
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,384
Why don't they

761
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,432
Sure but that doesn't matter like

762
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,248
That would be an admission would work again

763
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,296
These other people that could events

764
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,320
Swept and be like

765
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:22,720
He's lying

766
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,304
Do you Game of Thrones term

767
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,584
2 Benz

768
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:31,168
The truth that's all he has to do he just has to be like

769
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,472
I know that I said these things

770
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,496
I f***** up

771
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,776
That's all you have to do

772
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:36,544
There's no

773
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,592
I don't want him to go to prison

774
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:41,664
I don't want him to

775
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:45,504
I don't want to kick I don't want any of that stuff

776
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,784
Come correct

777
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,088
I want him to be right with the con

778
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,904
Cuz you can still lie and defraud people and not

779
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,792
Like lust like this time in our Project Camelot episode

780
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:03,680
The problem is that you like we were just talking about

781
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,752
You can front

782
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,568
Pullback

783
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,360
Icarus these people fly to

784
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:15,456
I know you can't agree

785
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,064
Prison that's white Mark Richards

786
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,832
In prison

787
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,600
Greed

788
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,368
Right

789
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,672
I mean I think there's a cautionary tale for all these

790
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,696
Con man

791
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,232
Is this as old as time

792
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,000
If they studied

793
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:34,144
Pantheon of Western culture

794
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,704
They could probably help them out with that

795
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,776
You know it's almost like those were some sort of like

796
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,080
Tale about morality

797
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,872
And

798
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,152
Should user not you

799
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:48,224
Sort of like

800
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,248
Is trying to teach you

801
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,272
It's very weird

802
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:53,344
So I'm going to skip somebody clips

803
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,112
Because I think we've

804
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,136
Pretty much beat

805
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,416
The dead horse of Alex

806
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,696
Self-defense

807
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,232
It's about the Sandy Hook shooting

808
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:02,048
Like he doesn't say anything all that like

809
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,096
Because he knows he's in court

810
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,656
Gino's

811
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:11,008
So he's just doing this like

812
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,032
One word at a

813
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:17,408
Quotes to make it look like I said something that I didn't know one has any clips of me blah blah blah blah

814
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,200
It's kind of boring

815
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,504
Let's get let's get past that getting to

816
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
Just some juice

817
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:27,136
So you're complaining about being in

818
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:31,488
A couple years back

819
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,424
I was going to bring that up

820
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,960
He went to Davos right

821
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,008
Can you play Uno with Trump

822
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,800
Is weirdo ding dong

823
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,336
Going to Advocate the role of

824
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,360
World leader

825
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,152
Will help out

826
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:52,736
That was his orders take pickups

827
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,784
The slack and try and help with world

828
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:09,120
Has a very different idea.

829
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:13,984
Don't even

830
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,032
I don't want you to be part of

831
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:21,408
That's fair

832
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,176
But

833
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,968
That's not that's not where Alex is

834
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,760
Coming from

835
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,040
Because he's going out to break

836
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,320
I would say

837
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,088
This boy is

838
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:29,856
Shook

839
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:23,871
That was a sting to the end of that

840
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:38,975
You guys

841
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:41,023
Essentially Alex Jones's now

842
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,815
We need you to attack house

843
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:46,655
If they were otherwise will fire you

844
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,983
If they were to attack Alex Jones legitimately the only position

845
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,519
He's like

846
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,335
Plagiarism

847
00:42:54,591 --> 00:43:00,735
Yeah exactly it would have to be some sort of like xfr

848
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,527
Porto's

849
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,319
They could attack him on Merritt

850
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,343
Hey what's up

851
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,159
Quit being racist over there that's my job

852
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:10,463
We've claimed

853
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,743
Very weird

854
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,399
Are the people that you want the Westin

855
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,167
Trampoline

856
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,703
Alex you're very full of

857
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,471
Displacement

858
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,519
Fears and anxieties about what

859
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,311
Carlson is now

860
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,615
Done possibly a better job cuz he does

861
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,663
Yell all the time

862
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:35,295
More palatable space for your race

863
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,063
Have been

864
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:38,879
He shaved

865
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:39,903
True

866
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,695
He doesn't have a weight did Alex

867
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:46,303
No no

868
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:52,703
You know once you shave doesn't grow back

869
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,823
I'm kind of character I liked

870
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,615
Play improv games

871
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,063
She said it real quick

872
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:16,255
Anyway so we move along this next clip Alex

873
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:19,327
Coming back from break after that

874
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,887
He had some words

875
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:22,911
About

876
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,623
What's

877
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,023
Islamic

878
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,559
NFL games

879
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:58,239
Just reminders whatever.

880
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:03,359
Problems with that I think

881
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,639
Itemized

882
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,431
The first coming at the end of their life

883
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,711
Yeah yeah

884
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,479
Protective

885
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,503
Children

886
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:13,343
Bet that is absolutely it just a standard

887
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:15,647
Legal

888
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:21,535
And journalistic integrity you absolutely Under Wraps prices

889
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:22,559
Let one

890
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,887
He's golfing about the idea of like protecting childrenswear

891
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,167
Something's privacy

892
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,239
Second

893
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,519
US law

894
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,287
He's in England

895
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:36,383
I don't know why you brought that up, you ask

896
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:41,503
It doesn't means that you have First Amendment

897
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,527
Next week

898
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,575
Issue

899
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:53,023
US law brexit issue is the prison without a hearing

900
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:59,423
Because he had a suspended sentence from another time he was harassing a bunch of Muslims and the judge was like

901
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,471
Do this again we're going to put you in prison

902
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,263
We're going to let you off this time

903
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,543
But you haven't

904
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:09,151
You don't need hearing at that point

905
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,431
That's basically you broken

906
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,199
Control

907
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:14,271
You will go to prison until you getting another pyramid on that

908
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,831
You have waived your right to not be

909
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,111
Put into a cell

910
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:18,879
Fourth Amendment

911
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:19,903
Fair enough

912
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:22,975
My fourth problem is the idea that

913
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:26,303
He wasn't covering this. I mean I guess I agree with that

914
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,839
He was Rebel Rouser

915
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,287
Witches

916
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:40,383
Much like that Logan Robertson

917
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:47,295
How many gets video of it

918
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:53,695
He was doing the single version of throwing a brick at somebody window

919
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:57,023
You're the victim whenever they're mad at you

920
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:03,679
Do something like that

921
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:07,007
But even okay we're going to f*** with

922
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,591
People I meant pretend that we weren't

923
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:13,151
So it's still ridiculous like

924
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:16,991
Those are my four issues I think you beat down three of them but one stand

925
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,527
Not much I can do about that

926
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,319
16th Amendment

927
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,903
What about the booze

928
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,463
Does 18

929
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:29,791
So

930
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:33,375
Little bit of bulshit little

931
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,143
Nonsense

932
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,167
Mostly

933
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,447
You talked about China

934
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,519
Not

935
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,287
Any subs

936
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,591
He does

937
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:47,455
Did The Intercept bring up Greenwald about

938
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,247
Specifics of things you just talked about like

939
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:55,647
Of course I already knew.

940
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,951
Now has control of the entire cloud

941
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:02,559
Please bring me a

942
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,863
Sims that are pressing it

943
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,631
From

944
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:08,191
More reputable sources than him

945
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,983
He's trying to combine

946
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,007
He's passed narratives in

947
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:11,775
Newer fresh

948
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,615
He spends a lot of time on it and then

949
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,151
Screaming about the falun gong

950
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:20,991
And fair enough but why don't you ever talk about the rohingya like why

951
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:27,391
Where do you draw the line what's the what's the issue like where is political expedience

952
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,927
Care about Alex White

953
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,951
Roanoke

954
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:31,999
Buddhist

955
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:38,399
Via the following Kong folk or not necessary

956
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,703
Reason at this is just a throwaway

957
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:47,359
A lot

958
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,639
It's because of yet

959
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,407
Because the Rancho

960
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,967
You hate China and so he's right

961
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:54,015
Some victimized group in China get

962
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,295
Precedence over

963
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,575
Some Muslims were being

964
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,855
Slaughtered

965
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,879
In a country that he doesn't

966
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,815
A little bit

967
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:09,631
Your response iPhone to be

968
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:14,239
Much more direct adapt and I would say better than mine

969
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,287
Which way is your response was like

970
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:25,759
I need Kanye

971
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:33,695
That will be Google but will Center everything on its own

972
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,231
And

973
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,511
And then you said

974
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,303
Yeah course they are and I was like

975
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:42,911
Why would I ever consider that

976
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,447
Remember the true version

977
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:46,495
What Alex about germs

978
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,263
Bobby Clarke

979
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:51,103
The real version of that is that they've given the Chinese

980
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,895
Clarky's Overture

981
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:55,455
Exactly

982
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,735
Credible

983
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,039
Could be used by the government

984
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:08,255
The fact that people came out were like this is a really messed-up thing for them

985
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:14,399
Believe anytime I hear something like this

986
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,423
Incredible back in

987
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,703
Intuit

988
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:23,359
Yeah no s*** Google wants to control outfit that

989
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:28,223
I don't think that means that they're going to

990
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:29,503
Who is this

991
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,551
Version of it in China in order to

992
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,319
To get it back

993
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:35,391
No I don't think that's reasonable

994
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:39,743
Unify the world

995
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:42,047
You just get some dragon

996
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:45,887
All of the rest of the world I've been

997
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,935
Brushing backup

998
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:56,639
Oh yeah

999
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:00,735
So that's what

1000
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:07,135
What's great about that is that just hit

1001
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,695
Tonight China is that

1002
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,231
Just today

1003
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:14,303
An eighty-year-old

1004
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,839
Not activist but like

1005
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,375
F****** critic

1006
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,215
Unfortunately

1007
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,775
Make it 280 died of hearts

1008
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:24,799
Did 74

1009
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:36,063
Books became president in 2016

1010
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,695
Where are the bears that sing for joy

1011
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,583
Critic reference

1012
00:51:54,751 --> 00:52:00,895
84 year old 8-year old 8-year old was giving an interview to

1013
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,479
And was literally

1014
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,503
Arrested

1015
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,295
During the middle of the interview

1016
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:11,391
Like they actually went to his place and f****** place him under house arrest

1017
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,415
His last words

1018
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,463
To the interviewer like

1019
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:17,279
Hey I'm allowed to do this right and then it was cut off

1020
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,863
That's that's the situation that were talking about

1021
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,887
Google's

1022
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:26,495
Search results like it is it is absolutely immoral and

1023
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:28,031
Insane for them to ask

1024
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:31,359
Do this but why would we expect anything else

1025
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,663
Why in God's name would you expect

1026
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:35,455
A massive Corporation

1027
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:40,063
That is global that has no allegiance to Any Nation or anything like that

1028
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:43,391
And is purely about making profit which is what it is

1029
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,159
Supposed to do

1030
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:46,463
Why would we ever imagined

1031
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:48,767
There is no

1032
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,303
Where morality

1033
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:51,583
Your stock

1034
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,607
Yeah

1035
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,423
Why would any business really care all that much about

1036
00:52:56,191 --> 00:53:00,287
I did my best my best goes like I don't order anything from

1037
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:04,127
Like I don't want Jeff Bezos to have another f****** die

1038
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,175
Like that made

1039
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:06,943
Means anything

1040
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:12,831
More to the point what you're saying is like because of the better thing is

1041
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:16,415
They're real dirt. They're real problems

1042
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,439
Regina

1043
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,719
And the way they behave

1044
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:20,767
And stuff like that in terms of human

1045
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:22,303
Freedom in terms of

1046
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,119
The kind of world we would like everyone to be allowed to live in

1047
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:28,959
And it doesn't do service to them when Alex lies about

1048
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:31,519
Because the serious issue was under

1049
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,287
Haircut by the

1050
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:33,823
But he's like

1051
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,103
He's just bullshiting

1052
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,639
And screaming in order to make

1053
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:38,431
Make himself LOL

1054
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,967
A truth-teller or whatever

1055
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:41,503
Get out and if that's a thing

1056
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,807
It's going to play out in a played-out over

1057
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:44,575
This park

1058
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:45,855
History

1059
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,647
Like Alex Jones does a disservice

1060
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:49,695
Real serious issues by

1061
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:53,279
He pretends he's on the right side of it and lucky

1062
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:54,559
Against

1063
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,119
Kathy loves Liberty sure but that conversation

1064
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:59,167
Be much better served by people who

1065
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:01,727
Have nuanced thoughts about it

1066
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,263
Don't scream all the time

1067
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:06,591
Don't yell this is World War for America is under attack

1068
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,383
Your that's or what was

1069
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,663
Don't worry about it

1070
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,711
Probably Cold War I don't know

1071
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:17,599
There's a secret word

1072
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,391
I don't want to know

1073
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,183
I don't know what he fixes

1074
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,999
I kind of know but I can't really

1075
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:29,631
What is the general

1076
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,679
The themes World War

1077
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:38,335
It ended with Trump

1078
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,455
It's like saying that word

1079
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:48,831
Found a top 10 war broke out again

1080
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:50,879
I was I was Arbitrage

1081
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:55,999
Eloquent

1082
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,279
People who are

1083
00:54:57,535 --> 00:55:00,351
Crazy make the point that you could argue that something like

1084
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,887
Cold War weather World War

1085
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,167
That we just weren't

1086
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,703
Actively

1087
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:06,751
Is there where the surrogate War

1088
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:15,967
Make that argument Fairplay to

1089
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:17,247
We're not in World War 4

1090
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,063
Hopefully we will be soon

1091
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,879
Fingers crossed

1092
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:23,903
It's because of this

1093
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,183
What the globalist

1094
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,535
Bet

1095
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:31,071
Ion

1096
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,119
Islam

1097
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:36,703
Just because of demographic

1098
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:44,639
People get mad for that something that's now

1099
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,711
Demographically they have

1100
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:52,063
Decided to make the smoke it's just beeping. We've been sold out

1101
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:11,775
Commercial

1102
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:14,591
Relationship

1103
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:22,271
Yeah

1104
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:26,623
I thought it was I thought it was reverse missionary

1105
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:32,255
That's a bad that's bad for the weekend

1106
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:39,935
Panama Canal gave him that Canal looking for

1107
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,031
Like all of this stuff

1108
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:48,383
We we already talked about in the past episode the idea that they run all the University

1109
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,687
Chinese

1110
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:53,503
It's very sketchy on a lot of University

1111
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:55,295
Not the Run

1112
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,319
The universe

1113
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,343
Implanted running it

1114
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,135
What's going on

1115
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,975
If you look at the truth of that situation

1116
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:05,023
I wish I apologize

1117
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,047
In front of me

1118
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:08,095
We went over it before

1119
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,631
Oh yeah this is

1120
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,423
Weird

1121
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:12,703
Weird

1122
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:17,055
The reason that universities accepted is because they don't have robust Chinese

1123
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,335
Language program

1124
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:25,247
Until they accept offers them for free service to the school and they get hooked

1125
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:27,295
Into this possibly the

1126
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:30,623
You know they also have ROTC programs

1127
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,903
Nobody wants

1128
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,951
To join the f****** military but

1129
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:38,047
You know they're going to give us some f****** fun maybe we should have

1130
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:43,935
Better funded maybe we wouldn't have this issue Alex

1131
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,703
If we had

1132
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:46,751
Public University

1133
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:53,919
Since you are the most paid Evan public servants in this

1134
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:56,479
Football coaches places like that

1135
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:58,015
Wild

1136
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,111
Anytime he says demographic

1137
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,647
And then we

1138
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:06,463
Most racist thing

1139
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,743
Demographically

1140
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:09,023
We've been sold out

1141
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:14,143
Dodo

1142
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:14,911
Yep

1143
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:20,799
No

1144
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:23,615
Chinese people in Americans are akimbo

1145
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:30,783
Because that's a very terrible

1146
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:35,135
Compatible

1147
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:35,903
Something very

1148
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:44,095
Lauren Towers

1149
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:51,519
If you talk about the four quadrants is that is that it Colorado New Mexico

1150
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:55,871
Guitar equipment

1151
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:58,687
Call Giuseppe's

1152
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:02,015
White

1153
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:02,783
White

1154
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,319
White people

1155
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:09,695
Break chill out relax for a moment

1156
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:13,023
Take a drink from the hose as it was at football practice

1157
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:18,911
Taking me white people

1158
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:22,495
This is actually really fast

1159
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:23,775
I think there's another answer

1160
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,823
This later not the exact same thing

1161
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,895
Fascinating thing that Alex does

1162
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:29,663
Rhetorically

1163
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:32,735
He's describing what

1164
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:33,759
People do

1165
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,063
These claims beyond the

1166
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,087
The business end of it

1167
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:39,391
But in the clip he's asked

1168
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:41,951
Actually doing the thing he's accusing other people of doing

1169
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:45,023
This is this is remarkable like I listen to the sound like

1170
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:49,375
Set high-level Jedi f****** Judah right there

1171
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,399
Even knows he's doing it

1172
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:57,055
Oh you don't think you knows I do it muscle memory

1173
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:04,991
That just either

1174
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:08,063
Shut off everybody

1175
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:09,599
Praising

1176
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:15,231
Suck off everybody

1177
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:18,047
Warriors

1178
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:27,519
They're just mercenary follower coward what they're destroying

1179
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:30,591
Universities in Hollywood

1180
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:34,175
America's Best

1181
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:42,879
Teacher five-year-olds

1182
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:45,439
Execute you

1183
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:51,583
See see what he did there this pretty amazing that's a good gymnastic maneuver that he pulled that was

1184
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:57,983
Astonishing

1185
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:04,383
Kill people

1186
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:09,759
Every Muslim is a terrorist

1187
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:15,903
They're just trying to demonize there anyway you can just take what he said in that quick

1188
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:21,535
They hate the mother and father living

1189
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:27,935
You're demonizing your enemy as we speak and then blaming other people for demonizing their enemy

1190
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,519
War

1191
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:34,335
Now we're going to get into Newsradio what is it good for

1192
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:39,967
What is a good for I don't know when the super karate monkey death car comes to my house

1193
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,991
Absolutely nothing

1194
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:43,551
Response there supposed to be

1195
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:45,855
Say it again

1196
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:47,647
Or a game

1197
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,439
Also going with

1198
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,487
Saint but I did

1199
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,023
I'm so

1200
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:59,679
Pedophilia in Hollywood

1201
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:04,799
Great Bridge jump on you here in the middle of the episode

1202
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,079
But Alex

1203
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:08,383
He knows that he's got a

1204
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:11,967
You do not talk too much about his lawsuits and what have you got to do

1205
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:13,247
What he does best

1206
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:15,039
Which is sensationalized

1207
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,319
Real-world issues

1208
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:20,415
I didn't doing so he ends up bringing on a guest that I think

1209
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:23,743
Delete to another lawsuit I don't I don't think

1210
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:30,911
I don't see any way around like I don't think this is like I don't think what he does at the end of this episode is legal in any way

1211
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:31,935
Like I know he

1212
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:37,567
You keep practicing it by saying that like I don't know if I should have gone I don't know if I should let him say that

1213
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:39,359
She is like at least

1214
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,407
Mizuno being like

1215
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:48,831
Might be really bad I don't know what the definition of hubris is or whether or not I am flying to close

1216
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:52,159
Frank

1217
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:55,999
Like isn't it double jeopardy where you can only be sued one time

1218
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:59,839
Like you only get one lawsuit against you and your entire life

1219
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:04,447
We get into it here and then even the topic for a bit and then get back to

1220
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,983
This is where I kind of start

1221
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:09,055
Do you want to brag a bit about his in-depth knowledge

1222
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:09,823
Hollywood

1223
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,687
You got a screw

1224
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,223
And

1225
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:25,695
Hollywood

1226
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:33,631
Yeah let's party so cool

1227
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:38,495
Germany

1228
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:44,127
I want to get out of here for the kids

1229
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:46,175
Rustico

1230
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,247
K

1231
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:50,527
And then

1232
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,303
What

1233
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:08,447
What restaurants are here

1234
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:11,519
You don't know

1235
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:16,383
The back room of the restaurant is very clearly

1236
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:20,223
To puke like anybody who listens to his show and believes his world

1237
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:26,111
The backroom

1238
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:28,415
Birthday parties

1239
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:30,975
Stuff like that there was something

1240
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:32,767
The backroom restaurant

1241
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:36,351
Well he may not be talkin about that that is what is evoked

1242
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,375
In the mind of the listener

1243
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:43,775
Now what he's describing their as a Hollywood A-list party that he's been to that story three times on this episode

1244
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:48,383
Does not give any more details than what you just said there and I would argue

1245
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:51,711
More accurately represents

1246
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:55,295
Planes that that one dude and drop run

1247
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,111
Cofc

1248
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,159
Guy wanting Alex

1249
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:02,207
Leave a party

1250
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:06,559
If I have to play Occam's razor games

1251
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:10,399
I'm going to save it no one is going to go to Alex and be like

1252
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:12,959
Hey there's going to be some kids showing up at this party

1253
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:17,055
Unless they want him to leave cuz he's bombing everybody out of the f****** party

1254
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:20,127
Everybody have a good time

1255
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,431
Building 7

1256
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,455
We got to get him out of

1257
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:27,039
Right so and we can't confront him

1258
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:33,439
Turn your head to the ground

1259
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,487
Rabbit turn off

1260
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,535
Because that Goblin mode

1261
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:38,815
Heatwave

1262
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:45,215
Then he's not called about drugs on this episode

1263
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:46,239
Golden Goblet

1264
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:50,079
He watches a lot of movies for somebody who hates all the

1265
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,359
Yeah yeah for sure

1266
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:55,199
Lord of the Rings

1267
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:58,015
Goblins

1268
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:04,415
Until you're in a coma

1269
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:06,975
Analog of

1270
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:08,767
The dwarves they live underground in

1271
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:09,535
Mountains in Bell

1272
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:12,351
Goblin Hobgoblin

1273
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:14,655
They're generally just considered like

1274
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:15,679
Weirder people

1275
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,703
This weather got the hob

1276
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:21,055
Exactly

1277
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:23,871
VIP Auto Care

1278
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:24,639
This line

1279
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:30,271
I'm sorry I'm sorry that I don't really have a lot of fun

1280
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:37,695
Another episode

1281
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:42,815
That's better that clip is foreshadowing

1282
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:43,583
For things to come

1283
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:48,447
Possibly run spray of the law

1284
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:50,239
Yeah

1285
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,543
Play a little bit more self-defense

1286
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:55,359
Recently we didn't cover the song episode

1287
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:58,175
You know it's all you can find it on right wing watch

1288
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,711
Media Matters all them covered

1289
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:01,503
Alex

1290
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:04,063
And I did some finger

1291
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:10,207
I was threatening Robert Mueller a little bit

1292
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:19,423
If you really care about that go back to the clip that we posted where Larry Nichols a literally threatened to blackmail him

1293
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:24,543
Exactly literal illegal

1294
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,335
Just use metaphors

1295
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,919
He's got a he's got to talk about that a little bit

1296
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:30,687
But he's got a

1297
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:31,967
Explain himself

1298
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:33,503
Ends up doing

1299
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,039
It's crazy

1300
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,575
This is so weird

1301
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:38,111
Cuz he takes you inside

1302
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:38,879
His mind

1303
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:45,279
Who's doing when he said those things I would like to know what he's doing is very

1304
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,047
Very weird

1305
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:52,191
Finish criticism Tucker Carlson hours cuz they said well Allison perfect the one that's out of context

1306
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:59,103
Get oh my God the stuff you know

1307
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,431
One thing

1308
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,967
Belmar

1309
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:08,063
He's a blowhard douche

1310
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:13,695
You give him a little bit of a path

1311
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:18,559
Not not that he deserves much of one literally

1312
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:20,607
Write using an attempt

1313
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:21,631
Cuz he's

1314
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:23,679
Anyway

1315
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:29,567
Like it would be like if you had your your cernovich

1316
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:34,175
Right-wing blow up every go through

1317
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:37,759
There's a reason we never talked about like Nick DiPaolo on the show

1318
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,551
Or something like that

1319
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:43,135
Yeah you can meet

1320
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:54,399
There's a lot of not a number of like right-wing leaning

1321
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:58,751
Comedians is no reason to ever like look at what they're doing that

1322
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:03,103
Cuz most of the time they're trying to be funny and they say things that are f****** awful

1323
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,407
Do you know that there's an attempt at humor there

1324
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,687
The same way that like

1325
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:10,015
I don't like Bill Maher I don't think anyone I know who's on the left

1326
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,551
Likes Bill Maher

1327
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,343
He's a s******* yeah but he's

1328
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,879
Trying to be funny llama

1329
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:17,183
Islamophobic master

1330
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,487
Problem

1331
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,279
You know

1332
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:25,887
Did the statements he makes about wanting depopulation so there's less traffic

1333
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,423
That's just a hockey joke

1334
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:32,031
Populate the world

1335
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:36,127
If you take that literally

1336
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,407
It's a month

1337
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:40,735
20 years ago

1338
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:42,527
Different delivery

1339
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:53,279
Politically

1340
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,983
There's a reason that it might want to

1341
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:04,799
What's a victim first

1342
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,359
The worst

1343
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:09,663
Ignore survive

1344
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:13,503
It's not good because

1345
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:19,903
He would turn into a victim strong

1346
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,183
Really want to kill him

1347
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,487
To kill him

1348
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:25,535
It's not worth it for me

1349
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:28,607
But the other thing is the reason that is brain comes up with victim

1350
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,631
Before

1351
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,655
Is because that's what he

1352
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:31,423
Teacher

1353
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:34,239
He cherishes his victim status

1354
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,519
Artificial

1355
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,311
That's why he's mine

1356
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,383
He doesn't

1357
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:48,831
Offensive offensive

1358
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:58,559
Spontaneous

1359
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:02,655
At first sight

1360
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:07,775
Passaic trials breaking Constitution

1361
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:13,919
So crazy

1362
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:17,247
Express

1363
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:21,599
13 year old

1364
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:27,487
XX Islands

1365
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:29,023
Witsec

1366
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,559
Witsec sheets

1367
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:31,839
Got a sexy

1368
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,655
The Iron Sheik

1369
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:36,703
Say that five times fast

1370
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,751
I prefer sex boat

1371
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:45,407
A great song by a rapper friend of mine named

1372
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:47,199
Remember that were Fred Smoot

1373
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:08,447
Define confirm

1374
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:15,615
That's crazy

1375
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:21,759
Music

1376
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:37,119
He's pretending that in his head what I did is I made up this bit on the spot although I had

1377
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:47,871
X wrote the blinds for the battle rap ahead of time I came up with it

1378
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:52,479
It's fun that he's trying to deconstruct his mental process

1379
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,503
Which I think is ludicrous

1380
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:57,343
Clearly lying about what people are

1381
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,111
Complain

1382
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:03,999
He gets to the meat of it

1383
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:04,767
Which is

1384
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,559
My story got out

1385
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,863
Because I yelled about all that stuff

1386
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,655
They covered it

1387
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,679
Because of that

1388
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:18,335
And so whatever fictitious narrative I was trying to push got so much more traction because you all covered it

1389
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:22,943
And why should why does anybody speaking care

1390
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:29,343
Right that's why the president f****** said I hope Second Amendment

1391
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:30,623
People take care of Hillary

1392
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:33,439
It's the same s*** he threatened violence

1393
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:36,767
Why would anybody give a s*** now it's Alex Jones

1394
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:39,839
Yeah why didn't you give a s*** of Alex Jones

1395
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:42,399
The president f****** doesn't on a daily basis

1396
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:47,007
Sarah Huckabee Sanders wouldn't even say that the Press wasn't the enemy of the

1397
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:48,287
Free world or whatever

1398
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:50,847
Gives a s***

1399
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:54,175
Kids giving up their games

1400
01:13:54,687 --> 01:14:00,831
His violent rhetoric or all of that other b******* I give up the item on pissed off

1401
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:05,695
But the fact that he throws around exactly what you just said

1402
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:07,743
Because of that

1403
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,279
They gave me more coverage

1404
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:12,351
He's allowed to say exactly why

1405
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:15,679
And nobody's covering that but he says the ship

1406
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:23,871
I wish people I wish the people with larger platforms with people who are

1407
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:25,919
Supposed to be the public

1408
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:30,271
Watch Dogs would understand a little bit better

1409
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:31,807
Cookie

1410
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:34,879
Great know it's like anybody

1411
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:41,023
Kind of two loose-lipped will ever like just say I

1412
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:44,607
I mean does it all the time if you just pay attention instead of just going through

1413
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:45,631
Like the

1414
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:48,191
The Chosen clip outrage

1415
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:52,287
You stepped into my trap

1416
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:58,431
Yeah I don't know yet we did cuz the other options

1417
01:14:58,687 --> 01:14:59,455
Do a we do

1418
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:03,551
And right when watching me matter that way more traction

1419
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,575
Tristan that now

1420
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:08,927
I mean I think it would be interesting to see an article

1421
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:10,975
Alex Jones

1422
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:17,375
Explains right-wing media whatever it is I want as long as I make a stew

1423
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:19,679
Stupid dumb thread and then people paid

1424
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:21,727
I only have

1425
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,775
X amount of

1426
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:26,847
Can go on

1427
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:31,711
Name two putting out the thing that I want

1428
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:34,527
To put out which is Robert Mueller

1429
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:37,855
Was involved with the Lolita Express in Jeffrey Epstein

1430
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:41,183
People have sex with kids

1431
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:45,023
Yep you accidentally. Accidentally

1432
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:47,071
Put that message out into the world

1433
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:49,631
Through your coverage of his sensation

1434
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:50,655
No fake stuff which is

1435
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:55,775
I'm going to have a political Showdown with them

1436
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:57,823
In terms of like the times that he breaks down

1437
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:59,615
And I actually think that there is

1438
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:01,919
This might be a tiny bit

1439
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,199
True

1440
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:06,527
On and on his own like that he's doing that intentionally

1441
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,807
And part of it is saving

1442
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,855
Cuz I don't think if you watch

1443
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,135
Like a times that

1444
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:12,927
Said that he was doing this

1445
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:14,975
In the past a lot of times you can just be like

1446
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:16,767
Outer unhinge

1447
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:19,839
His face is not thinking at all

1448
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:22,143
Like almost spitting from his mouth in

1449
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,167
Red

1450
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,703
So I don't think

1451
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:26,495
Uno

1452
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:29,055
This possibility is much better actor than

1453
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:31,103
I don't know

1454
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:33,919
Play I don't know if he's a much better actor

1455
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:36,735
I think you're good

1456
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:41,855
Stanislavski

1457
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:46,719
He went to

1458
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:48,767
Victim instead of murder for a reason

1459
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:50,303
Is relevant

1460
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:51,583
Next clip

1461
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:58,751
Most

1462
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:04,639
Most persecuted radio / TV Transmission in the world friends

1463
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:08,991
Vitalize by friends

1464
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:16,415
So I mean all you hear there is coming back from break and wearing your faults victimhood like a bag

1465
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:20,255
The idea that people supposedly lie about it but active

1466
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:22,303
Thinks he's persecuted

1467
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,327
Is what gives

1468
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:25,119
Invalidity in his own mind

1469
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:27,423
And what he projects on to the mind of his listeners

1470
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:30,495
Idea of claiming the space of victimhood

1471
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,519
So f****** important

1472
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:33,311
Without ever

1473
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:36,383
You know really

1474
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:37,663
Playing that

1475
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:38,943
Hard

1476
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:42,783
In his world

1477
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:44,575
It's so weak to be a victim

1478
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:47,903
That you can never be like where the victim of all this stuff

1479
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:49,695
But you have to say everything but

1480
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:53,023
The only way it works for

1481
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:57,119
You're the victim

1482
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,911
Simply because everybody else is

1483
01:17:59,167 --> 01:17:59,679
So weak

1484
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:03,775
Everybody else is so much weaker than you they feel like they have to like

1485
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:05,055
Gang up on you

1486
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,079
When you're even

1487
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:10,431
Even then you're so much stronger than them you can survive being the victim

1488
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:12,223
But only because you're such a

1489
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:16,319
But there is a

1490
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:18,623
Absolutely

1491
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:22,207
Continue to exist

1492
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:24,511
So earlier

1493
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:29,119
We had that clip route to talk about the globalist

1494
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,911
Islamic

1495
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:34,495
Like how it's that sounds kind of races

1496
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,263
Besides

1497
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:36,287
To take it to the edge

1498
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:37,055
Degree

1499
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:38,079
In this next clip

1500
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:44,223
Hibachi like

1501
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:50,879
To go to get away from all the sectarian Wars and year of the rest of it

1502
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:14,943
Megalodon

1503
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:16,479
Handsome

1504
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:19,807
Seems to me like there's a small chance

1505
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:26,207
Might now want to get into traditionally white Protestant countries is that those countries

1506
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:31,071
Centuries

1507
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:35,423
Sweetly decimating and strip mining the other countries

1508
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,959
Prophet

1509
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:39,519
Maybe that's the reason

1510
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:43,359
What countries are now in the position of being it in

1511
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:45,919
More comfortable better

1512
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:49,759
Then countries in sub-Saharan Africa and in South America

1513
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:50,783
I don't know

1514
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:51,807
Maybe

1515
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:54,879
Is you know what was

1516
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:59,487
Interesting to me is that the people who wanted most to get into white products

1517
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:01,791
Really

1518
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:03,327
Wanted to get in those countries

1519
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,607
Is before the white

1520
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:06,143
Took it away from them

1521
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,703
You know like the Native Americans

1522
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:09,727
The First Nation

1523
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:16,640
Really wanted to get into that white Protestant country of North America

1524
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,688
Independent man somebody stole it

1525
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:24,576
It was weird just f****** murdered all of them and stole it and now somehow they're like

1526
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:27,392
You only want it back

1527
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:29,952
Because we stole it the first time Dan

1528
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:30,976
You just triggered

1529
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:33,536
Like a thought that I'm embarrassed

1530
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:34,560
We have not brought up

1531
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:35,328
What's up

1532
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,936
Alex always talks about how the Muslims are so evil because of

1533
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:40,960
The Crusades

1534
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:41,984
And like them

1535
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:43,520
Spilling into

1536
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:44,800
To Europe in Conquest

1537
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:47,360
Extensible Academy like 700

1538
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,920
What happened with you

1539
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:52,480
Western people coming to America

1540
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:53,760
I don't know what you talk about

1541
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:55,040
I've never really

1542
01:20:55,296 --> 01:21:00,160
Cuz I was too busy like

1543
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,440
You're looking at you like

1544
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:08,608
Nature of things in Europe around that time

1545
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,912
Zeinab lines of demarcation everywhere

1546
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:13,472
Every five years or so and they weren't really even

1547
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:17,312
Lot of places were city-states that point

1548
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:19,360
There's no real combined.

1549
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:20,384
Like Italy or

1550
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:24,736
And I never even put the pieces together of like

1551
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:26,528
Best example of this

1552
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:28,064
It was really but white people

1553
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:32,928
Exact

1554
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:33,952
Thank

1555
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:37,280
But everyone wants to give away prizes

1556
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,840
Can't take that away from our

1557
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:43,168
Really wish history hadn't

1558
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:45,472
Well history

1559
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:50,336
It seems like his like in defiance of reality

1560
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:52,384
Not true

1561
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:56,736
For real like have we considered that we might be the only people that are

1562
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:58,528
Not of this planet

1563
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:00,576
No I mean physiologic

1564
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,160
I don't know

1565
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:08,256
Evil gland do we have

1566
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:11,584
Is the pineal gland also Evil 4

1567
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:15,168
See the problem the line that your walk

1568
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:18,240
Now is that you're going to end up a demon

1569
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:19,264
Before too long

1570
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:25,664
Territory is Alex

1571
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:30,272
People need to be banished from this Earth until

1572
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:34,880
And then maybe we'll find out it was good or a bad idea but I think you got a

1573
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:35,648
Do stuff

1574
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:36,672
First

1575
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:39,232
It's better to ask forgiveness

1576
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,512
From

1577
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:42,048
People that you jettisoned into space

1578
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:43,840
Senators asked for permission

1579
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:51,264
You I would fit right in with that New York Times that lady

1580
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:56,128
But the right-wing is all fake mad I go to bed

1581
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:59,968
F****** piss your pants somewhere else degree diaper

1582
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:04,832
Yoga Fest

1583
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:05,856
Go home

1584
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:07,648
There are no Heroes here

1585
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:10,208
Home history

1586
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:13,280
I only say this because they're fairly close to my lady

1587
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:20,192
I do have to respect a group

1588
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:21,728
Built around the idea

1589
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:22,496
Just leaving

1590
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:29,408
What's the most part and they're also built around the idea like the Amish and Mennonite my family come through released

1591
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,224
From Mennonite

1592
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,504
Andy

1593
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:35,808
Anabaptist

1594
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:36,576
Tradition

1595
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:39,136
Their whole idea was that you don't baptize children

1596
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:40,160
Because they don't have a choice in

1597
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:42,464
Accepting Jesus or not

1598
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:46,816
What disagree in Europe

1599
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:50,912
In Western tradition

1600
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:52,704
Because of the church

1601
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:56,544
Adult baptism was illegal you had to baptize every baby

1602
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,616
He died you know before they're in adults

1603
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:02,176
Adult baptism

1604
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:04,224
Yes absolutely

1605
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,808
So at the time because they refused to baptize children

1606
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:12,160
They were slaughtered and run out of countries and that's why

1607
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:13,952
The that the Mennonites

1608
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:14,976
The Amish

1609
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:16,512
I ended up being

1610
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:18,304
Victimized class

1611
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:22,144
They were killed all over the place they became nomadic people throughout Europe

1612
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,704
And a lot of them ended up coming to America and settling

1613
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:28,032
There's a bunch of like hotbeds of

1614
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:28,800
Amish men

1615
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:29,824
Memories

1616
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,384
My grandpa was actually a Mennonite

1617
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,408
Preacher

1618
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,248
Southern Cal

1619
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:38,784
California City California

1620
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:42,624
Fresno California

1621
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,392
Before that

1622
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:45,952
But

1623
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:48,512
There's an interesting history to the

1624
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:50,048
The anabaptist tradition

1625
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:55,680
I did not I knew though I knew the history of the Pennsylvania Dutch and the lakebed

1626
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:58,752
Did not know that the Baptist

1627
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:05,920
Mennonite Church

1628
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:07,200
Because they're mostly a bummer

1629
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:08,736
Fans

1630
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:11,296
Kind of we lived

1631
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:13,856
Columbia Missouri which was a city

1632
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:15,648
People don't believe me when I say that

1633
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:18,208
Collegetown

1634
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:21,792
Preemptively defensive

1635
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:25,120
So there was like neighboring cities like little small towns

1636
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:27,936
Community of all of those

1637
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:29,472
Two Cities

1638
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,264
In Columbia everyone would

1639
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,800
Commute into Columbia

1640
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:35,360
Like when I was younger

1641
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:36,640
10:11 or so

1642
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:37,664
We went to the

1643
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:38,432
Mennonite Church

1644
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:40,480
Bummer

1645
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:41,504
Like all of the

1646
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:43,552
This isn't his fault

1647
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:46,112
And isn't even really necessarily Mennonite

1648
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:49,184
But the preacher was in a wheelchair he's a quadriplegic

1649
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,232
And he spoke through like a trach hole

1650
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:57,632
Get a microphone at his trecole it was terrifying as a kid is just so awful

1651
01:25:57,888 --> 01:26:04,032
The kids at the first were so much more evolved than me

1652
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:07,872
But I was supposed to be the city kid cuz I lived

1653
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:09,152
Yeah f******

1654
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:10,176
Like 12

1655
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:11,712
Horrifying

1656
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:14,016
For me in that situation growing up

1657
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:16,576
So I always had a really negative feeling about Mennonite

1658
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,160
And a baptism middle

1659
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:23,744
This is a good if there is a version of Christianity that's a good

1660
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,024
It's probably this one

1661
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,560
They make great pies

1662
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:27,584
Yeah

1663
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:29,888
Child baptism is not

1664
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:36,288
But also you should get re-baptized as an adult if you do

1665
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:42,688
Uno with the world and personal capital

1666
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:44,480
Personal choice

1667
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:45,248
So there's such a

1668
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,528
Emphasis on service

1669
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:47,808
Within the Mennonites

1670
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:49,344
And the Amish

1671
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,648
Ideas like doing things for other people

1672
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:53,952
Even if you're not praised for it is really important

1673
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:56,512
Like as an adult

1674
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:58,304
To like I wish I valued

1675
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,376
Religious upbringing

1676
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:02,144
Things that I had

1677
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:02,912
More

1678
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:03,680
During that

1679
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:05,984
Because later we ended up going to like

1680
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:11,360
Do that

1681
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:12,640
Liquor store

1682
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:13,408
Something In My Heart

1683
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:18,784
And all this is just to say Alex is about to lie about the

1684
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:26,464
Well that's nice I have no no

1685
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:28,768
No sentimental feelings about

1686
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:30,560
Any of my time in the church

1687
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:31,328
Ever

1688
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:33,888
Ever your cult was a little different.

1689
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:36,960
Not even that just like even from when we were past

1690
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:39,776
The Colts and we were in just like regular as churches

1691
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:44,896
Sure well

1692
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:48,224
My life's experience

1693
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:50,016
Was

1694
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:50,784
With the medal

1695
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:53,088
Alex is going to talk about the Amish

1696
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:55,904
And there are

1697
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:58,720
Absolutely

1698
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:00,768
The question whenever people

1699
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,584
Amish with electricity

1700
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:07,680
There's more flexibility in terms of you can wear button

1701
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:10,752
Do the Amish

1702
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,312
But they are allowed to wear like teal shirts

1703
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:14,336
So that's better

1704
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:18,176
Reformed Amish stuff is very Progressive

1705
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:21,504
Colors

1706
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,320
All this is to say that I don't know everything

1707
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:25,344
About all of the

1708
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:28,672
Whether it's Mennonite or Amish

1709
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:32,256
I'm pretty acquainted with it

1710
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:34,048
To know that Alex knows nothing

1711
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:36,864
The Amish don't know I know

1712
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,312
And they live longer

1713
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:51,456
And they do not have autism

1714
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:54,016
That is not true

1715
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:55,808
Propaganda

1716
01:28:56,064 --> 01:29:02,208
Bulshit absolutely Community the Amish community all of them so they do largely live

1717
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:03,232
Separate from

1718
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:05,536
Urban center

1719
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:08,864
There have been studies that have been done there is autism

1720
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:10,400
The Amish community

1721
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:13,472
There is vaccination done all this

1722
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:14,240
Is

1723
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:16,800
Cruel nonsense propaganda

1724
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:19,616
Just trying to Bank off the idea of other

1725
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:20,896
The other nest

1726
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:21,664
The Amish

1727
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:26,528
It's absolutely been debunked

1728
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:31,648
Also why not

1729
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:38,048
They live longer and everybody looks the same until they're like 95 and then they get real old real fast

1730
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:38,816
Liberty spikes

1731
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:39,840
Because they all right

1732
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:51,616
And this one

1733
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:52,896
This is bogus

1734
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:00,832
They have some secret programs

1735
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:07,232
I talked.

1736
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:09,792
Dutch

1737
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:14,400
Stud

1738
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:16,192
Their daughters

1739
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:25,152
Sheet between like Orthodox Jews

1740
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:27,456
Everything

1741
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:31,808
What's a lot of money

1742
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,600
Had a nice time out

1743
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:44,352
444

1744
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:46,912
They're just so much to know

1745
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:58,432
I'll tell you I'll tell you this

1746
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:03,296
Knowledge is a dick

1747
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:07,392
And you just want to learn and learn and learn and learn the truth

1748
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:08,928
So there's a number of problems

1749
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:15,328
Was this the first the first

1750
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:19,936
Devout

1751
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:22,752
I would not ever allow is out of marriage sex

1752
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:35,040
To f*** their children in front of them

1753
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:36,320
Who's the sheets

1754
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:39,904
Do you know what this is

1755
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:41,184
Comes from message board

1756
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:47,584
This comes from Anonymous post on message boards Amish fiction

1757
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,120
That has to do with the ideas

1758
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:52,448
Different that world

1759
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:55,264
Exactly

1760
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,056
Is that like are believable enough

1761
01:31:57,312 --> 01:32:00,128
The people who know nothing

1762
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:06,528
Record on a little bit in the internet world

1763
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:10,112
The moment you said you know like Orthodox Jews

1764
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:15,488
All right well that somebody who threw in a bulshit thing from what Orthodox Jews do and then

1765
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:16,256
Just threw it in the

1766
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:19,584
Creative

1767
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:21,888
Movie ideas like a

1768
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:23,168
Is it cuz there's two problem

1769
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:27,264
What is if this daughter

1770
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,288
The Amish her against

1771
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:29,056
Premarital see

1772
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:37,760
Secondarily is she is married their super against infidelity

1773
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:39,808
How expensive is real is because of

1774
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:43,648
Again what it comes back to you if is this other ring of other population

1775
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:49,536
Well there's probably not many people choosing to become Amish

1776
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:50,816
We must be

1777
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:51,840
Completely isolated

1778
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:53,120
Community and they must all be

1779
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:54,144
F****** each other

1780
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:59,520
At a certain point you're just going to be f****** your sisters and your brothers like all country Folk

1781
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,544
The problem

1782
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:01,568
Tons and tons

1783
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:03,872
Separate communities around

1784
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:05,152
The country a lot of

1785
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:06,432
Fairly close together

1786
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:07,200
Like the pain

1787
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:09,248
Pennsylvania Dutch

1788
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:10,272
It's not one

1789
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:12,064
There's a right

1790
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:15,648
So often people will.

1791
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:21,536
Write your part of this community over here Community a

1792
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:25,120
And often they will be a mixer with community be

1793
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:27,680
And you'll meet someone and marry someone from

1794
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:28,704
Community beat

1795
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,240
I meant you'll have kids

1796
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:31,264
I meant the kids

1797
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,288
You have with someone

1798
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:33,056
Community

1799
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:34,848
Community C

1800
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:35,872
It's not

1801
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:38,688
Going to necessarily end up indirect

1802
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:39,456
Inbreeding

1803
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:40,992
Because it's not like

1804
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:45,088
Community a b or c is just one family

1805
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:47,392
It's not it's not nearly as small as Alex

1806
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:49,952
This is all going to

1807
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:51,232
New generation

1808
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:53,024
It's going to be all inbred baby

1809
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,328
It's not an emergency like that

1810
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:56,864
Even if

1811
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:59,424
Even if it was an emergency

1812
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:02,752
Whose idea was it well let's hire a duck

1813
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:04,800
Soldier to f*** our daughters

1814
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:10,432
Problem solving skills

1815
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,248
Something like a like a

1816
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:19,136
Pennsylvania Dutch

1817
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:23,744
Came from

1818
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,352
If I remember correct

1819
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,656
Joyce

1820
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:31,680
Yeah exact

1821
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:33,728
He's just using like the the

1822
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:37,056
AAA colloquial

1823
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:43,456
As I as an expansion about netherlanders issue is what I talked about

1824
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:45,504
Driven all around Europe

1825
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:48,576
There was a nomadic

1826
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:49,600
Choose the people

1827
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:53,440
To the extent that their Dutch or German isn't

1828
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:54,720
The full picture

1829
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:56,512
Right there is like a multi

1830
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,816
Nationality

1831
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:01,120
Lineage 2 that

1832
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:04,704
Population is a religious thing

1833
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:11,616
Country

1834
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:12,384
People who get

1835
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,408
Forest around

1836
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:16,480
Wichita

1837
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:24,672
Deaf

1838
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:26,464
U.s. crafts

1839
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:35,168
Gospel say that word Anasazi why I'll get it right

1840
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:42,080
Ocusoft floating floors that most people don't think of slurred it's crazy

1841
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:44,384
So

1842
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:46,432
Just to put a fine button

1843
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:48,224
Shout out to my

1844
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,760
Miami Meadows out there

1845
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:50,528
Amish

1846
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,344
Or listen to this podcast

1847
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,368
That's true but

1848
01:35:57,696 --> 01:35:58,208
This

1849
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:00,768
Is one of those things

1850
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,584
I'm driving this home so hard

1851
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,632
Because I like I have a hangover

1852
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:06,400
Yeah yeah

1853
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:07,936
It's so offensive

1854
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:10,240
As of how much

1855
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:11,264
The narrative

1856
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,288
Invalidate

1857
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,824
What those people

1858
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:18,944
There's no way they would choose this as an option

1859
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:22,272
Because their faith to begin with

1860
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:23,808
Secondarily

1861
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,112
There's no way that this is true because it comes

1862
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:26,880
Second message

1863
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,464
That's such a

1864
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:33,536
That's such a thing like we talked about

1865
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:35,328
Times where it's like

1866
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:41,728
Of course you assumed they would do that because you have no belief in your actual

1867
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:43,264
So you're like

1868
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:47,616
Well yeah why wouldn't they sell out everything that they believe I would do it

1869
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:48,896
There's that piece

1870
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:51,200
And then there's also the fetishization of the

1871
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:52,224
The community you don't under

1872
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:54,528
Very attractive

1873
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:56,320
To do that is very hard to

1874
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,344
Yourself from being like

1875
01:36:57,856 --> 01:37:00,160
I believe the weird thing about this group I see

1876
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:07,072
And also you would watch a Dutch Soldier f*** Amish lady

1877
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:12,448
Echoes reality shows

1878
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:14,240
Came out there were like that

1879
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:18,336
Amish Justice

1880
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:19,616
Guy with a big stick

1881
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:20,896
I would go round and like

1882
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:29,344
Terrible reality show Within

1883
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,648
In the Amish community

1884
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:33,440
Give people f***** with them that they had Justin

1885
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:34,720
Enforcer guide

1886
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:36,256
And like

1887
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:37,024
I was like

1888
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,816
I watch that show like this.

1889
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:40,096
F****** tree

1890
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:40,864
True at all

1891
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:41,888
So I asked my dad

1892
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:46,496
Communities around

1893
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:50,336
And he was like this is one of the most laughable

1894
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:53,408
It's absolutely one of them

1895
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:57,248
It's literally like believing

1896
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:59,040
Rock of Love is how people die

1897
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:01,856
Literally that level of stupid

1898
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:03,648
Operating off that world

1899
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:05,440
I'm not offended

1900
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:07,488
But

1901
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:08,256
Dates

1902
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:10,048
Are you talking about

1903
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:20,032
Rockets

1904
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:21,056
Bret Michaels

1905
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:26,176
The Rock of Love bus there's another right baby

1906
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:31,040
Groupies

1907
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:32,320
That's a good day

1908
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,952
A little bit about pizzagate

1909
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:40,000
He's supposed

1910
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:44,096
Because

1911
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:46,400
Admission

1912
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:51,008
And thousands of emails about the kids

1913
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:54,592
Talk about this episode

1914
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:58,688
And it's the FBI code words for sex with kids

1915
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:07,136
Talking about $65,000

1916
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:10,976
He's completely editorializing on this hot

1917
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:13,792
Email Victor he has turned into some

1918
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:14,816
Something else

1919
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:16,096
This is all bulshit he is

1920
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:17,120
Caesar's rhythm

1921
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:19,168
Budget

1922
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:21,216
Spell prostate

1923
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:29,408
He's not watching sports dinner 3 hours today

1924
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:31,200
Okay

1925
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:34,016
He's got

1926
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:38,368
UShip

1927
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:43,744
Can we break that down

1928
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,048
What is

1929
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:46,816
Start that

1930
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:51,680
I want to tell the audience that when Alex said Obama's having sex with Tim do today

1931
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:53,728
You didn't your face didn't change

1932
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:57,824
Whatever

1933
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,384
Very idea

1934
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:05,760
A good sexual experience

1935
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:08,064
I mean there's going to be diminishing returns cousin

1936
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:09,344
Refractory.

1937
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,648
The first time is

1938
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:12,416
10 minutes

1939
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:14,464
So let's let's

1940
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:17,536
Pretend the each time it takes 3 minutes more

1941
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:19,584
Orso okay

1942
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:22,656
+ 13 + 16 right

1943
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:24,704
2225

1944
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:32,640
Now let's imagine that you're doing all 10 at the same time

1945
01:40:32,896 --> 01:40:34,176
That's going to take even longer

1946
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:35,712
Because each of those tend to

1947
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:36,736
Attention

1948
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:39,552
And you can't give attention

1949
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:40,320
You know

1950
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:41,600
This is Ludacris

1951
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:44,672
Okay first stop

1952
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:46,464
He's probably watching SportsCenter

1953
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:47,488
You

1954
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:52,096
I know your skills that is a man

1955
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:52,864
Who can

1956
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:54,144
Tom softendo

1957
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:55,424
In a heartbeat

1958
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:59,264
Please look at even in his presence

1959
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:04,384
Are you with orgasmic rage

1960
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,152
Tumi

1961
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:11,296
Could not control yourself

1962
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:12,832
The day that's different

1963
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:13,600
Because

1964
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:14,368
Cuz then

1965
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,648
Look at it

1966
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:19,488
There's no

1967
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,536
Sock rag

1968
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:25,632
There's no refractory.

1969
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:32,032
You know what I'm saying that implies that his dick is involved

1970
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:34,336
Nut 10 times

1971
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:40,480
I'm saying that there are a few has

1972
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:42,272
The aura mental powers

1973
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:43,808
Lava lava

1974
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:45,856
Power that we cannot

1975
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:51,744
Imagine what's the pleasure

1976
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:55,840
That's a good everything is about sex before

1977
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:58,656
I've heard that from Janelle Monae

1978
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:00,704
I just

1979
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:03,264
Which is actually the worst lyrics

1980
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:04,544
On her entire album

1981
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:06,592
Computer is Phantom

1982
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:08,640
Lyric anyway.

1983
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:09,408
Continue

1984
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:10,176
I know I have nothing

1985
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:15,808
Continue with horse

1986
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:16,832
Alright

1987
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:24,256
This is what Media Matters and rightwingwatch decided to cover

1988
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:25,536
So to give you some con

1989
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:27,584
Yeah of like what

1990
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,632
He's talking about and has talked about already

1991
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:30,400
We have

1992
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:31,680
People want

1993
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:33,984
To get into white Protestant countries

1994
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:35,008
We have

1995
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:39,616
The one that has white Protestants stole from the people who want to get in there now

1996
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:46,016
The demographic Lee chosen Chinese and Islam as their way to go us

1997
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:49,344
It's almost like

1998
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:51,904
Western countries.

1999
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:52,672
Right

2000
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:56,256
We also have Alex talkingshit on the office

2001
01:42:56,512 --> 01:42:58,048
Unnecessarily

2002
01:42:58,304 --> 01:43:02,400
Recover that you do a little dance on his face with that if you want that beef

2003
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:05,984
A further thing that they could have covered if they wanted to is Alex

2004
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:08,544
More popular

2005
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:14,688
What this would be a great thing for them to cover

2006
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:16,224
Likert scale

2007
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:20,576
Yeah

2008
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:26,720
Even bad what he does at everything

2009
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:33,120
Anything in the world to do is go down to a boardwalk

2010
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:35,424
A lot of different reasons

2011
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:37,472
What's your name

2012
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,664
That doesn't work anymore

2013
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:51,296
Mafia or

2014
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:57,440
Kill somebody

2015
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:58,720
Italian mafia the same way

2016
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:00,000
You got to make your bones

2017
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:03,072
Sure but the Hollywood

2018
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:04,608
Got to make your bone

2019
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:07,424
13 year old girl that's the bare minimum

2025
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:38,400

01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:43,776
Show

2027

I don't believe it

2032
01:44:58,368 --> 01:45:00,160
If it's true I would assume

2033
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:03,232
But it's someone sucking my dick

2034
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:12,192
Set timer

2035
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:13,728

That was

2053
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:06,208
I don't know this is so stupid

2054
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:11,584
I was trying to like

2055
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:12,864
Play with

2056
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:15,424

It's right

2062
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:27,712
Perhaps

2063
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:28,736
The most

2064
01:46:28,992 --> 01:46:29,760
Silly thing

2065
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:31,296
You could possibly present is

2066
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:34,112
And then the second level up

2067
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:38,464
Who wants Mark Dice

2068
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:45,888
Gina

2069
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:49,472
The literal

2070
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:54,336
This guy has

2071
01:46:54,592 --> 01:46:55,616
Second

2072
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:58,432
I want him

2073
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:01,248
But you got to get them in the

2074
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:03,040
Cool

2075
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:04,832
So f****** stupid

2076
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:09,184
Much like Alex is like lack of awareness and

2077
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:11,488
Playing games

2078
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:12,768
Accomplished

2079
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:14,048
The same thing with

2080
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:18,400
There's absolutely be

2081
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:23,008
There's absolutely child exploitation rehab

2082
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:26,080
We're not making fun of

2083
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:32,480
And I'm the second piece of it is

2084
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:34,528
The way that I went to Jones.

2085
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:35,808
And talks about this

2086
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,600
Real issue

2087
01:47:39,392 --> 01:47:42,720
Like Ronan Farrow is doing lessmore fez's

2088
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:45,536
Screwing much more serious

2089
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:47,072
Nuanced workthespace

2090
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:49,120
Austin reality

2091
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:50,912
A disservice to all of that

2092
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:52,448
By bringing him so much

2093
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:53,728
Bulshit

2094
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:55,520
Image next clip

2095
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:57,056
Alex brings up

2096
01:47:58,592 --> 01:47:59,616
About what's bad about being

2097
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:02,688
Yeah it's really bad about it and his

2098
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:06,784
I was like

2099
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:15,232
I can't imagine someone coming up to people in a dressing room

2100
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:21,632
Like maybe if they're underage girls at a beauty pageant I can't imagine what kind of idiot would take to walk in

2101
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:22,656
Into a dressing room

2102
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:27,776
And harass people I can't even imagine that no president would ever do that certainly

2103
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:42,880
Have we considered close to Ralphie May

2104
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:51,840
Remember he's dead

2105
01:48:52,096 --> 01:48:53,376
Nitin karagounis

2106
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:54,144
Some friends of mine

2107
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:54,912
Yeah

2108
01:48:55,424 --> 01:48:56,192
He came and did stand up

2109
01:48:56,448 --> 01:49:00,288
Open Columbia Missouri different like he had

2110
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:01,824
So many different stories of like

2111
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:04,640
He was ultimately the most mean and then

2112
01:49:04,896 --> 01:49:05,920
Currently the most generous

2113
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:08,224
All the sudden he's been like

2114
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:14,624
Entire life

2115
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:20,256
Recipe for Elsie Mae

2116
01:49:22,048 --> 01:49:22,816
He did have some f******

2117
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:24,608
Awful jokes

2118
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:27,168
Work

2119
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:31,264
From time to time that Club in Columbia Missouri with the name of it

2120
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:33,056
They would have those like

2121
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:34,336
Remember When

2122
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:35,872
You were hosting at Zanies

2123
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:36,640
You were

2124
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:43,808
Is going to be a long video before this

2125
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:44,832
Month from now

2126
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:48,416
Coming in a month-and-a-half whatever

2127
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:50,208
And then

2128
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:52,768
Every time you coming

2129
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:54,048
If you watch that video

2130
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,096
So bad

2131
01:49:56,608 --> 01:49:57,632
The Joker

2132
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:00,704
Videos talking about like how he named his daughter

2133
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:02,240
April June May

2134
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:08,640
Do you know what to say what your wife think about that name

2135
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:09,408
Anderson

2136
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:12,224
Achieve

2137
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:13,504
Like

2138
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:14,528
What is that a joke

2139
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:15,808
What is that

2140
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:19,392
Why is Devon the sizzling

2141
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:22,464
That's going to get me to come to the show

2142
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:26,304
You hear something like that you think I got to go see what the f*** is wrong with this guy

2143
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,328
Yeah

2144
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:29,376
And then he's out his opener

2145
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:35,776
In the video like legitimately he comes to Stage the giant orange suit

2146
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:37,056
I let y'all get

2147
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:41,664
Used to this amount of orange on the stage

2148
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:42,688
Hey

2149
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:49,088
When we would do sex

2150
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:51,136
Are sometimes like me and my friend

2151
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:52,160
Things would be at on the

2152
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:53,952
Show together

2153
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:56,512
And I one time me and very funny

2154
01:50:56,768 --> 01:51:02,144
Not doing stand-up anymore but very funny

2155
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,448
You can find it on the internet

2156
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:09,312
He's a very very funny dude

2157
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:11,872
Wendy's

2158
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:13,920
Video Play-Doh

2159
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:15,200
It's so goddamn

2160
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:16,480
He got to go up first

2161
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:21,600
No I'm going to stand here and let you

2162
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:24,672
Get adjusted to the kamado Joe

2163
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:28,256
0

2164
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:31,072
Laughing my ass off

2165
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:36,448
There's nothing better than a comedian wearing something

2166
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:39,008
Crazy it is that he wore it

2167
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:45,152
That crazy

2168
01:51:46,944 --> 01:51:48,992
I don't have any of those

2169
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:50,784
I don't have any of those drugs

2170
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:51,552
Because I

2171
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:52,320
You only

2172
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:58,720
Like you got to give it up to those guys for at least writing like eight new hours every year whatever the f*** it is like

2173
01:51:58,976 --> 01:52:03,072
I don't have any of those jokes

2174
01:52:03,328 --> 01:52:04,864
Anyway

2175
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:11,264
Ralphie May is from Texas

2176
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:16,640
Because ostentation

2177
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:17,920
Okay Austin

2178
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:20,992
I get it I get it but he's brilliant

2179
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:22,528
We spent a lot of his time in LA

2180
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:25,344
And we know that one thing from this next clip

2181
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:26,880
That is what la

2182
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:32,000
As a torturous route but I like it

2183
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:36,864
I can't go

2184
01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:39,680
Even to LA to audition

2185
01:52:56,576 --> 01:52:58,112
That's what's up

2186
01:52:58,624 --> 01:53:04,512
Degrees it maybe had a tough time because how hard he was self-medicating when he was a

2187
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:07,584
Wasted

2188
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:13,728
$10,000

2189
01:53:13,984 --> 01:53:15,264
Addition

2190
01:53:17,568 --> 01:53:20,128
I bet it's a good cover for why you're not in any

2191
01:53:22,432 --> 01:53:24,736
Yeah we're good

2192
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:29,088
In this audience

2193
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:35,488
So now Jordan I've been teasing this a little bit because Montreal is on fire

2194
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:39,072
Bingo does mentality

2195
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:42,912
I've been teasing if there's a guest coming

2196
01:53:43,936 --> 01:53:45,216
You have no idea who this is

2197
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:48,544
The name is said

2198
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:51,616
You'll have no idea who this dude

2199
01:53:51,872 --> 01:53:52,896
Here's Alex

2200
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:06,720
Turn off our survival Instinct Hollywood as her main weapon

2201
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:15,680
I want to watch

2202
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:27,456
You figure that one out

2203
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:29,504
Whatever

2204
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:33,856
They tried to induct

2205
01:54:37,184 --> 01:54:38,208
Isaac Kappy

2206
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:42,560
Which I actually kind of suspect is Buzz Marketing for Super Mario Odyssey

2207
01:54:43,328 --> 01:54:44,864
Cuz the new character is Kathy

2208
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:47,168
Who is ber

2209
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:51,008
He is like a spirit and body is Mario

2210
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:52,544
Throwing around

2211
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:53,824
Is the new character

2212
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:56,640
Did another

2213
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:01,760
Number of reasons

2214
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:05,344
That I don't I don't think this guy is sexier

2215
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:12,256
The number of supporting roles

2216
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:15,584
And somebody said that they didn't even get into

2217
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:17,120
What Rosie's been in because he

2218
01:55:17,376 --> 01:55:17,888
He's been in so many

2219
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:25,312
I don't want Tales out of school about what roles has been in

2220
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:30,688
IMDb big blockbuster hits on the other side of this clip

2221
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:32,992
Because I would rather let Isaac Kappy

2222
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:37,856
Respond to Alex's allegation that he's a big movie star

2223
01:55:38,624 --> 01:55:39,392
An elected

2224
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:40,672
Spell a few things you said

2225
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:43,488
Not a big movie star

2226
01:55:45,536 --> 01:55:46,816
Movie star

2227
01:55:47,072 --> 01:55:53,216
Also I really would like to get a friend as I never threatened Paris and in fact I reached out to her yesterday we texted back and forth

2228
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:56,800
I know you're a good person I don't want to bring you into this

2229
01:55:57,056 --> 01:55:58,592
They are trying to draw you in

2230
01:55:58,848 --> 01:56:03,712
Can use other people around and they don't care who they hurt

2231
01:56:03,968 --> 01:56:04,992
I just bring them in

2232
01:56:12,928 --> 01:56:17,280
Relevant

2233
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:23,424
I'm just sitting here at your an established

2236
01:56:31,104 --> 01:56:31,616
Pencil lead

2237
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:35,968
This guy

2238
01:56:36,224 --> 01:56:38,272
Where

2239
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:39,552
It's being reported

2240
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:41,344
You never know how like

2241
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:48,000
Beer

2242
01:56:48,256 --> 01:56:51,072
Celebrity news

2243
01:56:51,328 --> 01:56:51,840
Because

2244
01:56:52,352 --> 01:56:52,864
This guy is

2245
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:53,632
Is clearly on

2246
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:54,912
And mentally ill

2247
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:56,704
Yeah and the allegation that he

2248
01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:00,032
He choked her is much more serious than say

2249
01:57:00,288 --> 01:57:00,800
Paris Hilton

2250
01:57:01,056 --> 01:57:02,080

01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:08,128
Being a big movie star I do like his lack of ego about it cuz he's

Steven Spielberg

He's doing all this stuff but

2334
02:01:07,328 --> 02:01:09,376

02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:17,312
I've already been making accusations about

2338
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:19,360

2339
02:01:19,872 --> 02:01:20,896

Game nights with Seth Rogen

2342
02:01:30,624 --> 02:01:31,904
But then you have to also take

2343
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:33,184
Consideration other things

2344
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:36,768

Rite Aid thinks that pizzagate is proven and documented

2347
02:01:42,912 --> 02:01:44,448
All right how are the other thing is like

2348
02:01:45,728 --> 02:01:47,520
What I was saying that I'm not sure if I believe

02:01:47,776 --> 02:01:48,544
Gossip sites

2350
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:49,312
But

2351
02:01:49,824 --> 02:01:50,336
You know

2352
02:01:50,592 --> 02:01:54,176
You can take take this for what you will

2353
02:01:54,432 --> 02:01:54,944
Based on

2354
02:01:55,456 --> 02:01:55,968
What he did

2355
02:01:56,224 --> 02:01:56,992
Need to Paris Jackson

2356
02:01:57,504 --> 02:01:58,272
She has had to

2357
02:01:59,296 --> 02:02:01,856
Because he knows where she lives

2358
02:02:02,368 --> 02:02:03,136
And he kept trying

2359
02:02:03,392 --> 02:02:05,696
Contact

2360
02:02:05,952 --> 02:02:07,488
If I mean I don't know if that's

2361
02:02:10,304 --> 02:02:12,352
Seems very plausible

2362
02:02:12,608 --> 02:02:13,632
The world

2363
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:14,400

That we you like wait around in

2365

You are pretty much guilty until you prove you're in

2366
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:23,872
Maybe

2367
02:02:24,128 --> 02:02:24,640

I know what's coming up and I think the schedule s*** huh

2374
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:50,496

02:03:04,064 --> 02:03:05,344
In the night it's the ninth inning

2381
02:03:07,904 --> 02:03:08,672
And you have to pitch

2382
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:12,512
No wait

2383
02:03:13,536 --> 02:03:14,560
It doesn't work

2384
02:03:15,072 --> 02:03:15,584
Yeah I know

2385
02:03:18,144 --> 02:03:21,216

Maybe their parents

2397
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:21,120
Maybe

2398
02:04:21,376 --> 02:04:23,936

15 year olds in

Just hanging out and playing board games

2409
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:13,088
Beach with your family in the fifty-year-old stinks of beer

2410
02:05:16,416 --> 02:05:20,256
And you got scantily-clad girls

2411
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:23,840
It is

2412
02:05:24,608 --> 02:05:25,376
What are you guys talking

2413
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:26,912
What's happened

2414
02:05:27,424 --> 02:05:33,568
Drew Barrymore that part of the a thereunder

2415
02:05:33,824 --> 02:05:39,968
Cutting their own argument

2416
02:05:40,224 --> 02:05:46,368

2417
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:47,648
I don't know what Alex

2418
02:05:47,904 --> 02:05:51,744
15 year old

02:05:52,256 --> 02:05:54,048
Who's at the party playing board games

2420
02:05:54,304 --> 02:05:55,072
With you and nothing happens

2421
02:05:55,584 --> 02:05:56,864
The cleaner undercuts V

2422
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:59,168
Always suspicious of a fifteen-year-old

2423
02:05:59,424 --> 02:06:00,704
The party

2424
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:04,544
The beginning are we talkin about a kid showing up with a dad

2425
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:08,384
Conceivably yet lookastic looking for Seth Green when Steph Curry

2426
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:09,408
Country

2427
02:06:10,688 --> 02:06:13,248
From being anything suspicious

2428
02:06:13,504 --> 02:06:15,808
Because if it was a child delivery

2429
02:06:16,064 --> 02:06:18,112
F****** know that he was out of the country

2430
02:06:18,368 --> 02:06:24,512
You don't risk that kind of thing

2431
02:06:28,096 --> 02:06:28,864
At least

2432
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:30,400
At least send a text

2433
02:06:30,656 --> 02:06:31,168
Exactly

2434
02:06:31,424 --> 02:06:33,984
Maybe you don't want a paper trail right

2435
02:06:35,264 --> 02:06:40,128
Literally any sort of missive karaoke

2436
02:06:40,384 --> 02:06:41,152
What are you talkin

2437
02:06:41,408 --> 02:06:42,688
Why is your first thought

2438
02:06:42,944 --> 02:06:43,456
Okay

2439
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:47,296
And screens out of the country

2440
02:06:47,552 --> 02:06:49,856
So obviously they're trying to get me to f*** a kid

2441
02:06:50,368 --> 02:06:56,512
That is the type of project of a man who really wants to book a kids

2442
02:06:56,768 --> 02:06:58,304
You're looking at it

2443
02:06:58,816 --> 02:07:00,096
Just someone who is

2444
02:07:00,352 --> 02:07:00,864
Either

2445
02:07:01,632 --> 02:07:03,168
Grossly opportunistic

2446
02:07:03,424 --> 02:07:04,960
And is trying to make a buck

2447
02:07:05,216 --> 02:07:08,032
Probably or is mentally ill and has

2448
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:13,664
Insane delusions of paranoia possible

2449
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:16,224
And I will give Alex from credit

2450
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:18,272
Like I said I brought this up a couple times

2451
02:07:18,528 --> 02:07:21,088
He had misgivings about the idea of talking to

2452
02:07:21,344 --> 02:07:21,856
To the sky

2453
02:07:22,112 --> 02:07:27,744
Has misgivings

2454
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,792
To him for at least having that

2455
02:07:30,048 --> 02:07:30,560
Kind of

2456
02:07:30,816 --> 02:07:31,584
Vino in

2457
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:34,400
That's what we're honest

2458
02:07:34,656 --> 02:07:36,704
This could go really badly

2459
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:39,520
Alex is trying to

2460
02:07:39,776 --> 02:07:40,544
Get him to

2461
02:07:41,824 --> 02:07:43,104
You know do the narrative

2462
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:44,640
If you want to bring up Mark.

2463
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:46,688
She is already

2464
02:07:46,944 --> 02:07:48,736
He's trying to leave in like I've been

2465
02:07:48,992 --> 02:07:51,296
Parties

2466
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:57,696
Let's get the vague narrative together that I want right that's probably illegal

2467
02:07:59,744 --> 02:08:05,376
Picking might be able to sue you and then I've got to get to post he's other goddamn lost

2468
02:08:05,888 --> 02:08:06,656
Is what he's doing

2469
02:08:06,912 --> 02:08:07,424
He's hope

2470
02:08:07,936 --> 02:08:11,776
Yeah I think that's another thing that I think as we go along and

2471
02:08:13,312 --> 02:08:14,336
You will see a little bit of him

2472
02:08:14,592 --> 02:08:15,360
I'm trying to like

2473
02:08:17,408 --> 02:08:18,176
Write the story

2474
02:08:23,296 --> 02:08:24,064
Kind of like

2475
02:08:24,576 --> 02:08:25,600
Just tell me your goddamn it

2476
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:26,368
Information

2477
02:08:26,624 --> 02:08:28,672
Like because I think even he heard that like

2478
02:08:28,928 --> 02:08:32,256
A kid showed up and there was a man and a woman is that green wasn't there

2479
02:08:33,536 --> 02:08:35,840
That's weak I think he thinks that's weak

2480
02:08:36,096 --> 02:08:38,400
Even for Alex this week

2481
02:08:38,912 --> 02:08:40,448
I think that Alex has been burned

2482
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:43,264
In the past by people like

2483
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:48,640
Yeah yeah yeah

2484
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:51,200
How to film a video where he apologizes

2485
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:58,112
Tell me your information hoodie do it is Robot Chicken

2486
02:08:58,368 --> 02:08:58,880
You dude

2487
02:08:59,392 --> 02:09:00,160
You do a little puppet

2488
02:09:00,928 --> 02:09:01,952
Come back into play

2489
02:09:05,024 --> 02:09:07,328
What's the data

2490
02:09:08,864 --> 02:09:11,168
Williams returned

2491
02:09:11,424 --> 02:09:14,752
Experience what you saw

2492
02:09:15,008 --> 02:09:18,080
What they say

2493
02:09:20,128 --> 02:09:20,640
Real quick

2494
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:23,456
Alex asking for the information

2495
02:09:24,224 --> 02:09:27,040
Have you started weaving a weird Tale

2496
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:31,904
The outro music play now.

2497
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:33,696
Recap here before they went to

2498
02:09:34,208 --> 02:09:35,488
I was going to keep both clips

2499
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,024
Just for context

2500
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:39,072
Alakazam

2501
02:09:40,864 --> 02:09:44,448
Today

2502
02:09:48,288 --> 02:09:51,872
That's very close to ADESA

2503
02:09:52,384 --> 02:09:54,432
Set screen at his house

2504
02:09:54,688 --> 02:09:56,736
Afterparty we're all kind of drinking

2505
02:09:58,016 --> 02:09:58,784
Secret bookshelf

2506
02:10:03,136 --> 02:10:03,648
Alright

2507
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:05,184
That sounds like someone who's not being

2508
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:05,952
Sincere

2509
02:10:06,208 --> 02:10:12,352
Sounds like someone who's like who's been professionally funny for a long

2510
02:10:15,168 --> 02:10:16,192
They're the top

2511
02:10:16,448 --> 02:10:17,984
The top floor in that Malibu house

2512
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:20,032
Was covered in stuffed animals

2513
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:24,128
Is that a guest room for maybe that couple with their kids

2514
02:10:24,384 --> 02:10:28,992
I didn't know you was a room for somebody who doesn't show

2515
02:10:29,248 --> 02:10:30,016
With puppet

2516
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:38,464
Toys and Pacifica

2517
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:44,864
Collectibles of the nerd culture stuff fit Seth Green's entire careers

2518
02:10:49,472 --> 02:10:50,240
Alright that's it

2519
02:10:55,616 --> 02:10:56,384
Laugh it off

2520
02:10:57,408 --> 02:10:59,712
Because it's hard you know cuz you trust these people

2521
02:11:05,344 --> 02:11:06,112
I love them

2522
02:11:06,368 --> 02:11:07,136
And I got fired

2523
02:11:14,816 --> 02:11:17,376
Robots

2524
02:11:17,632 --> 02:11:21,728
A very young child or the show Robot Chicken

2525
02:11:23,008 --> 02:11:24,544
I don't know what more

2526
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:26,080
Data people want

2527
02:11:26,592 --> 02:11:30,176
You have already solved the mystery

2528
02:11:42,976 --> 02:11:46,304
Pedophile code word that nobody is ever used

2529
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:49,888
Or maybe it is been used but come on

2530
02:11:50,656 --> 02:11:51,168
If

2531
02:11:51,424 --> 02:11:56,800
There is a thing that says green might say with the use of the word chicken

2532
02:11:57,056 --> 02:11:58,080
I'm going to go with

2533
02:11:58,336 --> 02:11:59,360
His show

2534
02:11:59,872 --> 02:12:00,384
Robotic

2535
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:06,016
Right you'd like if you and I were

2536
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:08,576
Dan or like if I

2537
02:12:09,088 --> 02:12:09,600

You know like maybe we go meet up with a bunch of contacts on my want to fill in for you

2539
02:12:16,256 --> 02:12:16,768
Fight

2540
02:12:18,304 --> 02:12:23,936
Exactly what Fight Club

2541
02:12:24,192 --> 02:12:26,496
But on some level you could

2542
02:12:26,752 --> 02:12:32,384
Could be a way I might drunkenly presented somebody or

2543
02:12:32,896 --> 02:12:34,432
Hey like we had talked about chicken

2544
02:12:34,944 --> 02:12:35,712
That is awesome

2545
02:12:35,968 --> 02:12:42,112
Hundred percent of people specially based on the other week

2546
02:12:42,368 --> 02:12:45,440
He had a secret rooms

2547
02:12:45,696 --> 02:12:51,840
Even witches

2548
02:12:52,352 --> 02:12:53,888
And again the bunk beds part like

2549
02:12:54,144 --> 02:12:56,192
Physician Electra Cruiser

2550
02:12:59,008 --> 02:12:59,520
Like I don't

2551
02:12:59,776 --> 02:13:02,592
I hate that I said b**** their blankets so stupid

2552
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:05,152
You haven't you could easily

2553
02:13:05,408 --> 02:13:06,944
Like if you have a mansion

2554
02:13:07,456 --> 02:13:08,736
The idea is like

2555
02:13:08,992 --> 02:13:09,760
I know

2556
02:13:10,528 --> 02:13:11,040
From

2557
02:13:11,296 --> 02:13:11,808
Stomach

2558
02:13:12,064 --> 02:13:12,576
Experience

2559
02:13:13,088 --> 02:13:13,600
Mansion

2560
02:13:13,856 --> 02:13:14,368
Watching

2561
02:13:14,624 --> 02:13:15,136
The lifestyle

2562
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:17,440
Right cribs

2563
02:13:17,696 --> 02:13:18,208
Okay

2564
02:13:20,256 --> 02:13:20,768
Have

2565
02:13:21,024 --> 02:13:22,816
Rooms that people can stay in

2566
02:13:23,072 --> 02:13:29,216
That they know from their life before they were rich as they're rich enough to be like

2567
02:13:33,056 --> 02:13:33,568
You can stay with

2568
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:37,920
In Malibu if you come in vacation

2569
02:13:38,176 --> 02:13:38,688
You have Acts

2570
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:45,344
To my mansion that I can build a room for you to visit

2571
02:13:47,392 --> 02:13:48,416
Human

2572
02:13:51,744 --> 02:13:54,048
Maybe some green has a lot of friends

2573
02:13:55,072 --> 02:13:56,864
Maybe like this day and like maybe

2574
02:13:57,120 --> 02:13:58,400
You would want to allow the kids to

2575
02:13:58,656 --> 02:14:02,496
Have their own room

2576
02:14:03,264 --> 02:14:04,544
That would be in my house

2577
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:06,592
Yeah because I have enough friends

2578
02:14:06,848 --> 02:14:08,128
That are close to me

2579
02:14:08,384 --> 02:14:10,944
That are now married or on their way to heaven

2580
02:14:11,968 --> 02:14:13,760
Like it let's say I were to

2581
02:14:14,016 --> 02:14:14,528
I don't know

2582
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:15,808
Perfect world

2583
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:16,832
Lendup

2584
02:14:17,088 --> 02:14:18,880
We become super successful with this vodka

2585
02:14:19,136 --> 02:14:25,280
To the point where I'm super rich you're superrich to we all have to work anymore maybe you stay in Chicago at

2586
02:14:25,536 --> 02:14:26,304
Decide f****** I'm going to

2587
02:14:27,072 --> 02:14:28,096
Should I get a big old house

2588
02:14:28,352 --> 02:14:31,168
France your girlfriend get married have some kids

2589
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:33,216
We do the show over Skype

2590
02:14:34,496 --> 02:14:40,640
Keep things going everything is good

2591
02:14:40,896 --> 02:14:44,224
Dedicated so when you come and visit in my chateau

2592
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:45,504
That is something

2593
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:46,272
Like

2594
02:14:46,528 --> 02:14:47,296
That makes perfect sense

2595
02:14:47,552 --> 02:14:48,320
My brother

2596
02:14:51,904 --> 02:14:53,184
There are rooms in that house

2597
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:54,208
That Arch

2598
02:14:54,464 --> 02:14:54,976
For other people

2599
02:14:55,232 --> 02:14:56,256
Specific

2600
02:14:57,024 --> 02:14:58,560
That don't match his lifestyle

2601
02:14:59,072 --> 02:15:01,632
At all because he has people come and stay with him

2602
02:15:04,192 --> 02:15:05,216
This is the room for others

2603
02:15:07,264 --> 02:15:10,336
Weird you don't understand though in this fantasy

2604
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:11,872
Sad face

2605
02:15:12,384 --> 02:15:12,896
Scenario

2606
02:15:13,408 --> 02:15:15,200
What I would do if I were rich

2607
02:15:15,712 --> 02:15:16,224
Which is

2608
02:15:16,992 --> 02:15:18,528
Test the limits of the

2609
02:15:20,832 --> 02:15:22,368
I would go around committing

2610
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:29,280
I would I would burn down

2611
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:30,048
Anywhere

2612
02:15:30,304 --> 02:15:32,096
We could go anywhere I can go do you know how

2613
02:15:32,352 --> 02:15:34,144
People get away with

2614
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:37,216
I would test every single f****** Limited

2615
02:15:37,472 --> 02:15:39,008
Try and put me in jail

2616
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:42,336
Trying I'm so rich

2617
02:15:42,848 --> 02:15:43,616
I don't even give a

02:15:43,872 --> 02:15:44,384
F***

2619
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:48,480
Burn It Down

2620

All of your lies you know what I'll pay for the prosecution's lawyers a mental picture of Youth like

2621
02:15:55,136 --> 02:15:58,976
Worsening

2622
02:15:59,232 --> 02:16:05,376
$100 bills is how I would start fires on other people's homes come out of the house

2623
02:16:05,632 --> 02:16:06,400
Checkbook in your life

02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:14,080
Build my Redford

2625
02:16:14,592 --> 02:16:19,456
That's horrible. I do like it I do like it on one level cuz maybe they didn't like

2626
02:16:19,712 --> 02:16:20,480
The house they were living in

2627
02:16:20,736 --> 02:16:26,880
And because of the numbers you could write on that check

2628
02:16:31,232 --> 02:16:36,608
Joyriding Robinhood is what I'm doing

2629
02:16:36,864 --> 02:16:40,960
Stop on the backend pack

2630
02:16:41,216 --> 02:16:45,824
For a while your house down

2631
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:46,848
You're going to come watch

2632
02:16:50,432 --> 02:16:50,944

02:16:58,112 --> 02:17:01,952
Restart feel like I'd be a better rich person

2634
02:17:02,720 --> 02:17:04,256
Korean president

2635
02:17:04,512 --> 02:17:07,584
Penny-pinching Rich vs poor

2636
02:17:08,096 --> 02:17:08,864
You have

2637
02:17:11,424 --> 02:17:12,704
You bring a recorder

2638
02:17:13,216 --> 02:17:15,520
If you watch the House burn

2639
02:17:15,776 --> 02:17:21,920
Is it that watching

2640
02:17:22,688 --> 02:17:27,040
How do you feel right now

2641
02:17:27,808 --> 02:17:33,952
Any memories you think you're not going to be able to recover from that guys welcome to the new episode of real estate fight

2642
02:17:34,208 --> 02:17:40,352

Funeral home burned to the ground it was built by their grandfather by his own hands I know you're crying right now

2644
02:17:46,496 --> 02:17:49,056
You have to keep in mind that you're going to lend in a better place

2645
02:17:50,592 --> 02:17:54,432
You're going to have a better house

2646
02:17:54,688 --> 02:17:57,760
Shoes with it but

2647
02:17:58,016 --> 02:18:04,160
I think I could be a miniseries on Earwolf mementos or do I have to stipulate that they keep it all

2648
02:18:04,672 --> 02:18:06,720
They can only keep any copies they have

2649
02:18:06,976 --> 02:18:09,024
The DVD of Mamma Mia

2650
02:18:09,536 --> 02:18:11,072
Everybody else has got a bird

2651
02:18:15,168 --> 02:18:16,448
You got to go Survivor

2652
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:21,568
Fever watch Survivor one of the things they get to bring one luxury item

2653
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:23,360
Everyone who comes on the ship gets

2654
02:18:23,616 --> 02:18:24,128
To bring one

2655
02:18:24,384 --> 02:18:27,200
Bring a razor

2656
02:18:32,064 --> 02:18:38,208
Get the one item

2657
02:18:38,464 --> 02:18:43,328
We'll talk about this and then they'll be the crackling of

2658
02:18:43,584 --> 02:18:45,632
Willbros marshmallow be fantastic

2659
02:18:45,888 --> 02:18:51,776
The best idea for a podcast this is right up there with

2660
02:18:52,032 --> 02:18:53,824
TV show with the

2661
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:55,360
I can save the show

2662
02:18:55,616 --> 02:18:57,152
They're the stand-up show the we pitch

2663
02:19:00,736 --> 02:19:02,784
Be so rich we could be

2664
02:19:06,624 --> 02:19:07,648
Anyway

2665
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:26,848
So Isaac

2666
02:19:27,104 --> 02:19:29,408
A lot of this stuff on the fact that

2667
02:19:30,432 --> 02:19:32,480
Seth Green said we need to talk about chicken

2668
02:19:32,736 --> 02:19:34,784
Dinner party

2669
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:38,112
You really resembles the show that you do

2670
02:19:38,368 --> 02:19:39,392
And I got to be honest

2671
02:19:40,416 --> 02:19:41,184
Alex

2672
02:19:41,952 --> 02:19:42,464
Finally

2673
02:19:42,976 --> 02:19:43,488
Shows

2674
02:19:44,256 --> 02:19:49,120
Somewhere with all as a journalist

2675
02:19:49,632 --> 02:19:51,424
Props to Alex

2676
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:54,496
This is this is as close as it's going to get to Alex be like

2677
02:19:55,008 --> 02:19:55,776
Good job buddy

2678
02:19:56,544 --> 02:20:01,152
Maybe they thought you were into pizzagate I thought you were funny they knew you they were teasing you

2679
02:20:11,392 --> 02:20:13,696
He said that conversation

2680
02:20:15,232 --> 02:20:18,816
Why would someone say we need to have a conversation about you

2681
02:20:24,448 --> 02:20:29,312
Walking you're interrupting me brother

2682
02:20:29,568 --> 02:20:32,128
Someone saying

2683
02:20:33,408 --> 02:20:35,200
Is is is is that good

2684
02:20:35,968 --> 02:20:36,480
Okay

2685
02:20:39,808 --> 02:20:42,112
He says we need to have a conversation about zika

2686
02:20:42,368 --> 02:20:43,648
Eating

2687
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,560
This this wave of dread cuz like I had

2688
02:20:50,816 --> 02:20:54,144
You know my house like they might the end of this stuff they might be into the stuff

2689
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:58,752
Children I asked him if they were into sacrifices

2690
02:21:04,896 --> 02:21:05,408
Who knows

2691
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:12,064
He never real expresses a little bit more about the aliens

2692
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:12,832
Clearwater

2693
02:21:13,088 --> 02:21:14,880
Go fuc yourself

2694
02:21:15,136 --> 02:21:19,488
Fake conversations that you had

2695
02:21:19,744 --> 02:21:20,512
Based on

2696
02:21:20,768 --> 02:21:24,352
Did pizzagate fear that you already had that you brought into it

2697
02:21:24,608 --> 02:21:25,120
Inform

2698
02:21:25,376 --> 02:21:26,912
This conversation with someone who is

2699
02:21:27,168 --> 02:21:28,704
Decent enough to let you

2700
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:29,472
F******

2701
02:21:29,728 --> 02:21:32,544
No-name out-of-work actor into his Circle

2702
02:21:33,056 --> 02:21:33,568
You're just trying to

2703
02:21:33,824 --> 02:21:35,104
The cash in on Seth Curry

2704
02:21:35,360 --> 02:21:35,872

2706
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:40,992
Do you know what

2707
02:21:42,016 --> 02:21:45,088
A week from now it could come out that Seth Green the monster

2708
02:21:47,136 --> 02:21:49,696
I still don't believe this guy

2709
02:21:50,976 --> 02:21:52,768
I'm not defending Seth Green

2710
02:21:56,864 --> 02:21:57,376
That's all

2711
02:21:57,632 --> 02:21:58,656
And I love that Alex

2712
02:21:58,912 --> 02:22:02,240
Like because he's been burned in the past is like he said chicken

2713
02:22:08,896 --> 02:22:11,456
Whatever I'm listening to I feel like Alex

2714
02:22:11,712 --> 02:22:12,736
Is getting out a lot of

2715
02:22:12,992 --> 02:22:14,016
The frustration that he has

2716
02:22:14,272 --> 02:22:14,784
With himself

2717
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:15,808
No

2718
02:22:16,064 --> 02:22:17,344

Naming Seth Green

2733
02:23:31,072 --> 02:23:32,608

Nobody understands Alex Jones better than you

2742
02:24:00,512 --> 02:24:06,656
I got the tiniest bit

2743
02:24:06,912 --> 02:24:13,056
Usually have nope

2744
02:24:13,312 --> 02:24:15,104
We can't swear on the

2745
02:24:17,152 --> 02:24:22,784
I very rarely ever hear some almost

2746
02:24:23,296 --> 02:24:25,856
Like I was writing in my head like oh he didn't say f***

2747
02:24:29,952 --> 02:24:31,232
Upgrade

2748
02:24:31,488 --> 02:24:34,560
Alex is going

2749
02:24:37,888 --> 02:24:39,936
Russian agent Adam Schiff

2750
02:24:40,448 --> 02:24:45,824
By the way you go to fill your hand.

2751
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:47,872
Click sports shop needs help

2752
02:24:49,408 --> 02:24:50,688
The other thing dude

02:24:50,944 --> 02:24:51,712
Is that like

2754
02:24:52,736 --> 02:24:53,504
I've made it very clear

2755
02:24:54,784 --> 02:24:56,064
I think this is

2756
02:24:56,576 --> 02:24:57,344
Descendants 2

2757
02:24:57,600 --> 02:24:58,368
Not good

2758
02:24:58,624 --> 02:25:00,928
It's not good but he comes up with a rebuttal

2759
02:25:01,184 --> 02:25:02,464
That I think is actually

2760
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:03,232
Worth exam

2761
02:25:04,256 --> 02:25:05,536
Bouillabaisse

2762
02:25:07,328 --> 02:25:09,120
If what I'm saying is

2763
02:25:09,632 --> 02:25:11,168
Why would there be such

2764
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:12,448
Effort

2765
02:25:12,960 --> 02:25:16,544
Shut me down on every platform that it's called state

2766
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:18,080
Control cuz it's libel

2767
02:25:21,152 --> 02:25:27,296
Cuz you're slandering someone

2768
02:25:29,344 --> 02:25:30,112
If you type it

2769
02:25:30,368 --> 02:25:31,136
Even weather

2770
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:34,464
If I

2771
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:36,000
You are without

2772
02:25:36,256 --> 02:25:38,560
Evidence other than he said chicken

2773
02:25:39,584 --> 02:25:40,096
Mickey

2774
02:25:43,424 --> 02:25:45,728
If I had

2775
02:25:45,984 --> 02:25:47,520
Why would ever BB

2776
02:25:47,776 --> 02:25:49,568
Trying to prosecute for me

2777
02:25:49,824 --> 02:25:50,336
For murder

2778
02:25:50,848 --> 02:25:56,992
Come on doesn't murder somebody why would everybody be trying to save a timer

2779
02:25:57,504 --> 02:26:03,392
Because it's so true

2780
02:26:05,952 --> 02:26:07,488
Wrong that's not good

2781
02:26:11,072 --> 02:26:11,840
You're too good at this

2782
02:26:12,352 --> 02:26:13,888
I was hoping to

2783
02:26:14,144 --> 02:26:16,704
Like I was hoping to like never discussed the

2784
02:26:23,360 --> 02:26:25,664
Chicken are in the

2785
02:26:28,992 --> 02:26:31,808
Robot Chicken for dinner

2786
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:35,136
Could have been on air for 13 years

2787
02:26:35,648 --> 02:26:37,696
Premiere 2005

2788
02:26:38,464 --> 02:26:40,768
The reason that I was hoping to like tea

2789
02:26:41,024 --> 02:26:41,536
Cheez-It outage

2790
02:26:41,792 --> 02:26:42,304
Just because

2791
02:26:42,816 --> 02:26:43,328
They don't

2792
02:26:43,584 --> 02:26:45,632
Bring it up for quite a while

2793
02:26:45,888 --> 02:26:48,704
Until Alex does in this

2794
02:26:50,752 --> 02:26:52,288
Let me ask you this question cabby

2795
02:26:52,544 --> 02:26:55,872
You're really good buddies we looked it up we just believe

2796
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:57,920
Seth Green going back for years

2797
02:26:58,432 --> 02:27:01,760
Charlie against TV shows called Robot Chicken

2798
02:27:02,272 --> 02:27:03,040
Chicken Joe

2799
02:27:03,552 --> 02:27:06,624
Is this not the ultimate out doing Sacha Baron Cohen

2800
02:27:08,928 --> 02:27:13,024
I would like to dispel this one more time

2801
02:27:13,536 --> 02:27:14,560
Cool

2802
02:27:15,072 --> 02:27:15,584
I like

2803
02:27:16,096 --> 02:27:16,608
Alex is like

2804
02:27:17,376 --> 02:27:18,144
I'd like his

2805
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:18,912
Beer

2806
02:27:19,168 --> 02:27:20,960
You don't ever say you don't like I like

2807
02:27:21,728 --> 02:27:22,240
He's gun-shy

2808
02:27:22,496 --> 02:27:23,008
A little bit

2809
02:27:23,264 --> 02:27:24,288
Because he's wrong

2810
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:25,824
Crazy

2811
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:28,640
But I like the idea of it like because

2812
02:27:28,896 --> 02:27:31,456
Everyone

2813
02:27:31,712 --> 02:27:32,992
But now he has to be like

2814
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:35,808
Really on his guard

2815
02:27:38,368 --> 02:27:40,928
The chicken strip

2816
02:27:41,184 --> 02:27:42,208
Some sort of weird

2817
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:43,488
Prank

2818
02:27:43,744 --> 02:27:45,024
What's going on is

2819
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:51,424
I'd like to know I know

2820
02:27:51,680 --> 02:27:52,704
I know

2821
02:27:52,960 --> 02:27:53,984
I was

2822
02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:57,568
That's like that's like a child

2823
02:27:57,824 --> 02:27:59,104
Find The Rock

2824
02:27:59,360 --> 02:28:02,944
But interesting solution to a problem

2825
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:04,224
Alright so this

2826
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:06,016
Fifth Circle doesn't fit in

2827
02:28:07,296 --> 02:28:09,600
But the cube

2828
02:28:10,112 --> 02:28:11,648
Will fit into the diamond hole

2829
02:28:12,928 --> 02:28:14,976
Well if we make the

2830
02:28:15,488 --> 02:28:16,000
V2

2831
02:28:16,256 --> 02:28:22,400
Bigger the circle will fit

2832
02:28:22,656 --> 02:28:23,168
They're thinking

2833
02:28:24,704 --> 02:28:26,240
That's creativity at least

2834
02:28:26,496 --> 02:28:29,056
That's how low the bar is ballot

2835
02:28:33,664 --> 02:28:35,968
Intimately please

2836
02:28:37,248 --> 02:28:39,808
Then he actually brought up Robot Chicken at all

2837
02:28:43,904 --> 02:28:45,184
Of course you would bring up robot

2838
02:28:45,440 --> 02:28:45,952
Chicken and then

2839
02:28:46,208 --> 02:28:48,000
And when you said it used

2840
02:28:48,256 --> 02:28:49,536
Surprised that he pushed back at all

2841
02:28:50,304 --> 02:28:50,816
Oh yeah

2842
02:28:51,584 --> 02:28:52,608
Of course because if

2843
02:28:57,984 --> 02:28:59,008
Chicken would never have come up at

2844
02:29:02,848 --> 02:29:03,616
No I don't

2845
02:29:04,128 --> 02:29:10,272
I don't know I don't know if it's

2846
02:29:10,528 --> 02:29:11,296
Burned so many times

2847
02:29:11,552 --> 02:29:13,600
This would be such the thing where he's like

2848
02:29:13,856 --> 02:29:18,464
Let's throw into let's go let's go hold let's go all the way

2849
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:19,232
Peace

2850
02:29:19,744 --> 02:29:20,512
I didn't bring up

2851
02:29:21,024 --> 02:29:22,048
Kind of unnecessary

2852
02:29:23,328 --> 02:29:23,840
Conversation

2853
02:29:24,096 --> 02:29:24,608
It's relevant

2854
02:29:24,864 --> 02:29:27,424
I think one of the biggest reasons that Alex is like

2855
02:29:28,448 --> 02:29:30,240
With or without Sacha Baron Cohen

2856
02:29:30,496 --> 02:29:32,800
Would be pushing back against this guy a little bit

2857
02:29:33,056 --> 02:29:33,824
Goody's getting sued

2858
02:29:35,872 --> 02:29:38,432
The Cuban on world and like the reading 4chan

2859
02:29:39,712 --> 02:29:40,480
It's about him

2860
02:29:40,992 --> 02:29:43,040
Are largely like don't trust this guy

2861
02:29:43,552 --> 02:29:45,088
Like most of the internet

2862
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:46,880
Conspiracy Community has

2863
02:29:47,392 --> 02:29:48,928
Red flags on Isaac Kappy

2864
02:29:49,696 --> 02:29:50,208
Okay

2865
02:29:50,464 --> 02:29:53,280
Because there are stories like about him choking

2866
02:29:54,304 --> 02:29:56,096
Right because there are people

2867
02:29:56,352 --> 02:29:58,400
From his path to Heaven automatically posted on the

2868
02:29:59,424 --> 02:30:00,448
About knowing him and

2869
02:30:01,728 --> 02:30:02,496
Kind of horror guy

2870
02:30:02,752 --> 02:30:05,824
Yeah then also there are other stories

2871
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:06,592
Peter Parker

2872
02:30:06,848 --> 02:30:08,640
Football I can't really sort these out or not

2873
02:30:08,896 --> 02:30:10,688
I'm only reporting this in as much as

2874
02:30:11,456 --> 02:30:11,968
Why

2875
02:30:12,224 --> 02:30:12,736
These internet commute

2876
02:30:12,992 --> 02:30:13,504
Please don't trust

2877
02:30:15,552 --> 02:30:16,064
He's tried to

2878
02:30:16,576 --> 02:30:17,088
Private message

2879
02:30:18,112 --> 02:30:19,136
Get people

2880
02:30:19,392 --> 02:30:21,440
Who are quote-unquote whistleblowers

2881
02:30:21,952 --> 02:30:23,232
To identify themselves

2882
02:30:23,488 --> 02:30:25,024
As if it were a dachshund Opera

2883
02:30:25,536 --> 02:30:28,608
Like trying to get private if yeah yeah

2884
02:30:28,864 --> 02:30:35,008
I don't know if that's true but that's what they're saying on the Wind about him about him

2885
02:30:35,264 --> 02:30:36,800
I think Alex

2886
02:30:37,056 --> 02:30:38,336
Took this on as like a

2887
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:41,408
I'm playing

2888
02:30:42,944 --> 02:30:43,712
Another goddamn poker

2889
02:30:43,968 --> 02:30:47,040
Metaphor but I'm playing

2890
02:30:47,552 --> 02:30:48,832
Maybe something weird will happen

2891
02:30:49,088 --> 02:30:51,648
You know he's accepting this interview as like

2892
02:30:51,904 --> 02:30:53,440
I'm coming in with a bad hand

2893
02:30:54,208 --> 02:30:55,488
I can walk away from

2894
02:30:55,744 --> 02:30:59,840
Fold in the middle of this there's no big deal I'm not I'm not emotionally invested in this

2895
02:31:00,096 --> 02:31:00,608
But if it hits

2896
02:31:00,864 --> 02:31:05,472
It's going to hit big

2897
02:31:05,984 --> 02:31:07,264
But the weird thing that happened

2898
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:08,032
Is it like

2899
02:31:08,288 --> 02:31:09,312
Alex pushes back

2900
02:31:11,360 --> 02:31:12,128
And then he's like

2901
02:31:12,384 --> 02:31:13,920
He has a show called Robot Chicken

2902
02:31:14,432 --> 02:31:15,200
Sacha Baron Cohen

2903
02:31:15,456 --> 02:31:18,272
People right now do you understand what's going on

2904
02:31:18,528 --> 02:31:20,320
You get so are you f****** with me yet

2905
02:31:20,832 --> 02:31:21,600
That all out of his sister

2906
02:31:22,112 --> 02:31:22,624
And then

2907
02:31:23,136 --> 02:31:23,648
A

2908
02:31:23,904 --> 02:31:24,416
Said it is

2909
02:31:24,672 --> 02:31:25,440
It's almost like

2910
02:31:25,952 --> 02:31:26,976
His hot-headedness

2911
02:31:27,232 --> 02:31:27,744
Cool

2912
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:29,024
And then he's like

2913
02:31:29,536 --> 02:31:30,816
Yeah I know they are f****** kid

2914
02:31:31,072 --> 02:31:32,352
Hollywood

2915
02:31:33,376 --> 02:31:35,168
It kind of becomes like

2916
02:31:35,424 --> 02:31:35,936
Yeah

2917
02:31:36,704 --> 02:31:38,752
Really aggressive Isaac is like

2918
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:41,312
People f******

2919
02:31:41,568 --> 02:31:43,616
Use the right

2920
02:31:43,872 --> 02:31:44,384
And then Alex

2921
02:31:45,152 --> 02:31:45,664
Just like

2922
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:46,944
Yeah right you're cool

2923
02:31:49,760 --> 02:31:52,576
You didn't say anything

2924
02:31:52,832 --> 02:31:53,344
Yeah

2925
02:31:54,112 --> 02:31:55,136
You still out

2926
02:31:55,392 --> 02:31:55,904
For like

2927
02:31:57,184 --> 02:31:58,464
Turn our it's crazy

2928
02:31:58,976 --> 02:31:59,488
It's crazy

2929
02:32:01,536 --> 02:32:02,048
This

2930
02:32:02,816 --> 02:32:03,840
There's not there's no more me

2931
02:32:04,608 --> 02:32:05,120
Yeah

2932
02:32:07,168 --> 02:32:09,728
We've got what we wanted to get everything else that Isaac

2933
02:32:09,984 --> 02:32:12,032
Abby says is all just like

2934
02:32:12,800 --> 02:32:13,824
The same shed

2935
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:16,128
And like I think this

2936
02:32:16,384 --> 02:32:17,408
I think no

2937
02:32:18,176 --> 02:32:18,688
Yaddle

2938
02:32:18,944 --> 02:32:20,992
Yeah so we we've dealt with him I haven't

2939
02:32:21,248 --> 02:32:22,016
The child delivery

2940
02:32:22,528 --> 02:32:24,576
We've heard him say that Seth Green has a

2941
02:32:27,136 --> 02:32:27,904
What animal

2942
02:32:28,160 --> 02:32:29,696
Yeah and that you talked about chick

2943
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:31,232
However

2944
02:32:31,744 --> 02:32:33,536
This is the most important

2945
02:32:34,048 --> 02:32:37,120
Obertal

2946
02:32:39,424 --> 02:32:40,192
With two dudes

2947
02:32:40,448 --> 02:32:41,472
Who are both trying

2948
02:32:41,728 --> 02:32:43,008
Two light

2949
02:32:44,032 --> 02:32:44,800
Coming to Loggerhead

2950
02:32:45,568 --> 02:32:46,848
Okay

2951
02:32:49,664 --> 02:32:53,760
Why doesn't

2952
02:32:54,016 --> 02:32:58,880
Okay

2953
02:32:59,392 --> 02:33:02,976
Blackmail material

2954
02:33:03,232 --> 02:33:03,744
Private

2955
02:33:04,256 --> 02:33:07,584
16

2956
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:09,632
Maybe 16 I mean

2957
02:33:16,032 --> 02:33:18,592
Habitat

2958
02:33:23,200 --> 02:33:24,480
And

2959
02:33:28,320 --> 02:33:30,624
Clips not done

2960
02:33:30,880 --> 02:33:31,904
Eclipse not done

2961
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:34,976
But that's the greatest thing ever

2962
02:33:36,768 --> 02:33:37,536
Don't you dare

2963
02:33:38,048 --> 02:33:41,632
F****** know Seth Green

2964
02:33:41,888 --> 02:33:48,032
What is your age

2965
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:51,872
I don't

2966
02:33:52,128 --> 02:33:55,200
Call Honey

2967
02:34:02,112 --> 02:34:02,880
I haven't pointed this out

2968
02:34:03,136 --> 02:34:04,160
At All by the way

2969
02:34:04,416 --> 02:34:06,208
The guy in studio

2970
02:34:06,464 --> 02:34:07,744
Co-hosting with Alex

2971
02:34:08,256 --> 02:34:09,792
Who runs

2972
02:34:10,048 --> 02:34:16,192
The TV network that plays out like he has some sort of like maybe a satellite TV channel plays in

2973
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:18,240
I haven't played any of them cuz

2974
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:21,824
It's like a booty song.

2975
02:34:25,408 --> 02:34:26,944
Just an idiot

2976
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:31,040
Sitting next to them

2977
02:34:31,296 --> 02:34:33,344
First of all the whole thing about chicken

2978
02:34:38,976 --> 02:34:40,000
You know hey

2979
02:34:40,256 --> 02:34:42,304
Yeah I'm sure you've been to the parties but you're not like

2980
02:34:42,560 --> 02:34:44,608
Good friends with you like that

2981
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:48,960
I know I know a lot of

2982
02:34:49,728 --> 02:34:50,240
Today

2983
02:34:50,752 --> 02:34:51,776
So here's with Echo

2984
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:16,864
No one wins

2985
02:35:22,240 --> 02:35:26,080
Because Alex is trying to

2986
02:35:26,336 --> 02:35:29,152
Talked him out with the actors

2987
02:35:29,408 --> 02:35:30,688
The Producers tried to get me

2988
02:35:30,944 --> 02:35:31,456
I meant

2989
02:35:31,968 --> 02:35:32,480
Very

2990
02:35:32,736 --> 02:35:33,504
Correctly

2991
02:35:34,016 --> 02:35:35,040
Cathy Hughes like

2992
02:35:35,296 --> 02:35:41,440
Steph Curry has a giant production company

2993
02:35:44,768 --> 02:35:47,584

Forgotten his name

3002
02:36:17,536 --> 02:36:18,048
He's not important

3003
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:21,120
You know what in Hollywood what it is

3004
02:36:21,376 --> 02:36:22,912

I don't know if they're still at the same place

3016

But they were working for

3017
02:36:46,208 --> 02:36:46,976
Largest

3018
02:36:47,232 --> 02:36:48,512
Casting agencies

You know like what they go through in

3024
02:37:01,568 --> 02:37:02,592
From high school

3025
02:37:03,104 --> 02:37:03,872
I knew

3026
02:37:04,128 --> 02:37:05,152
They were like

3027
02:37:05,408 --> 02:37:06,688
And I'm using a

3028
02:37:06,944 --> 02:37:07,456
Ambiguous

3030
02:37:09,248 --> 02:37:10,272
They don't need

3031
02:37:11,296 --> 02:37:12,064

3033
02:37:20,256 --> 02:37:21,280

3034
02:37:22,048 --> 02:37:22,560
Yeah they made me

3035
02:37:22,816 --> 02:37:23,328

Long time

3040
02:37:31,008 --> 02:37:31,776
Chronological

3041
02:37:32,032 --> 02:37:34,336
Right but I which is why I don't have a job

3042
02:37:36,896 --> 02:37:37,408
2 years

3043
02:37:37,664 --> 02:37:39,456
Actually had a real conversation

3044
02:37:39,968 --> 02:37:40,992
I care about them very much

3045
02:37:42,272 --> 02:37:43,296
Amazingly

3046
02:37:43,552 --> 02:37:44,064
Social

3047
02:37:44,576 --> 02:37:46,880
Which flies counter

3048
02:37:47,136 --> 02:37:49,440
To the little bit very dumb

3049
02:37:49,696 --> 02:37:50,208
But

3050
02:37:59,680 --> 02:38:01,216
Hollywood

3051
02:38:01,472 --> 02:38:02,496
That's a big giant

3052
02:38:02,752 --> 02:38:04,800
Fly zapper a big web

3053
02:38:05,056 --> 02:38:07,104
Where they can now be in charge

3054
02:38:07,616 --> 02:38:09,408
And a cheerleader that wouldn't date them

3055
02:38:09,664 --> 02:38:12,480
They're going to crap all over her and make them

3056
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:16,064
Like a pump talked about

3057
02:38:23,744 --> 02:38:27,072
Super Princess Lakes

3058
02:38:28,096 --> 02:38:28,864

3059
02:38:36,032 --> 02:38:37,568

Right

3061
02:38:40,896 --> 02:38:41,408
Floating

3062
02:38:42,688 --> 02:38:48,320
Booty shorts

3063
02:38:48,576 --> 02:38:51,136
They crap all over

3064
02:38:51,392 --> 02:38:53,184
The agency is on you

3065
02:38:53,440 --> 02:38:55,744
Write the crapper and the crappie

3066
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:57,536
Yeah but that's metaphorical

3067
02:38:58,048 --> 02:38:58,560
Politically

3068
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:07,520
I don't know

3069
02:39:09,568 --> 02:39:12,896
Dammit Godzilla jail what is going on

3071
02:39:17,248 --> 02:39:21,600
No adults around

3072
02:39:21,856 --> 02:39:28,000
This is a Friday show because it's sort of like on Friday we let it all hang out

3073
02:39:29,024 --> 02:39:33,632
Retroactively

3074
02:39:35,168 --> 02:39:35,936
What are we doing

3075
02:39:36,192 --> 02:39:37,216
I also love to like

3076
02:39:37,472 --> 02:39:37,984
If we can just take

3077
02:39:39,264 --> 02:39:40,544
The brakes he's talkin about

3078
02:39:41,824 --> 02:39:42,336
Can people eat

3079
02:39:42,592 --> 02:39:43,360
S***

3080
02:39:43,616 --> 02:39:44,640
Richard

3081
02:39:45,152 --> 02:39:48,992
Confirmed earlier he said that

3082
02:39:49,248 --> 02:39:55,392
Track mean something else with which weekend

3083
02:39:56,672 --> 02:40:00,256
Imagine if the prenup your ass I have no idea I don't know

3084
02:40:01,792 --> 02:40:03,584
The issue that I Come Away With It Is

3085
02:40:04,608 --> 02:40:08,448
Isaac Kappy said f*** on the show he's like his family

3086
02:40:08,704 --> 02:40:09,984
No it's not

3087
02:40:10,240 --> 02:40:16,128
I forgot I forgot

3088
02:40:17,152 --> 02:40:20,736
Like Scott Aukerman on Comedy Bang Bang as a joke

3089
02:40:22,272 --> 02:40:28,416
Felicia

3090
02:40:28,672 --> 02:40:33,280
Don't you know how the family gathers around like

I hate him in the

3093
02:40:40,704 --> 02:40:41,472
President because there's

3094
02:40:41,728 --> 02:40:43,264
Nothing really of substance

3095
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:44,800
It's all of this

3096
02:40:45,056 --> 02:40:45,568
Nonsense

3097
02:40:49,664 --> 02:40:52,992
There's a part of me that likes it on some level just

3098
02:40:57,856 --> 02:40:58,368
I can't finish

3099
02:40:59,904 --> 02:41:02,720
His show is A Prairie Home Companion

3100
02:41:02,976 --> 02:41:04,512
Except for sometimes they talked about

3101
02:41:04,768 --> 02:41:05,536

3102
02:41:09,632 --> 02:41:10,912
How to give a like abroad predict

3103
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:14,240

A broad abroad

3105
02:41:17,312 --> 02:41:17,824
No ice

3106
02:41:22,432 --> 02:41:24,992
Video of the things that I'm going to forget you

3107
02:41:25,504 --> 02:41:26,272
Be the thing

3108
02:41:29,600 --> 02:41:32,672
The things that I'm going to predict

3109
02:41:33,184 --> 02:41:35,744
So there's three there's a police record

3110
02:41:36,256 --> 02:41:37,280
Dear

3111
02:41:37,536 --> 02:41:38,816

3112
02:41:39,328 --> 02:41:42,144
He's going to from these lawsuits has learned his lesson

3113
02:41:42,912 --> 02:41:43,424
That like

3114
02:41:44,704 --> 02:41:45,216
Do this

3115
02:41:45,728 --> 02:41:46,240
Civilian

3116
02:41:47,008 --> 02:41:48,032
People in power

3117
02:41:49,312 --> 02:41:49,824
Care

3118
02:41:50,080 --> 02:41:53,152
You can yell about Soros being a demon all you want

3119
02:41:53,408 --> 02:41:54,432
He's never going to sue you

3120
02:41:56,480 --> 02:41:58,784
You didn't care about whatever bulshit you're saying

3121
02:41:59,552 --> 02:42:01,088
If you knows it's not true and you know it

3122
02:42:02,368 --> 02:42:03,392
So whatever

3123
02:42:03,648 --> 02:42:05,440
Just live your life until you know enjoy it

3124
02:42:05,696 --> 02:42:08,768
He can do this to the pope cuz opposed not going to sue him for

3125
02:42:09,280 --> 02:42:13,888
Pope has much bigger things to do like recently

3126
02:42:14,144 --> 02:42:15,168
The capital punishment is

3127
02:42:15,424 --> 02:42:16,448
Is no good right

3128
02:42:16,704 --> 02:42:20,544
He's also said that hell isn't real

3129
02:42:20,800 --> 02:42:21,568
Hey big

3130
02:42:21,824 --> 02:42:23,872
Issues on his plate

3131
02:42:24,384 --> 02:42:24,896
Through

3132
02:42:25,408 --> 02:42:26,176
Eating a bowl of s***

3133
02:42:26,688 --> 02:42:31,552
Like he was doing while he's like

3134
02:42:31,808 --> 02:42:32,576
Capital punishment

3135
02:42:32,832 --> 02:42:33,344
Cannot do it

3136
02:42:33,600 --> 02:42:36,160
Audi

3137
02:42:36,672 --> 02:42:38,464
I'm still going to protect child molesters but

3138
02:42:43,328 --> 02:42:44,864
What report

3139
02:42:45,120 --> 02:42:51,264
Crudite wild humane

3140
02:42:51,520 --> 02:42:55,872
There they could smell it

3141
02:42:56,384 --> 02:42:57,920
Smilax

3142
02:42:59,200 --> 02:42:59,712
Verity

3143
02:43:00,992 --> 02:43:06,880
Landing on Obama around his mouth as the Pope's

3144
02:43:10,208 --> 02:43:14,048
So I don't I don't know what my point was necessarily about like what the

3145
02:43:14,304 --> 02:43:15,072
Value of press

3146
02:43:15,328 --> 02:43:15,840
Today is

3147
02:43:16,096 --> 02:43:16,608
I guess it's

3148
02:43:17,888 --> 02:43:21,216
Nothing alike spread Maybe

3149
02:43:21,728 --> 02:43:22,496
But I do like

3150
02:43:22,752 --> 02:43:23,264
How

3151
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:24,032
Weird

3152
02:43:27,104 --> 02:43:28,896
Who knows there's this last clip here

3153
02:43:31,712 --> 02:43:32,224
I think it's a

3154
02:43:36,832 --> 02:43:37,856
There's nothing

3155
02:43:39,136 --> 02:43:40,672
Like legitimately

3156
02:43:41,184 --> 02:43:41,696
This doesn't

3157
02:43:41,952 --> 02:43:42,720
Come out as like

3158
02:43:42,976 --> 02:43:45,536
A natural inorganic

3159
02:43:45,792 --> 02:43:47,072
Evolution of the conversation

3160
02:43:48,096 --> 02:43:48,608
To go like

3161
02:43:49,632 --> 02:43:50,144
18 seconds

3162
02:43:50,400 --> 02:43:50,912
Before to give

3163
02:43:52,192 --> 02:43:54,240
It would actually make it

3164
02:43:54,496 --> 02:43:55,264
More confusing

3165
02:43:55,520 --> 02:43:57,056
Because the guy

3166
02:43:57,312 --> 02:43:57,824
Who runs AT&T

3167
02:43:58,592 --> 02:43:59,360
Network

3168
02:44:00,640 --> 02:44:01,152
Completely

3169
02:44:04,224 --> 02:44:05,248
They sent a transmission

3170
02:44:06,784 --> 02:44:10,112
There's a transmission, emanating out of

3171
02:44:12,416 --> 02:44:15,232
Spiritual blackout

3172
02:44:18,048 --> 02:44:18,560
Planets

3173
02:44:18,816 --> 02:44:19,328
Kill yourself

3174
02:44:19,584 --> 02:44:21,376
No do not listen transmission

3175
02:44:22,144 --> 02:44:23,936
There's a bigger transmission from God

3176
02:44:24,192 --> 02:44:24,704
Sing don't do it

3177
02:44:27,264 --> 02:44:28,288
Alex

3178
02:44:29,824 --> 02:44:30,592
He's not saying

3179
02:44:30,848 --> 02:44:32,384
Believe

3180
02:44:32,896 --> 02:44:34,176
He's arguing that

3181
02:44:34,432 --> 02:44:34,944
From a black

3182
02:44:35,968 --> 02:44:40,064
There's a transmission that's trying to say kill yourself to a bunch of planets

3183
02:44:40,320 --> 02:44:40,832
That are unoccupied

3184
02:44:43,392 --> 02:44:44,928
We are getting the transmission from

3185
02:44:45,184 --> 02:44:47,744
The black hole thing we should kill ourselves

3186
02:44:48,256 --> 02:44:50,048
Because we know Alex Jones enough you mean

3187
02:44:50,560 --> 02:44:51,584
Give minorities rights in

3188
02:44:52,096 --> 02:44:52,608
Liberal with

3189
02:44:53,376 --> 02:44:56,192
With the

3190
02:44:56,448 --> 02:44:59,776
Accepting

3191
02:45:01,568 --> 02:45:03,104
And because we already know

3192
02:45:04,384 --> 02:45:05,152
Trump is Christ

3193
02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:08,480
Do what Christ would do

3194
02:45:09,504 --> 02:45:10,016
Which is

3195
02:45:10,528 --> 02:45:11,040
Be a monster

3196
02:45:11,552 --> 02:45:12,576
Explain to me

3197
02:45:12,832 --> 02:45:13,344
Real quick

3198
02:45:15,904 --> 02:45:16,672
Black hole

3199
02:45:18,208 --> 02:45:19,232
Which they believe

3200
02:45:22,560 --> 02:45:23,072
Right

3201
02:45:24,608 --> 02:45:25,120
Send out a

3202
02:45:25,376 --> 02:45:26,912
Spiritual transmission

3203
02:45:27,168 --> 02:45:29,216
Which would be tough to get out of the Event Horizon

3204
02:45:30,496 --> 02:45:31,776
To get a message

3205
02:45:32,032 --> 02:45:38,176
Of the things that we've all read Einstein's theory of relativity

3206
02:45:38,432 --> 02:45:42,016
Tivity we know that the only thing that escapes The Event Horizon is the spirit

3207
02:45:43,040 --> 02:45:43,552
Messenger

3208
02:45:45,344 --> 02:45:47,904
Show me the f****** message

3209
02:45:48,416 --> 02:45:51,744
Read out a spiritual message willy-nilly

3210
02:45:52,512 --> 02:45:54,048
360 degree

3211
02:45:55,072 --> 02:45:55,840
All over the place

3212
02:45:56,096 --> 02:45:58,912
You know the black hole

3213
02:45:59,168 --> 02:46:00,960
Is like a Russo's transmission

3214
02:46:01,216 --> 02:46:02,240
You so more

3215
02:46:06,591 --> 02:46:07,359
Give up all hope

3216
02:46:07,615 --> 02:46:08,895
Right there.

3217
02:46:09,151 --> 02:46:10,431
So-so

3218
02:46:13,503 --> 02:46:19,647
Is that a thing are they

3219
02:46:19,903 --> 02:46:24,767
Black holders the black hole

3220
02:46:25,023 --> 02:46:29,631
Is that

3221
02:46:30,143 --> 02:46:32,191
Tasmac

3222
02:46:32,447 --> 02:46:35,263
Like what's going on here

3223
02:46:35,519 --> 02:46:36,543
Most concerned

3224
02:46:36,799 --> 02:46:37,823
Jordan

3225
02:46:38,079 --> 02:46:38,591
The black hole

3226
02:46:39,615 --> 02:46:40,127
You got this

3227
02:46:44,479 --> 02:46:44,991
Perry

3228
02:46:46,015 --> 02:46:48,319
Probably a Muslim

3229
02:46:48,575 --> 02:46:50,623
Who hates Western Civilization

3230
02:46:50,879 --> 02:46:55,999
On the other end of that black hole

3231
02:46:56,255 --> 02:47:01,631
Just look at the center of every Galaxy there is a supermassive black hole

3232
02:47:02,143 --> 02:47:03,679
The center of every supermassive black hole

3233
02:47:03,935 --> 02:47:05,215
There is a supermassive Muslim

3234
02:47:05,471 --> 02:47:08,543
Right or non-western percent

3235
02:47:10,335 --> 02:47:12,383
Obviously and Alex's brain

3236
02:47:12,639 --> 02:47:13,151
Representative

3237
02:47:13,407 --> 02:47:17,759
First swap

3238
02:47:18,015 --> 02:47:20,575
Well it black all is probably the best

3239
02:47:21,343 --> 02:47:24,415
I love I love this because we've done now

3240
02:47:24,927 --> 02:47:25,951
We walked ourselves backwards

3241
02:47:26,207 --> 02:47:27,231
Listen to like what

3242
02:47:27,999 --> 02:47:28,767
He's the perfect been

3243
02:47:29,023 --> 02:47:29,791
Garrison cartoon

3244
02:47:30,303 --> 02:47:36,447
Still

3245
02:47:43,871 --> 02:47:47,711
He's riding a bar of gold offered the distance for no reason

3246
02:47:50,015 --> 02:47:51,551
Yeah why not what the fuc

3247
02:47:53,343 --> 02:47:55,647
I love it though man that's nonsense

3248
02:47:58,463 --> 02:48:02,303
And also it's really fun way to end an episode where Alex is

3249
02:48:05,887 --> 02:48:07,679
Like we spent the beginning of this

3250
02:48:07,935 --> 02:48:09,215
With him defending himself

3251
02:48:09,471 --> 02:48:09,983
About these

3252
02:48:10,239 --> 02:48:12,031
Really real lawsuits that are happening

3253
02:48:12,543 --> 02:48:13,055
Disgusting

3254
02:48:13,823 --> 02:48:15,103
In-N-Out

3255
02:48:15,359 --> 02:48:17,151
The best of our ability is Outsiders

3256
02:48:17,919 --> 02:48:18,687
Involved in his court case

3257
02:48:19,711 --> 02:48:20,223
You probably should be

3258
02:48:21,247 --> 02:48:25,343
To the stand maybe great we know what we know and what we don't we don't pretend

3259
02:48:25,599 --> 02:48:26,623
Right

3260
02:48:26,879 --> 02:48:27,903
And that was the beginning of it

3261
02:48:28,415 --> 02:48:29,183
I'm in the middle of it you got it

3262
02:48:30,463 --> 02:48:31,231
Clunky b*******

3263
02:48:31,743 --> 02:48:32,255
What about the Amish

3264
02:48:32,767 --> 02:48:34,047
And then

3265
02:48:34,303 --> 02:48:35,071
Do you have any

3266
02:48:35,839 --> 02:48:36,351
Weber tow

3267
02:48:36,607 --> 02:48:38,399
Talk about chicken

3268
02:48:40,447 --> 02:48:43,263
Video

3269
02:48:43,519 --> 02:48:45,055
I don't mean to I don't mean to like

3270
02:48:45,311 --> 02:48:46,079
Undersell that

3271
02:48:46,335 --> 02:48:47,615
No

3272
02:48:47,871 --> 02:48:49,663
I know that he's already in the

3273
02:48:51,199 --> 02:48:51,711
GameStop in

3274
02:48:51,967 --> 02:48:52,735
Like periscope

3275
02:48:55,551 --> 02:48:57,855
Is Growlithe should not have let him on the show

3276
02:48:58,367 --> 02:48:59,135
Because he

3277
02:48:59,391 --> 02:48:59,903
He was going to say

3278
02:49:02,207 --> 02:49:04,511
There's every there's every

3279
02:49:05,791 --> 02:49:06,303
As a

3280
02:49:07,071 --> 02:49:07,839
Show

3281
02:49:10,143 --> 02:49:10,655
Curating

3282
02:49:11,423 --> 02:49:11,935
A presentation

3283
02:49:13,215 --> 02:49:14,495
When you have a guest on

3284
02:49:15,007 --> 02:49:16,543
You have a slight responsibility

3285
02:49:17,055 --> 02:49:18,591
Understand what they're going to say

3286
02:49:18,847 --> 02:49:19,871
Yeah and if they

3287
02:49:22,175 --> 02:49:23,199
Commit libel

3288
02:49:23,967 --> 02:49:26,271
The little on you arrivals usually an issue

3289
02:49:26,527 --> 02:49:28,063
Two little on you usually

3290
02:49:28,319 --> 02:49:29,087
Now that liable is

3291
02:49:29,599 --> 02:49:30,111
Slander is

3292
02:49:30,367 --> 02:49:30,879
Is that what you say

3293
02:49:31,135 --> 02:49:34,207
Right

3294
02:49:37,535 --> 02:49:40,351
Alex is still bogged down in lawsuits

3295
02:49:40,607 --> 02:49:41,119
Who gives a s***

3296
02:49:41,887 --> 02:49:43,935
Busy for awhile for sure

3297
02:49:44,447 --> 02:49:45,215
Slide Seth Green

3298
02:49:45,471 --> 02:49:46,495
Something litigious

3299
02:49:47,519 --> 02:49:48,031
Hey

3300
02:49:48,543 --> 02:49:49,823
I look forward

3301
02:49:51,103 --> 02:49:52,383
Nothing the next season of chicken

3302
02:49:52,895 --> 02:49:54,175
Which is a

3303
02:49:54,431 --> 02:49:54,943
Very different

3304
02:49:56,735 --> 02:50:00,063
Never hearing about this dude ever again

3305
02:50:02,367 --> 02:50:07,231
He's going to be in the new season of

3306
02:50:07,487 --> 02:50:08,767
Coming into talk s*** on his

3307
02:50:09,023 --> 02:50:15,167
Erstwhile friend of fun this has been a lot of fun. Sorry this month

3308
02:50:17,215 --> 02:50:21,823
But we have a website

3309
02:50:22,335 --> 02:50:23,871
We called that out of pianos

3310
02:50:24,895 --> 02:50:27,199
Where were technology.com

3311
02:50:27,455 --> 02:50:28,223
To find

3312
02:50:34,879 --> 02:50:41,023
Not the best Twitter presence in the world

3313
02:50:41,279 --> 02:50:42,559
Entirely so I am

3314
02:50:42,815 --> 02:50:43,327
I'm not good at

3315
02:50:43,583 --> 02:50:49,215
Social media

3316
02:50:49,471 --> 02:50:50,495
We think that there is

3317
02:50:51,007 --> 02:50:52,031
Consistent activity

3318
02:50:55,871 --> 02:50:56,639
We put the word out

3319
02:50:58,431 --> 02:51:00,991
To go is the group go home and tell your mother you're brilliant

3320
02:51:01,247 --> 02:51:04,063
We've seen a lot of traffic come in Racine

3321
02:51:04,319 --> 02:51:05,343
Walk

3322
02:51:05,599 --> 02:51:07,647
Listeners come on

3323
02:51:07,903 --> 02:51:09,439
Hangout

3324
02:51:09,695 --> 02:51:10,463
On the page

3325
02:51:10,719 --> 02:51:12,255
Not going by where the action was

3326
02:51:12,511 --> 02:51:13,023
And I appreciate

3327
02:51:13,279 --> 02:51:17,887
We're up over 300 and that group now

3328
02:51:18,143 --> 02:51:19,679

3337
02:51:53,471 --> 02:51:54,239

3347
02:52:18,559 --> 02:52:19,071
But

3348
02:52:19,327 --> 02:52:20,607
Episode

3349
02:52:20,863 --> 02:52:21,375
Tumi

3350
02:52:21,887 --> 02:52:23,935

3351
02:52:24,703 --> 02:52:25,983
And I'm going to go with

3352
02:52:27,775 --> 02:52:28,543
Being such

3353
02:52:30,079 --> 02:52:32,639
