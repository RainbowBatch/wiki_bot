00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

A Jordan is behind the bastards this week

9
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:23,712
Nice to have a nice time and sit down

10
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,784
What did I what did I would have liked

11
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,112
Grand old time to talk about the end of

12
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,416
I don't know I guess Christianity being nice

13
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:36,256
The beginning of something else

14
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,280
Something

15
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:43,168
No spoilers comes up on Thursday

16
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:46,752
It's it's a lot of us this week if you want

17
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,568
If you want Dan and Jordan content boy

18
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,848
Everyday

19
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:55,456
Ikea shudder at the thought of someone listening to me

20
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:00,576
Every day is starting out white

21
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,904
Overburdened our voices

22
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,488
Check that out enjoy Good Times

23
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:13,888
Yeah absolutely well that was going to be my pride aside so you stole that from me

24
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:19,520
But my bright spot is very stupid

25
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,312
But I have

26
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,360
Recently at the best

27
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,128
If no one

28
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:29,248
And without telling anyone embarked on a little comic strip adventure of my dog Jake

29
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,904
Series of a little situation

30
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,696
And I finished

31
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,464
Story

32
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,024
Again without telling anybody

33
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,816
And Jake is eaten by

34
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,632
So it is it's a tragic end

35
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,960
Is a mutiny that did it or no

36
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,520
Involved in the mutiny

37
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,312
Oh no she's just a grump

38
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:57,408
Maybe she'll have some Adventure suit

39
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,968
Go to music

40
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,784
But that was my bright spot

41
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,832
To take them where they come

42
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:09,440
Today we were talking about

43
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,768

00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,328

Talkabouttd

48
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:25,824
Oh man this is something else awfully

I'm not saying something that we've been on over the past week

50
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,992
This is a mess

51
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,528

You would think the globalist would stop writing their plans

62
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:19,071
I don't seem to be at Platt hold a hat

63
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,143
Text Keith

Bukavu globalist

66
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
I have

67
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
Risen above

68
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,247
Miami

69
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,319
Go take a little break you down

70
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,487
And then we're going to come back

71
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,559

72
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,679
F*** you

00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,431
Maybe the next few moments

78
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,759
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby 5 years

79
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,575
Real walk out of here tomorrow

80
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,111
And you never see me again

81
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,415
Only what I want to do

82
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,719
I never want to come back here again

83
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,255
Apologize to

84
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,303
Yesterday that I

85
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,375
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

86
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,167
I'll be better tomorrow

87
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:34,591
A lot better

88
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,151
I don't know I'll let you decide

89
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,199
Wow if there's there's a question

90
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:45,087
Our last episode we talked about

91
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,135
That video that Alex dude about his

92
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:47,903
Supposed

93
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:54,303
The prediction of the war predict beginning so much traffic with

94
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,375
The Alex crowd for the Auntie Alex crowd

95
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,679
Vivi whole like he predicted the war

96
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:06,079
They're there now saying wow he did it I think that I've seen far too many people tweeting nonsense about

97
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,895
I have this prediction is proof that he's a Russian

98
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:15,295
Here is getting information session intelligent

99
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,575
Anything with the

100
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
The

101
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,367
Deposition

102
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,951
It's the Dario could not handle being so it's not blurry

103
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,255
For an intelligence operation

104
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
She just got to have

105
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:32,191
I wouldn't if I were in charge of a country's like intelligence assets

106
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,727
I would dress her organization

107
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
No

108
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,103
Engage Metallica's materials off of difficult because it draws you in

109
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,383
People who want us

110
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,407
See his stupid predict

111
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:46,271
Video is proof that he works for rush hour already passed the point where Alex wants to lure them to

112
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,063
Because they've adopted his fundamental

113
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,599
Premise namely that he

114
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,903
He did actually predict this war

115
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:57,791
Whether you see that video and hailed him as a prophet or you accuse him of being a foreign asset either way you're playing his game

116
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:04,703
Both conclusion speeding to be his own attention economy and involve the belief that the things that Alex Azar worth

117
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,751
To do and not just random bulshit

118
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:11,359
He throws out so be cautious caution people

119
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,175
Do not fall into the opposite trap

120
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:18,271
Begin from the Occam's razor point of this man is always lying

121
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,855
I don't I don't I don't know if that's why is either because I

122
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,159
Think I could in a blind you too

123
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
I mean Alex Jones

124
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,535
I understand that it could blind you to me

125
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:35,423
I tried to call a taxi was applying I think it's a process though

126
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:39,007
If you can train yourself to 22

127
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,335
Hasty conclusion

128
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,431
It's just more of a if you can

129
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:49,503
Set the practice of like okay what is this

130
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
Information

131
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:55,391
I is exhausting

132
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
But it's it's

133
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,951
It is better

134
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,231
So

135
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,767
We start here

136
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,071
With Alex talking about how

137
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,399
You know Russia's kind of restrained

138
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,471
Restrained

139
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007
What you're seeing is a

140
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:12,799
Massive

141
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,567
Conventional

142
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,383
WWII Style

143
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
Invasion

144
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,199
Of Ukraine

145
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,015
And I'm not lying eyes in the Russian

146
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,039
Enter Putin butt

147
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
Wanted

148
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,855
To clear out

149
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,135
Those areas they would

150
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,415
Just dropped heavy Munitions on

151
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,695
A cluster bomb

152
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,231
Because I don't want

153
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
A high civilian

154
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,583
Facing massive casualties

155
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,655
With their infantry going in

156
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
To the areas

157
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:43,775
2

158
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,799
People that

159
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,823
Guns after

160
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
Dave

161
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,871
That's Riverside

162
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,895
I told her being fired up

163
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,991
Large Russian

164
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
That's all

165
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,295
From what I've been seeing I would imagine

166
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
There's 20,000

167
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:56,831
Walking Dead Russian

168
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,855
Trips not 5,000

169
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
Like

170
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,951
And I would imagine they're also

171
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,231
Thousands of dead

172
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:03,999
Ukrainians

173
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,047
But your aunt never be hearing about that

174
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:12,703
I have very little patience for Alex saying that he doesn't lionize food method whole pageant last week

175
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:22,687
Alex right now is trying to moderate is insane admiration for Putin it's just an affectation

176
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,223
Putting on because Putin is abating

177
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,247
Sovereign neighbor

178
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,527
Things are getting a little

179
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
A little bit

180
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,343
Seriously

181
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,391
Service the moment that this conflict

182
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,207
Is however concludes

183
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,767
Alex will immediately baby icon like

184
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:43,167
Well poop got a raw deal on this her or whatever maybe before you will be will give lip service to

185
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,799
Just threats flying around that's the time to be

186
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,567
Support

187
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,847
Civilians are being killed

188
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,639
It's time to pretend to be a neutral party

189
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,687
So you don't end up having people

190
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,759
You feel bad for supporting the guy who's doing the invasion

191
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:02,623
It's entirely possible that the fatality counts are higher than what's being reported now

192
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,207
But pretty much every report you see on that on the number of

193
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,767
Casualties includes that caveat

194
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,559
The well hostilities are ongoing

195
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
It's really hard

196
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,607
To get precise number

197
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:18,495
Really take too much of an issue with Alex's insinuation that the current numbers may be low

198
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:23,359
I think it's speculation of how far off the reported numbers are might be a little loose

199
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:28,991
Morally objectionable is his claim that you'll never hear about the higher death toll

200
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
My God

201
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,039
Alex is so addicted

202
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,623
Conspiracies that he just inject them into almost every sentence that comes out of

203
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
His mouth

204
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:39,231
And being an idiot but there's an element of this that sex

205
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,023
Pretty clear strategic

206
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,071
The tactic designed to train is listeners

207
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:46,655
To be distrustful of every source of information that isn't him

208
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,727
Or something with Alex's indicated as one of the good ones like

209
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:56,127
Gateway pundit or NaturalNews under question until I authoritatively

210
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,919
Give you the belief that you should have

211
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:03,039
Yes yes it's super toxic stuff and it's just the audience in a bubble

212
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:08,671
Where they can't take seriously any reporting or information that proves the central Infowars narrative to be wrong

213
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,231
Alex has to spread distrust

214
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,767
Of all other media sources

215
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:18,143
Because he's rightly scared that if his audience actually took in a broader scope of sources for information

216
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,167
Phoebe Fox

217
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,263
And so one of his primary even subconscious behaviors is the concert

218
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,031
Bentley inject

219
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
Insinuation

220
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,359
For outright claims that you'll never know

221
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,407
The truth about various things

222
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,431
Epsom

223
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
Not good

224
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,271
I listen to this

225
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,807
And especially that

226
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,855
And I mean

227
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,903
Is something f***

228
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,927
Stop about

229
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,975
Being a part of the American

230
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,767
Media

231
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,047
Consumer base

232
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,839
Insofar as

233
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
Because

234
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,679
The United States has committed so many war crimes

235
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,239
Either lied about it or

236
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,591
To skate or tried to hide or any number of those things

237
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,383
Alex can say you know

238
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,431
When they go in there they want to Lowe's

239
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,223
Civilian death toll so they don't cost

240
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,503
Starbomb

241
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,319
Culture bombing a f****** city is

242
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
Warcry

243
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:15,999
I'd literally War crime you can't just block they don't want to have a high school

244
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,815
It's wrong fundamental level

245
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
No I agree

246
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,423
I agree

247
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,215
I think that

248
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:26,751
To the point

249
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,543
That there's a

250
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,847
Find criticism tomatoes

251
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,151
U.s. foreign policy a pig

252
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,431
The wars that we had

253
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,735
It doesn't really have a bearing on

254
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:43,135
Whether or not this is right and you're saying that I'm just saying how the media

255
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:47,743
Allows us to speak of it as though it's not something that should be treated as

256
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,535
You cannot cross that line

257
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,559
Not like

258
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,119
Oh they don't want to I mean like literally

259
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,143
You cannot

260
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,935
And the problem is it

261
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,239
We have and that doesn't bear own piss

262
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,543
But that does bear on how we talked about

263
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,127
Nature Institute

264
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,943
I have guard rails for the what

265
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,967
To come up in

266
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,015
United media

267
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:15,135
That's what I'm not like this is a both sides or anything along those

268
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,719
Or some people

269
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,255
Kind of argumentation

270
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,351
So Alex believes their propaganda going around

271
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,631
And boy is there

272
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,471
The level of propaganda

273
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,799
But the Russians and NATO and

274
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,847
Staggering levels

275
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,663
But I got to say as usual the last.

276
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,687
Clearly top Russia

277
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,503
In

278
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,575
Bishop going on over here

279
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,599
And then you got them

280
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,367
Demonizing

281
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:48,927
Either

282
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:53,279
As a profoundly stupid position for Alex to have it even he knows that what he saying

283
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:57,119
Is bulshit that's just a desperate attempt to justify Putin's invasion

284
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,935
Both sides are equally guilty argument

285
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,983
Talk about

286
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:08,639
So weird how this position is evolves from real bombastic yelling about Putin being great to cowardly middle-of-the-road

287
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,687
Bulshit about both sides having problems

288
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:17,599
This isn't a serious position Alex has you just knows that he can get his audience to tears of Justified

289
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,391
Journalists and protesters

290
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,695
To his own cancel culture narratives

291
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,487
But he's trained the audience to respond to

292
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,047
Sure the Patriots have caused some violence but

293
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:31,679
Black lives matter is called some violent protest too wide open

294
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,983
That's essentially the game between play dear

295
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,543
Uses established talking points as a crutch

296
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,615
To get the audience closer to being on who decide that they would be

297
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,919
If Alex were just reporting actual information

298
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,247
And it's fine I guess

299
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,807
I mean it was it is one of those

300
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,343
Propaganda effort

301
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,367
It's that is

302
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,415
Not aimed at like oh okay

303
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,951
We want you to be on Russia's

304
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,487
Steam it's more aim.

305
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,023
We don't want you to be on Ukraine

306
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,327
We want you to be on in the middle

307
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
Love like

308
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,143
But you know what this this just

309
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,423
You know whatever it is

310
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,775
Yeah I would say that it is less a attempt

311
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
To make

312
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
Gluten look

313
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,335
Good

314
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:13,663
And it is an attempt to make Putin look less bad

315
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,831
Keep you from condemning what puta

316
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
In the way that you should

317
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,159
Exactly also I think it's

318
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,439
Open insult to say

319
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:31,583
I think Alex accidentally insulted whatever is like as usual the US wins the propaganda War again

320
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,167
As usual your haircut and Putin short

321
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,703
He's got he's had some wins

322
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,775
But I think it would probably let that go though

323
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,055
You think I don't know him

324
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,895
We're going to talk to somebody who does know personally later

325
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,223
But also a liar

326
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
Welfare

327
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:53,087
So Alex decides that it's time to

328
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,647
Let's reset the narratives

329
00:15:55,903 --> 00:16:01,023
Let's try and come up with a way to rewrite the story of what I've been saying

330
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,839
This whole time I didn't

331
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,887
But here is what I did today

332
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
Very clear

333
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,007
Hi there

334
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
I said that

335
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,311
Before the invasion

336
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
And I said that

337
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,687
Going to try to stage cyberattacks

338
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
Shelves

339
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,295
And that once they've done that they could really ratchet up things

340
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
With the rocks

341
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
Khalid

342
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,623
2A Regional

343
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,903
Nuclear war

344
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,951
And then probably a full-scale nuclear war

345
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975
I'll because of you

346
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,743
Just a satanic

347
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,023
Evil running our world

348
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,815
I mean we're really close to that

349
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,167
Who is probably going to be Oz talking point moving forward that these were his positions

350
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:42,495
Incisor was related to the standoff and then the invasion of Ukraine

351
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,519
Of course it's all a lie

352
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:50,175
There wasn't really a consistent position Alex's have through any of this time by Q waffle.

353
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,479
Set up all over the place but there were some elements

354
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,783
It popped up more regularly and you can

355
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,319
Use as kind of a

356
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,879
A guiding through line through what he was talkin to

357
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,671
What about

358
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:04,767
Points on this whole thing was on February 8th

359
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,607
Clip posted in a Daily Mail article

360
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,911
Of the speech of the Putin gave any decided

361
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,191
The boot was on the brink

362
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,215
The firing nukes

363
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,007
To destroy all of Europe

364
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,591
I enjoyed that narrative quite a bit because it allowed him to

365
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:23,199
Send it too long and vivid descriptions of how nuclear war

366
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:27,039
Because of abortion or whatever

367
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:33,951
Even prior to this but escalating as the tensions Rose between Russia and Ukraine Alex's Central theory was that a false flag

368
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,511
I was going to be run by in order to gain support for

369
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:42,399
During the midterms or take attention away from the trucker convoys which Alex was insisting was

370
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,679
The key to defeat the global

371
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:50,847
This is the narrative he was selling on February 11th on the day that Biden announced that he would not send troops into Ukraine to fight

372
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,407
Because that would be a World War

373
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,295
If you put this together with all the other pieces it would take an hour to go through I'm just going to give you the answer for my view

374
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,975
But there's one Big Slice of the

375
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,047
Equation

376
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,543
You think they're just going to let us be them on this whole

377
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,359
Can go away your crazy they're going to start a damn War

378
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,271
Oh my gosh these people

379
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,039
Make me sick

380
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:37,439
Are Alex's coverage is mostly about justifying food and take military action in The Don Bosco region because

381
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,975
According to Oz fake version

382
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,535
Interview Soros did Ancien

383
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,607
Soros had actually overthrown

384
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,127
Do you want

385
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:01,503
And brag time she can just put it on screen

386
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,207
He parroted all food in stock

387
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,023
Complaints about how did NATO was attacking tamaskan look hot

388
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,327
I wish Alex reported as areas that shoot

389
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,655
Be part of Russia or were rightfully being occupied by Russia

390
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:25,055
He repeated the claims that the kindergarten was shelled false-flag pulled by Ukraine

391
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:30,943
He claimed that Western forces were going door-to-door killing people in an ethnic cleansing of the Dawn boss region

392
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,015
He did literally everything you could to make sure that the audience

393
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,295
GameStop that is violet

394
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,879
Did Breakout it only happened because the West was so evil

395
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,415
Headed for spoon to respond

396
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,975
He was literally saying that on February 8th

397
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
Here's the bottom line

398
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,143
When they launched offensives in the east

399
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,751
And then now in tube

400
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,335
Other areas of Russia

401
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
Control

402
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:06,271
When they finally attack Crimea the Russians

403
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
We'll have a Redline

404
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,343
And that Putin will be deposed

405
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,903
Hardliners in

406
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,999
Putin's being driven into a corner

407
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
2

408
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,887
Be induced

409
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,191
Which will then be called

410
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:29,311
Details here and there and things would move around

411
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,847
When was pretty clear into

412
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,615
Consistent

413
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,943
Any fighting was to be seen by the audience as NATO and Biden

414
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,759
Fault and if we did something look bad on paper

415
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:42,879
It might be a false flag and even if it's a real thing he did he only did it because the Western Powers forced him

416
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,159
He would have loved

417
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,183
Did not do it

418
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,719
There's nothing he wants to

419
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,511
Do less to do than war crimes

420
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:54,911
Soros is Madeline crime man

421
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:58,495
He was going to recognize the nest

422
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,543
21st and Alex was beside himself

423
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,823
How much you supported

424
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,871
What he pretended boutin was saying

425
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:08,991
He's apologizing for communism is saying that he just wants to enjoy the free market with Ukraine

426
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,015
Woohoo

427
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,599
Absolutely not bitten off more than he could chew at any point up

428
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,416
This is this point according to Alex in

429
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,208
That wasn't even Alex's dance

430
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,232
After the invasion

431
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,072
24th Alex had to deal with the fact that he

432
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:27,424
Buy Russian propaganda and they Putin was definitely planning to invade the whole country

433
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,032
Well thank publicly that he wasn't going to do that which Alex repeated as truth to his audience

434
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,128
But even at that point when Alex has shown to have been very wrong

435
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:39,456
He still wasn't saying the Putin had been off more than he could chew

436
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:43,552
Alex was very insistent that already won the war because he

437
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,344
Paid off Ukrainian leadership

438
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,648
The Russian forces would just be up against

439
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,440
No resistance at all

440
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,488
These troops raise

441
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,560
Russian flag in Ukraine A-Z tanks

442
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:55,840
What you come

443
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,120
From the East

444
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,400
Ando tanks

445
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,704
From Belarus

446
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,728
Dinner

447
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,520
Deeper into the nation

448
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,336
And there is

449
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,176
Because just like the US

450
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,504
The Iraqi leadership in Gulf War 1

451
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,528
For 2

452
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,832
Generals

453
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,648
You see that Putin is already done

454
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416
Work

455
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,464
And is already paid off you

456
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
Ukrainian military

457
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
And that's why the rush

458
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,536
No they can roll

459
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,304
Rite Aid

460
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,936
Because that's how real war is done

461
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:35,264
Alex never said that Putin have bitten off more than he could chew

462
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,664
He was constantly expressing solidly pro-putin talking points that revolved around the idea that food needed to take over the

463
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,432
Dawn boss

464
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,712
In order to protect the Russian

465
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,480
Can speakers there

466
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:50,880
Even after Putin invited the entire country Alex was rationalizing his actions by pretending the whole thing was a piece of theater

467
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:55,232
Where's olinsky was a double agent in on it with Putin and there will be no Ukrainian resist

468
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,280
This b******* you saying I was

469
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,072
Attempt to whitewash his actual position

470
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:02,144
Because he doesn't want to own any of that ship moving forward

471
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:08,032
He wants his initial positions in the lead-up to The Invasion to appear far more moderate than they actually work and the reason

472
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:08,800
This pretty off

473
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:15,456
I will grant that Alex has been saying that there's going to be a cyber false-flag for a really long time even prior to this standoff

474
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:21,088
Again our last episode of play the clip from July of last year where he and Leo zagami were insisting that

475
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,904
False flag cyberattack was right around the corner

476
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:30,560
This isn't actually a meaningful prediction though and it's just Alex laying the groundwork so in case there ever is a cyber-attack he needs to

477
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,840
Pretend isn't real

478
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,912
You can claim that he was predicting a false-flag cyberattack at Vista

479
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:38,496
What is a f****** year-ago everyone assumes

480
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:44,896
Will happen sooner or later so it's only like that is going to happen

481
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,432
A lot of vulnerabilities

482
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:50,272
Is there a lot of Nefarious people who are pretty good with computer

483
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:54,624
It's not a good prediction so much as it is like this is how

484
00:23:55,904 --> 00:24:01,536
Annabelle write a story in advance should ever happen in a way that's inconvenient for my narrative

485
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,864
So I can pin the blame on my imaginary enemy

486
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,912
Bingo Charles Schwab

487
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:13,568
Beautiful computer machine Charles

488
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,104
Deep blue it's Charles Schwab

489
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,128
Gotcha

490
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:20,736
Smile back to the 27th Alex talks about the headline for the show

491
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,344
Aaron's the world

492
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,392
Is on the brink

493
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,672
A nuclear war

494
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,744
As NATO Ramsey Farms

495
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,120
Against

496
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:37,888
Russia

497
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,520
Think about that ladies

498
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,288
Gentleman

499
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,312
And we have the

500
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,104
Video of him singing

501
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,664
Unlike corporate

502
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,432
Established

503
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200
Globalist

504
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:51,968
Media

505
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,504
Are there Empire lies

506
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:54,784
When I tell you

507
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
The clip

508
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,928
This is kind of Alex's orwellian moment

509
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:06,560
Russia is invading Ukraine but the situation is really that the west and NATO are attacking Russia Vice

510
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,352
Supported Ukraine at loving sanction

511
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,168
There's no other way to really look at this other than Alex

512
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,448
Just hates Western Tubac

513
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
Perseus

514
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,008
See the International Community thrown in

515
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,032
The chaos

516
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,056
Also

517
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:21,408
You can f*** right off with this unlike the media I actually play clips bulshit

518
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,224
What the media who doesn't play today

519
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,760
Nobody's exactly

520
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:32,160
It's just a petulant lashing out against be poorly Define nebulous group everyone supposed to hate the dreaded media

521
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,720
Again this is just a strategy Alex used to soda

522
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:38,816
Distrusting all sources that are not himself or things he has ordained as good

523
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:41,120
He can never really miss an opportunity to take a

524
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:44,192
Swipe to remind you the listeners that he's the real journalist

525
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:47,520
Or at least eat that until he's under out the man there's a

526
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,800
Completely different story

527
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,104
Entertain also Empire of Lies

528
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,128
What is a quote

529
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,152
Upfront

530
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:57,248
Thought that Sebring use a great term

531
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,064
Who is

532
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,344
It is just like

533
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,696
You can't do that

534
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,464
We've had

535
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:13,120
We have novels we have novels where people do that and there's a bad people how can you do that and not be immediately like oh yeah

536
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,168
You can do it

537
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,448
You can do it

538
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:20,544
You should just be a little bit less of a coward in on your position

539
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,312
Well I mean

540
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,360
Yeah

541
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:27,456
He wants to pretend he has this moderate distance from things

542
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,992
But he's

543
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,272
She's just acting as

544
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,344
Amalfi's

545
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,136
Citymd

546
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,160
That's what

547
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,304
You know people who are like always a Russian asset or something like that

548
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,840
I think he's more like them

549
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,656
Weirdos who are like Elon Musk

550
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:53,312
Superfan reply guy he was still on Twitter

551
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:57,408
In so many different parts of his life you know with the anti-communist

552
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:02,272
Intelligentsia

553
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:06,112
G Edward Griffin

554
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:12,512
Who are in the John Birch Society and the same thing is true of the militias

555
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,840
Is out over these weirdos

556
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,656
I do exercises with guns Underwood

557
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,728
Like it it's just like how he's Fanboys out over Star Wars

558
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,264
It's just a higher Stakes

559
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,800
And also he claims that he does

560
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,432
It's just kind of a consistent thing with these

561
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:38,624
John Birch Society ding-dongs militias into a strongman dictators

562
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,024
Yeah it is it is weird for him to claim that he's the tip of the spear and yet at the same time have been has been there

563
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,328
Perpetual follower and hanger-on

564
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,912
He's in that he's a retinue guy he's he's not

565
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,704
He's not in the lead of s***

566
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,008
No not the tip of the spear at all

567
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:01,664
Sunday was the day that they were supposed to play that documentary about Alex on Sienna

568
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:07,552
What time he's on air I believe the units but it already gone out that it wasn't going to happen

569
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,856
I was just pretending that that has not happened

570
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,904
That it's still going to air

571
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
And yet something

572
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:17,024
Complaints about it in a bit of a high road

573
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,304
CNN 4-week

574
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,096
Advertising every break

575
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,120
Purposely

576
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,144
Alex Jones special

577
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,936
Tonight 10 p.m. Eastern

578
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:27,776
9 p.m. central that I was going to watch live and comment on here

579
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,312
But my family is more important

580
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,360
World War 3 is more important

581
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,640
Crisis

582
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,176
And it's a

583
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:34,944
Feen

584
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,504
Foreseeing into are something like

585
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,528
During a time like this

586
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,064
NFL,

587
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,624
Get more viewers

588
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,160
I'm having small audience

589
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,512
And already know it's regurgitated lies they sent me

590
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,536
Questions on YouTube

591
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,560
Respond to it

592
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,912
The questions was a bunch of made-up malarkey

593
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:59,008
First of all malarkey

594
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,056
Come on let's go Alex

595
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:05,408
Second they haven't been

596
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:10,016
The press release announcing that special was on February 22nd

597
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,576
They've are commercials around that point

598
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:18,208
And it's really easy for Alex's I was like well I was going to go over it but my family is more important

599
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,816
After they've already canceled it right

600
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:28,960
Real smooth Above This

601
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:34,848
Hold me back family I wouldn't I would go hard on these people but you got to hold me back

602
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,152
That's a little a little sack

603
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:40,992
So Alex let's talk about Putin's speech

604
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,552
And he's not being clear about this because

605
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,576
There was

606
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:50,976
Before this the announcement that Putin was putting his nuclear deterrence on high alert

607
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:54,560
Alex is referencing

608
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,656
He's actually talking about is

609
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,448
The speech were Putin declared war

610
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:02,496
That's what I would have assumed

611
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:07,360
This is an older speech released a couple days old speech that Alex is referring to

612
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,384
We also

613
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,432
The way he talks about it is amazing

614
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,224
Russia hasn't it

615
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:12,992
Ethos

616
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,040
Invasions by the Huns

617
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,344
4:00 of years

618
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,136
Invasions by the Muslims

619
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,416
For over a thousand years

620
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,744
Zen Napoleon and Hitler

621
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:24,768
And

622
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,584
20 million Russians died in World War II

623
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,120
20

624
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,400
2 million Germans died

625
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,728
Russell KB

626
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,384
670,000 people

627
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,408
In World War II

628
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,688
Or

629
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,992
Something's house in Vietnam and everybody

630
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,784
Felt it knows it was a real war

631
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,320
Russia

632
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,088
20

633
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:49,856
Million

634
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,904
In World War II

635
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,720
And so it is in the Consciousness and I can

636
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,488
Said he said

637
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,816
People always try to bully us and always flipping her boards and weapon

638
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:02,144
And for the first time ever Russia is not going to wait till you attack

639
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,240
47 minute

640
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,008
Address

641
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,592
He also says you want to sexualize our children are a bunch of pedophiles

642
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,616
Hollywood

643
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,640
Devil worshippers

644
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,176
You want to destroy

645
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,224
The men and women of the family and we're done

646
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,760
You want a nuclear war

647
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,040
I mean it's unbelievable

648
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,440
Supposed to say

649
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:30,304
So that could was fascinating because it's specifically designed

650
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,352
Two deceptive ideas in the audience

651
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,120
This is mine

652
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:39,776
The first is Russia's history of being invaded makes the idea of Putin invading another country somehow more acceptable or

653
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:44,896
Understandable self-defense when you've been robbed 300 times in your past

654
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:48,480
You know the moment that somebody looks like they're going to rob you

655
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,016
You run them down with your truck

656
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:54,624
It makes perfect sense it's just another in a long string of Alex's very clear attempt

657
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,648
To justify Putin

658
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:59,232
Invasion without having to take on the intellectual and moral responsibility

659
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,280
I'm giving a full-throated endorsement

660
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,584
The 2nd

661
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,984
Interesting to me because Alex is doing is lying about Putin speech in order to create the image that he threatened

662
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,568
Nuclear war inspired by the very same thing that Alex feels

663
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,360
Are Central to his battle against

664
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,896
That's the global it's so weird

665
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,688
Obviously Putin didn't say though

666
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:21,248
He said he wanted to protect the first

667
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,296
Alex says those things haha

668
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:29,696
I'm fairly certain food would be assassinated immediately if he were to go up and give a speech about ready and nuclear weapons also

669
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:36,096
You want nuclear war the f****** go while spouting off a bunch of Alex's and Niche culture-war complaints

670
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,376
Bros bros

671
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:43,776
We have to take out Hollywood they worship the devil

672
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:50,176
The feelings the audience has towards

673
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,200
Hey Monty Putin

674
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:55,040
If you're an Infowars listener you recognize all of those talking points

675
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:55,808
Except the globalist

676
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,856
The pedophile trying to sexualize children

677
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:02,976
Hollywood is run by devil worshipers that the globalist want to destroy men and women in the family

678
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,792
They recognize that because they're things that Alex yells all the time

679
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:08,096
Time and the audience has been trained to believe that Alex

680
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,120
These things

681
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:12,704
Is a form of him fighting for them and their very lives

682
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:18,592
There's no way to slice this other than to say that Alex want the audience to not only admire and support Putin

683
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:24,736
They want he wants them to view him as a person is motivated by and fighting for the same things that Alex is

684
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:25,504
I'm has

685
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,528
Been all this time

686
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,576
And you know Alex is a hero right

687
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:29,600
So is Putin

688
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:33,184
You can't you can't get somebody to go from

689
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,488
Auntie interventionism

690
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,768
War is bad

691
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,304
To immediately be like

692
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:43,168
Absolutely has to murder all of these people in order to protect himself from the West

693
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,984
Do you have to have an intermediate step where you say

694
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,032
His grievances are real

695
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:52,384
You know I have trained you over the course of

696
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,176
I never born

697
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,968
Then the lives of any

698
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,760
One man or woman

699
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:03,392
Who's the f*****-up mentality but it's really not too far off from some of the ways we've seen Alex frame Putin in the past

700
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:10,304
What makes this particularly troubling is that Alex isn't playing this rhetoric in response to news that Putin has raised the alert level

701
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,584
Level of nuclear weapons

702
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:15,424
It's really hard to tell what's going on with Alex and what's Behind These

703
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,984
Completely insane things he saying this week but

704
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,032
It kind of feels like him getting his audience

705
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:20,800
Seether

706
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:23,616
Support the idea of using nukes or to rationalize

707
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,152
After the fact that

708
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,944
You know they may not like

709
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,480
Did Putin use nukes

710
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:33,344
Globalist to water destroy men and women just like him no choice I didn't have anything to do

711
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,184
It kind of feels like a pre-emptive getting you ready to justify it

712
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,232
Massive Slaughter

713
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,352
Whatever the case is here this was one more disturbing Clips I've heard on Alex's show in a bit

714
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:48,448
Shocking and disgusting clothes with this was psychologically worried

715
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,984
This involves Alex

716
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,056
Clearly talking about himself when discussing poop

717
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:57,408
Trying to get the audience to believe that Alex's words were coming out of boutin's mouth

718
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:00,992
I also think the laughing at the end there was Alex

719
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,040
Speak surprised that he went that far

720
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:06,112
I kind of suspect that he even shocked himself

721
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,160
With his ability to go that low

722
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:08,928
Yeah

723
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,952
Yeah

724
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:10,976
I mean

725
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,328
You have to also

726
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:18,656
Consider that he has to find some way to justify to himself

727
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:21,472
That he's for Putin murdering all these

728
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,240
You know

729
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,520
Like he knows

730
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,544
What really happened

731
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:30,176
There's no there's no way that you cannot know and still, like this school are of some

732
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,456
Right bro

733
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,736
Vulpix

734
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,016
Batman

735
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,296
Wow how do you

736
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,832
You wake up and go like yeah

737
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,624
I'm going to be on that guy

738
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,928
You have to find the number of ways

739
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:44,256
Is to do that that's really key is to convince yourself

740
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,792
But you're not actually

741
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,328
On this dispersed

742
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:52,704
One of the ways you do that is pretend that you just want to stay out of it

743
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,752
Above The Fray

744
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,288
This is a Slavic

745
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,568
Civil war going on

746
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,640
And I study history I'm addicted to it

747
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,944
And a slob just like the Japanese hate the

748
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,480
Chinese and vice versa

749
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,296
Swampert always killing each other

750
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,344
And they're always doing this

751
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,392
Just gone for over a thousand years

752
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,696
And it's a Slavic Civil War

753
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,232
Are B you just stay

754
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,768
The hell out of it

755
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,792
Ladies and gentlemen

756
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,840
On the Crips and bloods shooting

757
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,608
Each other in

758
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,144
La weekly

759
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,704
Need to stay out of it

760
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,752
We have

761
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,032
Knock yourselves out

762
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,312
But make no mistake

763
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,128
George Soros and others I'll play the clip

764
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,152
We come back

765
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:33,920
B Lipton

766
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
Soros

767
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,528
And the New World Order responsible

768
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,832
Okay because Soros

769
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,904
Has ordered the Ono

770
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,464
Cuz he paid for

771
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,256
Because he was there

772
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:49,792
Yeah

773
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,584
I think that this is not

774
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:58,752
The mark of neutrality everything he did is Justified because everything they did is

775
00:36:59,264 --> 00:36:59,776
Yeah yeah

776
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:06,432
I just think you have a situation where the argument is pro-russia it is much

777
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,224
Is it saying don't get involved

778
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,552
In terms of sending military aid to people who are being invaded

779
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,088
And that is

780
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,368
Explicitly

781
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,136
Pro

782
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,440
Putin

783
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,464
Yeah

784
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,232
Not

785
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,024
Is

786
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,424
Taking Rochester absolutely you can't you can't just be like oh man you know it's one of those civil wars that they

787
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,960
I have every so often

788
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,776
Uamee he's trying to also get you nothing

789
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:32,800
R-Truth

790
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,824
Just be like hey

791
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,384
You know what if they want to kill all of each other

792
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,664
That's none of your business

793
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,200
Don't give a s*** that

794
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:45,344
Putin invaded a country don't care it's just another civil war that these people have always had

795
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,368
Yeah it's

796
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:52,000
Trying to make where he's like I am

797
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:52,768
I'm not

798
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,072
Into this I'm just seeing Alside

799
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,352
Is so fragile

800
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,144
And it's really clear

801
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:01,728
But that's the impression that he's trying to give on this Sunday episode

802
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:06,336
So Alex Pei

803
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:09,664
He tries to layout why Russia has a legitimate case

804
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:15,808
Does a clip of Soros

805
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:20,416
Stop run. The car is interview CNN from how many years ago

806
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:26,816
I was eight years ago about overthrowing the government of Ukraine for money which she wasn't

807
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,096
Just b*******

808
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:32,704
The other piece of evidence Alex has a clip that clip of Biden saying he was threatened

809
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,984
To withhold Aid unless

810
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:37,056
Ukraine fired that you cry the corrupt prosecutor

811
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,336
That's it that's

812
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,872
Log the evidence Alex has

813
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,664
Is tobacco Putin's legitimate claim

814
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,760
That Ukraine is a poppet of Soros sunglass

815
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,296
Justify

816
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,112
Everything well that's the angle

817
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:56,512
From the Russian perspective right of the Ukrainian perspective perspective

818
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,048
He just gives this

819
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,352
Justification for why

820
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,376
Russia

821
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,656
What do this

822
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:06,496
Pieces of evidence that he provide just b*******

823
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,264
Man

824
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,312
We have an entire f***

825
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,080
18 amendments

826
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:13,664
Devoted to not letting a soldier into your f******

827
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,432
Can house man

828
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,456
That's

829
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,736
Real number

830
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,504
3

831
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,320
Alex Alex

832
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:25,952
You wouldn't fight for that one but it seems I feel like it's

833
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:32,352
Not having a soldier quartered in my f****** office 3rd Amendment absolutist

834
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:35,168
So the Russian soldier comes to my house

835
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:37,472
It's totally fine for me to fight back

836
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,032
So that works quarter

837
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,360
Oh my God I'm so relieved that is a third amendment

838
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,664
I got worried

839
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,968
I need to memorize the order of these Amendment

840
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:54,624
So Alex is he's pretending that he's going to give all side and talk about all this you know it's

841
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,392
Fraud

842
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,232
Claims act all tough

843
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,280
Shipping $10 of weapons

844
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,888
All these Russian held areas in the Russians

845
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:08,448
You're just like okay I guess we'll attack

846
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,008
Proxy government

847
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,032
Pedagogy

848
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,056
TV star

849
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,616
It was the president as the

850
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,152
Dad's the TV star host

851
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,712
And then I can stall him and do all this

852
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,760
And Russian went crazy

853
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,600
Axel F

854
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,160
Always doing whatever they wanted a Viking

855
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,720
Just a couple days ago not knowing who he is

856
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,768
Adversary see this

857
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:36,864
And it scares them even more but they're such a competent leaders they said well screw it

858
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,192
And put the shutdown

859
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,752
Jackson congratulation

860
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,568
And the podium is yours let me pull this out

861
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,480
But okay

862
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,296
Sage presence camp

863
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:03,744
So that's why

864
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,512
What

865
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,280
Okay

866
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:09,632
Today's Alex has claimed that he's going to show the Ukrainian argument and the Russian

867
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:13,216
180 side but you just played the sauros inviting Clips they're the

868
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,008
Conspiracy should we just talked about

869
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:19,616
Just trying to justify the argument that Russia is cool to invade

870
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:21,920
Clearly

871
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,712
Making more justification

872
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:29,088
I was just trying really hard to do literally everything in his power to create the feeling in his audience

873
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,136
This invasion was absolutely Justified

874
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,440
And everything bun does is good wow

875
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,464
Occasionally

876
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,256
Could do this

877
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,560
Just wants a plausible deniability

878
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:42,144
It probably really good strategy on his parts

879
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,984
The feeling that he wants in his audience and he's supporting Putin's agenda

880
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,752
The same time

881
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:50,336
Creating a number of Clips are you saying that he isn't in favor of this

882
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:53,919
Never needs to pretend he was against the invasion in the future

883
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,967
I'm going to Paper Trail

884
00:41:56,223 --> 00:42:01,599
I thinks he can take out of context and put in the compilation that people be tricked by in the future

885
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:07,487
Texas is doing to trans youth right now Russia has a better argument that they should invade

886
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:12,863
It would be tough

887
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,959
The rest of the country would be stoked about it I don't know where Russia would start

888
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:23,103
Mexico cool Mexico's their own country as we heard of that

889
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:28,991
Cuz they're not with the globalist so I guess I have to hang out with Canada do go up to Alaska have to take Alaska

890
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:29,759
Skippers

891
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,295
Trudeau is weak

892
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,647
So this could happen but then you got to go all the way down

893
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,671
From that yeah that stuff

894
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:37,695
At self

895
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,743
Give me a long walk

896
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,023
Yep

897
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:44,351
Too bad there's not the Bering land bridge

898
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,631
So this

899
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,655
This is this is

900
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,983
Weird Alex is talking about how

901
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:54,591
People in USSR Soviet to always

902
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,359
Ben

903
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,383
Double-crossed

904
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,663
In the past sure

905
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:00,479
Like Hitler screwing over Stalin

906
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,527
Just like Hitler

907
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,551
Installing

908
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,855
In the early 1940s had a deal

909
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,391
Nobody should hear up amongst

910
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,671
And of course

911
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,719
Hitler then double-cross.

912
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:13,791
That's what these criminals always do

913
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,583
Can't believe Hitler would

914
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,775
And things being shipped in

915
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,055
And prepared

916
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,079
Too attractive

917
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,919
NBC's The immorality of the West

918
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:30,943
He talked about it

919
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,711
You talk about

920
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:35,039
Nobody

921
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,063
Going to shower

922
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:41,183
One way or another whether the whole damn speech we have

923
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,999
This is again making reference

924
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:47,583
Do the the speech where Putin was declaring war

925
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,375
Bead

926
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,911
This is nothing but

927
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,191
Justifications

928
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,263
It is

929
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,567
Sweetly like we needed to do this totally

930
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:03,967
Everything is a everything he's doing is right that is all that's going on explain to me how history

931
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:06,015
Three of Hitler betraying you

932
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,319
Justifies invading Ukraine

933
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:10,367
That's not the question that I asked

934
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,439
I give up OK Google

935
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:18,559
So Alex is you have this situation where

936
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,327
Ohio

937
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:24,959
There's an invasion going on Soros is instigating everywhere it's all his fault

938
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:25,727
The West

939
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,007
America

940
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,543
We had a lot of freedom

941
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,591
Sure and we built them up

942
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:32,127
Make a reserve

943
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,663
Right like the third amendment

944
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:38,527
But they're running out man or running out of freedom

945
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:42,367
And I might down for this because that leads Alex to some

946
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,135
Some troubling

947
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,207
I tried to explain.

948
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,767
For a long long time

949
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:53,887
So free and so open the door.

950
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:54,911
Skating don't get out much

951
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,447
McDaniel redbud

952
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,495
All of that shaved up

953
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,287
Freedom all that shaved

954
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,079
Liberty in all that saved up

955
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:02,847
Security

956
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,383
That we had in the bank lady

957
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,151
The gentleman

958
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,943
Is almost gone now

959
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:14,111
At a certain point there's probably no reason to talk about

960
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,135
I'm going to go

961
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:19,231
I'm not mad I just want to go meet my family

962
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:20,767
Enjoy yourself

963
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,327
I'm out here

964
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,143
Just can't do this

965
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,191
I can't pretend anymore I can

966
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:28,959
Can't go along with it

967
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,495
Destroy all planets

968
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,031
Stop

969
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,199
Prepare too much

970
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:41,759
Okay that's that's that's what's going on

971
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:45,343
I think you really see Alex's

972
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,391
In trying times

973
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,183
Real real Rock

974
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:52,255
I'm telling you I am starting to think

975
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:57,887
That may be the amount of effort it takes to twist your brain to a place where it's okay for

976
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:04,287
Rakuten to invade and murder of a lot of people scary cat gonna really f*** your head up yeah and especially if

977
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:06,591
If you want to try and just do it without

978
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:11,711
Doing any work yeah if you don't care at all

979
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:18,111
Just make them up on the Fly improvising rationalization for the stuff is probably pretty

980
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:21,183
Have a writers room for that level of difficulty

981
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,207
Yeah

982
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,743
Yeah but like man

983
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,327
Globalist

984
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:31,423
Alex is walking over it he's done maybe there's nothing you can do

985
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,703
I'd like SiriusXM

986
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,727
Action about that sure

987
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,775
What does Satan do

988
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,311
After

989
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,359
The planet has been destroyed

990
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,639
Terraform

991
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,407
Everything

992
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:43,199
So you can start all over again

993
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:46,527
Oh I don't know isn't it

994
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:51,135
Wasn't childhoods like at the end of the like

995
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,415
The aliens

996
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:58,815
Could only breathe if the like the enviromed was degraded

997
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:03,167
I would believe that they like breathe sulfuric acid or something

998
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:03,935
,

999
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:06,495
Yeah great I bet I would

1000
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:10,335
Push came to shove that's what you want to do

1001
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,895
Blow it up

1002
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,175
Blow it up

1003
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:16,991
Maybe maybe

1004
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:21,343
Maybe maybe we should all just die right away the planet

1005
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:23,903
And maybe that's the best

1006
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,975
I mean I'm not going to blame God if

1007
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:29,535
That there's big nuclear flashes and then we're all dead men

1008
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,351
Over with

1009
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,655
Hollywood need to be gone

1010
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:35,679
I mean don't

1011
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,447
New York

1012
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,215
You know

1013
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,775
And I know there's a lot of good people there

1014
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,567
Stop.

1015
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,615
Seriously

1016
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:46,687
But you know

1017
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,991
The children don't deserve to die song

1018
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,319
I shouldn't even sit here in

1019
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:55,391
Hypothetical you say

1020
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:59,487
Are you I mean what is the point of having the Book of Revelation

1021
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:03,071
If you're going to be like maybe God will just kill us this way

1022
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,863
Should you be more relaxed

1023
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:11,263
It's about nuclear warrior-like but look it's not in the f****** book so guess what no big deal

1024
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,287
Fairly relaxed

1025
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,567
Inasmuch as

1026
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,407
This is just a little childish outbursts

1027
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:21,247
What this is is a manifestation of him being in a bad mood

1028
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,039
Right maybe hungover

1029
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,319
Sure

1030
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,855
Probably

1031
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,927
Really wrestling with how much

1032
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:34,303
There is to talk about and how little he knows about the subject that is a problem

1033
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,327
Just lashing out

1034
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:38,143
Maybe gacha

1035
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:43,007
What about the children

1036
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,311
Buckets

1037
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:48,127
So Alex ends up

1038
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:51,455
He's gone

1039
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,015
How many are tape and I'm not sure.

1040
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,111
Concern

1041
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,415
Family

1042
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,183
Next week

1043
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,511
I heard that before

1044
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,047
And just all of this is

1045
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:06,815
Saturday

1046
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,143
Because I think that's the right thing.

1047
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,447
It's not even talk about it.

1048
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,215
Look at it

1049
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,775
A synonym for you

1050
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,799
Neither Liars

1051
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,871
For the whole world burns down

1052
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:23,455
Close down there like trying to stop somebody who's trying to stop it and line

1053
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,599
I got all these clothes smaller

1054
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:32,671
Anywho

1055
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,975
I want to know this stuff

1056
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:37,791
Probably don't

1057
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,071
Jesus

1058
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:43,423
What a second loser

1059
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:49,055
Who is this

1060
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:57,503
Going to blow up everything maybe you don't want to hear me riff about a Gateway pundit article after

1061
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:03,903
I should be with my family but I'm going to take next week off

1062
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:10,559
No one else but Owen Shroyer to read Gateway pundit head well and you will miss him when there's no one else thought I would try as you will

1063
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,583
Well I did that is true

1064
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:16,191
Stupid

1065
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:19,519
They just reveal how unequipped to use to

1066
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,287
Deal with

1067
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:26,431
Maybe serious material absolutely he's very capable of dealing with abstract

1068
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,199
Nonsense

1069
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,479
That doesn't mean anything

1070
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:33,599
I think he's fine whatever they're just bees like vague things like

1071
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:38,207
Palace Intrigue about the Trump Administration

1072
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:42,303
It's kind of fun poisoning him

1073
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:47,423
Yeah but little spy novels he's ready even to some degree the election

1074
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,703
Conspiracies like

1075
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:55,871
The audit is going according to plan

1076
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:58,175
North Korea

1077
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,223
There's there's all that kind of stuff

1078
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,759
It kind of works for him cuz

1079
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:04,063
The stakes of it aren't really real

1080
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:07,391
I even he didn't think that January 6th was going to happen

1081
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,415
Subway

1082
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,439
It's

1083
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,463
It's kind of like

1084
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:16,863
He can do that now there's actually a country getting it invaded by a nuclear power

1085
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,423
In a geopolitical

1086
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,447
A pickle

1087
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:23,263
Alex is dumb

1088
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,823
Too lazy to

1089
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,663
To possibly even engaged so you see him act like this

1090
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:32,479
Yeah that is something that

1091
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,759
Like when you when you talk

1092
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:38,367
About the CNN documentary like I don't want something that's going to portray him as big

1093
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:41,439
Bad Evil kind of masterminded it's like yeah

1094
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,719
Cuz listen to this s***

1095
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:46,303
This is not an evil mastermind this is a whiny teen

1096
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,071
Yeah

1097
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,143
This was an evil mastermind

1098
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:52,959
Everyday be able to handle it

1099
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:54,495
So he comes back

1100
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,287
After the next break

1101
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,823
Cuz he just actually

1102
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,103
He storms off

1103
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,943
For like the last couple minutes of this segment forgot the commercial

1104
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:09,855
Low blood sugar

1105
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:11,647
And the crow

1106
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:14,975
But I'm not

1107
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,511
You're not something I'm not

1108
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:21,887
I really care I'm really informed really involved and I'm

1109
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,703
With all the

1110
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:25,727
Stuff going on in the world

1111
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:31,615
I know the globalist nine times out of ten of the ones like

1112
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,383
Nephews

1113
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:34,431
They're endangering all of our

1114
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,967
Lives in our children's lives

1115
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,319
Gnarls Barkley

1116
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,087
Please show

1117
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:44,415
I wasn't crazy because I didn't know enough

1118
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,183
If I do too much

1119
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,463
The show

1120
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,511
My word

1121
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,815
Good about not blowing up on here

1122
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:54,399
I don't think that's true

1123
00:52:54,655 --> 00:53:00,799
Did Gnarls Barkley do a Las Vegas residency for a while that I didn't know probably they have like a Celine Dion

1124
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:03,103
I'm kind of style attraction going on there

1125
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:08,735
What's up Miss speaking is one thing

1126
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:14,367
Alex Jones has been apologizing to the crew for 24 f****** year-long

1127
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,903
Set alarm

1128
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:21,791
Everything is the globalist Fault 9 times out of town today

1129
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,583
What even talkin about

1130
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,863
None of this is real

1131
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:29,471
I think he said something accidentally that revealed one of those classic paradox

1132
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,239
Cuz like

1133
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,031
Everything I tell you is a lie

1134
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:34,847
You know like he's saying I'm not here to protect I'm not pretty

1135
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,639
Pretending like I'm something I'm not

1136
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:37,407
Where you like

1137
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,199
Yes you are

1138
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:39,967
But

1139
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:41,503
That is who you are

1140
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:42,783
So you aren't

1141
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:47,647
It's one of those kind of situation could be it could also be used

1142
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:48,415
Pretending

1143
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:50,975
For a long time and then just is that now

1144
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:54,559
You become you become the thing you pretend to

1145
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,583
That where

1146
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,351
Sure

1147
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:58,911
Also to

1148
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,191
This isn't

1149
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:02,495
Like someone who cares too much

1150
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,519
March

1151
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:06,847
This is not the behavior of someone who cares too much

1152
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,151
This is someone who is

1153
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:11,455
Supposed to be doing their job

1154
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:14,015
That's right because they're in,

1155
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:21,439
Things aren't like why do I need geometry because they care too much about geometry and what about math

1156
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,743
Samantha this is already been proven

1157
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:24,511
Anyway

1158
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:25,791
Alex going to start

1159
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:26,815
Okay good

1160
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:30,399
It's a little late from the beginning

1161
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,959
Going to start over and I'm going to plow through the nose

1162
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,007
You have to understand something later

1163
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,799
There's also a great frustration

1164
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,359
Justice stop right here

1165
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:42,943
Is so horrible

1166
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:47,295
And I refuse to rationalize what's going on in like not making it

1167
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,319
Migraine

1168
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,695
It's the Stockholm Jean

1169
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,255
Where was I being abused I can make it

1170
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,279
Excuses for it

1171
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,303
And and

1172
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,143
Can you just go along with it

1173
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:06,495
Being awake

1174
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,799
I don't have the Stockholm change

1175
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:12,639
And instead with people are enslaving me and my family and enslaving you

1176
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:14,687
I get extremely upset

1177
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,647
Do you know what happened

1178
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:28,511
They had three more universities with

1179
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,303
Crispr Gene editing

1180
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,095
The damn covid-19

1181
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,655
But it is one

1182
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:36,703
Hundred percent made the lab

1183
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:40,287
100% made by Madonna

1184
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:56,927
There are more universities coming out with evidence of covid-19 Aiden the lab in

1185
00:55:57,183 --> 00:56:02,559
That's all nonsense that's just the last episode

1186
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:05,631
Mo3

1187
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:09,471
Studies have come out the Tracy epidemiological history of covid

1188
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:10,751
And all of them

1189
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:14,847
Very strongly point to a natural origin of the virus coming from the Hunan

1190
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:15,615
Seafood mark

1191
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:22,527
We'll have to wait until those go through the review process but they take different approaches to looking at the question and each strongly suggests match

1192
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:23,295
Florajen

1193
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:26,111
And strongly point away from the idea that it came from a lab

1194
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:30,207
The personalizing of this stuff that Alex is doing is really scary though

1195
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:33,279
The dumb conspiracies about covid being a bioweapon

1196
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:39,423
Kind of abstract enough that most listeners in the past generally see it as kind of a detective game they were playing

1197
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,703
These evidence

1198
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,495
Pieces together they could finally stick at

1199
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,031
The gate

1200
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:49,407
Proven 100% that they killed your family yet this on the other hand is inside

1201
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:52,735
Alex is having this emotional Outburst in such a

1202
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:58,111
Personal contacts didn't hit the audience permission to deal with covid like that too

1203
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:04,767
A lot of people have friends or family who have died from the virus and this is modeling the sort of response that appropriate

1204
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:05,535
Have about that

1205
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:09,375
Screaming and yelling about how your friends were murdered by the globalists like

1206
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,143
Clothes swap

1207
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:16,799
It's a bad sign of things to come and honestly if nothing else it reflects how unhinged Alex is on this episode

1208
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,079
He is

1209
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,103
Losing it

1210
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,151
Another problem though

1211
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,943
Is it there's an intention behind

1212
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:25,503
He's building up this emotion

1213
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:30,111
What are the things that emotion and then uses that to

1214
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:32,415
Power another machine

1215
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:35,487
And you can see after building up this emotion

1216
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,767
He uses it

1217
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:38,303
To go in another Direction

1218
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:46,751
And debilitating other people I care about

1219
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:53,151
Hitman all they start a war with Russia I'm so sick of Bill Gates

1220
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,431
I'm so sick

1221
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:57,503
Barack Obama Hillary Clinton

1222
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:59,551
Anymore

1223
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:03,647
Vladimir

1224
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:06,975
How does fingerprints on a bioweapon

1225
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,327
I don't have a dog in that fight

1226
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:14,399
The Russians messing with me

1227
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:23,359
You know why they call me a Russian the Russian czar

1228
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,895
Power down there crap either

1229
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:39,487
The fakin way over-the-top emotional outbursts that Alex

1230
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:42,815
Perform there was essentially in service of creating strong feelings

1231
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:46,143
But then he could shift over to being used to justify Putin

1232
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,167
Invasion of Ukraine

1233
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:52,287
It's a tactic where he's trying to create this very strong negative feeling about these globalism

1234
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,823
Villains that he pretends he's fighting

1235
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:56,383
Which is so much stronger than any feeling the ADI

1236
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,967
How could you come down on Putin

1237
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:06,623
Make this bio-weapon how could you come down on it when these villains exist

1238
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,903
Started the war

1239
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:11,999
I hate Hillary Clinton Obama close Schwab

1240
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:14,559
The people who started the war

1241
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:16,863
Definitely those people the globalist

1242
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:20,191
Like Obama and Hillary Clinton and Klaus Schwab

1243
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:24,543
Kind of an outburst is an indication Metallica's new busy

1244
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,847
This being on are incapable of

1245
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,639
Responsibly discussion discuss

1246
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,175
These sorts of very important

1247
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:30,943
Misuse

1248
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:32,479
I am too I think it's pathetic

1249
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:36,063
Yep and it goes even further off the rails if you can believe that

1250
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,623
He rushes The New American

1251
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,903
The capture America

1252
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,695
You can't have a free Open Country

1253
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,975
Cuz everybody else might want

1254
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,559
See what's happened

1255
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,351
Alicia love these ran

1256
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,287
Because I don't

1257
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:08,831
Because they got

1258
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:15,999
Chateau de I was going to sell to cover the news

1259
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:23,167
And we're going to go through all of it the next day

1260
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,447
Okay

1261
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:28,031
Russian is the new American

1262
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,311
Is is

1263
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:33,151
Yeah that's real real real real bad

1264
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:38,015
This conversation supposedly happening on this episode

1265
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,295
Deacon

1266
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:41,087
Really say anything

1267
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:46,719
That would be more of a way of Alex saying Putin everything everything is the best

1268
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:50,815
Your patriotism pretending to be impartial

1269
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:51,839
And like

1270
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:54,399
I'm not for this Invasion or whatever

1271
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:55,423
But suck

1272
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:59,775
Bulshit amazing thing that I find

1273
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,335
Fascinating about that clip he's

1274
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,383
It does appear that Alex

1275
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,663
Can't do these Rats on it

1276
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:12,319
Yeah that's true I feel like there's a physical aspect to it he seems winded unable to

1277
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,855
Have the lung capacity

1278
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:15,135
To just do that

1279
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:16,671
Second

1280
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:20,767
You could hear a couple points where his brain was trying to find

1281
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,047
The next thing

1282
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:25,887
To like

1283
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:30,239
Where is before there would be a bit more fluidity between

1284
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:34,335
I think his brain and his body aren't able to do this anymore

1285
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,615
But he also knows that

1286
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:38,687
Kind of wanted the only things that people need him

1287
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:40,991
Before yeah I mean if that was

1288
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:42,527
If that was that

1289
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,575
That's the type of audition tape

1290
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,111
That would really get your ex

1291
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:47,391
You know

1292
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,927
That's the

1293
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:51,231
Quite the performance that you want to

1294
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:52,767
I want to have the world C

1295
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:55,071
Maybe maybe take that one a few more time

1296
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,095
5 cm

1297
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,399
Oh boy

1298
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,935
You got to know your strengths

1299
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:06,335
When you lost your fastball come out

1300
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:12,735
Clayton Kershaw new when he lost his fastball changed his pictures got it better adjusted things yet

1301
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:15,039
You know what curse I was willing

1302
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:15,807
To do his work

1303
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:17,087
Paris XXX

1304
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,623
Is not high that's hard

1305
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:21,439
You know if he got in shape I bet I could do rant

1306
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,719
Again I have to correct

1307
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:23,487
Myself

1308
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:24,767
I said that Alex was

1309
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:25,791
Willing to do work

1310
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:28,351
Actually this next clip contradict

1311
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,423
And if I have to I'll push the great I want to show your back

1312
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,471
That it work

1313
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,239
I can cover all this

1314
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,287
I got ready to cover all this

1315
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:37,567
And I got the

1316
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:38,335
Prepared

1317
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,127
Probably a little too much

1318
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:42,431
Anytime I prepare 15 hours for show

1319
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,199
It's the weekend

1320
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,783
Apologize

1321
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,575
Just prepare for a couple hours that's enough

1322
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,623
Instead of literally

1323
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:51,903
Reading

1324
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:54,975
Iran

1325
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,863
Videos

1326
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:01,887
Oh my God

1327
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,287
But you don't need me to tell you how

1328
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,847
Oh by the way I got another video clip

1329
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:17,247
Whatever. Time to get to it is your fault

1330
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:18,015
Set out to do

1331
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:20,319
Also I call Shenanigans

1332
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,927
How how are you

1333
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:25,951
Complaining

1334
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:26,975
Tamia

1335
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:28,255
That you can't get

1336
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,791
To a video clip

1337
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:34,655
That's not fair that's not fair it's not your fault is the listener

1338
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:37,215
And it's so abusive

1339
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:39,263
You know why I can't do my job

1340
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:45,663
Cuz I work too hard over prepared for this and that's why I'm having this silly childish outbursts

1341
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,711
You would do if you had all the

1342
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:49,247
Information in my head

1343
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:51,807
It's a really good way to

1344
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,855
Cover when you haven't done any work

1345
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:56,927
No idea what's going on

1346
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:58,719
You also want to emotionally

1347
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:00,767
Aloo your audience into sporting

1348
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:04,863
I mean can you imagine something like that happen

1349
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,167
To Alex at a f****** Starbucks

1350
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:13,567
Seaburn that ship to the ground if the Barista was like hey I'm sorry I couldn't get to your coffee I was too busy

1351
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:19,967
Studying coffee in the back I was caring too much about over prepared for this year

1352
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:26,367
I'm sorry I will get to you tomorrow it's funny to imagine this in any other context

1353
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:29,183
Imagine you show for a college

1354
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:33,279
Of course and the professor just screams at you through the entire thing

1355
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,303
How about bike

1356
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,351
Nothing related to the subject matter

1357
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,911
I studied too much

1358
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:40,447
To prepare for this course

1359
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:43,775
No to much about this subject

1360
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:48,895
To yell at you about anything other than the Grievances that I made up

1361
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:55,295
To be happy right now

1362
01:04:56,063 --> 01:05:01,183
Even just picking more middle-of-the-road down the middle news

1363
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:05,023
Reader Iraq imagine that

1364
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:09,119
But no one has this reaction to over preparing

1365
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,167
You know what

1366
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:15,007
I do think the possible reaction to over preparing is having

1367
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:18,847
Too many bike possible non-sequiturs that's maybe

1368
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:23,967
I mean a possible over prepared for a test before

1369
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:27,295
And then you've got so many answers you're not sure if this is the most

1370
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,575
Correct one

1371
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:34,463
Or if there could be a more current over preparation

1372
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,743
No I didn't

1373
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:37,535
I didn't immediately go like

1374
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:43,935
All these questions are wrong and lies and everybody stuck here with me and I mean I don't even want to be here.

1375
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,983
Baby. You just let us go

1376
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:48,031
Getting nuked already

1377
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,127
So

1378
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,943
Apologetic

1379
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:55,711
To the crew

1380
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:58,271
Not this time

1381
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:02,623
I got really upset earlier and I can apologize anymore for it

1382
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:07,743
That's what I wanted

1383
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:09,535
That's acting out

1384
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,351
Friendly God made us this way to get upset

1385
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,375
Things are going on like

1386
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,911
Everybody does dozen

1387
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:17,983
Doing on its normal why doesn't everybody get up

1388
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:19,775
None of this is normal

1389
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,311
That's because

1390
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:26,687
No one is as manly as Alex Alex is so in touch with what God wants him to be

1391
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:29,247
He acts like that

1392
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,527
The other people don't

1393
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:35,903
I agree with him not about that that larger point but that was

1394
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,695
If that's at all

1395
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:38,975
Justin acting out

1396
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:44,863
Also agreed I think that it makes

1397
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:45,887
It worse

1398
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:49,471
But he's clearly aware of that and willing to just be like

1399
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:52,799
Yeah that was me putting on a show I mean that is

1400
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,847
It's almost weird to admit

1401
01:06:55,615 --> 01:07:01,759
I say that out loud especially because you so unable to actually even do the acting out thing

1402
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,039
It's kind of like

1403
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:09,439
The old clown who can't do his routine you know just sad

1404
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:14,815
Light on right is flower only towards water about an inch to enter to himself wet

1405
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:21,215
Can only juggle 1 balls that's sad that the sad clown throwing up a ball

1406
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,007
Juggling one ball

1407
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:25,823
Yeah I mean like if you if you're going to be like I meant

1408
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:32,223
To do that this is a this is a thing

1409
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:39,647
Just realized his inability to even do the fake job that's that he sees

1410
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:44,511
Is being a job it is a little bit watching a man disintegrate

1411
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:47,327
So

1412
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,887
Like I brought this up a couple times and it

1413
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:50,655
It's because

1414
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:51,935
Alex does as well

1415
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,471
He thinks

1416
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:55,519
That he can get away with

1417
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,799
Saying that

1418
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,359
He's looking at all sides

1419
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:05,503
Looking at the NATO side look at

1420
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,039
Is very untrue

1421
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:09,599
But you eat rice play that game again

1422
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:11,135
I'm going to do my best

1423
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:11,903
Has to show

1424
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:12,927
All the news tab

1425
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:15,999
From the Ukrainian side the NATO side and the

1426
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,535
Russian side

1427
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:19,839
Bunch of clubs bunch of articles

1428
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,119
And a bunch of thanks

1429
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:21,887
To get to Butler

1430
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:22,911
Start

1431
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:25,215
And again this is interaction with their subtitles

1432
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:26,751
40 viewers last stop

1433
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,311
Thomasina play

1434
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:31,871
It's on record so people know he said it

1435
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:34,175
Play show you what I'm about to say

1436
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,991
And then I will paraphrase

1437
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:44,927
So I got to say after we seen here today I'm super confident that Alex is going to be totally fair and impartial

1438
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,207
Give equal weight

1439
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:50,303
To the Russian Ukrainian tomato position the f*** out of here

1440
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:53,375
B words mean things

1441
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,143
Right

1442
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:56,959
So this Peach is the one from February 24th

1443
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,311
Current speed

1444
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:04,383
Very unclear

1445
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:07,455
He's not he's not being specific enough

1446
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:10,783
To give the audience really a clear understanding of which

1447
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,831
Speeches Which rare things,

1448
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:16,671
The speech were Putin

1449
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:20,767
Declared war Alex is doing is he's going to be uncritically playing in endorsing

1450
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,303
Putin's propaganda campaign

1451
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:25,375
Where you trying to rationalize invading Ukraine

1452
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:27,679
Going to be his

1453
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:30,751
So so I think what you might be saying

1454
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:32,799
Is that when Putin gave that speech

1455
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,335
The one that

1456
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:36,127
Cricket that Alex could find

1457
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,407
No moron

1458
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:42,015
Speech yeah it was the

1459
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:44,319
1 prior

1460
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:49,183
It was one where he was recognizing on skin

1461
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,487
Couldn't find fault with

1462
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:56,095
I would send seeing this one until probably until yesterday

1463
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:58,399
Yeah so

1464
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,959
So the speech where Putin

1465
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:01,983
Lied

1466
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,263
A lot

1467
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:04,799
Non-Stop

1468
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:07,103
In an effort to convince

1469
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,639
Anybody who would listen

1470
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:09,919
I think that we're not

1471
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,967
Alex is going to just play that

1472
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,735
Johnson Tire

1473
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:20,159
Is very little because he gets bogged down

1474
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:23,231
One of the problems is that Apes

1475
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:29,631
Video with subtitles there's no dubbing subtitle

1476
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,655
That's too hard

1477
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,703
So he doesn't do much of it but

1478
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:35,519
Cannot believe they gave him a video with subtitles

1479
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,287
Do you think the last

1480
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:38,079
Foreign language film he saw was

1481
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:38,847
Get the f***

1482
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:41,919
Catching Tiger Hidden Dragon

1483
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:44,991
So here is out with his first paraphrase

1484
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:54,719
He says they're using psychological warfare operations Destroyer family to rhodhiss from within

1485
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:55,999
Shall we collapse

1486
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:57,535
They want us to our families

1487
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,327
And we're aware of this

1488
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:02,399
So here's what that part of the speech actually sat

1489
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:05,983
Properly speaking the attempts to use us in their own interests

1490
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:08,031
Never really ceased until quite recently

1491
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:11,871
They sought to destroy our Traditional Values and force us

1492
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:16,223
Course on us there felt false values that would erode us are people from within

1493
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:19,807
The attitudes they have been aggressively imposing on their countries

1494
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:24,927
Attitudes that are directly leading to degradation and degeneration because they are contrary to Human Nature

1495
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:29,023
Naturally this leads to Alex picking up the ball and

1496
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:31,071
Translate

1497
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:32,607
Support raised transphobia

1498
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:35,167
Which might be a fair reading of Putin's words

1499
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:43,871
He says like they've done in the countries that control

1500
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,919
Honey they're bombing us

1501
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,455
With fentanyl

1502
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:50,271
And an LGBT PG

1503
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,295
Eqz

1504
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:53,855
They're bombing us with transgender I mean

1505
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:55,391
Destroy somebody

1506
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,671
The Russians are dumb

1507
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:59,999
Look at this

1508
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:03,071
Because they don't want to embrace this there the bad people

1509
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:09,727
Wow so one of the things that's really interesting about this particular passage from Putin's War speech is that it could be used to appeal to

1510
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:11,519
Really any variety of bigot

1511
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:12,543
If you have

1512
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:17,407
Trans are gay people you can hear degradation into generation isn't being about that community

1513
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:20,223
Happy same time if you're a racist you could

1514
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:22,783
Mute being about multiculturalism or

1515
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:24,575
If you're super anti-immigrant

1516
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:29,183
See it about being an attitude of openness towards refugees and asylum-seekers

1517
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:32,511
If you're a misogynist you could see this buddy about feminism

1518
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:35,583
If your auntie abortion you could see this being about that

1519
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:40,191
This passage that Alex's playing is essentially a Rorschach test for a person's bigotry

1520
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:44,543
It seems pretty clear that Alex is deeply committed to his hatred of tramp

1521
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:51,455
Also if you follow the chain of logic here than what Alex is saying is the George Soros made people in Ukraine trans

1522
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:55,039
And they Putin is worried that he do the same in Russia so he had to invade

1523
01:12:55,807 --> 01:13:01,951
This is nonsense reply when you can't just come out and say that you love dictators and what a One World Government

1524
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:03,743
One that's authoritarian against people

1525
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:05,791
Who you considered to be part of out-group

1526
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:07,327
Write a Netherlands towards

1527
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,119
You right and you're in group

1528
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:12,191
Yeah the the language is so

1529
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:13,983
5 minutes

1530
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:14,751
Just f***

1531
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:15,519
Nothing on except

1532
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:17,311
They are bombing us

1533
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:20,639
With LG

1534
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:22,687
With lgbtq visit

1535
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:27,039
What is a histogram

1536
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,063
End

1537
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:32,671
Putin just saw them bombing him and they're all Putin's doing is bombing back

1538
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:33,951
Sure

1539
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:37,279
What they're doing is saying things are okay and using words

1540
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:40,863
And Putin is murdering a lot of people but bombs are bombs

1541
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,143
It's

1542
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,167
It's pretty disgusting

1543
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:43,935
Yeah

1544
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:50,079
We got because Alex has gotten what he needs out of this this is most of what he covers of pollutants

1545
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:53,151
There isn't much reason to do anything other than like go back to

1546
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:54,687
The beginning so I can rest more on the

1547
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:57,503
And to get some other rest

1548
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,831
But he goes on to say

1549
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:03,647
This is not going to happen

1550
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:05,439
You're going to fail

1551
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,207
I mean

1552
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:08,255
What do you say to that

1553
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:10,303
Cuz this is an alien takeover

1554
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,095
I don't like green men running

1555
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:13,631
What is

1556
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,167
Whatever's going on

1557
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:17,983
What are the most the world is anti-human

1558
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,031
Russia and China are rejecting

1559
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:23,871
That's not what

1560
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:27,967
He was saying that the US wasn't going to defeat Russia and impose the West

1561
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:28,991
Model of an open

1562
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:30,271
Society on the country

1563
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:36,671
Things he wants to hear in this because he really likes Putin and wants him to be the hero that Trump couldn't be

1564
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:38,207
And honestly it's just pathetic

1565
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,231
It's it's

1566
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:40,511
Just a disaster

1567
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:43,327
You have Alex here on Sunday

1568
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:45,119
Listening to the speech

1569
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:46,911
From the 24th

1570
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:47,935
And

1571
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,215
Being like

1572
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:50,495
This guy

1573
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:51,519
Is great

1574
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:54,335
He's standing up to these aliens

1575
01:14:54,591 --> 01:15:00,735
That's what I've that's what I want in my president I want the new American president because Russia is the new

1576
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:01,503
New America

1577
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:04,831
And Putin is the President of Russia between Putin is my president

1578
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:05,855
He I love

1579
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:09,183
It seems like a short walk honestly

1580
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:11,743
Just

1581
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:13,023
Nuts

1582
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:13,791
Sphinx

1583
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:14,559
But he's in

1584
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:15,327
Anyway

1585
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:17,375
Being all sides

1586
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:20,447
Next time off

1587
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:21,727
Just took some

1588
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:24,543
Give me just go to the woods like a week or two ago

1589
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:25,823
Otherwise it takes

1590
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:29,919
And I will be here live

1591
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,479
Tomorrow with the Monday show but

1592
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:38,111
I have decided English major Wars going on but I'm going to take off a few days

1593
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:39,647
Because

1594
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,671
I've got to really think about

1595
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,951
What's happening in inches

1596
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:43,231
Come out disconnect

1597
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,255
Because here's the problem

1598
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:48,095
Just like I know this happen you probably

1599
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:50,143
I'm thinking about this all the time

1600
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,167
I'm dreaming about

1601
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:53,727
This is all I'm doing

1602
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:55,775
But I'm becoming

1603
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:57,055
Very unbalanced

1604
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:00,639
NASA Global is playing

1605
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:07,807
The globalist plan is to make you all talk to you earlier

1606
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:11,135
Performative

1607
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:17,535
I don't see that as being a good plan problem is probably that Alex he's dreaming about this stuff I could

1608
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:18,559
Tutors at Visions

1609
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:23,167
Or research

1610
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:26,239
F****** time off maybe the rest of your career take it off

1611
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,263
I don't think

1612
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:28,287
Anybody

1613
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:29,055
Really

1614
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:30,591
Needs

1615
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:32,383
Your take on the Ukrainian

1616
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:33,919
Situation

1617
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:36,223
Especially when it

1618
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:38,015
Into this direction

1619
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:39,807
LaRosa's

1620
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:42,367
Lukashenko was are always calling an idiot

1621
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:43,903
And I'm moron

1622
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,695
He doesn't know anyting

1623
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:48,255
Swatch subjects ego research

1624
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:50,815
And you want to watch

1625
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:52,607
Our lawn

1626
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:53,631
Galaxy

1627
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:54,399
Michelle

1628
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:56,959
And I'm not endorse

1629
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:57,983
Everything he does

1630
01:16:58,495 --> 01:16:59,775
What he's up to there

1631
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,055
Like what

1632
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:07,455
Alexander lukashenko is a dictator and he's been in power in Belarus

1633
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:13,855
Since 1994 could f****** God I'm a little more careful about finding himself relating to look at

1634
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:20,255
Hey Lucas and I are two peas in the same pod and I see no problems with saying that out loud to Allah

1635
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,023
A lot of people

1636
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:25,119
What are the complaints of the International Community has with lukashenko

1637
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:28,447
It's Betty really seems to like torturing political dissenters

1638
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:30,751
The 2020 election where Lucas

1639
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:34,335
Santa won his sixth term though most of the world in a lot of Belarusian

1640
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,615
Believe

1641
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:36,639
Strongly that election

1642
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:39,711
It was not a fair election to a lot of protein

1643
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:41,759
According to Human Rights Watch

1644
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:46,111
At least 8712 people were detained in connection to protest

1645
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:47,391
Between November 2020

1646
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,927
October 2021

1647
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:55,583
In August 2020 the government decided that there was no reason to open an investigation into 4600

1648
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:56,607
44 claims

1649
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:57,887
Filed by victims

1650
01:17:58,143 --> 01:17:59,167
The torture by the government

1651
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:03,263
What usually the Fairly strong indication that they don't want to talk about all the torturing

1652
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:08,127
Is Alex thinks that Luca shanko sounds like his show he probably right

1653
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:11,711
But that's because Alex is yours essentially the ravings of an authoritarian wants to

1654
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:14,015
The torture and imprison people he doesn't like

1655
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:18,623
Also considering the Belarus has now at war with Ukraine also

1656
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:20,415
It really makes it clear

1657
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:21,695
Capable Alex is a

1658
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:24,255
Close to impartial coverage

1659
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:28,351
He's just a stand for Putin

1660
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:33,215
Like the idea that you can maybe okay well

1661
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:36,287
I'm going to distance myself from Putin a little bit

1662
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:38,079
I don't think the war is smart

1663
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:39,871
That's my problem

1664
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:40,895
Not smart

1665
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,431
He's in over his head

1666
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,991
He bit off more than I can chew

1667
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,527
If he said one

1668
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:47,807
Then it would have been very

1669
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:51,903
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to heat preys upon

1670
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:52,671
A

1671
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:55,999
It was just somebody who is totally neutral in this situation

1672
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,535
Somebody who I can say listen

1673
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:58,303
Somebody who's

1674
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:01,375
The only other person

1675
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:08,031
F****** a******

1676
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:14,431
Yep unreal sucks

1677
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:18,527
They say Ukraine the quote unquote

1678
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:24,927
Head on over to Belarus that's where you going to the country where Russian Troop

1679
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:31,071
Please put nuclear weapons in our country that's stupid

1680
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:35,679
Yikes has complained about Joy behar's comments being insensitive

1681
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,447
And I think

1682
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,215
That's

1683
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:38,239
A little

1684
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:41,823
Point Beach

1685
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,127
I told you

1686
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:46,175
You going to have a guest

1687
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:48,223
And it's you

1688
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:49,503
Evilly

1689
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:55,391
All right folks Leo zagami is a best-selling author research

1690
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:57,951
Vatican experts also an expert on Western

1691
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:58,975
Happening in Russia

1692
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:03,839
I'm sorry what is an expert on what sorry what now what

1693
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:08,191
I mean he has spent some time in St Petersburg cuz of his like DJ

1694
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:09,215
Sure

1695
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,239
I know like

1696
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:13,311
I know that I've seen videos of him like

1697
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:14,592
Showing

1698
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:18,176
Flyers for the event cities.in Russian stuff

1699
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:22,784
At least Samba familiarity with the country but more than Alex

1700
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:24,064
Elizabeth be

1701
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,600
Like really above-board here

1702
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,904
He is not a best-selling author

1703
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,184
Those books are

1704
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,208
Disaster is

1705
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:30,976
They suck

1706
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:32,000
Self-published

1707
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:34,816
He claimed that he was in the Illuminati

1708
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:36,096
He was Jesus

1709
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:40,960
Well yes he was approved to the Vatican that he was Jesus and they were like whoa

1710
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:44,288
Can't believe it can't believe it's blowing my mind right now.

1711
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:49,408
The only Jesus would have

1712
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:51,968
Yeah if you could open the padlock

1713
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:53,760
All the basement of the Vatican

1714
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:56,832
They have eye scanners that only record

1715
01:20:57,088 --> 01:21:03,232
Acknowledge Jesus as I know he is repurposed himself I guess as

1716
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,512
Is ax word

1717
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,840
International relations Visa V Russia

1718
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:16,800
In the meeting

1719
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,848
Moscow in 2002

1720
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:22,688
At briefly end in

1721
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:26,784
When he was a steal a mare in St Petersburg remember

1722
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:27,552
End

1723
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:29,600
Heating change Russian polish

1724
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,160
Sure

1725
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:40,096
I would I would like to just because it's fun imagine that every part of

1726
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:45,472
Leo's mythology is something that he believed simultaneously as opposed to he's done a bunch

1727
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:48,544
Two different grips over the years he's coming off of

1728
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:54,944
Just a few months earlier at 11 for 9/11

1729
01:21:55,456 --> 01:22:01,600
Saw the towers go down was like I got to get out of here I'm going to head to st. Petersburg going to hang out with my buddy them

1730
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:02,368
Mayor

1731
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:05,184
President by 2002

1732
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,120
All this is so dumb

1733
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:16,704
Anyway after that

1734
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:19,520
Intelligence services

1735
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:25,408
Right now

1736
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:27,968
Right that they had to frame up some folk

1737
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:30,016
F****** a******

1738
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:34,112
But that's it just goes to show the cravenness at the depths of the thieves

1739
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:35,904
These con artists will go to

1740
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,720
In order to come up with their new mythology

1741
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:42,048
Which is it part of it is done in service

1742
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,352
Of getting rid of that old one that

1743
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,120
Kind of sucks

1744
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:47,680
You don't want to be the guy who's Jesus

1745
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:54,336
It started Matrix ism is 911 amazing might be fun for a little bit

1746
01:22:57,664 --> 01:23:02,784
You need a new gimmick you had a 2002

1747
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:05,344
And I know everything about Russian politics

1748
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,672
Look the the the

1749
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:10,464
The world is seeing

1750
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:14,560
Breaking out in Russia which is short people are pretty heart

1751
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:17,632
It's nice to see people

1752
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:19,936
Being that brave right

1753
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:24,288
Lukashenko and Putin both are fans of torturing people who protest

1754
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:27,104
You should know is actually not true

1755
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:35,808
I mean

1756
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:42,208
President Vladimir Putin

1757
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:44,512
If some people get arrested

1758
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:50,912
People I know for sure

1759
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:51,680
The West

1760
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:53,728
They of course get money also by George

1761
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:58,080
It's not the relevant

1762
01:23:58,336 --> 01:24:04,480
Yeah man these protesters just paid by Soros wow irrelevant

1763
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:06,784
Trying to play the I'm impartial games

1764
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:09,088
Just at disaster

1765
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:10,368
I.

1766
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:11,648
That's really

1767
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:12,928
That's really incredible

1768
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,232
Good work

1769
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:16,512
Goodworks agave

1770
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:18,560
Does Christ

1771
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:24,448
Yeah it's not relevance what why would all of those people care

1772
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,288
I mean sure their money is on fire

1773
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:30,592
But Lisa relevant to the work

1774
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:35,200
Cooking class the man who feeds his family and his money's on fire

1775
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:36,736
Not relevant irrelevant

1776
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:40,576
So we went from

1777
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:43,392
That that meaningful toot for our purposes

1778
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:48,768
But he describes what is going to be Putin plan after this

1779
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:49,792
Alex should

1780
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:53,120
You should have stronger

1781
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:55,936
Because they're at a time right

1782
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:56,960
Is this

1783
01:24:57,472 --> 01:25:01,312
The Centenary of the Soviet Union crane his

1784
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:05,920
Is going to go into the bath

1785
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:13,600
And so basically Europe

1786
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:16,928
Heading gift for peace

1787
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:26,912
And so if you want we got to get you on this way

1788
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:28,704
Call this amazing thank you so much

1789
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:35,360
Wow okay see your your guy who's supposed Russian expert is

1790
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:37,664
He's going to put together the Soviet Union again

1791
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,224
I want to rethink some of your support

1792
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,016
But you're throwing around here

1793
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:43,808
Alex I just want to let you know

1794
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:45,344
That after this

1795
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,368
Again

1796
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:48,416
Super totally fine

1797
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:52,768
Both side invasion of Ukraine just really gentral

1798
01:25:54,048 --> 01:26:00,192
Putin will also be invading 627 other countries and I'll help

1799
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:05,568
Because if the 100th anniversary of the forming of the Soviet Union

1800
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:10,688
What were you just going to let Finland not celebrate with you this sounds like the new American

1801
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:14,528
Doesn't get much more American than colonizing

1802
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:15,808
There is something

1803
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,904
I feel like Alex might want to take a break

1804
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,696
A little Breaky Breaky

1805
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:28,096
Take take some time off we think maybe take a big long break but I think over that time he might want to rethink

1806
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:34,496
How he wants to lick position himself right terrible job right now I mean

1807
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:36,288
Sincerely is doobie

1808
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:38,848
I can out now Putin apologist

1809
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,408
This goes on

1810
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:43,456
I don't understand

1811
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,224
What else

1812
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,248
He could be setting

1813
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:46,016
Myself up for

1814
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:46,784
I mean

1815
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:47,808
Honestly

1816
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:50,880
Like we're at a point where

1817
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:54,720
I'm even willing to entertain the thought of Alex being like well

1818
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:57,024
Listen I'm going to be broke in America soon

1819
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:58,048
But

1820
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:01,376
If I'm not in America maybe I'm in Russia

1821
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:05,984
They need a new Infowars they got a lot of wood they got a lot of woods out there

1822
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,264
I told my daughter camping

1823
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,288
I told that you called for me

1824
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,104
Yeah I don't I don't I don't know I don't think

1825
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:14,432
I don't know that's absolutely ridiculous but it is nuts

1826
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:15,200
Just don't

1827
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:18,016
Get I don't get what the game is

1828
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:18,784
Really

1829
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:21,856
It's a rare it's a rare instance where I can

1830
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:26,208
Can see like little pieces of it and yeah he's doing makes sense and the

1831
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:28,256
The little propaganda games

1832
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:31,072
But the overarching point of it I can't really see

1833
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:34,912
I don't know what the benefit of this is other than maintaining

1834
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:38,752
The idea of him as a champion of these anti

1835
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:41,824
Sjw

1836
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:44,128
Memes and

1837
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,408
And there it is that he has

1838
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,712
That's the only thing that I see

1839
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:49,760
Is being worth it

1840
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:51,040
For him to preserve a

1841
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:53,088
I mean I think the only

1842
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:55,136
Maybe maybe here's what I'm

1843
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:58,464
Maybe it is at a point where they're just

1844
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,512
Pot committed with Putin

1845
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,048
And they can

1846
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:03,072
Can't admit they were wrong

1847
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:09,472
They can't just say it maybe I was wrong so there is a place where they built up Putin and Trump as both being soup

1848
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:10,240
Super cool dudes

1849
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:15,872
Who are absolutely aboveboard and not at all line to the global community at all times it may you might be right

1850
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:18,176
And if you say Putin is actually

1851
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:19,712
F****** evil

1852
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:22,272
Like everybody obviously knew he was

1853
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,064
Then you also have

1854
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,344
To say well I was wrong

1855
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:26,880
Spec's humble

1856
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:29,184
Yeah yeah it could

1857
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,232
It could could be that simple

1858
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:32,768
I mean I wish it were

1859
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:34,560
You know there's a busy

1860
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:36,864
There's an out there possibility

1861
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,680
I am just throwing this out

1862
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:40,960
You better now

1863
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:43,264
Alex and his

1864
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,032
Community

1865
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:47,360
Never were more relevant than the Cold War

1866
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:51,968
That's a good point world

1867
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:53,504
Where there was

1868
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,784
A big

1869
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,344
Ominous villain

1870
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,648
Consistent threat of nuclear war

1871
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:05,280
Really really did wonders for the anti-communist community right and

1872
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:06,304
Made them

1873
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,864
Voice Within

1874
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:10,656
Some of the right-wing

1875
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:17,056
They gave them a boogeyman that was such a society wasn't necessarily as maligned until after

1876
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:19,360
McCarthy

1877
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:20,640
So I

1878
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:23,712
I could see some kind of subconscious Drive

1879
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:25,504
To bring back the good old days

1880
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:26,784
Voorhees

1881
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,320
Antiquated

1882
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:29,344
Radical

1883
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,392
Right in that

1884
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:32,672
In that circumstance

1885
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:34,464
The ironic part

1886
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:35,488
Is that is that be

1887
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:37,024
Because of the way that their

1888
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,048
Pics of migrated

1889
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:40,352
They're cold war buddy

1890
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:41,376
Would be Russia

1891
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:42,656
I don't think

1892
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:45,472
Cuz right now they feel like they're in a cold war with

1893
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:49,056
Every but I guess the democratic government as a at the con

1894
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:55,712
I feel like a process that bridge when they got there

1895
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:56,992
How it would play out

1896
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:00,064
Just spitballing

1897
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:01,856
I don't know it's

1898
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:04,672
I find the same time

1899
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,232
Just disgraceful

1900
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:08,000
The

1901
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:08,768
The way that I look

1902
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:10,048
Extract position himself in

1903
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:10,816
Pretend that he is

1904
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:12,608
Like not just

1905
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:14,400
Doing

1906
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:16,704
Rationalization justification

1907
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,752
That's all he's doing

1908
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:20,288
Absolutely

1909
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:21,824
The breakdown was pathetic

1910
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:25,152
Even in terms of just like on a scale of

1911
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,456
Good break down to

1912
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:28,736
Bad breakdown

1913
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:29,760
Very low on that

1914
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:30,528
Upscale

1915
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:31,552
Unreal

1916
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:32,576
Will be back

1917
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:36,928
But until then

1918
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:43,584
We are on Twitter that knowledge underscore fight and I go to bed Jordan

1919
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,352
Marbles

1920
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:54,848
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work
