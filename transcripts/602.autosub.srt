1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Air Jordan

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as if through the good guy

3
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Need money

4
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:59,648
Bestbuy.com

5
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:08,608
Fix it around where they all through and talk a little bit about Alex

6
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,888
Why I was kind of like

7
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:16,288
Lost for a second summer

8
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,592
How's it going

9
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:22,176
What is

10
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:28,576
Your brakes but my brakes but they Jordan with a resounding capital letter is 100 cards

11
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,904
I got some

12
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,696
Capital letters her bright spots

13
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,976
Yes Magic

14
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:39,328
Car card capitals all across the board

15
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:44,192
The gate with trying out the magic Arena online it was fun

16
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:48,544
I like the art style of a lot of these cards I like the gameplay I enjoy that

17
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,592
But it wasn't really

18
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:54,944
Exactly what I was looking for until I got on eBay and just got a big

19
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,712
Box

20
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:59,552
Of random cards and that was what I was looking for

21
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,624
It's there's a tactile sensation to pee

22
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,976
Looking at Henderson before we start recording

23
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,280
There's almost like an implied story

24
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,888
That's just it's gripping and an atmospheric and

25
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,656
Calming

26
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:18,752
I really really really enjoy it and I wish that I've been able to

27
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,080
Mess around with these things when I was 13 yeah I understand

28
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:28,224
That's that same feeling that like you would never go to a bookstore bookstore that just filled with ebooks

29
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,040
You know like you go to a used book store with

30
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,344
Stacks of books that are unorganized

31
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,392
And you can smell the paper and you can

32
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:41,792
Touch it with your fingers and it's completely different vinyls

33
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:48,192
Where old we are old but so I was considering checking

34
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,264
Some of these cards out push me over the edge

35
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,080
Make me like you. Definitely for sure

36
00:02:54,336 --> 00:03:00,224
Was that Jason sent us something at to the mailbox yeah and that was

37
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:05,088
Individually crafted Magic Car insane based on Alex Jones

38
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,136
Put up a picture of them

39
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:13,792
But 11 is a sudden plug and the other is not over prepare

40
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,840
Awesome their amazing

41
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,680
These are just a one-of-a-kind things in Issaquah

42
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,984
Why not build a collection around B

43
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,080
So I'm I'm starting down that road I'm going to not go too crazy

44
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:30,688
Put Jason in his notes that he sent along with it also

45
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,504
He requested that we give a shout out to his uncle

46
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,552
And I say f*** that no

47
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,344
To both of you

48
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,160
Bob homeboy Jason

49
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:46,560
Shot at a car lot of aggressive energy coming from all directions to he's telling me I have

50
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:52,960
Have to do something you're telling me that I have to do something different to I'm just going to say you can sit out of this one I'm giving both

51
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:59,360
Call Michelle.

52
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,712
Evolutionary RV there's no way around it

53
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:10,368
Also piggybacking on some of this stuff to I want to give a special shout-out to Dillon k

54
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,904
Who got in touch with me

55
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,047
And I was way too delayed in sending an email back about that and idea for a card game the sort of along these lines

56
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,631
And Lucas H thank you so much

57
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:28,031
That's a battle-hardened goblin card on Twitter that started a little bit of thread

58
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:34,431
Personalities of magic cards

59
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,711

The spirit indeed

62
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,487
In the Before Time

63
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,047
Alright for covid-19

64
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,583
Okay

65
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,375
My partner and I

66
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,191
We're going to see a magic show

67
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,751
Oh that place down on Clark

68
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,079
We were going to see that magic and a week

69
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,151
Before everything shut down

70
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,431
So

71
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,711
This Friday

72
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,991
Finally

73
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:15,647
We will be going to that very same magic show by Fred 98 it happening it's coming full circle we're get

74
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,439
Not a pandemic this is a symbol

75
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:23,839
This is a meaningful thing to do. Nightmare it's never going to make it

76
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:29,727
There is a magic club they don't have like a sign saying magic it's like it there like okay there's a door

77
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,519
The secretly find

78
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,311
And you're like that doesn't match apart

79
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:39,711
But you're never going to make it in the door to find that place I really really

80
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:46,111
I love that idea of this poorly advertised Magic Theater

81
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:50,207
It's a Vibe and I really mean of course

82
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,743
Love that book

83
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:58,399
Places always called to me I'm excited

84
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,983
You will sow also Jordan before we get into

85
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,823
Too much business here I want to give a shout out to Bodie

00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:33,215
Today we have an interesting situation on our hands we have

92
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:39,615
Alex's just lost some soup and exhausted at now at this point

93

00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,391

We're here

102
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,887
Heroin

103
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,423
Why you poop so good

104
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,495
Freakishly large

105
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:44,383
Who started the State against his net worth

106
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,919
Yes sir so look

107
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,247
I mean we all know what went down we were there

108
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,551
We would we saw it all happen

109
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:57,951
Alex is all the newly Vindicated everybody has changed their Tunes everybody realizes

110
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
Schnauzer

111
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:04,351
Horrible mistakes they've made in they've treated him types of bad news

112
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,679
Alex gotta be lost

113
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:15,103
With prejudice news came out at the end of last week

114
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,663
Miles in Texas court with judge in the case giving the parents

115
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,431
A default

116
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,199
Ulta judgment

117
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:25,855
These two cases initially were brought by Leonard Posner and veronique

118
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,159
And the one that was brought by Scarlett Lewis

119
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:34,559
I took a little bit longer for the news to break on it but there's also a third case that Alex lost that day which was robbed by Neil heslin

120
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:40,191
I wanted to get deeply into the Weeds on this development but you know how I am with these technical issues

121
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:44,543
Sometimes drop the ball so just kind of embarrassed myself sometimes I get

122
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,079
Emails for people who are like

123
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:52,479
You don't you don't know this term I believe in our first two deposition episode I called the guy a prosecutor

124
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:56,063
Embarrassed myself sometimes

125
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,855
Do you know what I think would be great

126
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
What if

127
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,415
What if what if we could get

128
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,231
The Sandy Hook parents lead counsel Mark Bankston

129
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,791
To come on our show and help explain it

130
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
Well yeah but I mean there's no chance

131
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,191
After that maneuver

132
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:16,543
Hey everybody welcome to this segment

133
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,151
We're going to do something a little bit very out of

134
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,967
Out of the norm yeah yeah

135
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,503
To be joined by

136
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,575
Lead counsel for the the Sandy Hook

137
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,903
Families posing Alex Jones

138
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,695
In court

139
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,975
That you're telling the truth

140
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:40,351
That's the weird part see when you when you announce something like that on this show we're supposed to be

141
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:44,191
Being ridiculous friend doing a character exactly

142
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:49,311
Mark Bankston welcome thank you for joining us

143
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,103
Thank you so much for having me I'm glad to

144
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:56,479
I appreciate you taking the time I know that I imagine there's some press request

145
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,783
This point boring

146
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,855
They're absolutely boring it wants to talk to you no answers

147
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
Cooper that's not

148
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:09,279
He's CIA

149
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:13,631
If you did go on Anderson Cooper and talk to him you could talk about his nose disappearing

150
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
And that would be

151
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:18,239
That is my partner call Farah was on and

152
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,263
Friday night

153
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,103
I'm talking about the disappearing nose and knothole

154
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
Insane

155
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,895
Proposition

156
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,199
For those who aren't regular followers

157
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,807
Mr. Jones contends that one of my clients berni Delarosa

158
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,831
Performed

159
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:36,159
Fake interview on a blue screen in a CNN soundstage

160
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,463
It's rather than actually being at Sandy Hook

161
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,767
Disappeared

162
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,351
Breakers you know just a little middle little noses.

163
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:48,959
I would love it if your fellow lawyer who is on Anderson Cooper

164
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:54,079
Where did the I got your nose trick that would have been awesome

165
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:03,551
Straight the place I'd like to start with this I guess

166
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,343
It is that we're doing is

167
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,623
What hap

168
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,695
What week can you explain the ruling that happens

169
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,719
Sure

170
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,255
I'm not a legal scholar

171
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,559
Sew-in in before I say it

172
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,631
There's some ground rules that we're going to be

173
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,423
Expected to follow today

174
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
DD

175
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:25,055
The ethical rules regarding pre-trial publicity make me not be able to say a couple things

176
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,359
Why can't I can't talk to you about things like

177
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,175
The credibility of certain Witnesses or my belief

178
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,199
On the guilt or innocence

179
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,479
Certain people Aldi

180
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,807
Two things chirp but they're also becomes a sort of loophole

181
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,087
When you're opposed

182
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
Party

183
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,391
Completely abuses

184
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:43,999
Pretrial publicity in says the most insane things publicly to freeze you up to

185
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,815
And so that's part of why I'm here today is that

186
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,399
It's a little bit further than I would normally be because my opponent

187
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
Has made an Absol

188
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
Mockery

189
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:56,799
This is the pot Kettle statute recall

190
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,407
The Paw Kettle situation

191
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:07,551
But let me just say in relation to that if there's any point where anything feels uncomfortable or like

192
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,575
Past what you

193
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,111
Can't talk about just let me know

194
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,415
I'll respect that entirely

195
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,695
Then all watching injection

196
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:18,559
Jordans

197
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:22,399
Bobby Barnes it up in here and just double-checking

198
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:28,799
Hey Google is Barnes good work B

199
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
Happened

200
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,151
It is never happen

201
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,223
It has never happened to anybody I know

202
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
Outside of

203
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
The most insane

204
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:38,783
Situation

205
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,111
Alright well then I can cross one of my questions off the list which was

206
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:46,463
Have you ever had a case like this before the answer is never got you

207
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
Advocates like this

208
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,815
Is for the past 3 years

209
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,631
We have been in a situation where Jones's had

210
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
Discovery Auto

211
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,215
Let me see the court will enter order saying yes

212
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,495
How to produce certain documents

213
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,079
Daft Punk albums

214
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,103
You're right

215
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,663
An absolute mess

216
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,479
So not only is he not producing the documents

217
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
Not answering the

218
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,831
Let me know when were talking about question where did their stuff like

219
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,159
Name all the employees who worked on these videos and

220
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:22,815
Name the videos themselves never met any of them questions

221
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,631
Simple facts are not answering

222
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,423
And then you have the

223
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,007
The documents they won't produce and then you have the documents date

224
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,543
Do produce when when they

225
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,591
End up giving us a bunch of documents

226
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,871
Turn over them in electronic

227
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,639
Format

228
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,175
Oh one of the Consultants up

229
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,711
Connecticut found that they had given us

230
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,479
Child pronography

231
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,575
Yeah that was a mess of a

232
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
Affair

233
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:49,695
Bounty on

234
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,231
I was

235
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,255
It's against

236
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,791
Go to those situations where it just

237
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,071
Nobody has ever

238
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,423
So we know we had a we had and I think

239
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,215
A credit to our judges

240
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,751
You just recently retired

241
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,031
We are Judge Scott drink

242
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
He's a mold

243
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,591
Charlie judge

244
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
Does things right by the book

245
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,223
And he was giving Infowars and Jones every chance they had

246
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,247
To get

247
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,271
Compliance

248
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,551
Correctly

249
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,623
I mean a lot of other parties they would've been done well

250
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,719
You don't want to give Jones the ability to say I'm being Railroad

251
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,767
Closest railroad jobs

252
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,303
What's that's not what you want to do

253
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,839
Enso

254
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:33,215
We gave him every chance that he had but after 3 years now we show up into our last hearing and they basically

255
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,751
Pretend like we have no idea where

256
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,823
His lawyers are brand-new he's on lawyer number 7

257
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:43,711
What is law

258
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:49,087
I don't know how love works is a legitimate thing for a lawyer that works for Alex to say

259
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:57,279
Defense is just a little while ago saying he was going to get into stand-up on

260
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,327
Alexa show

261
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,423
You know you noticed that there has been a Cavalcade of lawyers

262
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
You have

263
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,983
Finn Jones as an opera

264
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:06,751
Opportunity

265
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
Themselves

266
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,311
Admit card out

267
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
In the right wing

268
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,359
I probably would

269
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:15,711
Do I mean I think that's a real irrational thing to do

270
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:20,063
Bobby Barnes got it turned into a show on Infowars

271
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:25,695
For a while not the career-changing opportunity that he was open for but

272
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:29,791
Just not right maybe it was exactly

273
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:33,119
You was hoping for when you're representing these cases

274
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,167
You never think you're going to get so lucky

275
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,751
As to have your opposing counsel be an actual Infowars comment

276
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,591
You don't get that one

277
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:48,991
Something up for us we've noted so long we've known it for years but then you eat

278
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,319
You say it in person a real lawyer

279
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:56,415
Meaning it's in the real world and not just ourselves

280
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,231
It just completely ridiculous

281
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:03,071
An amazing perspective on this or like

282
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,607
Sense of humor about it

283
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:09,215
You know watching the depositions that we did it seems like it would be infuriating

284
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,775
Like you just be banging your head against the wall

285
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,847
I think most people would probably look at that and be like

286
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:20,735
I'm miserable you seem to find some amusement in it which I think is probably healthy probably how you feel

287
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,039
Oh yeah yeah what you got

288
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,319
People when I first got on the

289
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,879
I had to watch about 150 hours

290
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,671
And

291
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,463
As you guys know that message

292
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,815
Enso

293
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,631
After a while do you do kind of half

294
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
To take a speck

295
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,959
At the barn at that you you embrace the absurdity of it all

296
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,519
In Ennis I'll tell you this it's

297
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,359
You know it's particularly easy to find a good sense of humor about it all

298
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,943
When at the same time these things are happening you are also

299
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,247
Is beating them up and down

300
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,807
In this case

301
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,111
When I'm sitting in that Jones deposition in in

302
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,415
He is saying the most absurd stuff

303
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,695
Yum some level 2

304
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,231
Infuriating to watch him not take the

305
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,255
That process serious

306
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,095
On the other hand it's intensely rewarding when he says stuff like

307
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,399
Oh we ourselves we never even Envy

308
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,103
Was was really good

309
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,407
Because I haven't really answered your question is

310
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,943
Been there done that

311
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,223
Sending it over

312
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
For all

313
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,295
The judge has said

314
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,367
These people have disobeyed the rules with such intensity

315
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,671
With such consistency

316
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:37,023
That there's no way that my my judicial rulings are ever going to have any impact

317
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,071
Damn so what she's done

318
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,095
Just declared

319
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,375
Which basically says I'm going to

320
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
Instruct the jury

321
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,935
That what he did was

322
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,471
Illegal unlawful and

323
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,751
Can cause damage to these

324
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,287
And their only job

325
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,823
Figure out how much money that's worth

326
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:56,479
Yeah but that's the next step right that's the that's where the case goes from here then to figuring out

327
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,527
What's the price tag

328
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,551
Exactly

329
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,599
Another one of those where

330
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,391
Nobody has any idea

331
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,951
Because nobody has ever seen anything like

332
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,231
Yeah

333
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:13,887
One of the things that I know from Alex's response to the the news of these

334
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,679
These are default judgement

335
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,727
Was that he said he

336
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,543
Produced all of his bank records

337
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,591
From like his entire life

338
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,615
Is that true

339
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:30,271
Bu-but to the Connecticut court

340
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,575
In Texas and there's also a lawsuit

341
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,135
And he did have to produce

342
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,183
Some financial information

343
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:37,951
Internet

344
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999
I I have

345
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,535
Personally viewed it

346
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,071
But I know what was

347
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,351
Requested what was had

348
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
Okay

349
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,679
Actually produce

350
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,471
It was not a

351
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,263
Abroad Spanish

352
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,799
Financial in Korean.

353
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,943
Mainly because what you have to understand and

354
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,479
You know differ

355
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,015
Different lawyers have

356
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,039
Different ways they approach

357
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,879
Aaron Connecticut one of the big things that they're talking about

358
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,415
It's an interesting idea

359
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,439
Is that

360
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,975
Part of why Jones

361
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,999
Did this so often

362
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:12,767
Sending so much

363
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,047
Cuz you'll definitely

364
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,863
Is that if you can look at the Wrecker

365
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,631
Urgency

366
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,911
That sales

367
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:23,263
Or brain force and male Vitality rehire on the days that Sandy Hook was

368
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,543
Disgust

369
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,311
Control modem

370
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,079
That he had to do

371
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,407
Personally I also believe you can look at

372
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
That

373
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
His motive is

374
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,759
Genuinely that he started

375
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:35,807
Adidas

376
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,575
These parents be

377
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
Came

378
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,879
Genuine Financial threats

379
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,927
Because if they got strikes

380
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,207
YouTube everytime you put up app

381
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,743
A picture of their kids saying that they were fake

382
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,023
Then pretty soon

383
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
Likelihood

384
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,983
An inference that that really was his motive is that

385
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,031
Alex Jones that

386
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:56,799
New

387
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,567
It was

388
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:58,847
He talking about Sandy

389
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,127
Swaney just couldn't help

390
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:08,319
Yeah that's about right that's it that's an interesting perspective I think I think there may be something to that and there may just be

391
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:12,415
Be like he's never really had any meaningful consequences ever in the past

392
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:18,047
Why why would he change his behavior if there is

393
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,607
Keep the Dukes of Hazzard in himself out of trouble

394
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,423
Exactly I mean I've never been interested

395
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,447
Situation where

396
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
The answers

397
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,775
Questions that people are asking him have any Khan

398
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,311
That he would be held to account

399
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,615
And for him being in a Depo

400
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
Position music

401
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,151
Completely nude

402
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687

You know we have done big work

409
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,959

Civil rights

414

What is an interesting thing as a lawyer to go to

I could imagine what are the reasons that I'm on this show right at this moment is I want y'all to go back at some point listen to those episodes in

00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,008

As to what this means or what is going on here what the

430
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,784
100%.

431
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,832
Everyhome

The Dead on

434
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,280
I look particularly

435
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,072
I'm talking about the Paul Joseph

436
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:55,840
Watson.

437
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,680
That one was that one was the one that was kind of

438
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
The least

439
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,776
Funny but very interesting

440
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,544
Because

441
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,080
Because like you pointed out

442
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,360
Watson

443
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,640
Is very aware of how

444
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,408
How bad this is

445
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,176
He doesn't want to be

446
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,528
It's strange you would have never thought Paul Joseph Watson

447
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,552
Stop being the good guy

448
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,832
You know I mean

449
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,880
That was interesting was he really worried about it

450
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,672
Because he was worried about the morality or cuz you

451
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,440
He was worried about the money

452
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:29,376
I feel like he came off like Stringer Bell you know like you would think he was above this Fray and

453
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:33,216
And he saw his friend going to jail for you know 8 years and he's like

454
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,288
I have nothing to do with this I'm just over here on the other side

455
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:38,592
You mentioned Stringer Bell do it

456
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,616
You got to remember the other

457
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,152
There's that email from Watson worried

458
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:41,920
Says

459
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,480
Jones the Sandy Hook stop killing us these people are bad

460
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
She crazy

461
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,808
And that kind of reminds me of stringer Bells warning of like

462
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,832
You are writing

463
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,368
Down of criminal conspiracy

464
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:56,768
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it is wild

465
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,304
It almost feels like

466
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,864
I'm sorry Jordan had said in that podcast

467
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,168
When you're done with

468
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,240
You're sort of tempted to just go lightning around with him

469
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,544
And just you know climate change

470
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,336
Let's talk about

471
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,664
List of every story of Paul Watson

472
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,688
But I wanted to talk

473
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,480
But you get to that planet

474
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,016
Realized

475
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,880
Really interesting thing that

476
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,416
Show me the people inside him

477
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,208
Public record shows

478
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:27,744
They don't know

479
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,024
What's going on they don't

480
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,072
Paul Watson

481
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,096
Yeah

482
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,632
Supposed to Rob doing Alex

483
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:41,568
What's remarkable is that those emails that the toll had showed that he knew that then

484
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:46,176
He tried to make others aware of it

485
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,456
At the time

486
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,784
I am so they have every reason to know

487
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,808
Hidden kisses

488
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,600
Something that could be quiet

489
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,392
Warm water

490
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:57,952
Exactly

491
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,720
And then what

492
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,744
Contrast that is

493
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,512
From what we saw

494
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,280
From Rob do

495
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:04,096
My favorite thing

496
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,424
Rum dude has a lot

497
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:11,008
A lot on his shoulders in terms of why we're at where we are at

498
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:20,992
Is the corporate representative I'm supposed to know what that was

499
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:24,576
3 oz beer to have it more times than what happened Rob use deposition

500
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,136
Robbed you unlike the other Witnesses

501
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,696
Wasn't there testifying as himself

502
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,720
He was there too

503
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,488
Define as

504
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,536
Free Speech systems which is Jones

505
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,096
Subsidiary company that runs all this

506
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:42,496
Stop USB corporate assigned corporate Representatives

507
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,544
You're giving homework you're giving a list of

508
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,312
Topix

509
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,592
And you have the deed

510
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,640
The corporation has a reasonable Duty

511
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
Repair YouTube

512
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,200
Testify about those topics

513
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,736
And speak with the corporation

514
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,016
Voice give the answer

515
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,600
Rob you have no idea he was supposed to do that

516
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:02,720
And the funny thing about that is your remember that's the first deposition

517
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:06,304
He has no idea what he's supposed to do he has no idea

518
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,584
Jesus I don't know to everything

519
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:14,240
November 11th you kept having to ask back like do you not know or just free speech systems

520
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,312
My favorite my favorite

521
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,848
So I have to give a shout out

522
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:21,408
That was my other partner Bill Ogden

523
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,432
Did that deposition

524
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
That one

525
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,016
Was in the midst of it

526
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,552
One of the most defensive

527
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,320
And

528
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:29,856
Humana disre

529
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,392
Respect me and Sean for the process was

530
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,160
Infuriating

531
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,720
But the moment you get the transcript and listen to it becomes the most

532
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,488
Hilarious things

533
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,560
Because you don't you simply are uncapable

534
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,192
Did Rob didn't know

535
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:47,008
Like I think if you watch that tape of the deposition

536
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:51,872
It's kind of coming over him how unprepared he is as it's going along

537
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,432
I think he thought he could come in and Stonewall

538
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,992
Or whatever and

539
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,784
Comes across in your podcast about it

540
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,064
Because you did extra lot answer

541
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
In order to

542
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,368
Spirit of it

543
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
You have to win

544
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,672
Conclude about 20 to 30 minutes

545
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,696
Total silence

546
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,256
It was Brianna

547
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:13,376
Realtor. Are you ask a question and you're staring at a solid 2 minutes and he hasn't opened his mouth

548
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,704
No

549
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,472
The know that

550
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,776
What was the first time

551
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,312
Did Rob do you got understand that

552
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,336
6 months later

553
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,640
They got called to Discovery again

554
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:30,272
And they designated him again.

555
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:36,160
Say jail in Acworth that last time let's try it again

556
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:42,304
Throw Them Bones

557
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:45,632
Talk about these sourcing and research buying these episodes

558
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,192
You dummy

559
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,240
Didn't even know what have to do that

560
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,776
And so good

561
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,336
It was it was so offensive that.

562
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,616
The judge

563
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,896
Scratching their heads

564
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,456
Like I wrote an order saying that this was

565
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,480
Was really really bad and

566
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,760
Did it again

567
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,832
And at that point even at that point

568
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,624
Where we have gone through three cases

569
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,648
With no discovery

570
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,184
Child pronography and Binford

571
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,976
Deposition

572
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,256
Totally ignored it

573
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,280
Nothing is going on

574
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,816
We still got another chance

575
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,120
Appeal

576
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,400
Get this big.

577
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,704
21 the case and dismissed all of these cases

578
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,240
Still want an illegal argue

579
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,264
They didn't

580
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,312
Another appeal

581
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,336
Comeback

582
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,128
And then get another chance

583
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,176
Discovered it was only after they didn't do

584
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:30,944
Do that

585
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:33,760
But they were they were defaulted so when I see Jones

586
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,320
Person getting on his Show recently after

587
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,088
This happened

588
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,928
And an insane about how unfairly he's been treated

589
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,464
What a travesty it is

590
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,512
I've got to impress upon

591
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,072
This does not happen in judge

592
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,096
I just don't want to do it

593
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
And it took

594
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,888
3 years

595
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,984
You have been given literally

596
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,592
Every available benefit of the doubt to the point now where the judgment

597
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:03,456
Used to be 100 pages long and this is just one page of an ASCII middle finger

598
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,760
Just saying you owe money

599
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:10,624
Yeah I mean like I think anybody who lives on Star show probably is aware of how like

600
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:17,280
Very clear from an outsider's perspective it is that his strategy has been kicked the can down the road

601
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:20,352
Basically to make sure this doesn't go to trial

602
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,120
Or like

603
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,240
Partially in someone of his legal strategies we've seen in the past it's been

604
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,288
If we protract this case

605
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,312
Examples cost

606
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,872
The other people too much money and they want to settle

607
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:36,736
Happened a bit I think he was banking on that happening here

608
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,808
It's tough to know what he

609
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,600
Yeah

610
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:46,208
Because I think there was at that time and maybe he's still convinced of it that

611
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,512
No matter what happens

612
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,560
She's going to be at Larry Flynt hero Jugos

613
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:55,168
Look to the US Supreme Court in everybody you know it's all going to be saved and they're going to make a movie about what Heroes

614
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,472
Genuinely

615
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,496
When someone will have

616
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,056
The problem now though

617
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,080
Is that

618
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:06,432
In order to appeal to the US Supreme Court and vindicate yourself on the First Amendment rights

619
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:09,760
You have actually had to have made the first amendment argument and

620
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,296
And how to hello suit

621
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,344
Trial that actually happened here

622
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
You had

623
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,416
No you screwed around discover you're done

624
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,208
So you don't you don't get to a

625
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,488
People saying that you're right

626
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,304
We never had an exhibition of your right

627
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,840
I don't even know what the hell they are right now

628
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,608
So

629
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,144
Right now all we have is

630
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912
You have

631
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,192
Massively

632
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,472
Disobeyed a quarter

633
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,520
And that is the only thing you'll ever be able to appeal

634
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,568
Angela Lenny Bruce Matt

635
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,592
He's going to do it

636
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,640
This is what happens when you have seven

637
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,712
Albuquerque Journal

638
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,992
Never had a

639
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,040
Was it was always

640
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,320
It was always about

641
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
It's not

642
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,648
Some point you have to

643
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,416
Two-faced it

644
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:51,232
And that's what we're looking at now we're set now for March

645
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,000
28

646
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,280
For us to go

647
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,560
Pull some jurors

648
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,864
I mean basically put on

649
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,448
Psychological evidence of what happened or plaintiff put on evidence of how far this

650
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:03,264
Brad you know we're going to have to go with me 112 people

651
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,544
Unlike us

652
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,104
Don't have a real firm understanding of what

653
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,128
Infowars cultural

654
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,176
Don't understand it

655
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,944
Exactly how big

656
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,992
This was

657
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,808
Talk to a jury about that but in terms of them being able to say

658
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,344
What we did we were just

659
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,136
Justified in doing it absolutely not

660
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:19,904
Dude that's going

661
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,208
Yeah that that chapter this is over

662
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:29,120
Yeah this is such a Owens f****** community service all over again it's like all you had to do was

663
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,144
30 hours

664
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,936
That is not a lot

665
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,240
All you needed to do was show up

666
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:40,128
With the documents you didn't you and then you could have pushed probably another year down the road

667
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:47,808
That implies though do you know that there's a reason he wouldn't want to do that

668
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,344
To be considered rational actor

669
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,904
And they're doing what they do for a reason

670
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,696
We can speculate about it but it

671
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,256
Yeah yeah yeah

672
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,560
It really is because I mean that's the whole problem

673
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,864
So many times you want to try to

674
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,400
Predict what's about to happen or

675
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,704
Bye-bye using a rational Act

676
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,008
And it never works

677
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,592
What you think is going to happen is not whatever happens

678
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,384
And so we basically

679
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,664
The easiest way to

680
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,456
Some predictive control on the over the

681
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,248
This case is too at any juncture

682
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,040
Alright if I'm Jones

683
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:19,808
Did I miss attorneys

684
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,088
What would I do rashes

685
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,392
And then you can go ahead and cross at least that one off

686
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:28,512
Admit

687
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,536
Now you're throwing darts at

688
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,816
Your chaos board figuring out which

689
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,120
What is that this is really how it's been

690
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,656
There's no

691
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,192
There's no controller Reimer

692
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,008
So

693
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,032
To the point where you

694
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,056
You go stir crazy like me

695
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:46,688
Yeah well I think that at least partially that responses the right way

696
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:51,552
Thoughts have to be a little laugh there is somewhere there is a part of me

697
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,576
If there's a Time

698
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,600
To take a break

699
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,136
And reflect and look at this

700
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,416
And go wow hasn't

701
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,952
It's right now

702
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,000
Next few months

703
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,280
Gearing up to do

704
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,816
The very seriously

705
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,376
The jury of very

706
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,400
Siri story about

707
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,424
People who's lied

708
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,312
Lucy there's where the anger comes from a little bit

709
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,616
Is that in the middle of this

710
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,640
Circus

711
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,664
Absurdity

712
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,944
Jones needs to be put down

713
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,480
That Institution

714
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,760
Trapped in some way

715
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:22,784
From the real

716
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
Gravity

717
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,624
And so when it comes time to put this on

718
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,416
This is obviously you

719
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,184
You know they're going to be

720
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,976
Media's going to be recording this trial

721
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,256
Talking about it

722
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,536
This trial is going to be done

723
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:35,840
I've been

724
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,376
Distracted for way too long

725
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,168
Yeah

726
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,192
Fantastic

727
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,984
That this trial

728
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,032
Is not going to be about Alex Jones

729
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:47,872
What Alex Jones did and what he's about as already decided

730
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,432
What does Charles is going to be about is about

731
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:53,248
Yeah that could be no better

732
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,296
MattyB moment

733
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,832
He thought was going to be his Circle

734
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,880
Could use for himself he don't even go

735
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:05,536
That is very kind of gratifying it now is something I do think that there is

736
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,560
Too much

737
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,328
Rickets

738
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,704
It's lost in you know Alex will blame but gun-grabbers and stuff for coming at him and

739
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:19,104
It's just the way it kind of I feel of deflecting from exactly what you're talkin about the the reality that at the core of this

740
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,384
This is these people

741
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,688
I've gone through something unimaginable

742
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:25,248
Yeah and I think you have to do that if you're

743
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,552
Someone in his position cuz how do you

744
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,344
How do you look in the mirror if you do

745
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,880
How do you deal with

746
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,416
There

747
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,208
Real grief and your part

748
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,256
Very challenge

749
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:41,888
That the thing he wants most is attention and that is the thing that is going to be denied him is

750
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:42,912
Delightful

751
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,960
It really is

752
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:51,360
We'll find a way of course he'll find a way but he's not on YouTube or Facebook as long as as long as none of the major

753
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:54,176
Your media Outlets go to Infowars

754
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,968
We're going to put you on TV

755
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,504
Then we'll be fine

756
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,320
Until then we always knew to it would be

757
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,112
It would be a suspect

758
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:02,880
Nicole without any

759
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,928
Of course it was going to be some

760
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:05,952
I was just

761
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:09,280
Cuz it brings me back at you something to Dan you said

762
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,560
About the steps

763
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,584
Positions in wider kind of soup

764
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,656
Is that if Infowars is what it is

765
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,936
And it is what they claim to be

766
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,752
I need the position should have been the most exciting

767
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,056
Because it was their chance to put up

768
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:21,824
What they had

769
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,384
They're saying they're right it's

770
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,920
Put up or shut up.

771
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,688
The time you really get

772
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,456
Throwdown

773
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,784
With you know some commie attorney like me

774
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,088
You get to like tell him in his place

775
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:33,856
Yeah you're

776
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,136
Braun look at all the stuff

777
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,928
And instead Jones

778
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:39,744
And do even were like not remember any down.

779
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,912
I did no preparation for this it gives me a headache I don't even want to do this this

780
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:52,032
I've never heard of globalism

781
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,848
Who the hell is Rob do

782
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,224
Became a

783
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,016
Experts such that it is

784
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,808
Hopes mythology

785
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:06,368
Anybody who believes this

786
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,416
Wolfgang halbig

787
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,952
And I was actually

788
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,720
Looking forward

789
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,768
Going toe-to-toe with somebody who's

790
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,352
And it didn't

791
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,912
Instead what we got from Jones was

792
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:19,936
You know

793
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:23,776
Jones-eez you said this before then you know I never said that hears video clip with you

794
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,312
You saying that. Saturday

795
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,848
Mortal Kombat X

796
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,152
Mute Media Matters edit

797
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,224
Like you can't get anywhere like

798
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,504
There was this idea

799
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,296
I think that was really observant of you both that

800
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,368
There's some things you can compost basically

801
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,440
Are there some admissions

802
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,208
Can get very quick

803
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,488
But that's done

804
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,048
There's not a lot of

805
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:46,816
Legal significance

806
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,168
It happens very quick

807
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,448
Culturally I think there is

808
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,520
And I think

809
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,288
You're going to see that

810
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:58,848
So where will get

811
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,152
I don't want to say

812
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,200
The show is over

813
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,504
You know what I mean like they're 30

814
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,040
For Jones that's going to happen

815
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,576
And it's in it's going to be

816
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,344
Personal

817
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,880
It's not just to be totally Folk

818
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,928
So there's still some more.

819
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,232
Wow

820
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,256
That's that's

821
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:23,936
Interested I don't know I don't know how to respond to that

822
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:28,800
Anything cuz it's such a testament to the families that they've been able to

823
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,104
Have the wherewithal to

824
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,640
Continue in the face

825
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,920
Like the

826
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,200
The difficulty of

827
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,992
Of living through

828
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,552
Play me the last three years of this case

829
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,576
Steven

830
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,880
I could not

831
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:47,232
I wouldn't fault somebody for saying this is enough I'm out

832
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,280
Yeah totally and it's

833
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,048
Is really

834
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,608
On some level for the for people who can't

835
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,144
Stand up to a bully

836
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,936
You know it's it's pretty

837
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,216
Pretty heartening that they have

838
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,776
Yeah well you know I'll tell you the right there are

839
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,056
Definitely family.

840
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,336
Who were The Waltons

841
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,872
Who don't want anything

842
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
You know who aren't

843
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,456
Of course

844
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,736
Completely respect that

845
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,552
Because why would you want to get into any of this

846
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,136
But it's really interesting that that my clients done in Texas

847
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,160
You know where you have

848
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,952
Minion veronique AniLinkz

849
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,512
Scarlet those are those are two families who were

850
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,536
Really heavily

851
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,584
I like they put up

852
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,864
Depositors address

853
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,912
Address to where they go pick up their mail I said they were

854
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,704
Starting up anti first

855
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,288
Terrorist organization that was coming after Infowars viewers day

856
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:35,104
They sending you a son with lying about holding his son

857
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,128
With a bullet holder hat

858
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:38,688
Oh crap

859
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,992
These clients are really stood up with their

860
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,784
Because they were these personal Target

861
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,576
To be able to make this fight on the

862
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,880
It's really been

863
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,904
A brave struggle

864
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,440
Minions Banana

865
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,744
Yeah

866
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:52,768
Weeks of this

867
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,792
The shooting he wrote

868
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,328
NSAID

869
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,864
Knock assault why are you doing this

870
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,400
This is Lenny

871
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,168
Is upfront about the

872
00:37:59,424 --> 00:37:59,936
Like that

873
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,472
You know probably driving

874
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,264
What you drop Noah off that morning

875
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,312
We're driving away might have been listening in for

876
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,104
He was actually kind of into that

877
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,736
Sometimes don't realize is that

878
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,504
We're talking about

879
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,272
5

880
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,040
Years

881
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,064
Harassment

882
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:16,832
Followed by

883
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,136
3 years of the making a mockery of the Lost

884
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,696
Yeah

885
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,976
Yeah

886
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:29,376
And the thing that I was always plays games with his that idea of like five years of harassment is like I didn't say all that stuff

887
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,168
For five years on Airtech well

888
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:35,008
It's that everyday you were saying the stuff on air it's the

889
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,592
They have been subjected to this harassment that was facilitated

890
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,640
45-year

891
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,688
I think you do some people who are

892
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,224
Really up to speed like we are on Joe

893
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,784
I understand that you said things were

894
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,320
Sandy Hook would probably think it was

895
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,136
It was a handful of occasions over a couple years.

896
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,416
Question

897
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:55,488
I have to address

898
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:58,048
You'll notice that if you watch the statement about

899
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,352
In reaction to the default judgment when things you said

900
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,472
And we don't

901
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,240
Because of

902
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,288
Not realize but

903
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,312
But because of

904
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,592
We bringing the suit

905
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,896
And then there shortly thereafter

906
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,456
YouTube and Facebook deleting all their profile

907
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,992
Infowars has a lost

908
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:17,760
Irreparably

909
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,528
A lot of it

910
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,320
Incontinent

911
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,344
So we kind of had

912
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,696
Play Sherlock Holmes using the public record try to figure out what videos were

913
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,488
Right now

914
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,024
Best estimate is that they made of

915
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,792
100

916
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,816
Episodes about

917
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,584
Sandy Hook

918
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,400
Nothing

919
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:37,216
We know that they made about 350

920
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,264
Pages of Infowars articles

921
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,032
About sand

922
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,312
And so

923
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:44,384
This is what we're averaging about two shows a month

924
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,944
Over the entire span of others sometimes when you get

925
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,992
2015 and 2017

926
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:51,808
Amor

927
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,600
But generally

928
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,368
5 years

929
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,392
Harassment

930
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:58,208
The people just don't know unless you're a real

931
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,488
Everybody seen the medium out of

932
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,048
Got when you really dig in there

933
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,376
Watch an hour and a half

934
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,144
Unscrew

935
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:06,912
Conversation

936
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,704
Jones and Wolfgang halbig

937
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,240
Will Frye

938
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,288
Rebel restore

939
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,384
You're one of the most prestigious policeman who's ever lived

940
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:20,736
All the time school safety experts

941
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,784
Call Mom

942
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,160
What is things like I mentioned the Justice Jones was

943
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,184
Was telling me about how

944
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,952
Credible

945
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,232
How big was Noah's like

946
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,792
So you've done Skype calls with how big

947
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,816
You seen how big

948
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:37,632
Home you seen how he lives

949
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,936
You know who this man is

950
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,728
At one point I even use I mean

951
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,336
I would never normally say in a deposition look you got 4,000 emails from them and reading them

952
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,872
You would agree with me this manager

953
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,688
But I normally wouldn't use that

954
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,736
Wolfgang halbig

955
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,016
You know book I don't

956
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,808
I don't think that I think that that state

957
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,576
In the matter of my

958
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,600
My opinion is not a state

959
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,368
The facts

960
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,904
But if Wolfgang how big is

961
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,720
Upset about that please please do me Wolfgang

962
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:09,120
Yeah

963
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,400
The number one question I get

964
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,424
These cases

965
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,704
Does Jones believe

966
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,520
And all I can do is put you to the

967
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,824
That's all I can do is point you to the public record

968
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,592
Into the deposition

969
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,896
And I think it becomes very clear

970
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,688
He never for a sec

971
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,760
You know Jones talks a lot about

972
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,088
Where's the observations you made it was very

973
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,112
Very observant

974
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,440
The idea of the media jumping on with both

975
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,744
Of this idea that you said it was a psycho

976
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:36,768
Clown

977
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,584
It's not really what he

978
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,400
He was making a metaphor

979
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,424
Anna was stupid

980
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,704
Crazy and it was

981
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,728
The dumb thing to say

982
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,264
But there are people out

983
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,056
There are people out there who

984
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,336
It popular

985
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,104
Tuitions

986
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,919
And an M the powers-that-be and then

987
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,967
Is the shity deal you get in life in America

988
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,271
Has made them distrust basically all fish

989
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,575
There's no question that that's a real

990
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:08,255
What happened to Alex Jones off of that

991
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:11,071
Understands that phenomenon in which to inflamed and Annex

992
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:13,119
Voided

993
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,143
Any good points

994
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:14,911
Justification

995
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,935
He is not

996
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,703
One of those people

997
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,727
He does not have that

998
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:21,311
No but I can

999
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,079
Everybody

1000
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,383
I think I think that

1001
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:28,479
He could still be a slight

1002
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,039
Victim of that like that mentality

1003
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:34,111
Inasmuch as he was getting caught up in it as he was

1004
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,647
Producing that contact

1005
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,695
And it was becoming more successful

1006
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,463
Like

1007
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:43,071
If he would just wasn't aware of what was going on and he wasn't aware he's not in touch with himself

1008
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,607
Yeah yeah yeah

1009
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:47,423
Find yourself snowballing a little bit

1010
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:54,079
I do think there were radicalizing yourself at that point

1011
00:42:56,895 --> 00:43:00,735
He detaches from reality and just order free spins and in that way he made

1012
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,551
Totally grounded

1013
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,855
Like when he'll talk about an interdimensional shadow

1014
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:12,255
I'm in there other times where I think he has somewhat convinced himself of

1015
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,279
Amazon vs

1016
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,071
You know some very Bass

1017
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:15,839
World of Beer

1018
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,375
Syrian chemical attack

1019
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,679
Vince McMahon

1020
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,447
But wouldn't

1021
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:22,751
Sandy Hook

1022
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,519
Not an opera

1023
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,823
I don't believe Joe.

1024
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,591
Ever believe

1025
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,383
Or that there were

1026
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,431
Stuart kids who are recruited to

1027
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,455
Play the parts of

1028
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,503
Different dead children and they were chatting

1029
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:38,367
The scarier thought that I have is I don't think I ever cared about

1030
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:41,183
The truth or falsity of it

1031
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,487
Like the experience in the usefulness of

1032
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:46,815
This claim is more important than whether or not it's true

1033
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,839
Yeah that's really in

1034
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:50,655
The level of

1035
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:54,239
Conspiracy theory is is such that I have no doubt that

1036
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,543
He was just on autopilot

1037
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:00,895
You know like he wasn't even paying attention to the fake city was saying because

1038
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,431
It's the same stuff he said

1039
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,199
The last time

1040
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:06,271
Rxpertise really hard

1041
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,295
Is that

1042
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,831
You can look at every

1043
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:09,599
Single match

1044
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
It follows

1045
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,159
You can't really

1046
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:17,535
One position I asking can you name me a mess cuz we've been eating

1047
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:20,863
Didn't say was a false flag

1048
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:27,519
I think maybe more the recent ones like the El Paso shooting and then on the podcast

1049
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:35,199
We heard him do it over and over again

1050
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:35,967
Use it as

1051
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:39,295
When you have a person who's engaging in a course of conduct

1052
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,063
That shows that

1053
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,831
Consistent form of

1054
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,367
Behavior to advance their business

1055
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,415
You can assume that they made the same

1056
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,439
The same justification

1057
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,207
For this latest

1058
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:46,975
Play music

1059
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,767
With everything else they've ever done

1060
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:50,815
The fact that he is within hours

1061
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,607
Is going to call one of these events amass tragic

1062
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,143
Dishes you didn't say Reckless

1063
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,167
Disregard for the truth

1064
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,727
Yeah anyting

1065
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:00,799
Circle back to something we touched on a minute ago

1066
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,079
It's not question

1067
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:02,847
Things

1068
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:06,687
Like there's such a distinction that he abuses

1069
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:11,039
When he says like I was just questioning events you coming to conclusion

1070
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,599
Advancing a conclusion

1071
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:17,183
In the guise of pretending your question

1072
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:17,951
Exactly

1073
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:18,975
When you say

1074
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,511
There were men arrested in

1075
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,279
SWAT gear

1076
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,583
If I didn't happen

1077
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,375
It's not just you have a bad app

1078
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,399
Radar

1079
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:29,215
Or the another one that he'll try to do a trick on you is he

1080
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:30,495
He will put it in a quest

1081
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,799
But it will be a barrow b a y

1082
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,823
You still beat your wife Quest

1083
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:36,127
Yeah

1084
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:39,711
Why were there why were there no paramedics allowed in the school

1085
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,735
I'm just questioning

1086
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:44,063
Yeah but your question is based upon a y that there were no Paramount

1087
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,599
Creditzo

1088
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,135
It's never a matter of

1089
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:49,951
State Farm

1090
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:55,839
A That's a classic clip of him saying that he had didn't believe it was fake at first

1091
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:59,679
But then he looked into it deeply and it was all fake

1092
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,703
All actors

1093
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,751
And that's not question

1094
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,287
No no

1095
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,311
No it is not

1096
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,359
I'm in Dexter somewhere

1097
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:09,663
It's so unbelievably unequivocal

1098
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,991
At first I thought they killed real kids

1099
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:16,319
But now I know it's completely stage nysdol

1100
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,879
Fully synthetic in bacon

1101
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:21,439
Things but I never

1102
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,231
Question didn't do tality of saying whether it

1103
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,791
And you can play the clip right afterwards

1104
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,815
Contacts

1105
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:31,935
It's unbelievable that he can do it and invert for me I think what it came down to

1106
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,703
24 Jones

1107
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:33,983
Is

1108
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,519
Okay so this is scary

1109
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:36,799
Scariest

1110
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:37,823
Is Mac

1111
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,639
Ashley large

1112
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,943
A lot of supplements

1113
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,223
Could make him strong and

1114
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,015
But

1115
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,807
The thing that really scares me about him

1116
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:48,831
Is it

1117
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:49,855
Deduce

1118
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,903
Perhaps correctly

1119
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,207
That there are things

1120
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:54,975
North Pole

1121
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,023
More powerful more useful

1122
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:57,791
In our current

1123
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,815
Political dialogue

1124
00:46:59,071 --> 00:46:59,583
Then truth

1125
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,351
Or verified

1126
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,143
That there are

1127
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,423
Magical narratives

1128
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,471
That can represent what we

1129
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,239
1 + 1

1130
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,543
Hope to achieve in our Boudicca legenda

1131
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,567
Better weigh more

1132
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:18,527
So when the infowar how they're sick Supreme Court Justices who would say it's all about fairness and

1133
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,551
Earning your way

1134
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:23,391
I'm sure that it's about truth and honesty I guarantee

1135
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,327
The scary part is that

1136
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,095
I you know

1137
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,375
Buckeye

1138
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,143
You can probably imagine

1139
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:34,911
You get involved

1140
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,215
Attorney couple years ago

1141
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,263
Start to get really enthusiastic

1142
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:40,799
Changes that could

1143
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,359
Not only am I going to do something

1144
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,663
Maybe there is a a

1145
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,199
Cultural change in how we

1146
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:47,967
Talk about

1147
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,759
And then over the past

1148
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:50,783
3 years

1149
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,319
What if I seen

1150
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:54,111
In haseena a man who is

1151
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:54,879
Been able to

1152
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,647
To use

1153
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,415
His own

1154
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,951
Frivolous disrespect

1155
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,975
To delay this process

1156
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:00,511
There's no accountability

1157
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,047
Over that same course

1158
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:02,815
The time

1159
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,839
All of his

1160
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:04,863
More

1161
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,655
Industry established

1162
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,423
Contemporary

1163
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,447
Begin copy

1164
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,263
Are you done about Mitch McConnell

1165
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,591
You know the one that Springs to mind

1166
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,383
Only Timmy is Tucker Carlson

1167
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,735
More like Infowars now

1168
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,503
Then he did three years

1169
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:26,623
He looks more like Infowars than Glenn Beck did in 2009

1170
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:30,719
Stuff truth right at least at least back had this sort of pseudo

1171
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,767
Stage production of his writing on chalkboards

1172
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:35,327
Kind of silly

1173
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,095
Terrifying

1174
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,887
That's the same

1175
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,423
But basically

1176
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,191
Resume

1177
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:44,799
Overlap that Alex will just play long segments of Tucker show on his show

1178
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,615
It's right at home there

1179
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:53,247
Somebody used to tell me there was one of my one of my colleagues Genevieve Zimmerman was involved with

1180
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:54,527
Adidas

1181
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,551
Lawsuits against Jim

1182
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,087
In Michigan where

1183
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,623
Mini Posner was able to

1184
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,903
Willie defamation shooting

1185
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,671
Jim Fetzer

1186
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,207
Interesting.

1187
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,487
Bike results

1188
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:05,791
Refused

1189
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:06,815
Staples

1190
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:09,631
Toronto sort of birds of a feather flock together

1191
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,447
Virginia

1192
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,471
When she was

1193
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,263
Helping out with closing arguments

1194
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,055
Wine for Jake Zimmerman to use

1195
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,615
Which was Colleen what Jones did in

1196
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,639
Right opium

1197
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,431
And I know I was really

1198
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,199
Resonated with

1199
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:23,967
That phrase

1200
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:24,991
But then over the past

1201
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:25,759
3 years

1202
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,551
I told her that phrase no longer

1203
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,319
Works B

1204
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,343
Because it's not alright

1205
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,111
Opium anymore

1206
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:30,879
It's right opium

1207
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:31,903
There's no

1208
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:35,231
That what Jones did and what his

1209
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,535
Flavor for how to manipulate facts and stuff

1210
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,303
Is now just

1211
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,351
Lingua Franca for the entire conservative

1212
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:48,031
It does feel like that and I also think like just from my sense of things just from my looking at everything

1213
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,823
I don't think that

1214
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,383
He may even be aware of that

1215
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,407
Like Vicky

1216
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:56,479
Have discovered something more powerful than truth

1217
00:49:56,735 --> 00:50:01,087
Right now discovered it necessarily but he knows what he's doing

1218
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:03,391
Ultimately we have a problem

1219
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,183
That's you had

1220
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:07,999
In the depositions which is this

1221
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,047
They know

1222
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,071
You know they're lying

1223
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,375
You know they know they're lying

1224
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:18,495
So all there is the only question is are you going to tell me that you were lying or not

1225
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:22,335
So Alex is going to not say that he's lying and he'll accept

1226
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:24,895
Any default judgment anything

1227
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:31,295
Because then he doesn't have to say what everyone knows and why he's in the courtroom I'm lying

1228
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,575
Sing to you that's right

1229
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:36,415
You know it's y'all didn't a discussion of perjury in civil vs. criminal cases

1230
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,975
That was dead on point that if I was a criminal lawyer

1231
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:39,999
I could I could

1232
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:42,559
Rosti Speedwagon album against the wall and no time

1233
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:45,119
But here in Cibolo it's different

1234
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,399
You're the best thing that I

1235
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,167
I can do

1236
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:49,983
Is to hopefully make sure the jury understands

1237
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:53,055
Zuerlein

1238
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,591
Because the reaction is DM

1239
00:50:56,895 --> 00:51:02,015
I bet you could probably fully demonstrate quite a bit of that vary based on those depositions

1240
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:02,783
Absolutely

1241
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,575
No it's it's going to be really

1242
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:06,367
Have you seen them react

1243
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:08,671
Yeah

1244
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:14,559
How's the one thing we touch down the we haven't gotten to yet I was really hoping to get your perspective on was

1245
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,583
How you felt

1246
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,887
The coverage of the case

1247
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:18,911
Was

1248
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:19,935
Do you feel like

1249
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:20,959
The the

1250
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,239
The media at Large

1251
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,823
I focused on the right points do you feel like

1252
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,103
I think

1253
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,919
One of the things that's definitely become very interesting to me

1254
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,967
Over the course of the time that we've done this podcast

1255
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,783
Is seeing how people cover Alex

1256
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:37,855
Bright and seeing the ways in which

1257
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:41,183
Sometimes unforced errors and then sometimes people

1258
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,463
You know are like this is

1259
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:44,255
They they got the right point there

1260
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,047
To the first part

1261
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,583
Do I think the media has

1262
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,863
Typically gotten this right

1263
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:50,911
No I do not

1264
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:52,959
And that's that's a shame

1265
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,263
I wanted to meet you at

1266
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,055
Boat rentals Jonesboro

1267
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:01,919
Clickbait media editors know that if they have a story but I was shown in the Sandy Hook lawsuit

1268
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,455
Clicks psychosis

1269
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,759
Same deal and end

1270
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,807
Big prompt remind look I'm not

1271
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:11,903
A lot of people would say alright well if you're getting my cupboard wrong or usually

1272
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:12,927
Almost always

1273
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:15,999
Getting it wrong in a way that's critical to Alex Jones maybe that'd be good

1274
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,023
No no

1275
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,071
The problem is is that Jones

1276
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,351
Nose very itchy

1277
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,167
But his ability to identify

1278
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:23,935
Mistake

1279
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:25,471
It's made by the mainstream media

1280
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,007
Is is one of his best

1281
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:30,847
Overshoot the Target on Jones uses as a way tomorrow

1282
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,383
There was

1283
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:35,455
In fact that so I was just talking about the Jim Fetzer verdict up in

1284
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:37,503
Michigan

1285
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:41,599
A lot of newspapers ran a story that that was Alex Jones

1286
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,367
You got that

1287
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:44,159
And Jones got on the show and made

1288
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,439
Mainstream you look stupid

1289
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:50,815
He said he was going to sue the Associated Press

1290
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:52,607
There's even a lot of threats of lawsuits

1291
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,375
All over the place

1292
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,911
Place that never materialized but

1293
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,703
Always gives him a good sounding boy

1294
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,775
To say

1295
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:02,591
Being accurate when these people aren't being accurate about me

1296
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:04,895
Good point

1297
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:07,199

Boston bombing when the to Egypt

1305
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,799
Young men were identified on the front page

But they've got a big insurance policy they've got lawyers they got a lot somewhere

1311
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,855
They took care of those young men without him

00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:52,255
The exact same situation in this case I'm not sure if you are aware of the other suit that I'm handling right

1313
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,279
I know

1314
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,047

Was Marcel Fontaine as a young man in Boston who was falsely identified as being the park

1316

Same deal as

1318
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:06,591
I mean worse than what happened Egyptian kids because they were just like their pre people Adventure

1319
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,359
They might

1320
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:11,199

00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:24,767
Wish app

1326
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,303
They do that a bit

1327
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:29,119
Weave weave weave sabudana number of instances of

1328
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,143
That kind of

1329
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,679
Journalistic integrity

1330
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:32,703
Yeah

1331
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:35,007
And it's it's it's day or even

The bathroom wall unit

1337
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:57,535
Journalism should be protected to the extent that if I see Jane

00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:02,143
Copper a good time call Jane Smith on a bathroom wall I can go in the paper and Report Jane Smith

1339
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:05,215
This is in the public interest

1340
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:09,311
You're just asking questions about what's going on with James question

1341
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:11,615
The people were talking about

1342
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:13,663
Right2know

1343
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:14,943

And I want passionate enough to write on a bathroom wall

1345

We've got one of the most important whistleblowers in the world their information is so powerful they couldn't put

1346
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:30,047
Anywhere but a bathroom stall

1347
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,375

00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:08,959

You have three shares

1366
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,479

You're doing you knew we'd we have the emails that are in the

This case has been filed with the court

1381
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:43,775
Before they put.

1382

And you got you got to get him in a deposition. I want it so bad

1385
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:56,831
We would do a whole series of episode forgotten everything

00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:58,879
So you can't get to a Johnny Bravo would be a

1387
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:01,439
A wonderful guy to have Maya

1388
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,743
You know this whole thing but yeah.

1389
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,023
BP is a great character

1390
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,303
If

1391
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:12,447
If you could ever get Alex back under oath I'd like you to ask him if he believes he's fighting the literal devil

1392
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:19,871
I don't like I think it might be unprofessional for you to do but it's something I'm very curious how you would answer umbrella

1393
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:22,175
Mine don't you mean

1394
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:27,807
He's let me to believe through listening to the show that he definitely believes he's fighting the literal Christian devil

1395
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,855
Yeah the literal one yeah exactly

1396
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,951
From his standpoint

1397
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:38,559
Do I smell like sulfur

1398
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:41,119
Can you sing

1399
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:43,167
You're you're assuming

1400
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:45,727
That we don't seem massive

1401
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,007
The court in the next couple weeks

1402
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,311
Your wish will be granted

1403
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,335
He's currently set to

1404
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,359
Me to post again

1405
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,919
I can't wait

1406
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:58,015
I hope I hope that video ends up on YouTube as well

1407
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:00,319
But here's the other thing you have to remember is that

1408
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,367
When I suppose

1409
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:04,159
Call Joseph Austin you saw that I had

1410
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,583
Proceedings they have not yet

1411
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:12,607
I was

1412
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,375
Blind

1413
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,143
Completely blind

1414
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:16,447
News based on my own research

1415
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,263
Nowhere the varied

1416
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:21,311
Yeah we have

1417
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:25,151
So you know a lot of them the song and dance that a lot of

1418
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:25,919
People saw

Hemming and hawing about who dhanbad Auntie was and whether.

1421
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:33,599
Whether you sent the cracker

1422
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,135
Harassed

1423
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:38,207
The people in my life

1424
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:42,559
Flirty hired him and she calls him to crack out about

1425
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:44,863
Nevermind it was my frustration with

1426
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:45,887
Without Jones talks about

1427
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,423
He's publicly and how

1428
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:51,263
It comes out the depositions and all of this when you don't have the

1429
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,031
It still say

1430
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:54,335
Yeah we got rid of them and only we didn't like what

1431
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,615
He was doing up there Newtown

1432
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,151
We have to get rid of them

1433
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:00,223
Six weeks later we get the emails and it shows

1434
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:02,015
No they were still paying them through 20

1435
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,551
They fired

1436
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,831
Embarrass

1437
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,367
Demeter Trump rally

1438
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:08,159
He was dumb

1439
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:10,719
Making some inappropriate comments to a female

1440
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,743
Conservative journalist

1441
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,791
Trump rally

1442
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:16,863
Media Outlets

1443
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:17,887
We got to make sure

1444
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:18,911
We can still get into trouble

1445
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:20,959
Didn't care

1446
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:23,519
Denver Donnie chase the bunch people around Newtown

1447
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:25,055
I didn't care

1448
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,079
Wolfgang halbig

1449
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,615
Where you got how big

1450
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:29,663
Showing up in a white unmarked van

1451
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:30,943
Video of children of the

1452
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:36,063
Now put

1453
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:40,159
He was a Madman after the Boston bombing press conference

1454
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:46,559
After he disrupted that and got so much traffic to Infowars

1455
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,375
What you realize

1456
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,423
Owen Shroyer tried to make the same work

1457
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,959
He basically tried to do the same thing

1458
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,799
Yeah with the the impeachment

1459
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:59,103
Exactly right now and that's why

1460
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:01,151
Indeed a water things that we brought up at our last

1461
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:04,479
Is we were granted in 2018

1462
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,759
We were granted an order

1463
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:07,551
Saying that we were supposed to have Owen step

1464
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:08,831
Along with several other

1465
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,111
We never got

1466
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,135
They they refused to

1467
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,695
And now I'm in a position of

1468
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:17,535
Who are really want own Shores deposition and I'm not sure I'm going to get it

1469
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,071
Cuz there's a very good chance

1470
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:20,095
If you could be in federal custody

1471
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:22,911
Angus right now

1472
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,703
He's in a situation where he's

1473
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,471
Facing

1474
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:26,239

He did it at year ago and didn't show up

1478

Community service

1479
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:41,087
We told the judge to look we're concerned not only about that deposition but that's why we want this

1480
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,367
Position of Jones

1481
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,135
October

1482
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,671
Is because we're a little worried

1483
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:46,719
If you looking Shroyer's arrest affidavit

1484
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:49,023
With all the pictures of Owen Shroyer being places

1485
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,047
Not supposed to be

1486
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,327
Jones standing right now

1487
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,119
Yeah

1488
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,399
We're speaking in a recipe

1489
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:57,983
I wouldn't I wouldn't expect anything from Alex

1490
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:03,103
Because the reason that I went got in trouble was because he had a restraining order

1491
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:05,919
That's because he didn't do the community service

1492
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:08,991
He was barred from being like in all of those places

1493
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:11,039
You're being there with him

1494
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:14,623
I don't think it matters as much because he didn't have that like sort of

1495
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,927
Yeah yeah so that's who wasn't trespassing

1496
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:18,975
That's the theory anyway

1497
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,743
Save-A-Lot

1498
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:25,375
Whatever they could get Jones off off of those

1499
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:27,423
Pictures is such a minor crimes did not eat

1500
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,447
Even be worth the trouble

1501
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:32,799
So you can tell more than anyone else it would be

1502
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,591
But I think

1503
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:38,943
I think we've all seen enough mafia movies to know what why the federal authorities

1504
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:39,967
Might go arrest somebody

1505
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,735
Owen Shroyer

1506
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,783
I think we know what Thursday

1507
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,319
About what Owen Shroyer

1508
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:46,623
A could lead to see

1509
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,183
Yeah yeah

1510
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,463
You follow the crazy

1511
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:52,255
We want that I patched

1512
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:58,655
Oathkeeper is where we start

1513
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:01,983
Bring me to Donuts

1514
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:04,031
I didn't think about it as it is

1515
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,311
It's a distraction to my case

1516
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:07,103
Right. Great job just

1517
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,127
Criminal stuff going on

1518
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,407
Alongside of

1519
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,175
Exit is a destroy

1520
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,199
Then I want this

1521
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:15,551
Because it is pretty families they're ready

1522
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,087
Boy are they ready just now

1523
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:20,671
You know this isn't a couple years ago we got him to admit under oath

1524
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:22,975
Those are like a big step

1525
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:25,535
That's one step

1526
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:28,607
Yeah

1527
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,375
Find me maybe

1528
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:30,911
I don't I don't know

1529
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,959
I was getting real pessimistic imma be honest

1530
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:38,335
Procedures to the end of the Earth and grind diamond

1531
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:39,615
I've never questions

1532
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:40,639
But

1533
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:41,919
Was it actually going to make it

1534
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:42,943
Different stadia buddy anyway

1535
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,479
Whitley I mean first

1536
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:46,015
Could I make a difference from my own clients

1537
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,551
Could we even collect from him all those

1538
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:49,599
But then I started seeing

1539
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,903
Joshua start seeing Coronavirus

1540
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:52,927
Started senior

1541
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,719
50 absolute insanity

1542
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:55,999
Of the

1543
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,535
The false facts being put out there

1544
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:00,863
When I saw January 6th go down the big lie around the election

1545
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:03,423
Are we too far gone

1546
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,727
Did the diesel suits need to be brought

1547
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,519
Several years ago or

1548
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,311
Or is this too late what's going on

1549
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:11,103
Ability the last couple weeks

1550
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,639
I'm feeling a little more up

1551
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:14,687
Taken notice of this

1552
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:19,295
I bet there's a real-life feeling of exhaling you know like that

1553
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:22,879
At least on some level I feels like you're on the way up

1554
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:29,279
At least instead of on the way down to even lower wherever it can go because you're at the mercy of some

1555
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:32,351
Somebody who's dragging their heels as long as they're allowed to drag their heels

1556
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,887
Exactly

1557
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,167
And once

1558
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,703
The you know

1559
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:39,519
The judge orders know he'll dragon

1560
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,287
Bath

1561
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:42,079
Then everything starts moving a lot quicker

1562
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:46,687
One of these things to the accursed me about it is like 3 years later and

1563
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,223
It's funny they are

1564
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,295
I feel I feel pretty good about

1565
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,575
How I've handled this case

1566
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:54,111
I feel like I've done some really good work in it

1567
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,135
But

1568
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:56,415
The truth of the matter is they are

1569
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,719
I think anybody

1570
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:01,023
I think anybody who spends bit of time

1571
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:03,327
Listening to Infowars or knows it

1572
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:05,375
Semi-critical Leawood

1573
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:07,167
Never expect anything other

1574
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:08,703
You know like I do feel like

1575
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,239
They would always be the

1576
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,775
Root of there

1577
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,335
Yeah I think

1578
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:16,895
That's true when Jones was really mad after our death

1579
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:18,943
And talked about me for

1580
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:19,711
For couple hours

1581
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:21,503
What are things you were saying is you know

1582
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:25,087
They're all calling his lawyer the new Perry Mason

1583
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:29,183
School

1584
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:35,071
Honestly more most credit goes to you man like

1585
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:35,839
I wish I could take

1586
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:37,119
More depressed than I am

1587
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,399
But it really is

1588
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,191
A man who is so

1589
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:40,959
Self-destructing

1590
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:41,727
And almost a

1591
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:44,031
Epic Greek tragedy sort of way

1592
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:45,567
Yeah

1593
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,335
I'm just here as a

1594
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,639
The conductor on the train like I'm just a driving up to

1595
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,175
Sensation

1596
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:52,223
At this point there's not a note terms to be made

1597
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:54,015
The track going to one place

1598
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,295
Going down

1599
01:04:55,807 --> 01:05:00,415
When we go back to the 2003 episodes there is a certain feel of like

1600
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:06,047
You're looking at the man who is inexorably going to wind up where we are right now you know like

1601
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,583
His behavior then

1602
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,887
Will eventually lead to where we are now

1603
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,959
What's going to happen

1604
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:14,239
I saw that you're looking at

1605
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,519
Some of those earlier episodes

1606
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:17,823
Then I haven't I mean it takes me back to my college days you know

1607
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:19,615
In ut

1608
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:20,895
99-2000

1609
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:23,455
That's what Joe said become kind of huge

1610
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:24,735
From

1611
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:26,271
Public Access

1612
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,039
What's the weather yesterday

1613
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,343
And I really wanted now go back to listen

1614
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,367
The some of those episodes

1615
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:31,647
Stussy

1616
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:34,207
Embryonic chaosity

1617
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:36,767
Study Island

1618
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:41,119
One of the reasons we went over he interviewed a guy who had gone to heaven

1619
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:43,167
And it was

1620
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:45,215
Is fantastic

1621
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:46,751
I think there's a waiting room in heaven

1622
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:52,895
Your best friend is here imaginary friend and he's also the guy who's snitching on you to God is your guardian angel

1623
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:57,503
Is your childhood imaginary buddy

1624
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,575
Becomes obvious to me when I'm watching

1625
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,879
Videos you watch a video on 2013 versa

1626
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,671
2015 vs 2017

1627
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,695
The Setzer differ

1628
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:09,023
You see the evolution of the show through its set

1629
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:10,047
And now it's this

1630
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:10,815
Big

1631
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:13,119
Gotti Cinema can set

1632
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,911
It's funny to me how

1633
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:20,031
There are so many things that I know from what I think of Jones from what I came up with them in the

1634
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:20,799
2000

1635
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:21,823
Is not who he is

1636
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,103
Today cuz to me

1637
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,639
Jones is the guy who's

1638
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:27,711
About to be in tears over the alien fish hybrids

1639
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:33,343
Humanize

1640
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:36,159
It's so silly it's so in people

1641
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:41,279
For so many years people made viral video clips and stuff that we're just making fun of these silly things out

1642
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:44,095
Sex and then somewhere along the line

1643
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:45,119
And it happened

1644
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:45,887
Almost

1645
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:46,655
I mean

1646
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:49,983
Jonas face tan on Sandy Hook looking both directions

1647
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,519
From Sandy Hook

1648
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:52,543
Completely

1649
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,335
He's starting to Edge into a completely

1650
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:59,199
He's not just so he's not a lizard person silly

1651
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:01,247
Jeffron Style

1652
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,271
Absurdity

1653
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:04,319
Notice something more Sinister beak

1654
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,367
Portrayed as hardener

1655
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:07,647
I'd like

1656
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:10,975
Movie showing my jury a lot of videos from eminent

1657
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:11,999
2000 talking about

1658
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:12,767
Gay frogs

1659
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,047
Fish hybrids

1660
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:14,815
Crap

1661
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:18,143
Because what they need to see is that ever since then in the last 4 years

1662
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,423
He's trying to sound softball

1663
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,191
What is legit news

01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:24,287
How many times a day in four sets you're getting the real truth he ran Infowars the

1665
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:27,615
Tomorrow's news today

1666
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:29,407
Oh wow yeah yeah

1667
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:34,015
News of the future from 6 months ago

1668
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:36,319
Tomorrow's new soften blog post

1669
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,599
6 months ago

1670
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:40,415
Orwellian about

1671
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:42,207
Tomorrow's news today right like

1672
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,231
This idea that that

1673
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:44,511
He's creating himself

1674
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:45,279
Oh man

1675
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:49,887
I had one question that I definitely needed to ask you

1676
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:52,191
I want to jam this in

1677
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,727
And is that

1678
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:55,007
What's your favorite Sunday

1679
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,055
That was it

1680
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:07,807
And Alex's defense after these default judgments came out

1681
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:10,111
He said that in this case

1682
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:15,231
The opposing counsel was demanding that he produce something he referred to as

1683
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,535
Sandy Hook marketing material

1684
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:22,143
What can you talk a little bit about what he could have been referring to

1685
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:25,983
He's mostly talking about the Laffer

1686
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:26,751
Medication kinetic

1687
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,031
You must've talked about that

1688
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:30,847
Did something happen

1689
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,639
Not even with what just happened

1690
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,919
In other words

1691
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:35,711
Discovery request that were at issue in

1692
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:37,247
Is that made him default the case

1693
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,015
None of this has any

1694
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:41,599
Connecticut

1695
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:43,135
They had asked him

1696
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:44,415
It wasn't really sandy

1697
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:45,183
Marketing

1698
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:46,719
Basically what it was

1699
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:47,487
Is they wanted

1700
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:48,511
Any

1701
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:50,559
For any episode that Sandy Hook

1702
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:51,327
Discussed about

1703
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,887
They wanted Infowars internal animals

1704
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:55,935
They wanted to know

1705
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:59,519
What did they get off of Google ads what did they get how many hits

1706
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,311
And then

1707
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:03,615
Infowars also uses things like a

1708
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,919
Internal Google analytics program

1709
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:07,711
It has some other message

1710
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:09,759
Is there any wanted to request

1711
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,039
What's that makes sense

1712
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,319
Pretty fair

1713
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:14,879
View

1714
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:15,647
It's right because

1715
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,183
If you want to establish how these p

1716
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:17,951
People were damaged

1717
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:18,719
You have to know how many

1718
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:22,559
Great Lakes open Total audience

1719
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:23,583
Infowars is important

1720
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:26,143
Did they ask for also I think if they had

1721
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,423
If there were any

1722
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:30,495
Emails that referred to special marketing initiative

1723
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,567
And by that I mean

1724
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:36,127
Special promotional page or we're going to

1725
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:38,431
Can you make sure on this video can

1726
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:39,967
Can you promote some Sandy Hook videos

1727
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:40,991
They've been really popular

1728
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:42,783
Obviously

1729
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,319
Rasher

1730
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:47,135
You have to remember that

1731
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,439
Infowars

1732
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:51,487
Revenue and

1733
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:53,535
Set

1734
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,559
Ultimately

1735
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:56,095
Quartz not a very

1736
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,679
Yeah we're not like Haiti

1737
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,703
Can you produce a supermarket

1738
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,727
Getting director that you don't have

1739
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,799
Yeah and the way he'd be robbed

1740
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:11,199
Being robbed

1741
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:14,015
Rob do in a silly hat

1742
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:19,903
Demanding that I bring like

1743
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:22,719
Then like these flyers that we printed up with

1744
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:27,071
Sandy Hook sale going on

1745
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:29,119
No I mean there is

1746
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,655
There's obviously a lot of when you're up

1747
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:31,935
A digital web business

1748
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:33,983
Publishes on the web you're going to have some

1749
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,007
Statistics about

1750
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,287
What happened

1751
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:38,335
Shenandoah things

1752
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:41,151
But what's what's mind-blowing about it

1753
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:43,711
Is that is that in my case we aren't even there yet

1754
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:44,991
Like we have

1755
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:46,271
We have just recently got

1756
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,551
Sarda broke some of those is

1757
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,087
But in my case it's like

1758
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:50,623
Okay it would be a simple request

1759
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:51,647
But they're not answer

1760
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,695
Identify every video in which

1761
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:54,719
Infowars discuss the

1762
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:57,023
That. Has never been answer

1763
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:59,071
He's our very very soon

1764
01:10:59,327 --> 01:10:59,839
Simple thing

1765
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:02,143
And and that was what I think was most shocking door judge

1766
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:03,679
You have these

1767
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:08,031
Request that were supposed to be answered in 2018 like at the very beginning of the case

1768
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:09,055
You can even start

1769
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:10,591
Feeling your way around in the dark

1770
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,895
Red Lake like this is so basic

1771
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:15,711
Burton Lake

1772
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:17,247
He has been unjustly

1773
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:19,807
Had his right to a jury taken away

1774
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:20,575
This is

1775
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,135
Yeah

1776
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:30,047
I agree I was just be kept here is that one of the sticking point so that's the marketing material

1777
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:32,863
But there's something out there they just want to give us

1778
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:35,935
Really is focused on the post-sandy hook marketing

1779
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:38,751
And why you so hung up on

1780
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:41,823
It might just be that he doesn't understand what he's being at

1781
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:45,919
You ever run at Sandy Hooks

1782
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:47,711
50% off sale

1783
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:54,111
It's probably question he doesn't know the answer to and Emily doesn't want to find out the other two

1784
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:56,415
Would have done that so I just don't want to find out

1785
01:11:57,951 --> 01:12:00,767
I do I do love I do love the judge

1786
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:02,815
Being surprised when you ask that question

1787
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:08,191
Give me all the videos where you have said something about Sandy Hook and the judges surprised they didn't do it

1788
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:10,239
Immediately my thought was just like

1789
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:12,543
Oh they said that sounds really hard

1790
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,823
And just didn't do it

1791
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:20,223
How could you guys be surprised by that I know these people they said that's hard

1792
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:22,271
I won't do it and then maybe you'll go away

1793
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:25,855
It's hard

1794
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,391
It's half of

1795
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:30,207
We've been so insanely negligee

1796
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:32,255
Persons being sued that we have

1797
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:34,047
Cause massive amounts of Evan

1798
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:37,887
El favor

1799
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:39,167
Do really fully just be up

1800
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,447
Mr.

1801
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,519
Yeah yeah

1802
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:47,615
You know that's going to be as for those

1803
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:49,407
People who I know your audience is

1804
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,431
Go to watch the

1805
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:53,503
The challenge going forward is

1806
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:55,295
If there's any more shenanigans

1807
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:57,343
How exactly do you punish

1808
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:59,647
Right like there's not much more you

1809
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,183
Do it

1810
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:05,023
Yeah that was a that was a question I had in my head to like you know

1811
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:08,607
Because you still have the process that you have to go through in terms of

1812
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:11,423
Getting to the jury deciding

1813
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,959
Stop.

1814
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:13,727
Damages

1815
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,007
Absolutely

1816
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:18,847
He does have the some ability to drag his heels on that still

1817
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,127
Absolutely.

1818
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:22,431
Eleanor would cause other crazy problem

1819
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:24,479
You got to remember Mike Mike plaintiffs are going to be

1820
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:28,063
Some of the things are going to be

1821
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,343
Testifying about

1822
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:30,879
Confidential Private health

1823
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:31,647
Information

1824
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:35,231
And they've already made a mockery of that stuff up in kinetic

1825
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:38,559
You know they

1826
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:41,887
How detached from reality to

1827
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:42,655
The strategy has become

1828
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:44,191
Is they were in the middle of

1829
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:45,215
Deposing a plaintiff

1830
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:46,239
Sandy Hook

1831
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:49,311
Brighten the deposition itself as designated

1832
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,079
Confidential

1833
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:50,847
Attorneys izone

1834
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:51,871
I started the Depo

1835
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:53,663
Is it doesn't get released

1836
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:56,991
In the middle of that deposition Norm Pastor lawyer

1837
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:58,783
Streaming

1838
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,063
Basically

1839
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:07,231
Was he started writing down the things

1840
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:08,255
The plaintiff was saying

1841
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:09,535
The continental testing

1842
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:11,839
Inserted that into a motion

1843
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,631
And then filed that motion

1844
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,399
Publicly with the

1845
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:16,191
The court on the court docket where everybody can

1846
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:18,751
And okay so not a part of

1847
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,799
This is going to make you just your jaw dropping

1848
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,079
This is not only is that insane

1849
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:23,359
The motion

1850
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:24,383
But he was filing

1851
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:26,175
With a motion to request that

1852
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:28,479
The court compel the deposition of Hillary

1853
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:34,367
Yes because apparently according to Jones

1854
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:37,183
These lawsuits the only reason they happened

1855
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,719
Because Hillary Clinton wasn't mad

1856
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:40,767
For some reason my cat

1857
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:43,071
About two years after she lost the election

1858
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,607
She decided to go recruit

1859
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:45,631
Attorneys

1860
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:47,935
In Sandy Hook families 2

1861
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:52,287
Pursue a vendetta against Alex Jones not apparently I'm under Clinton payroll and all this

1862
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:58,687
What does not sound like something a malignant narcissist would invent Africa crazy

1863
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:02,527
I think I think he thinks that

1864
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:05,087
Hillary said he had a black heart

1865
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:08,671
Or something and then that was the sign that

1866
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:10,719
She's coming after Amber but

1867
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:12,767
In Jones's own

1868
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:14,047
Fever

1869
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:15,839
Construction of all of the

1870
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:18,655
Hillary Clinton is a big reason

1871
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:20,447
Why he said some of the things he said about

1872
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:21,727
Particularly after

1873
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:25,055
Used him as a prop

1874
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:26,335
To attack Trump

1875
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:30,431
And to say Trump's Associated this guy in this guy's a mess right and this guy said

1876
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:33,759
Everything she said about a 100

1877
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:34,527
True

1878
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:36,575
But she was using him very clearly as a

1879
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:40,927
But

1880
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:43,231
But once he did that that in raged

1881
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:44,255
That was it

1882
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,023
Because

1883
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:46,559
Jones at that point was on this

1884
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:47,327
Decorative beaker

1885
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:48,351
Barry

1886
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:49,119
Mainstream

1887
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:51,167
He adhered got Trump on his show

1888
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,983
He was being credited at that time with Trump victory

1889
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:55,263
And so that's why

1890
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:56,287
Just after the election

1891
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:58,079
In November right after you

1892
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,359
He did a broadcast

1893
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,639
Cold

1894
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,407
Alex Jones

1895
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,175
Final

1896
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:07,295
Basically couldn't stop talking about it cuz Hillary talked about him so he had to respond back

1897
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,063
So his

1898
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,599
Genius idea

1899
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:12,671
What you get on there and go will look here's all the reasons I thought it was fake

1900
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:13,951
And

1901
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:15,999
Honestly if it hadn't been for that

1902
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,535
Like some of this case would never

1903
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:20,351
If it is the parents they were of the

1904
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:21,119
Position that

1905
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:22,399
If Jones is stopped

1906
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,167
After 2016

1907
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:25,727
They probably wouldn't have pursued this

1908
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:28,287
Right but it was this Vendetta that kept up

1909
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,079
Is that not only did he do it then

1910
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:32,639
But then just a couple months later in the new year

1911
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:33,663
2017

1912
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:36,223
Video call Sandy Hook vampires

1913
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:38,527
Yep that's the one that

1914
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:39,807
Use my clients of Faking It

1915
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:43,391
2017 and he just can't stop

1916
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:45,951
Disparities Socastee

1917
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,743
Also rough name

1918
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:50,559
I would out fire River name these videos

1919
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,863
Sandy Hook vampires exposed

1920
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:55,167
Doesn't look good just as a title

1921
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:59,775
You know they're like I mean I can understand him being mad at Hillary

1922
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,847
Been his villain for

1923
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:04,383
Jordan years

1924
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:06,943
Also she lost and ruined everybody's life

1925
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:12,319
I'm sure he's mad at her about that

1926
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:19,999
Well I I don't know if there's any other points you want to get to but I feel like

1927
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,535
Media is not

1928
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:27,935
Said at all that you want to that you feel like there's some information that nobody has really touched on

1929
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:31,263
Really surprised that nobody in the media reported

1930
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,287
Tetanus

1931
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,055
20

1932
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:36,895
Is is November 27th on Starz November 29th

1933
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:37,663
18 deposition

1934
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:38,687
The second episode

1935
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:40,991
That he ended that deposition

1936
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:42,015
By saying

1937
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:44,063
Anatomies

1938
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:46,879
Is like you you have made this

1939
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:52,511
You understand what a mockery you've made of this that you're willing to do that at the end of that deposition

1940
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:55,071
Promotional

1941
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,399
During that deposition

1942
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:00,447
He was so eager to talk

1943
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:02,495
Talk about a really really wanted

1944
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:06,591
During the deposition no don't work

1945
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:12,991
I believe there's a player like I promise we'll get back to you

1946
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:13,759
Robin

1947
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:17,087
There were several points in there where his eyes glaze over

1948
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,111
Cuz he doesn't know what's happening

1949
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:20,159
God I'm agreeing with the boss

1950
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:22,463
This thing this guy saying right now I don't know what to do

1951
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:25,023
I'm sitting there telling him like I think you and I agree that most of the

1952
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:25,791
The people who run the

1953
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:27,327
This world who are the ruling class

1954
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:28,607
Tree in the world

1955
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:29,887
Are mainly psychic

1956
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:30,911
Criminal

1957
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,751
I do

1958
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:38,079
Because of course

1959
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:38,847
Ask me if something

1960
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,127
Bribed

1961
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:41,407
Really really interested

1962
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:44,223
I'm a democratic

1963
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:50,879
We were talking a little bit about his motion to depose Hillary Clinton and his sort of

1964
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:51,647
Obsession

1965
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:56,255
With this idea that these lawsuits were entirely motivated by Hillary Clinton's Vendetta against

1966
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:58,047
Yeah persecution complex

1967
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:01,631
It's weird because it's like do you think there's really that

1968
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:02,399
Shortage of

1969
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,959
Many people who would love to do these lawsuits

1970
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:12,639
Call me Hillary only Hillary could hate me there's no one else in the world who could want to be

1971
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:13,663
Bring me down right

1972
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:16,735
Funny because okay so just come inside me

1973
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:18,783
This is that as a plaintiff's lawyer

1974
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,319
What I do is

1975
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:22,111
Is is when people come to me for help

1976
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,391
They don't pay me anymore

1977
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,951
Write like I'm sort of

1978
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:27,743
Need like a pirate right like

1979
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:34,143
Somebody comes to a pirate and says the Spaniards took all my gold and I want you to go get it back and I like okay all outfit of fast

1980
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,679
Pokemon guns I'll try to go get

1981
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,447
Gold

1982
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,471
I'm keeping a third of it

1983
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:41,823
And all front any expenses and if I don't get the gold you don't owe me anything

1984
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:45,663
You're working on spec

1985
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:48,991
Is they say immediate in the industry

1986
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:51,807
Your privateers lawyer say it is you know you talked

1987
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:53,343
These lawyers who bill by H me

1988
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:55,391
You say that's not me I'm a claims lawyer

1989
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,415
Eat what I kill

1990
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,695
That's basically how I

1991
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:00,511
So for most of my case

1992
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:05,631
If I'm involved in a medical device case or if I've got a product case I've got to pay experts

1993
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:10,751
You know my firm were putting in 200,000 to 50 into a case before we see a diamond

1994
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:11,775
And try to make that up

1995
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:14,080
How's it cost

1996
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,872
And an honest issues differin

1997
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,688
And Jones is convinced

1998
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:21,248
We funded by biliary Clinton

1999
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:26,112
We've been really upfront about it since the beginning my for a handball is

2000
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:29,952
It's funded every expense on this we're happy to do it we're excited to do it

2001
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:31,488
There's not many law firms

2002
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:32,512
To do what I do who wouldn't

2003
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:33,280
Love

2004
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:34,048
Do this

2005
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:41,216
Have you forever you produce the Hillary Clinton marketing materials

2006
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:43,520
Request for production of oh my George Soros

2007
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:47,104
They never figured out

2008
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,384
Looking yellow out

2009
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:49,664
Interesting look at the

2010
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,456
The law firm up there in Connecticut

2011
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:53,760
The cost cough

2012
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:55,808
The nerve area button

2013
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:56,576
Barry

2014
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:58,624
Normal kind of Law Firm very

2015
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,416
You know Hauser

2016
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:01,696
Advertise on really nice

2017
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:03,488
I'm the guy on up

2018
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:05,792
Profane podcast about our children

2019
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:08,864
Slightly different approaches

2020
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,144
I'm a little bit

2021
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,960
The different lawyer I don't think they realize

2022
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:14,496
I came into their lives

2023
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:16,544
Representing a young Communists out of Masa

2024
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:21,920
And not send your cousin a came to me because I brought a suit on behalf

2025
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:23,456
And

2026
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:24,480
I am not

2027
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:25,504
Hillary Clinton

2028
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:27,040
That's there's no way shape

2029
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:29,344
Reformed but they never get this

2030
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,672
The entire Infowars organization is

2031
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:33,440
Is convinced

2032
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,208
All about aquatic

2033
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:34,976
Vendetta

2034
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,536
When when

2035
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,072
Really they just open themselves up

2036
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,864
Yeah

2037
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:45,728
It's a terrifying combination of just like narcissism and black and white

2038
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,544
You know Alexis absolute sand

2039
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:55,712
Everyone is against me because I'm the greatest

2040
01:21:55,968 --> 01:22:02,112
Global politics all the time thinking that he's a big-time show but really he only knows like 10

2041
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,392
So

2042
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:09,792
Okay so who's bringing this lawsuit I don't know any of these people so it's got to be

2043
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:12,608
One of the 10 people I know

2044
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:15,680
Yeah when you have that simple of a world

2045
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:17,728
View it just you cram everything into

2046
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:21,056
Run out of character

2047
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:27,456
It's just really small place in his head it's like a sitcom with a low budget

2048
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:31,296
Locations not a lot of characters Style

2049
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:37,952
My other kind of final thoughts and this is address to the State Bar of Texas when they finally review this

2050
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:39,488
And listen to me talk on this

2051
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,024
Listen guys

2052
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,072
I know we've we've been a little

2053
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:45,376
Loosen wild today in little profane here

2054
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:47,168
I know that I did my

2055
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:50,752
My invitations H Jones I know it did a couple of those

2056
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:53,312
Just wanted for the record he imitated me first

2057
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:58,176
So I think it's fair

2058
01:22:58,688 --> 01:22:59,712
He compared me to Golem

2059
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:04,064
Gremlin

2060
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,856
And I just that hasn't happened yet cuz I'm

2061
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:08,928
I am number one who's going to buy 10 yeah

2062
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:11,744
He started it

2063
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,560
Okay so I just don't want that to be fair for the State Bar he started it

2064
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:16,608
End

2065
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,656
It has been a situation where is

2066
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:20,960
His public statements have been absurd

2067
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,008
For somebody

2068
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:23,776
Look

2069
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:24,544
I have the up

2070
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,848
Opportunity to be on National Television whenever I want

2071
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:28,640
If someone was talked to said he'll call you it's going to

2072
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:31,456
Fairly infra

2073
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:32,736
You know I vibe

2074
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:35,808
When we first started I went on the Today Show the very first time

2075
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:37,856
I've done PBS Frontline appearance

2076
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:39,648
About this issue to talk about it

2077
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:41,184
Belmont like we don't

2078
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:41,952
That's not where we're fight

2079
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,768
And Anna went to come talk about it with y'all's audience

2080
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:47,328
Your audience is never going to be on the jury

2081
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:51,936
If there's anybody want to know which fight they're getting taken off the jury

2082
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:58,336
Very strong feelings and will not be

2083
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:00,384
Not worried about influencing the jury for anything

2084
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:03,200
Then I'm going to come talk about it with y'all because I feel like

2085
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:05,504
The suit has been really interesting

2086
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:06,528
2

2087
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:07,552
The Wider culture

2088
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:08,832
And not enough

2089
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,368
Really hard analysis

2090
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,648
Being done on it not enough

2091
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:12,416
A real bat

2092
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:13,696
Patriots

2093
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:15,232
And I know y'all guys come out like that

2094
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:16,000
Have fun with it

2095
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:17,024
But y'all are doing a really

2096
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:18,304
A lot of

2097
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,584
People have learned a lot more about

2098
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:21,888
From now on

2099
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:25,216
Don't know man

2100
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:31,616
Overwhelmed to hear that and thank you that we read a lot

2101
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:37,760
Place here I was talking to a friend last night about how we were going to do this interview and I was like

2102
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:39,808
Man I hope he doesn't compliment us

2103
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:46,976
That's the thing I'm most anxious about this today

2104
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:51,328
I'm going to go on a show

2105
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:52,352
There are

2106
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:53,376
Adore

2107
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:55,168
You can count on one hand

2108
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,192
The number of

2109
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:57,984
People in the world who know more about

2110
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:58,752
Alex Jones tonight

2111
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,544
And I'm currently talking to

2112
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:07,456
I don't know I think you could use some callbacks

2113
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:14,880
I bet I bet you know more about Alex Jones at most but you're probably not in the top 5

2114
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:21,280
Somewhere in my head I don't have action I don't have like the ability to call it whenever I want.

2115
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:23,840
Narcissistic

2116
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:24,608
I'll take it

2117
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:33,056
Well thank you so much for joining us Mark I hope it's some point we can reconnect and maybe check in and

2118
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:33,824
Another time

2119
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:36,896
Well I'm sure look up if if else comes on and some more crazy

2120
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:39,200
Stuff between now and trial I love to come back and

2121
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:40,224
Talk to you about that we

2122
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:41,760
Taco bout it

2123
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:42,784
But otherwise

2124
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:44,832
Let's try to plan on me having a verdict

2125
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:46,112
Sometime near the end of April

2126
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:47,648
And we'll come back and talk about what that mean

2127
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:52,256
Awesome maybe right in time for my birthday

2128
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:58,400
Thank you again it's been an absolute Delight to talk to you and wish you and everyone

2129
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:00,960
On your side of the case all the best

2130
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:03,008
We're going to keep doing what we can do

2131
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,544
Awesome thank you

2132
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:05,568
Thanks

2133
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,384
Wow

2134
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:11,712
That was hallucinating

2135
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:18,624
What are the odds that was a lot of fun thank you so much to mark for for joining us and having that little

2136
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,952
Spectacular

2137
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:24,000
Spectacular job

2138
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:29,376
Congratulations to I think I'm not sure if we articulated that it

2139
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:32,192
Enough in our conversation but like

2140
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:33,984
It's gotta just feel great

2141
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:37,056
Do you Snapchat. Come to a close

2142
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:39,616
And just she ran and just

2143
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:40,896
Talking to him you know like

2144
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,200
He pulled it off

2145
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:46,272
Like he hadn't spent the last four years in hell

2146
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:47,040
You know

2147
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:53,440
Like you pulled it off like this wasn't a crushing miserable thing to do on a date

2148
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:55,488
Daily basis filled with abuse

2149
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:56,768
Bulshit

2150
01:26:57,024 --> 01:27:00,608
And it looking like it might never end you know any f***

2151
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:01,632
Can get it

2152
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:04,960
Hell yeah maybe a little bit of that humor armor can help a little

2153
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:08,032
But Jordan we are not just here

2154
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:09,824
To have an interview

2155
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:10,848
I would mark

2156
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:12,640
Bankston we are also here

2157
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:14,944
Do discus Alex's immediate response

2158
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:17,760
But he put out the night that these

2159
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:21,088
Now these yes I do summary judgment

2160
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:23,392
Default judgment came around

2161
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:25,696
Answer you put out he put out a little piece

2162
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:27,488
And it's not good

2163
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,792
It's it's not not very compelling

2164
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:36,448
Piece of business

2165
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:39,008
Turn on that one I was on Norm isn't there

2166
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:41,824
Watching Alex just drunkenly spiral

2167
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:45,664
Here is where we're at

2168
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:46,944
If the last

2169
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:49,248
The left in this country

2170
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:50,784
Has completely

2171
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,576
Weaponize the legal system

2172
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:54,112
And the Judiciary

2173
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:55,904
There's so many examples of

2174
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:56,672
But

2175
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:57,952
Just last few days

2176
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:58,976
Decorated

2177
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,000
Lieutenant colonel

2178
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:01,280
Who came out in

2179
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:03,072
Criticize the hasty

2180
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:04,608
Horribly organized

2181
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:05,888
Withdrawal Afghanistan

2182
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:10,496
Is sitting in a military Stockade in a Brig in a prison

2183
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:11,520
Without

2184
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:12,544
Even being

2185
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,568
Charged with

2186
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:15,872
And he's already been there

2187
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:16,640
Five Guys

2188
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:23,296
This is about Lieutenant Colonel Stuart scheller criticized the administration's handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan

2189
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:25,088
A video that you posted on Facebook

2190
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:30,464
He was relieved of command and put in the brig at Camp Lejeune North Carolina

2191
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,488
Awaiting trial

2192
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,560
He's pretty messed up and I can see how this would worry

2193
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:36,864
Anybody but has nothing to do with the last

2194
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,144
Or the Judiciary

2195
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,448
This has to do with how they're different rules of

2196
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:43,008
Conduct when you agreed to enlist in the armed services

2197
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:44,800
Their military rules

2198
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:47,616
Reply to you and

2199
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:50,688
Not to not enlisted persons when you break them

2200
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:52,480
Different sort of trouble

2201
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:55,296
Peter Marshall lost yeah yeah

2202
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:58,112
You can't even really say no to him

2203
01:28:58,368 --> 01:29:04,512
Because he violated a gag order after being relieved of command by posting the video she put on Facebook salaries accused

2204
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:09,120
Quote showing contempt towards officials willfully disobeying a superior officer

2205
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:13,472
Failing to obey lawful orders and committing conduct Unbecoming of an officer

2206
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:20,128
I can agree that it might be a productive conversation to discuss how weird it is that the military has b-zone rule that it has for its my

2207
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:21,408
Members to be subjected to

2208
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:24,480
But in terms of Alex's response to

2209
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:28,576
He's getting on air to talk about losing these multiple Sandy Hook cases

2210
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:29,856
Nothing to do with anything

2211
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:33,440
I was about to say if I was directing this I would have been like Alex

2212
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:34,208
Quick cut

2213
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:34,976
Alright

2214
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:36,000
We're going to start over

2215
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:39,328
Okay we're going to take this again it's just real quick

2216
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:41,632
We're talking about your Sandy Hook lost

2217
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:44,960
Track a little already left

2218
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:49,568
Okay if this is the way he's deciding to start discussing list

2219
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:52,640
I don't have a lot of faith that this is going to keep going

2220
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:54,176
Or reach anywhere

2221
01:29:54,432 --> 01:30:00,576
I know you everybody's read the news they are not talking about is that it is still fat bear

2222
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:02,624
And the week

2223
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,928
Spells that bear should be held sacred

2224
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:12,352
I could be clear about this I think Alex is you'll be more productive and less dangerous if he did discover fatbearweek have everybody

2225
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:14,912
And have a much better time

2226
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:17,216
This this is not good

2227
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:20,544
Okay I thought I thought like well we're not going to get a whole lot here

2228
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,104
But we do get right off the bat is

2229
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:26,944
A little bit of a confused timeline of events

2230
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:29,504
Now you go back almost 10 years ago

2231
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,808
We saw the tragic shootings at Sandy

2232
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:35,392
It was hard for Americans to believe that someone would go into execute

2233
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:36,928
A bunch of Elementary

2234
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:40,768
The internet quickly had questions and talked about anomaly

2235
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:41,792
It was something that I

2236
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:43,328
Only a few times on here

2237
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,608
But what

2238
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:45,888
Years later

2239
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:51,264
Evidence came out with some of those anomalies were not accurate and I said Sally Sandy Hook actually happen

2240
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:53,056
It was the minute

2241
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:55,360
That I said I thought it happened that the

2242
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:56,896
The mainstream media center

2243
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,968
You said it didn't happen for attention

2244
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:01,248
What a truth

2245
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,296
Almost had employees quit over it

2246
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:06,112
I want people to scream with me including some of my family

2247
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:07,136
And it was not

2248
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:08,672
A popular fuel my show

2249
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:14,560
I can speak as someone who listen back to the entire period after the shooting and with absolute confidence I can say that that's

2250
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:15,328
Bulshit

2251
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:20,704
It's a good spin for Alex because most people won't actually go back and check idiots like Joe Rogan

2252
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,240
Didn't fall for this kind of line but

2253
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:23,776
That is definitely false

2254
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:27,616
But even leaving that aside that clip makes no sense

2255
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:32,992
I was just trying to make to claim simultaneously and it's really hard for both of them to be true

2256
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:36,832
The first is that he barely ever talked about Sandy Hook maybe just a few times

2257
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:38,880
The news just covering what the internet was saying

2258
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:41,184
And the second thing is trying to claim

2259
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:46,304
Is it the coverage of Sandy Hook was so unpopular that some of Alex's family disagreed with him

2260
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,096
And staff almost quit because of

2261
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:51,424
That's in convoluted I don't know how both of those can actually be

2262
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:57,824
He's accurate are retelling of events

2263
01:31:59,104 --> 01:32:05,248
Over it that he never talked about it again until several years later whenever he finally said that

2264
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:08,064
Believe that happened then everybody was like

2265
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,880
Haha now it's time to take you to

2266
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:13,440
What what are those years in between

2267
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:15,744
I mean he mentioned it maybe

2268
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:17,024
70

2269
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:17,792
100

2270
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:21,376
200 * I mean yeah but I mean

2271
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:23,168
But other than that

2272
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:26,752
Have a very few times you're the one being obtuse here

2273
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:32,896
Get off my damn high horse I should probably stop thinking like

2274
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:33,920
Hey

2275
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:40,832
I was just questioning things man

2276
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:41,600
Toledo

2277
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,136
Forward right

2278
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:45,184
So the idea that I

2279
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,720
Question Sandy Hooks

2280
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:47,744
Because it was some

2281
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,792
Master plan of mine to get famous

2282
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,120
I questioned wmds in Iraq

2283
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:54,656
I was right about that

2284
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:58,240
Why should babies in incubators Banks robbed by Saddam that wasn't true either

2285
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:01,568
I questioned Jessie Smollett and that was a fraud I question

2286
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:03,104
Bubba Wallace I question

2287
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:04,896
Hundreds of other events

2288
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:05,920
Out there

2289
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:08,480
The Gulf of Tonkin

2290
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:10,528
9064 that got us into Vietnam

2291
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:17,184
First of all no one's claiming that Alex had a grand design to get rich and famous by way of lying about Sandy Hook or at least that's not a matter

2292
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:17,952
For the courts

2293
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:19,488
Immediately

2294
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:24,608
Plant that idea in his audiences head because it's more defensible strawman than dealing with reality

2295
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:28,192
Alex's list of things he's questioned is a little bizarre though

2296
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:34,592
For one I don't think he was the one who questioned the Gulf of Tonkin incident if only because it happened 10 years before he was born

2297
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:37,920
Yeah but he was the first person to really look into it

2298
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:44,320
Second the cases of Jesse Smollett Bubba Wallace are the only two recent examples he comes up within those are both time

2299
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:48,928
Times that he just had a knee-jerk denial but allegations of racially motivated crimes

2300
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:53,280
If you listen to our show you'll find way more examples of times when Alex was very wrong

2301
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:55,072
But denying racist violence

2302
01:33:55,328 --> 01:34:01,472
Bring those times I thought know you're always batting a thousand so long as you pretended all the times that you struck out didn't happen

2303
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:04,544
And that's what his audience allows him to do it

2304
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:05,824
What a

2305
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:06,592
What a cheat

2306
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:08,896
100%

2307
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:15,552
100 well now he does get things wrong he's either 97% or Alex is playing

2308
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:18,112
Propaganda with a Game Genie

2309
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,184
Now we roll

2310
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:27,584
That one was definitely that one's definitely world the one large issue his comment

2311
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:31,168
There's another one that is that Alex is not questioning things

2312
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:31,936
Succumbs to

2313
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:32,704
Conclusion

2314
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:37,312
Who be one thing if Alex's coverage was what he imagines it was

2315
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:43,712
Who still be dumb and dangerous but if he was drily reporting that online conspiracy communities had questions about Ali

2316
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:45,760
Alleged irregularities in the Sandy Hook case

2317
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:48,064
That could be argued to just be questioning

2318
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:51,904
What else was doing was persuading which is different than questioning

2319
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:53,440
Questioning seeks truth

2320
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:55,744
Through asking sometimes unpopular questions

2321
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:57,024
Persuade

2322
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,840
Conclusion that the audience is supposed to be drawn to

2323
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:02,400
And often times you can ask a loaded question

2324
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:06,240
As a tool that you can use and the path of your persuasion

2325
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:07,008
And that's what I

2326
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:09,824
Jack West music

2327
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:13,664
Yeah that's why in court you can't do that is called the leading question

2328
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,456
You're not allowed to do it

2329
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:19,040
The way if if Alex wasn't guilty of stuff

2330
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:22,368
Then he would be able to do the same stuff he does

2331
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:23,648
In the courtroom

2332
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:27,744
The fact that he can't do any of the things he does

2333
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:34,144
The moment he steps into a place where it means something to tell you all you need to know that seems to happen over a note

2334
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,448
Over and over again with all these people yeah

2335
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:41,312
Dialysis career snowbigdeal

2336
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:42,336
Look Maya please

2337
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:43,872
No big deal

2338
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:45,152
Sandy Hook is

2339
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:47,200
A blip on the radar screen

2340
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:48,224
In the different

2341
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,272
Story for tens of thousands I've cover

2342
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:51,808
But it's not a blip

2343
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:52,832
On the radar screen

2344
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:53,600
4

2345
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:56,160
The Lobby's that are anti-gun the big

2346
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:57,952
Corporate institutions that seek

2347
01:35:58,464 --> 01:35:59,232
The disarming America

2348
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:02,304
The families of those

2349
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,584
Oh you didn't

2350
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:04,864
You did not.

2351
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:06,656
Remington into bankruptcy

2352
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:09,216
And the demonize the idea of shelter

2353
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:10,240
The fence itself

2354
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:12,544
I did try to basically destroying Steel

2355
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,080
The birthright of self-defense

2356
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:19,968
All Americans that's just so f****** callous in the ass insults that's insane

2357
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:25,088
His act like it because he's saying that his actions are just like a blip in his career

2358
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:28,672
But it wasn't a blip to the evil gun-grabbers that it did he's against

2359
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:34,048
They're round every Court like your response is exactly the same thing that I was experienced and I was looking for that

2360
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:38,400
Yeah you know who else it wasn't a blip for people who lost their loved ones you a******

2361
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:40,448
This is

2362
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:41,728
Crazy

2363
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:44,544
But what he's literally doing in that sentence

2364
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:48,384
Is denying that there were victims at Sandy Hook

2365
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:51,712
He's at least ignoring it

2366
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:58,112
And then another thing he's doing is he's taking away their agents

2367
01:36:58,368 --> 01:37:04,512
The gun grabbers are trying to play

2368
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:08,864
There are literally real yes but their intentions are fake

2369
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:13,472
Against their concerns are being weaponized by the gun grabbers

2370
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:14,752
Anyways that

2371
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:21,408
Would lead one to believe if you believe Alex that their concerns aren't real early on that is f****** discuss

2372
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:26,272
If you if you meant

2373
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:28,064
Any of what you said about

2374
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,112
Any of what you're saying right now

2375
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:30,880
UTA

2376
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:32,416
I'm sorry to the victim

2377
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:33,696
Yes

2378
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:35,488
Also this is like a supervillain

2379
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:36,256
Talk

2380
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:37,280
Like this is like

2381
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:43,680
It was just a blip in my career

2382
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:50,336
You'll never forget nothing to me

2383
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:55,456
Unreal unreal

2384
01:37:55,712 --> 01:38:01,856
F****** yeah that was where I was like well we're off the rails

2385
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:05,184
That's going in the money hearing play that s*** right there

2386
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:08,512
Even after a f****** lost he's pretending

2387
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:09,536
Yeah

2388
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:13,120
I can't

2389
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:17,984
See any possible way that's true but I will give him a shout

2390
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:20,800
Even their top legal expert says

2391
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,336
He's definitely sanction

2392
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:23,616
Basically a myth

2393
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:25,152
Because you're guaranteed

2394
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:26,432
To be able to try the

2395
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:27,968
Facts of the case

2396
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:30,784
So this is a legal Theory they're trying to get through

2397
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,320
To get rid of due process

2398
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:33,088
Using

2399
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:35,392
The strawman of the demonized villain

2400
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:36,160
Alex Jones

2401
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:37,696
Listen dangerous everybody

2402
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:38,464
Making process

2403
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,744
Everybody's Free Speech

2404
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,536
Wow

2405
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:42,816
The bacon have the Alex

2406
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:44,608
Jones law they call it

2407
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:45,888
To get rid

2408
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:47,936
Of people free speech selectively

2409
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:50,240
While protecting the corporate media is Free Speech

2410
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:52,544
I thought I'd history Works everybody

2411
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,360
It's going to get burned by this this is nonsense

2412
01:38:55,616 --> 01:39:01,248
Alex has been given excessive due process and given every opportunity

2413
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:04,064
And he showed himself to be unwilling at every turn

2414
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:07,648
Symbicort depriving Alex of his right to Tim's shooting himself in the foot

2415
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:14,560
In the court order for default judgment they specifically say that they have gotten no response and Discovery request 10th July set

2416
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:15,840
Second which was months ago

2417
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:18,912
Unicourt failing it's Alex's sabotage

2418
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:23,520
It's pretty funny to like the order makes it clear that this is not a lawyer problem

2419
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:24,544
It's Alec

2420
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:25,824
Quote

2421
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:32,224
It is clear to the court that Discovery misconduct is properly attributable to the client and not the attorney especially since defended

2422
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:35,552
Has been represented by attorneys over the course of the suit

2423
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:39,648
Regardless of the attorney defendants Discovery abuse remained

2424
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:45,280
Also The Huffington Post article that Alex was talking about with wasn't quoting their top legal expert

2425
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:47,072
They were quoting Bill Ogden

2426
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:51,424
Who's the lawyer at Ferrari in Belle which is the law firm that Mark Bankston works at

2427
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:56,544
The guy who he referenced was doing the Rob deposition

2428
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:00,896
Even right next to each other on the law firm's website

2429
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:04,224
This isn't a lawyer saying that to this is just a legal Theory

2430
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:08,320
You saying that it's taught that way at law school because it almost never happens

2431
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:09,344
Quote

2432
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:13,184
It's extremely rare that a party in the parentheses Alex Jones Infowars

2433
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,464
He's ordered by the court.

2434
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:15,744
To comply with discovery

2435
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,072
Obey with multiple orders

2436
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:22,656
And then continues to blatantly disregard the court Authority bike

2437
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:23,424
Continuing

2438
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:26,240
To refuse to comply

2439
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:27,008
Yeah it's

2440
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:28,544
It's like if

2441
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,336
Let's say okay

2442
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:32,896
How about this okay so I murdered somebody

2443
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:35,712
And then I took the knife home with me

2444
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:36,480
And they arrest

2445
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:37,760
Stickman they were like okay

2446
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:39,808
You just got to bring that knife

2447
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:41,600
And then we'll get this all done with

2448
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:45,952
No and everytime I didn't bring the knife and I was like nah I'm just not going to go

2449
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:48,000
I never liked okay football

2450
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:51,072
We have to do something so I guess there's a fine or maybe

2451
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:52,096
Just bring the f****** night

2452
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:57,728
And then I was like nah nah how about instead I go stand outside your courthouse and wagon my dick in your face

2453
01:40:57,984 --> 01:41:03,104
And then holding the knife above my head and then throwing it around and then spinning

2454
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:03,872
And then

2455
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:05,920
Whenever you grab me

2456
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:11,040
And arrest me and put me in jail

2457
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:16,416
What were the top of due process this talk Rob due process

2458
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:20,256
There's my one punch.

2459
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:22,304
Tell Alex Watkins at the records

2460
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,864
Straight he's giving everybody everything

2461
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:28,704
He's getting he's been the king of discovery

2462
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:33,824
A judge issued default judgments a rarity in the legal World against Jones and Infowars

2463
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:36,640
Has failed to produce Discovery Records

2464
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:39,200
Ladies and gentlemen first let me set the record straight

2465
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:42,016
My lawyer told me in Connecticut

2466
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:43,296
They said you shouldn't even

2467
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:44,320
Produce with the rat

2468
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:45,344
No one's ever done

2469
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:52,256
I release all of my company bank records going back to Sandy Hook It Up Until Now

2470
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:53,792
No one has ever done that

2471
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:59,424
So it sounds like Trump at the end there no one's ever done anything like this is the best lawsuit anyone's ever

2472
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:05,568
So we talked to t'mark a little bit about this and this cares has nothing to do with the cases he lost that's in the Connecticut

2473
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,616
This is just sort of like

2474
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:08,384
Again

2475
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:09,664
Rowing

2476
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:16,064
Confetti if it is a shotgun blast of b*******

2477
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,088
A10e wallet

2478
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:18,624
It might stick

2479
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:25,280
So Alex thinks that there is a case is really about trying to prove that he's paid by the NRA

2480
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:27,840
Are the Mercers or somebody

2481
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:30,912
Is just another side deflection

2482
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:34,496
They have this weird crazy theory that I'm secretly being paid off by

2483
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:36,544
The NRA or something to do this

2484
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:37,824
Let them see all

2485
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:41,152
Let them see there's no money from the Mercers are the NRA

2486
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:42,688
Are the Republicans or anybody

2487
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:44,224
And so

2488
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:46,784
We did that because the judge in Connecticut demanded

2489
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:49,600
Right here in Texas is all coordinated

2490
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:52,416
They asked for less but was still substantive

2491
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:53,440
Tens of

2492
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:55,232
Email thousands of record

2493
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:58,816
But they kept demanding the Sandy Hook

2494
01:42:59,072 --> 01:42:59,840
Marketing

2495
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:02,912
I don't do marketing around Newsweek cover

2496
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:04,960
I products and sponsors that I

2497
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:06,240
Promote and market for

2498
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:09,056
And we gave them in Connecticut and taxes.

2499
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:10,080
Basic information

2500
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:14,688
I had to bring it up with Mark because I

2501
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:21,088
I didn't know what the f*** you could possibly be referring

2502
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:22,624
Baby thinks that like

2503
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:26,976
It is about the source of the funding as opposed to tracking

2504
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:29,280
Whether or not your Analytics

2505
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:30,304
Show that you

2506
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:36,704
Know that you benefit from okay so the day after we did the first Sandy Hook story we had a huge increase in trap

2507
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:43,104
Traffic and then the more we did Sandy Hook Stories the more we saw an increase in traffic versus when we weren't doing

2508
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:47,456
It's a very queer way to establish a pattern of malicious behavior for money

2509
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:48,736
It doesn't even take it sunny

2510
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:52,320
Kind of tough to imagine

2511
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:54,112
Dino the image we have of Alex

2512
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:57,696
That he would spend any time poring over that date of

2513
01:43:57,952 --> 01:43:59,744
He has employed somebody that's yes

2514
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:06,144
Somebody did otherwise how're we here is any of this real if nobody is handled his traffic

2515
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,424
F****** I quit it's just

2516
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:10,752
Coincidence

2517
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:12,544
What man

2518
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:13,568
Part of the problem

2519
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:15,872
Is the discharge

2520
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:16,640
Texas

2521
01:44:16,896 --> 01:44:17,408
Right

2522
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:21,248
The judge won't let Alex have his lawyer that he wants

2523
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:25,088
They tearing I've covered up they say I haven't given any information

2524
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:27,136
Discharge

2525
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:32,512
And the judge previously one of her tired and Travis County will never let me have the lawyers I want their well-known famous

2526
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:33,792
Personal lawyers

2527
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:36,608
What is so

2528
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:43,264
We have a local lawyers most of which are real brand-new will take the case and they go in and they get yelled at and

2529
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,288
They roll over and say

2530
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:45,312
I'm sorry

2531
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:47,616
Will be better will give you more

2532
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:51,456
When the judge in the opposing sides say we know you got the information

2533
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:54,528
This is like asking somebody for a confession

2534
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:55,296
That doesn't

2535
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:56,064
Exist

2536
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:57,600
And that's what completely

2537
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:58,880
Crazy about this whole thing

2538
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:00,928
Wow that's an interesting spin

2539
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:08,864
That's that's a question that I guess they just didn't answer and they didn't ask him the depositions just like

2540
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:09,888
Legitimately

2541
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:10,912
You and me

2542
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:11,936
Man to man

2543
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:13,472
Tell me why you're here

2544
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:16,288
Very interesting

2545
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:22,176
Just keep going if your perception of what's happening what is happening

2546
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:28,576
I want to know before we go anywhere what do you think is going on right now and are there is there like spinny light

2547
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:34,976
It's around me yeah I remember learning in some philosophy class in in college was that like

2548
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:38,304
The beginning of any kind of discussion that you can have with someone is like

2549
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:40,608
Agreeing on the definition of interference

2550
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:44,448
And like if you eat you do really kind of have to establish like

2551
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:51,104
First principles about reality Galaxy

2552
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:56,480
This is a chair weakened from their next words were going to go through the dictionary

2553
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:58,784
Yeah always lawyers were just

2554
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:00,064
Like little worms

2555
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,624
They're afraid of it's so funny

2556
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:03,648
So funny

2557
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:09,280
They're brand new lawyers because that's all we could get to take this case a good lawyer would be like no will never do this

2558
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:13,120
So then they're like maybe we can figure something like a lawyer takes on the case

2559
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:17,216
Get involved realizes Alex

2560
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:19,776
Maybe get them disbarred

2561
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:26,176
They skedaddle and someone else coming I'm representing Alex Jones can I stop

2562
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:32,576
Reasonable thing to do one of the other problems besides Alex's lawyers he didn't get to choose the lawyer

2563
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:33,600
Everybody wants because there

2564
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:34,368
Maybe

2565
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:35,392
Not

2566
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:38,720
Isn't he dead

2567
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:43,584
Court Of Heaven

2568
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:48,704
Some people are not qualified to practice

2569
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:51,264
In Texas right we're not allowed to have

2570
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,800
Pass the bar

2571
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:54,336
In Texas or whatever

2572
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:55,616
And that's a problem

2573
01:46:56,128 --> 01:47:00,992
But the other problem I think is probably even more serious and it's if Alex has to be believed

2574
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:02,016
This job

2575
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:04,320
Does not know the law

2576
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:05,600
The judge also

2577
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:07,904
Who is known as

2578
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:08,928
A bomb thrower

2579
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:11,232
By the Democrats not talk to as well as just

2580
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:12,768
Unbelievably

2581
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:14,560
Ill-informed about the law

2582
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:18,656
They even quoted here in The Huffington Post of all places

2583
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:19,936
Who's attacking me

2584
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:21,472
But it's on her.

2585
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:23,520
Lawyer Bill Ogden with

2586
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:24,800
Fart ball

2587
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:26,336
11th and post that

2588
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:28,384
Gamble's default that's the judgment

2589
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:30,432
Riverlink is a bit of a myth

2590
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:34,528
In the legal world but not if they can make it real with me

2591
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:36,064
Rita judge decides

2592
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:42,464
Bad sign that Alex didn't recognize the name of the law firm Farrar and Bell

2593
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:45,024
That's not good that was weird you alive

2594
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:49,120
I recognize that name

2595
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:54,752
And I'm not being sued for not being sued by them what could be a ridiculous number of money

2596
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:58,080
Yeah and for a long time like if you were here

2597
01:47:58,336 --> 01:48:00,128
If you're in a protracted case

2598
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:06,784
And the law firm you know the name of the law firm against you to a certain point they have been in this case so long you halfway

2599
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:10,112
Expect them to a developing almost collegial relationship like

2600
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:15,232
We'll go out and eat lunch together we just spent everyday together for 4 years or whatever

2601
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,304
Nope still does another name doesn't seem to

2602
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,352
For defamation

2603
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:25,216
I didn't do

2604
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:28,800
Did you know that in the you don't want you to have a jury trial

2605
01:48:29,056 --> 01:48:30,336
I'm being sued by people

2606
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:32,128
And they say in the

2607
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:34,176
I've never said their names

2608
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:35,712
Texas law

2609
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:37,760
Says you can't sue somebody

2610
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:39,552
If you didn't say their name for defamation

2611
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:40,832
But Tricare

2612
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:44,160
People hear me so this is sort of true but Alex is still lying

2613
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:50,816
So the cases that were brought by Neil heslin and Posner and Della Rosa those are defamation cases because

2614
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:51,584
In four words

2615
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:54,400
And Alex did say their name specifically on air

2616
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:55,680
Conversely the case

2617
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:59,776
Being brought by Charlotte Lewis isn't for defamation because her name was never said

2618
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:01,312
But her child was invoked

2619
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:05,152
Industrial Q's Alex of intentional infliction of emotional distress

2620
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:06,688
Right does a different charge

2621
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:10,016
Because the defamation statute probably would not apply

2622
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:15,136
I was just playing fast and loose with these details knowing his audience will never look into it or try to figure out the difference

2623
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:19,232
Or why is it I never said

2624
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:20,256
Yeah yeah

2625
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:22,560
In the end in any situation like this

2626
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:23,328
If you would

2627
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:26,144
If you're a listener of Alex

2628
01:49:26,912 --> 01:49:29,472
Just based on all we've had to do till like

2629
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:31,264
Narrow down what

2630
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:32,288
Actually happen

2631
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,336
And how many different

2632
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:36,896
Complicated things are happening simultaneously

2633
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:41,248
Alex is giving you a very simple answer never heard of

2634
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:43,808
Judge

2635
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:50,208
Is a bomb thrower still informed on laws

2636
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:56,096
Explanation I'd rather keep it simple stupid

2637
01:49:56,352 --> 01:50:02,496
I think I think he probably self-select for an audience that is really into easy answer

2638
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:10,688
Insisting that he's never going to get a fair trial always me

2639
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:12,736
So they're not going to give us a fair trial

2640
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:16,064
Just like they're not going to give America for a trial because

2641
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,600
I taking this country Oliver

2642
01:50:18,368 --> 01:50:19,904
Especially in blue cities almost died

2643
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:22,464
Republicans have their own problems war-mongering

2644
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:24,256
Surveillance police take stuff

2645
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:27,328
But with the left all of that and more fused together

2646
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:28,864
With their righteousness

2647
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:32,448
That that that they're in control of society that they rule the world

2648
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:36,032
Alex's at every opportunity to have a fair trial this is nonsense

2649
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:42,176
Also it seems really weird that I like seems to be brushing aside the problems he has with Republicans when those problems are quote

2650
01:50:42,432 --> 01:50:48,576
War-mongering surveillance police state stuff

2651
01:50:48,832 --> 01:50:50,368
To take over the world

2652
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:56,768
Watches at all times and control our Behavior documentaries if you made called police state

2653
01:50:57,024 --> 01:50:59,072
Sure there's some problem

2654
01:50:59,328 --> 01:51:01,120
Who's there

2655
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:05,472
Because there's sanctimonious

2656
01:51:07,008 --> 01:51:07,776
All of us

2657
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:14,176
They want a police state and their snooty no one's going to starve in the streets

2658
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:18,528
No one was there was a f****** point of living in America ridiculous

2659
01:51:18,784 --> 01:51:22,368
How do you find this defense to be laughable

2660
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:25,184
Why did I really bismal display

2661
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:26,976
But it

2662
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:27,744
A little bit

2663
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:28,512
Satyr

2664
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:32,096
And again it's been years since I've even talked about this

2665
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:33,888
So I'm venting a little bit

2666
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:36,704
But in a way it's a good idea

2667
01:51:37,216 --> 01:51:39,776
It's so insane it's almost comical for the plan

2668
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:41,824
Clip of the courts to radiography

2669
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:43,616
At the end that's how I stay sane

2670
01:51:43,872 --> 01:51:45,920
But first let me read you a statement from Warren Patton

2671
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:49,248
I actually got my hands on this statement for Norm pattis

2672
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:50,272
Knock knock

2673
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:53,344
Who's there no seriously knock knock who's there orange

2674
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:57,440
Orange who orange you glad you bought woke insurance

2675
01:51:58,976 --> 01:52:00,000
Good joke

2676
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:09,984
Okay so you got one you got a knock knock joke what else what else

2677
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:13,824
Under the guise of it being written by norpoth

2678
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:19,712
It's been over this a good day for you I got called back to work Insurance in the next to this is fantastic

2679
01:52:19,968 --> 01:52:21,504
Yes

2680
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:22,272
You get five point

2681
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:32,256
I'm so we have one last clip here and it's the end of Norm quote

2682
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:36,864
Okay I which is not the knock-knock joke from Alex's lawyer.

2683
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:37,888
Batman

2684
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:41,216
Man it feels like I was about to go to an ad that then

2685
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:44,032
He doesn't really but kind of soft doesn't add

2686
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,336
It is not an overstatement to say

2687
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:48,640
The first amendment was crucified

2688
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:49,664
Today

2689
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:52,224
Captain George

2690
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:58,112
And today we fight judicial tyranny there still some good judges are still some good at BIR still some good just fart

2691
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:02,208
Running to fight these people violence or with muskets likely saw

2692
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:03,488
240 something years ago

2693
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:05,024
The truth

2694
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:06,816
And Justice and educating the public

2695
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:08,352
And taking our country back

2696
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:09,376
Through election

2697
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:10,912
At the rather legal in Waffle

2698
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:14,496
I appreciate the last 40-plus on air

2699
01:53:15,008 --> 01:53:17,312
I haven't made a big deal about this last few years we've been

2700
01:53:17,568 --> 01:53:19,360
Incredibly persecuted by these people

2701
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:20,896
High bar table top lawyers

2702
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:22,432
The country that never seen anything like

2703
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:23,200
It's in their lives

2704
01:53:23,712 --> 01:53:25,504
SOI just trust in God

2705
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:31,904
And I trusted you to support us and I appreciate you all so it does kind of like us at methasoft ad

2706
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:36,512
Idiocracy clip and just yelling about I was going to fight the New World Order

2707
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:43,168
I don't know man I found this this is this response to be I would be underwhelmed by this if I was

2708
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:46,240
Yeah I would find this to be

2709
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:49,824
You would need two more directly rebut the allegations against

2710
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:53,408
I would I would feel like this was a little little week

2711
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:54,688
Yeah

2712
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:59,552
I don't know it's not even really theatrical he's not is not

2713
01:53:59,808 --> 01:54:01,088
Full of bombast

2714
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:02,624
I just kind of

2715
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:06,720
The whet noodle

2716
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:11,840
Who's just like

2717
01:54:12,864 --> 01:54:19,008
I mean the moment he said my lawyers have never seen anything like this I was like every single law

2718
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:19,776
Lawyer on the

2719
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:20,544
Planet

2720
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,848
Had never seen anything like you Alex

2721
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:26,432
I want to see anything like you

2722
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:29,504
You have ruined the legal system for lawyer

2723
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:35,392
You and they love that it's just a perfect storm of narcissism enabling now

2724
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:37,952
The political situation where it crashed

2725
01:54:38,208 --> 01:54:39,488
Like he has he has

2726
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:40,512
We have some

2727
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:42,816
Ability whether it's in a loathsome

2728
01:54:43,328 --> 01:54:46,656
Area of expertise Allen

2729
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:49,728
Yeah I don't know

2730
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:52,032
Eyes f*****

2731
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:55,616
I'm just saying that over and over again thinking

2732
01:54:55,872 --> 01:55:01,248
Looks like there's no there's no thought that so many times in the past

2733
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:03,040
God I can't even say it

2734
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:09,440
If I say there's no way then I can't do it we don't we live in a world where that you can't say there

2735
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:15,072
There's no way this happened about this kind of kind of

2736
01:55:15,584 --> 01:55:18,400
Inasmuch as he didn't have to reveal a lot of

2737
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:21,984
Information that I bet you would not want to be public

2738
01:55:22,496 --> 01:55:23,776
The inner workings of

2739
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:27,104
How they made their news let's say

2740
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,920
Could be a lot more damaging to him than any Financial

2741
01:55:30,176 --> 01:55:31,456
Penalty

2742
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:34,528
So I do feel like there is that angle of his butt

2743
01:55:34,784 --> 01:55:36,064
At the same time

2744
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:36,832
That might

2745
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:39,648
Be me being too pessimistic

2746
01:55:39,904 --> 01:55:40,672
Because

2747
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:44,000
He still has the Connecticut case right still going right

2748
01:55:44,768 --> 01:55:45,280
Further

2749
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:51,936
As you get into the figuring out the damages and then through trials in in Texas

2750
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:54,240
If he does not cooperate

2751
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:57,312
They may Levy a penalty that is

2752
01:55:58,336 --> 01:56:01,408
Batman Beyond anybody's capability of thing

2753
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:04,480
There is a decent chance you could

2754
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:06,016
End up seeing is bankrupt in

2755
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:08,576
Yeah I don't know that that's the case but

2756
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:11,904
He has a financial incentive to cooperate

2757
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:18,304
In this phase of the trial because it he doesn't he's leaving it up to chance kind of what they believe

2758
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:20,864
How is a fitting punishment

2759
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:25,472
And I think that he kind of gives off the air of somebody who's pretty f****** rich

2760
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:30,592
Seems like it yeah no I mean the first thing I thought was as like

2761
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:33,408
Throw out 250 million

2762
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:35,456
Just say it

2763
01:56:35,712 --> 01:56:36,736
Just say it

2764
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:38,016
F****** do it

2765
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:39,040
Because

2766
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:45,440
That's what that means

2767
01:56:45,696 --> 01:56:51,840
I use 100 million dollar man out so sorry

2768
01:56:56,448 --> 01:57:02,592
Yeah I think that's probably going to be one of the more interesting things to follow is

2769
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:06,432
Is does his tune change in terms of cooperation when it comes down to like

2770
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:08,736
Now this is going to hit your bottom line a little bit

2771
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:10,784
You ever have an interest in this

2772
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:14,368
Not just office skating because eventually

2773
01:57:14,624 --> 01:57:16,416
A decision is going to be made with or without you

2774
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:17,184
Right right

2775
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:19,232
I mean it just seems like that's it

2776
01:57:19,488 --> 01:57:20,000
Too much

2777
01:57:20,256 --> 01:57:24,864
It's too much happening all at the same time for them not to come back with something

2778
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:25,632
That is

2779
01:57:26,144 --> 01:57:27,424
Massively punitive

2780
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:29,984
Because we're dealing with somebody who's

2781
01:57:30,496 --> 01:57:36,640
Everybody is saying that this is never f****** happened this is this is something taught in schools because it doesn't actor

2782
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:37,408
Really happened

2783
01:57:37,664 --> 01:57:40,992
So you got that already so your summary to here we are

2784
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:47,648
Default default judgment money should be like up to double just for that just for the extra

2785
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:48,672
3 years it took

2786
01:57:48,928 --> 01:57:49,696
Or whatever you know

2787
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:53,280
On top of that you've got this guy who is essentially

2788
01:57:53,792 --> 01:57:56,608
Created the blueprint by Which democracy is

2789
01:57:56,864 --> 01:58:00,448
Jamal I thought you can't punish him for that in this case you have to

2790
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:01,472
Keep it

2791
01:58:01,728 --> 01:58:02,752
What you can do

2792
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:06,080
Is make an example out of somebody who behaves the way he does

2793
01:58:06,848 --> 01:58:12,992
I mean I don't want Vengeance to come into it but I do think I do think that I mean straight up

2794
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:15,552
This should be a simple like hey

2795
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:21,952
F*** around and you're going to look at a 250 million dollar judgment

2796
01:58:22,208 --> 01:58:25,536
So either I think it's actually kind of loam

2797
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:27,840
Yeah well I just

2798
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:28,864
I don't know

2799
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:34,496
I'm fascinated to see where this all goes into like his actual show

2800
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:37,056
From after the. But

2801
01:58:37,312 --> 01:58:43,456
Because we had this conversation with Mark Bankston I didn't want to overburden the episode make it too long

2802
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:46,784
Tell Dad so far next episode we will get into

2803
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:49,600
Some of the actual show response but for now

2804
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:52,160
I'm I'm I'm just like

2805
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:57,792
I could see a number of directions this could go I know that he'll obviously try and use it to raise money

2806
01:58:58,048 --> 01:58:59,072
I probably have another money bomb

2807
01:59:02,912 --> 01:59:06,496
Mike Lindell

2808
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:07,520
I don't know

2809
01:59:07,776 --> 01:59:10,848
There could be all about the way Michael Mendel was just on a telephone

2810
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:12,128
On Jim Bakker Show

2811
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:15,200
He was just a guest on Jim Baker's Telethon

2812
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:21,856
What is it what is it about as very close are all of the same very close to covering that same s*** they're all the same

2813
01:59:22,112 --> 01:59:24,672
It doesn't matter where you go the far-right

2814
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:25,952
Is the same idea

2815
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:32,608
Will it back Jordan but until next time we website

2816
01:59:32,864 --> 01:59:39,008
