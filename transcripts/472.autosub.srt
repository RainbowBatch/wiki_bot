00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,063
August

53
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,439
This is a COO

54
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,743
I guess so.

55
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,071
Millie Weaver

56
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,423
We started the week

57
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:01,055
Wednesday we talked about Alex's immediate response

58
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,383
Who are the people who

59
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,479
It is weird

60
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,295
Images

61
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:15,135
Beginning middle and end if yeah it's very satisfying

62
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:21,279
Doesn't seem like there's more trouble trouble coming for sure

63
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,631
So to be done with it

64
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,447
Dead and buried with Alex's embarrassment

65
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,359
Burgits so much

66
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,527
It turned out

67
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,063
That's Alex

68
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,623
Terminated his working relationship

69
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:53,791
Well she was never employed

70
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,143
I don't know if

71
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,959
But I would assume it's true

72
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,007
Benzema a real reason to make that up

73
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
Then to challenge Alex

74
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:10,687
Steal a $10,000 bet weather

75
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:19,903
Then Caitlin another Infowars non-employee started

76
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,951
Good s*** on Melody that got into a fight

77
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,791
And Millie tweeted where we go 1

78
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,863
Berrington Levy

79
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:34,751
A bad week I do like her immediate

80
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,799
Spring crafts

81
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:40,127
That's the smartest thing I've ever seen her do

82
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,407
Tori and

83
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,711
Maybe even Burg Dark UFO

84
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,759
So I can quit her experts

85
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,575
But she's been hanging out with to make this film

86
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
Shadowgate

87
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,207
I think that they might have

88
00:06:54,463 --> 00:07:00,607
Help him steer her I think she's been aware we all go but we can always choose been working in forward

89
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,823
Her contract

90
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,383
Possibilities for the future

91
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:19,551

126
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,039
You can take that generosity

127
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:34,207
Make a documentary

128
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:39,071
Talk to a couple lose your contract

129
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:39,839

00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,119
Primary in Florida

131
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:45,983
I don't know just

132
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,567
That one way out the rail.

133
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,847
My brain just like

134
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,871
Delightful

135
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,967
So when start hero I should make one direction

136
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:04,927
One of the charges was burglary

137
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,231
I was just using the term because that's how the

138
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:12,607
Conversation was framed by

139
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,655
Charged with robbery

140
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:20,031
Much more fun word

141
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:20,799
Break-ins

142
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:27,711
Second-story man

143
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,759
Descend from somewhere

00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,855
Slippers language that

So on the 17th

146
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
Princess drop

147
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,167
Most people do not crap in the pool

148
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,703
Unless they're baby unless they're

149
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,727
We've learned

150
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,263
From Alex

151
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,823
This is not a social contract

152
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,127
Where there's a neighborhood pool

153
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,407
Everyone

154
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
Take a dump

155
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,735
That is a phenomenon

156
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,391
Oh-so

157
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:13,791
It is

158
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,559
Play music

159
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:22,495
I guess you can open

160
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:29,919
I give it to myself

161
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:34,015
Episode

162
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,063
It's just treading water just

163
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,111
Rambling about Satan

164
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,207
Under the wings of absolutely

165
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,959
You're missing the embryonic level

166
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,591
The big guy right there

167
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:08,319
I want

168
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,183
Shellbug

169
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,607
Explanation of the

170
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,887
The devil

171
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:28,799
Never seen those those movies about Catholic iconography

172
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,335
Are the order

173
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,759
Here's what the problem with it

174
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:44,159
He knows where evolved too far beyond him out wearing an embryonic stage

175
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
That's what

176
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,231
That's what Calabrese Peach preached from the pulpit

177
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:51,583
Do you say masks

178
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
It's always what he say

179
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,399
That's true

180
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:02,335
Yeah so the devil is jealous of human because we can build things of the devil

181
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,639
Citric acid to building is stopped

182
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,663
The Shakedown.

183
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,015
This is

184
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,111
Show about the dangers

185
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
Right

186
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,767
Is wonderful.

187
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:25,631
It is it's so much of this stuff

188
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:32,799
What's happening with Millie you as a real house on fire kind of issue on Monday

189
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:36,639
Didn't get to the situation until maybe a half hour into the show

190
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,711
And not that great

191
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,015
Let's get into the Millie Weaver situation

192
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
Vonage

193
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,599
Avomance

194
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,623
The tag place

195
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,975
I just go with what I really believe the true test

196
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,767
Now that implies

197
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,815
Wow did do that

198
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,911
That is basically what he say

199
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,727
Blindsided on Friday

200
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
Because

201
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,823
Elliott said she was right in front of the film

202
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,639
Saturday understand film hit behind

203
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
That's great

204
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,743
Your freelance

205
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,815
No

206
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,143
But I had one lady that's in the Philemon

207
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,079
Then it was put away

208
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,967
Coming into the show

209
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,503
This story is well told

210
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,063
Nelly Furtado

211
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,647
In the film

212
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,927
He's in Austin

213
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,303
Let me know when

214
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,607
Show me some clips of the film

215
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,167
We'll set you up and Studio

216
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,287
Well nothing happened on that Wednesday Thursday and then she calls me in the morning

217
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
I don't answer

218
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,015
And I called Aria

219
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,295
The producer

220
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,575
What's going on with this

221
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:26,975
Flowers

222
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,351
Millie Weaver arrested we're getting

223
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,143
What the hell

224
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,167
Ohio

225
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,471
SWAT team

226
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:41,311
Call Jesus Watson

227
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,759
Am I okay

228
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,343
Victor's for the film

229
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:54,879
In the film

230
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,695
Free

231
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,535
Millie doesn't own saying I don't get that I'm not distancing myself in the film

232
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,815
Don't know what's in it

233
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,119
Promoting

234
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,703
Trusting my guess I'll just nice guy

235
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:17,151
I had nothing to do with you

236
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,735
Okay okay

237
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
So

238
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:27,391
Why is he telling me this story like if he's old

239
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,415
When

240
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:33,023
No one is in trouble for anyting

241
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:39,423
But in Infowars that's that's fine have fun with that you don't fire somebody just repeating up their mom and info

242
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,447
Universe

243
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,751
Seem like it seems like

244
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:46,079
It seems like Millie was fired specifically for opportunist

245
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,663
Yeah

246
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:54,015
What is the you can't do that

247
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,087
Totally transparent

248
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:01,695
She got fired because Rodger Stones name was in that documentary

249
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,999
That's what happened

250
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,791
Rodger Stone said get rid of

251
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,887
Kylie Jenner

252
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,679
There's nothing else like this

253
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,543
Kinds of

254
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,431
Shady shenanigans on people it would not matter at all

255
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,711
He had

256
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,247
Temerity

257
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:29,343
2.2 finger towards Rodger Stone and that means you are out

258
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,623
Infowars

259
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,415
That seemed right up

260
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,231
But this this telling of the story I think is

261
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,071
Sounds fairly accurate

262
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,119
Because it's convoluted

263
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:41,887
Is boring

264
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,911
Incredibly boring

265
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,935
If it makes

266
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,471
Little sense

267
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,055
But it's kind of kind of how are you

268
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
Flyers

269
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,247
They're on my payroll.

270
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:03,903
Hey you know what this one went sideways

271
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,719
Easy when there are no consequences in any direction

272
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,607
I think the consequences are

273
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,399
Rodger looks bad

274
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,191
Does he

275
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,727
I don't know

276
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:26,687
So Alex is clear that he does not think of his arrest was in any way related

277
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,223
But

278
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,247
Really suspicious

279
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,551
Was to

280
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,855
Stop cuz it didn't stop the film

281
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,927
567 days before

282
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
Type something up

283
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,351
People thought something

284
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,495
Supposedly just going to release the film

285
00:18:55,615 --> 00:19:00,223
How the guys here in town waiting to come on my show and then I'm never sent the film

286
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,855
No technical problems will get a copy to you

287
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,391
Aamir Khan YouTube

288
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,439
And then to find out

289
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,511
Rogers

290
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,303
You know

291
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,887
Oh my God

292
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
Eleaf Vape

293
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,663
The internet to do research these folks themselves

294
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,455
Figure out what they think

295
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,783
Paul Watson

296
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,367
Or Millie weaver or

297
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,415
Very little feedback

298
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,975
As long as her putting material out and buy the new world order

299
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:48,095
And we get great content to fight the new world

300
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:54,751
Alarm people

301
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,567
As it happened here

302
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,359
It's an inch

303
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,687
Like if he was there if we were bar and he said you know

304
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:06,015
If somebody makes claims about you without any evidence that kind of makes

305
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,295
You feel bad

306
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,623
Lincolnton instant reaction of just like

307
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,439
Dare you

308
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:17,791
You said that you son of a

309
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
Think

310
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:24,703
About Arthur.

311
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:28,287
If you feel this way

312
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,591
Oh great apply that to other human be

313
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,175
No no cuz they're all global

314
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:41,087
Decided that

315
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
And

316
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,951
This is Monday

317
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,255
He's very clearly being like

318
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,791
Millie's f****** Shawn

319
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,095
People becoming famous and people

320
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,143
Interfacing nnnnn people

321
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:01,311
Has come in and they try to sabotage by try to do all this stuff you know it's like I want to embrace

322
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:06,687
I told you you're going to get it for the child kidnapping ring

323
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,135
100 plus thousand dollars a year I'm just a horrible person

324
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,168
Rodger Stone

325
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,592
I don't I don't know

326
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,688
John Monday

327
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:47,392
Two more days apparently

328
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:53,792
Call Buy HR representative father

329
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:57,120
Real familiar

330
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,216
Ha go away

331
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,592
Yep that's not good that's bad

332
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
Very funny

333
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,920
Rude pretty funny so funny

334
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,480
Pretty I just love how

335
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,040
Millie could never have imagined that

336
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,320
This was how it was going to

337
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,880
I think that's what I enjoy most

338
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:23,744
Probably should have no clue she had no clue that this was even a possibility

339
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:33,216
Surprising enough for a front

340
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,752
It really it really goes

341
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,520
The show some

342
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,848
But I think

343
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,200
Alex like

344
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,736
Billy was

345
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:51,136
The property for him you know if you're a team to the franchise player

346
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,440
The Infowars

347
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:57,536
Umbrella cuz you have people who are like

348
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,840
Who are there who are

349
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,144
Famous like Paul Joseph Watson

350
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,680
He's too famous

351
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,472
His face is recognizable

352
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:14,176
How many people like Savannah Hernandez Harrison Smith

353
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:18,016
No one really knows what they look like they could blend into a crowd pretend that there

354
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,808
You know not with Infowars

355
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,904
But those people aren't really all that

356
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,672
Good

357
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,976
Not good at getting attention

358
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,792
Conversely Paul Joseph Watson

359
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,816
Talking with people

360
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,120
Someone like Kaitlin Bennett

361
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,936
Israeli people

362
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:39,776
She also gets gallon everyone yells gun girl

363
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:44,128
Diaper protest

364
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,944
Yeah you're not going to be

365
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
They have those like

366
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:52,320
Problems with their ability to go out

367
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:55,392
Where's Millie had like almost like a real Center

368
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,928
Of that

369
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,208
She had

370
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,232
Her own

371
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:06,656
Popularity

372
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,424
Her fans

373
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,520
Over

374
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,568
Exposed as someone like Kaitlin Bennett

375
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,104
Did she could get away with

376
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,128
Doing some

377
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,152
What kinds of

378
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,456
No one knows that she should her pants

379
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:25,344
Before it shows up

380
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,416
She was somebody who had

381
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:31,488
I mean not a lot of talent potential

382
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
Usefulness

383
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,216
She was young 229 documentarian

384
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,008
She's somebody who Alex

385
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,800
Could have really been

386
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,360
And it seems like was very invested

387
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,944
Like brake is happening

388
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,016
Over what just appears to be

389
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,136
It shows me something it just

390
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,440
There is

391
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,584
Glaring

392
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,936
Imagine if if Alex

393
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,704
Just been like

394
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,728
Woohoo

395
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,056
I knew Russia

396
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,688
And then he's dead

397
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,968
Look it's that easy

398
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:33,952
Texas fired

399
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:37,280
Obviously I've never met Alex before

400
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,888
Decided to terminate our relationship

401
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,656
Juvenile

402
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:47,520
I don't know if it's as simple as just like she touch it on Rodger and Magic

403
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,336
I don't know it's very confusing

404
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,640
Here's the

405
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,736
I feel like in a normal environment

406
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:00,832
If you were working at a company as an on-air

407
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,624
And you

408
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,928
Beat up your mom I got arrested

409
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:06,976
I think it would be

410
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,048
Retired but that's a regular thing

411
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:16,192
It we're just Jada it was wearing the Infowars universe

412
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,728
For sure

413
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,288
And here's another thing

414
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,592
If you fund it a documentary

415
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:27,712
You probably get final Kyle there's that

416
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,480
No

417
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:33,856
When you fund a documentary you get a burlap bag

418
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:40,256
Some guy who's in it who you've never met

419
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:52,032
Largely Alex's phone

420
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:56,640
Mismanagement

421
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,176
Stop

422
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,480
Haha

423
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,784
Oh yeah

424
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,856
Better training of his people

425
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:11,488
Maybe maybe that's part of the problem

426
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:15,584
Liberty

427
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,192
That you're

428
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:23,264
End up having Hands-On time with Windows

429
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:34,784
Like I don't want to go to war with her already

430
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:40,928
I get the sense from listening to this episode

431
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,720
Is that she got setup

432
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,000
By Patrick Bergin

433
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,280
Bertie cetera

434
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,704
I got rushed out

435
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,520
Just felt weird

436
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,896
Agree

437
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,760
I think Millie is a good person

438
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,600
That's what you say before you find somebody for sure

439
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,416
Just imagine being 29 year-old mom

440
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,744
On YouTube

441
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,280
And she's beautiful and she smart

442
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,584
And there's always people that come around

443
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,632
How people

444
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:26,752
The other with the wrong crowd dancers I know what those people have told

445
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,920
Ignore the secret weapon

446
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,224
Check my business

447
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,136
Then something blows up

448
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,672
Assault

449
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:50,304
Fuqua.

450
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,840
Has Rodger Stone

451
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:57,472
Filmed

452
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,776
Stupid over all the films good though

453
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,568
I'll just go with it

454
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,616
What is a hat why

455
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,384
Alright

456
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,944
So is the general Vibe of what

457
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,992
Hillary smells like evidence

458
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,320
That she is a demon can we say that you call that's gossip

459
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:15,904
Which he's calling her gossip calling her demon with Avenue

460
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:22,304
Sources

461
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,888
Out of nowhere kind of assumed

462
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912
Politically

463
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,984
Connected person influence events

464
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:33,056
Perhaps even global-scale

465
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:35,872
Consider colluding with a

466
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,408
It's

467
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,456
It's an it's interesting

468
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,480
It is

469
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,016
I mean like

470
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,856
Obviously I have no f****** idea what's going on

471
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,392
With any of this

472
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,440
I'm going to take Alex's right

473
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
Millie

474
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,792
Tried to do her own thing

475
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,584
She relied on really

476
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,376
Dodgy a sources

477
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,704
It created something that runs

478
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,008
Counter to one of the main

479
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,544
Pillars of it

480
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,592
For five years

481
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,616
Donuts infallible

482
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,152
Right

483
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,176
I don't

484
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,480
I think I think he's right

485
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,272
I look at it differently

486
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,648
Of what appears to have happened

487
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,184
Is correct

488
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,488
Alex is about

489
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:29,376
Documentary arguing that stone is the Kingpin of stuff

490
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,168
Which makes sense

491
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:37,312
It's the way that you create the strawman

492
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:41,408
That you need for the argument of this is offensive

493
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,712
Reality

494
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,016
It's no big deal

495
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,576
I'd like to imagine

496
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,112
In a better world

497
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,136
She would have been fired

498
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,416
Just because it was so bad

499
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,984
Good buddy thanks for the program

500
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,008
Which is not

501
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,544
And then

502
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,104
Get to talkin a little bit more about Melly

503
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:16,224
I took away from this the implication that

504
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,272
Billy stabbed him in the back

505
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,832
But you have no water

506
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,136
Single Reed

507
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,696
Lockstep Rockefeller Foundation

508
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,000
Prison

509
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,560
Global police.

510
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,448
Industrialized world

511
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,984
Population collapse

512
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,080
You know what that means

513
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,176
Sitting here

514
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,992
Telling you this is going on you can verify it

515
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,320
Is change the subject to infighting

516
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,368
Just like the race rioting

517
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,928
And the divide and conquer their empire

518
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,464
Is divided and

519
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,232
Conquer people

520
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,560
Accident 1

521
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,448
Classically

522
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:12,800
That done. Over and over again by people we think are French people that weave

523
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:17,408
And finances at everything and good

524
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,760
It just makes

525
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,064
Myself

526
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,880
I wonder how are we turning out so many

527
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,416
Twisted screwed-up people

528
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:34,816
Or Justice or Freedom all they know is betrayal and lies he's obviously

529
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:41,216
Oh yeah well I think he's also including all of the Joshua

530
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:46,080
Yeah

531
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,480
He has to think that publicly

532
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,808
Do we keep getting

533
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,624
These types of people at Infowars

534
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,768
It's a mystery there's so many of those it almost appears that there is

535
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,048
Mynced

536
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:09,632
Crucial problem because business is rough

537
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:16,544
Alex gets off the topic of millionaire documentary and he's talking about how like

538
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,336
Hey man

539
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,384
I8

540
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,664
Generally hold

541
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,432
Back

542
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,712
From calling out

543
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,504
The globalist by name

544
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,552
But God told me to stop that

545
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,880
I know the most effective thing I do

546
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:35,488
Calling different globalist out by name and putting messages directly out to them

547
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,328
Conscious level

548
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,120
Payback

549
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:44,448
That's the one time you can really piss them off and then go ahead

550
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,496
Read legally

551
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,056
Suicidal things

552
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,336
Suicide

553
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,432
But needed Willie

554
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,992
Holy Spirit has told me to go ahead and attack

555
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,528
Literally the whole East

556
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,672
Skills

557
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,192
Put everybody on notice

558
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,568
Alright

559
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,592
My Wells.

560
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,248
Hellboy

561
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,016
That sounds right

562
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:30,784
Wow

563
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,088
That's a bummer

564
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,880
I did not realize that

565
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,160
This was sandbag

566
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:42,560
I didn't know the 25 years

567
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,312
I know that

568
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:58,944
Screaming at the top of my

569
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,064
About to die

570
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,464
Baby

571
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,792
Ridiculous I just can't I find that offensive

572
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,608
He says that he's got like

573
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:23,008
Call Lefty's globalist

574
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:23,776
Couple days

575
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:30,432
Is he using his enhanced oratory skills after

576
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,736
No

577
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,040
Almost the same if not worse okay

578
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,856
The next level

579
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,184
And about trying to hold back

580
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,768
It's just not going to flow so

581
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:48,864
Can probably have some starts but I'm just going to let him have it

582
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,400
And

583
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:56,288
You know that Ms a bomb detonate starting to build

584
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:02,432
Enforce

585
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,272
Because the whole thing's going next level

586
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,808
Animes going next level

587
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,112
And so I've been holding back

588
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,928
Ananda

589
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:21,120
It's like a storm that I'm not there yet you see it blowing across the water

590
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,936
Nature Sheila pretty start moving at once actually there

591
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,728
When does a break-in it's like

592
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,496
Now I know what

593
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:33,408
I think that Alex fired his lawyer or something maybe

594
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,200
What it what do you do stuff like

595
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:43,648
Right to fear getting people hurt all I think of is all the times for getting people

596
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:47,744
And what he says he's going to stop holding back

597
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,304
I want to start f****** behaving like I always

598
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,864
Like a complete

599
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,424
For hurting private citizens and

600
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,496
I don't know what else he could be talkin about

601
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,544
Start naming

602
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:04,128
Cool globalist sewer behind everything

603
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:12,064
Should come get even sloppy order

604
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:17,952
Just doesn't think about things that could get me in legal trouble

605
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:25,376
Got to go Full Speed Ahead

606
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,424
Are going to bankrupt me

607
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:33,824
Literally have nothing to lose by acting like I have something to lose

608
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,640
Borrowed time

609
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,432
Financial standpoint

610
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,992
Moving money around

611
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:45,344
Actually I've never met Millie Weaver

612
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,112
But

613
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:50,976
I think now is a good time to remember that next level

614
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,256
We've been holding back

615
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,536
Yeah

616
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,864
Next level

617
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,912
Talking more s***

618
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:01,216
I think next level would just include it

619
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:04,800
Picking on more obscure people like

620
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:14,016
All kinds of people

621
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,696
A freeway going on

622
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,720
That's what's going to happen

623
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:23,744
So

624
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,888
It's going to take is not great

625
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,704
It terms of him talking about

626
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,472
Situation

627
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:35,776
Into the 18th

628
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,896
Parking take the day off

629
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,200
It's on days like these that tell you really

630
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,992
Understand how transitory in

631
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,272
Short life is

632
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,856
T-Bone

633
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,792
The other guys dog that is okay

634
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:02,144
Good to be here when you today

635
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,728
Concussion

636
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:09,312
I think it was the wrong lesson from the movie whip

637
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,104
Cut that one

638
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,872
Man

639
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:13,664
Like

640
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,968
Just don't don't come in

641
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,040
It could be dangerous

642
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,832
Go to the doctor

643
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,856
Mild concussion

644
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:28,512
Not something you say on are you starting a broadcast like

645
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,584
Due to the T-bone

646
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,888
I heard that

647
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,216
T-Bone

648
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,496
Probably

649
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:45,152
So the night before Rodger withdrew his his his appeal

650
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,456
Nothing to do with it

651
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,992
Immediately released

652
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:49,760
Certainly.

653
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:56,928
Despite be possible minor concussion

654
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,696
You got to

655
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,280
For everything

656
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,816
Alright I got up

657
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:06,400
This morning. Slept last night

658
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,216
He just texted me at like 6 a.m.

659
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:13,568
The article that has stone cold tryst.com it's also at infowars.com

660
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:19,712
Why I decided to withdraw the appeal of my unjust conviction in the

661
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,992
Mueller Witch Hunt

662
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,784
Now we all know

663
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,576
But he could never get a fair hearing

664
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,928
The article he stayed up all night to write

665
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,280
You said lengthy which means you didn't read it

666
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,864
Add forgotten what they've done

667
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,400
What they've done to Stone

668
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,704
Call Ben

669
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,728
You didn't forget anything

670
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:51,456
And it's just a really boring interview

671
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:55,040
Basically just like I'm dropping this because

672
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:59,392
Hey my appeal won't be fair either that's good

673
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,672
That's good

674
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:07,072
I like that you know a lot of a lot of Freedom Fighters are really I really recognize

675
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,632
Guides for in the face of

676
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,168
Defeatable

677
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:11,936
Yes

678
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:12,960
They were like

679
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:18,080
Not worth it to much efforts I'm just so you know

680
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,872
Ships are rigged

681
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:23,712
And no I'm not giving refunds

682
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:30,368
Nelson Mandela

683
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:37,792
It's the garage or like really a brazen

684
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:41,888
Funny as hell these people

685
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,960
This hard with no consequences

686
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,496
Pretty remarkable

687
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,312
Once you find your Niche man you can really ride it out

688
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:52,895
I know that

689
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:58,527
I don't think I want to make a big deal out of it cuz it could just be saying we're like Rogers

690
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,295
Tired

691
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,343
But he seems

692
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,623
Not interested

693
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,391
At all

694
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,439
There is a very weird vibe

695
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:07,231
Between him and Alex

696
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,255
Frosty

697
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:11,071
It's not a good vibe

698
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,351
Final Cut

699
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,631
Give your employees

700
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:20,031
Hundreds of thousands of dollars you idiots are you put my name in the streets like that

701
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,567
I know he's not happy about that

702
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,895
Separated from Millie's

703
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,943
Rogers to be happy about that

704
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:32,063
Yeah I don't know I like I said I don't want to make a bigger deal out of it then

705
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:32,831
Then.

706
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,599
Disappearance

707
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,391
Not a good interview

708
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:37,951
It almost like there were a couple points where I was like

709
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,231
Rodger

710
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:42,815
Eden is he trying to flip it on Alex

711
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,631
I don't know I think it's just in my head

712
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:50,495
We got a lot of issues going on right now but post office sure love people are pretty

713
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,567
Concerned about Trump very clear overtures towards

714
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,687
And Alex has a

715
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:02,527
Way to spin this

716
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,551
Maybe

717
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,599
Play the next hour I'm not kidding

718
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:07,647
Trump stealing mailboxes

719
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:13,279
The mailboxes in the mail-in ballot

720
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:16,351
As a secret weapon there their hyping up the post office

721
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:21,983
We'll go out and get the balance and fill in granny

722
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,775
This is really all about

723
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,895
Not protecting the very vital service

724
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,711
This country to operate

725
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,247
Weather radar

726
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,807
Sleep or hail or

727
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:36,831
Is it bad junk

728
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:39,391
Mail delivery

729
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,927
I mean like

730
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,999
Anna Auto really basic level

731
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,047
The notion of

732
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,071
How much

733
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,119
Widespread damage

734
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:51,167
It would be done by

735
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:54,751
Like a capable post office

736
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:55,775
Like

737
00:43:56,543 --> 00:44:01,407
Exxon it

738
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:04,991
Astonishing

739
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,783
Even think about

740
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,575
That is so Essential Medical

741
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,415
One gigantic

742
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,439
It is

743
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,231
It's

744
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:18,047
It requires prosecution

745
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,143
But the fact that Alex is trying to put a break

746
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:26,495
Post office

747
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,031
Dismantle mailboxes

748
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,591
Whatever Alex haddish

749
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,247
Call

750
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,295
Call Santa

751
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,135
Is a theory about Alex's car accident from that morning

752
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:46,207
The calls are received in California

753
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:53,375
Thank you Alex I wanted to mention to you that there are parallels between the two thousand

754
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,911
16 into 2000

755
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:55,679
20

756
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,703
Election

757
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,751
Namely the fact

758
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:01,055
That you were T-Pain this morning and at

759
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,103
Rodger Stone was T-boned

760
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:07,199
That election but he didn't mention it this morning

761
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:10,271
And you know I know you mentioned about

762
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:15,135
A Gatorade but there's nothing that you could have done to prevent yourself from being T-boned

763
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:18,207
Real quick is the Gatorade is a Alex

764
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:20,511
Because he looked down and grabbed his

765
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,279
Is Gatorade

766
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,839

Pinhead on the driver

770
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:32,031
And you should call on Yahweh

771
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:35,359
And ask him in the name of Yeshua hamashiach to put

772
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:38,943
The ring around you and your family because you don't know how much

Because of this

779
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:03,775
Sorry a guy I hate that I'm firing up my non-employee over

780

Body call upon Yahweh

783

00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:22,463
Dr. Mercola

786
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,023

Big girl big supplement guy to G-Eazy

788
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:30,911
Disaster

789
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:33,471
Nihilism

790
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:37,567
And stuff

791
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,359
But I do want to give

792
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,151

Really good

796

The pro in

797
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,295
Promotion

798
00:46:54,207 --> 00:47:00,351
Information

799
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,471
Read it

800
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:09,311
Read the message to individuals like the churches

801
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:15,711
Members of Black station

802
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,015

Million views at minimum

804
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:39,775
Tell Heather perspective that is a little more because of my position

805
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:42,335
Only reason.

806
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:46,431
Congratulations

807
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:53,855
Jojo

808
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:54,623
Now there's that

809
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:57,951
Kind of nuts

810
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,743
We'll see if Alex's

811
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:04,607
Augusta tomorrow I wouldn't be too surprised by that but I was very surprised

812
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,911
If he ends up promoting

813
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,447
Someone else

814
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:10,239
Very very surprised

815
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,799
Listen I'm going to take my time

816
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,335
To make someone else

817
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,639
Money doesn't sound

818
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,687
No probably not

819
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,295
Yeah that's like

820
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:25,855
You get booked on a show and your friends are like

821
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:29,695
Give me on that show I don't book that John 100%

822
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:33,791
Also dr. Marco maybe a little bit

823
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:37,375
Not up-to-date on Alex's

824
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,167
Shadowgate situation

825
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:45,823
Congratulations on 190 what are you reporters put together surveillance gate that was a really brilliant

826
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:52,223
Yama color

827
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,343
Toothache

828
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:02,975
No you didn't call Chad not surveillance

829
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,535
If you had you would know

830
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,583
We're angry at each other

831
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:12,703
Didn't go didn't go great for me Mercola got caught in a lie

832
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:18,335
DD Rambles for a bit after response that

833
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:26,015
Boring interview dr. Mercola

834
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,551
Snooze

835
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,879
So we come in on the 19th all right

836
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:36,255
On the previous night on Tuesday was that Laura Loomer won her

837
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,535
Primary

838
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:47,775
The good news is there's a mass Awakening happening resistance is intensifying not just trim around the world and Laura Loomer

839
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:55,711
More votes basically than the other two candidates combined

840
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,735
Unbelievable

841
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,039
Great going Laura

842
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:06,463
Laura Loomer quite a bit on this podcast

843
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,743
And

844
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,767
America

845
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,303
I think that my feelings

846
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,839
Should be pretty clear

847
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:12,863
Oh yeah

848
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:19,263
I think that it's an embarrassment any political party that she could make it through a primary system

849
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,311
Primary

850
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:25,663
I think it's a real indictment of the state of politics

851
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:29,503
She's a guaranteed win in the

852
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,039
The first

853
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,831
In the in the general election

854
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,903
I think that Frankie has a pretty good chance

855
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:36,671
Of winning

856
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,719
Election

857
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:39,743
I think the

858
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,791
With the right messaging

859
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,863
It would be tremendously easy you would help

860
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:46,911
You would hope

861
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:51,263
I bet if it might if I was in like a debate

862
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,799
And I was just like

863
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:54,335
Mike Kennedy wants to

864
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,871
Kill all Muslims

865
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:08,671
To genocide I want no genocide I feel like a rational

866
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,695
People pick me

867
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:15,071
Record of her doing incredibly embarrassing thing

868
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,375
Infowars

869
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,655
Good for you

870
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,447
Lesbian office probably

871
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:23,007
I think I think

872
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,055
Any competent

873
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,847
General election strategy

874
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,383
I will be effective

875
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:31,711
Against what she has to bring which is right

876
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:35,039
Publicity stunts

877
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,319
Bigotry

878
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,695
They certainly have

879
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:44,767
Approach

880
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:49,887
I don't think so I mean

881
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,423
Really bad at 4

882
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:52,959
But I I don't

883
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:59,359
Erwin primary as like he's going to win this isn't General

884
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,127
Exandria winning the

885
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:12,415
It's not the same thing

886
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,207
Is at least a competitive Alexa

887
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:14,975
Yeah yeah

888
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:16,767
Who in the general app

889
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,839
Everything's that I know about Laura Loomer

890
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:24,959
I just don't think it's going to work

891
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:31,359
20% for Steve Bannon

892
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:34,687
Yes

893
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:41,087
Patience for his appeal but is now dropped

894
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:47,487
Millie was raising funds after she got arrested

895
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,279
Assumption

896
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:55,679
Something to do with her dangerous documentary 170,000 dollars donated to the

897
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:56,703
Right

898
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:58,495
Steve Bannon

899
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:04,895
Fraud committed fraud all the time

900
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:14,111
A really simple

901
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:16,159
Look at this person

902
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:20,255
She used to date a guy named Baked Alaska

903
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:22,815
Anyway

904
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:29,215
Celebration party was

905
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:36,127
No I wish you could have been there

906
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:38,431
The witness that because we truly did

907
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,711
Cancel culture

908
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,783
Everybody who has been cancelled from

909
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:43,551
By myself

910
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:46,367
Milo yiannopoulos Rodger Stone

911
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,927
And even Faith Goldy they were all there

912
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,207
On stage

913
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:53,535
Really it was just a big middle finger to the

914
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:58,399
Silicon Valley

915
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,167
Haha

916
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:02,495
That's fun I mean if that's your definition of conservative

917
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:05,311
You think less of conservatives than I do

918
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,847
Here's my ears my ad

919
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:09,407
I'm running against Laura

920
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,943
Safe gold

921
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:17,343
At the celebration party

922
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,391
DC

923
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:21,439
See look at it

924
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:25,023
Just be in front of it

925
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:29,375
The board to keep in mind

926
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,935
Laura Loomer has no interest in governing

927
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:36,543
She has no interest in being in politics for the sake of

928
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:42,943
She doesn't want to read bills and like points like minutiae

929
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,479
Within the halls of Congress

930
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:48,831
She doesn't want to do this just give a f*** about those things they're going to put her on the appropriation

931
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:51,391
He committed to have real power

932
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:53,183
This is really what this is all about

933
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,975
Single-handedly

934
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:57,279
As the Republican nominee for Florida 21st

935
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,071
Presented

936
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,887
Do the doj

937
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,471
Prosecute

938
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,751
Mark Zuckerberg

939
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,543
For committing perjury because now

940
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:12,383
They are actually guilty of committing election interference because they are

941
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,711
Dragonsong District

942
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:17,247
Florida 21

943
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,807
You and I both know

944
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:22,879
They are not

945
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:25,951
Center political

946
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:28,767
First of all that statement was from

947
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:32,863
The past

948
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:37,727
This is this is basically what the game

949
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,495
Spycakes

950
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:43,615
Essentially on subway to get back on Twitter

951
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:46,687
AMC

952
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:50,783
Her getting into the the race and winning the primary she gets

953
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:53,087
Grandstand and make this whole

954
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:55,135
This is a criminal action that use

955
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,159
Press conservative

956
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:58,719
It's just a facilitation and continuation

957
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:05,119
Of the online culture War nonsense.

958
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,655
Handcuffing herself

959
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:10,239
The doors

960
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,007
Specific

961
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:13,311
Pics of a farming build

962
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,871
She really wants to make sure the people know

963
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:17,407
What zone is

964
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,943
Available in the

965
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:25,599
Districts in Florida she is going to go to bat for her constituents of which she knows

966
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:27,903
Get the f*** out

967
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:35,071
Alex has no social media

968
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:36,863
Give me

969
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:37,631
Just

970
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:39,423
Oh my God it's

971
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,191
Beautiful

972
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:43,775
It's beautiful outside

973
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:48,383
Now that is actually in the general there will be a lot of those

974
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:52,735
Nefarious

975
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,015
Rodger

976
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,039
Floating around

977
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:59,391
Because of the potential that they can have to use her as a condom

978
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:02,975
Great piece on her and The New Yorker

979
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:05,791
Embedded with her for a while and

980
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:09,631
Cool boy that's who I want representing me and Congress

981
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:16,543
Corazon forbidden Alex

982
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,407
Full speed

983
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:23,455
Aurora train

984
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:28,063
Which takes up most of the rest of the show just like

985
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:29,855
I just don't care

986
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,415
Oh f*** off

987
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,463
Coming up

988
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,279
Graphic novel

989
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,119
Believable

990
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:44,959
Really graphic novel I don't understand what it is

991
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,239
Apparently there's like a book

992
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:48,287
But the pages have videos or something

993
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:52,639
I don't know maybe could Digital Book I don't understand love it I don't care Alex

994
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:58,015
Really fully explain it all that well

995
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:03,391
I don't know I don't care

996
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:07,231
Things to say

997
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:10,559
Business

998
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:11,839
He's not a psycho

999
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:15,679
You said he was a psychic

1000
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:16,959
But he's not like

1001
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:20,543
He has is from reading all right

1002
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:21,823
You know I'm not like

1003
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,615
John the Revelator

1004
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,639
Atmos having a vision

1005
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,687
The godson angel now

1006
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:28,479
I know I'm

1007
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,759
Reading

1008
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,063
Applications

1009
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:37,183
Put out by the John Birch Society and others

1010
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:38,719
So you are

1011
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:43,583
I didn't believe so I went

1012
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,631
Helmut Schmidt the German Chancellor

1013
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:49,215
Flint

1014
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,407
And I went and got the book

1015
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:02,015
Where they admitted all of it

1016
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:04,319
Said man this is horrible

1017
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:07,903
Here's Alex admitting that he has not read Carroll Quigley

1018
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:11,999
Infowarsstore.com in the tragedy and Howe

1019
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:14,559
That's an 11:00 Pages or so

1020
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:16,607
Rossion William gaspers

1021
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,655
Bookshelf on Skype

1022
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,447
Watching us on TV

1023
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:24,287
Where the Georgetown political science Professor Bill Clinton

1024
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,567
Louis centeno

1025
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:30,175
Admits they control liberalism can

1026
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,967
Conservatism fascism

1027
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:36,319
And the trilateral commission and all of it is meant to bring in World corporate government

1028
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:40,159
And it's only meant to look like there's the illusion of choice

1029
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:42,207
In politics I'm paraphrasing quotes

1030
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:45,791
This book and I've actually read almost the whole thing

1031
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:48,863
I said I probably read 800 pages of it over the years

1032
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:51,935
Doesn't mean I skip over some of the Mortal factoid

1033
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,471
Inside baseball stuff

1034
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:59,871
So Alex didn't get this

1035
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:06,271
All these books

1036
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:09,599
Maybe he just sort of skimmed of those books and read the

1037
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,879
Society materials and then

1038
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:12,415
Knows that you sound

1039
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,439
Like a lunatic

1040
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,999
If you're a John Bircher in 2020

1041
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:21,375
Protect

1042
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:28,543
John Bircher

1043
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:31,871
All kinds of Christian identity non-central then you end up with Alec

1044
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,431
I think the libraries

1045
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:36,991
Kenwood EX

1046
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:41,087
You do not like a wholly

1047
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:42,879
Grounded is up

1048
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:48,255
Interesting experiment

1049
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,815
Ban Alex from libraries

1050
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:51,839
And see if he cares

1051
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,167
Do you love me from things

1052
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,447
Don't tell him he's

1053
01:00:56,959 --> 01:01:00,287
Do you have to tell him cuz he has to fight against it

1054
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:01,823
Tell him

1055
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:02,847
Alright

1056
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,639
And see if he find out

1057
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:07,711
Cuz if he finds out naturally can go crazy

1058
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:13,087
Here's an interesting way to do this I don't know how we would logistically

1059
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:14,879
We could tell Alex

1060
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,415
It's that we've got a bunch of witches

1061
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:20,255
Kids together cast a spell that makes him unable to read

1062
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:24,351
Came to prove us wrong you would have to read

1063
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:30,239
This might be

1064
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:33,055
The best reverse psychology we can do

1065
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:39,199
Alex is not ready because

1066
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,735
He hasn't

1067
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:44,319
Yeah I just think he said it was lengthy

1068
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,087
It's not like

1069
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,391
I'm not

1070
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:53,791
Begrudging Alex for not reading tragedy and hope that is his choice

1071
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,071
You want it and not reading it

1072
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,863
Is my complaint kind of

1073
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:03,007
Phoenicia

1074
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:05,823
Control

1075
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,127
I have to take my videos down

1076
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:24,255
Is trying to figure out

1077
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:26,559
But but but they don't have any other knowledge

1078
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,351
Yeah

1079
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:30,911
Kentucky shark

1080
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:31,935
And he has been there

1081
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:36,287
Coast to Coast

1082
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:45,759
You talking about the original Hanna-Barbera cuz it's a very bizarre reference if you're talkin about

1083
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:49,855
Coast to coast is also a bizarre reference no matter what

1084
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,671
And it doesn't land

1085
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,439
That's not good

1086
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:58,559
31 last clip year in cuz I don't care about listening to David Icke talk about his

1087
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:02,655
Yuval is a possession

1088
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:07,519
Says this

1089
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:13,663
About to BBC there

1090
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:15,455
Satan things when I was younger

1091
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:22,367
Dislike really Disturbed

1092
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:26,719
Did you ever see what I've seen I do it on TV but I saw some growing up in Dallas

1093
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:28,255
When will say this when they make that

1094
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:35,935
Phases or the

1095
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:39,263
Pacers made by Arc or the faces made by the Hillary

1096
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,543
Call Sharkey now

1097
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,847
Newsom

1098
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:50,783
Obscene

1099
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,599
Strange things

1100
01:03:56,671 --> 01:04:00,767
That's a great save

1101
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:01,791
Can do

1102
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,071
Because

1103
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:09,471
Stupid question

1104
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:16,639
I'm not going to get it

1105
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:23,039
Alex is just trying to rationalize why he can call whoever you want to be

1106
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:31,231
The face that only demons can make humans can't copy it

1107
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:32,511
4 Bonanza

1108
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:34,815
Who is also a vampire hunter

1109
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:38,399
And he's like I kill all these vampires how do you know

1110
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:52,479
A joke

1111
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:56,319
Monica

1112
01:04:57,087 --> 01:05:00,159
I've seen a lot of faces on a lot of people

1113
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:02,463
Trying to think of other like classic

1114
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:04,511
People who had like soda

1115
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:10,399
The motivations Coronavirus

1116
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:15,007
Robin Williams died

1117
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:17,823
The demon

1118
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,615
Yeah there's a lot a lot of folks

1119
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,663
Features

1120
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:26,527
There's some voices but only demon

1121
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:30,111
Yelp

1122
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:43,679
Humans cannot die there a verb

1123
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:47,263
Just drove right into the white papers

1124
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:52,639
Episode has a lot going on for it

1125
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,943
We've entered back

1126
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,223
Into info

1127
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:57,247
Yeah

1128
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,015
By this

1129
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:01,343
Like the weekend was f****** exciting as hell

1130
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,111
MN

1131
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,903
It just fell apart

1132
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,951
Alex decided to reject

1133
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:08,767
What was going on with Nelly

1134
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:15,167
Behind-the-scenes clearly must have been communicating with her at all and the working relationship

1135
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,215
Wednesday

1136
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:21,567
He's not bringing it up on the show and pretend like Shadow gate doesn't exist

1137
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:26,431
Like Tuesday and Wednesday showed Rodger defense

1138
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:30,271
For his like a boil

1139
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,039
It's important

1140
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:33,855
To drop stupid interview with Mercola

1141
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,159
It just feels like

1142
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:44,095
I find I found that to be disappointing I found it to be an insult

1143
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:47,935
You are a really cooking with gas when you were

1144
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:51,519
Being mad about what I'm saying

1145
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:54,335
I'm really disappointed on his decision.

1146
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,383
I think he has to

1147
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:01,503
Getting into the mud with these people is not a good idea

1148
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:03,039
Yeah he's making the right

1149
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:05,087
I'm disappointed because

1150
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,159
My life would be infinitely better if he was like

1151
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,695
This is where we die

1152
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:12,255
Hill is what's going down

1153
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,791
Millie Weaver

1154
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:17,631
Tooth and Claw either bergey goes down arrivals

1155
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:23,263
To get a deal play more with a tie

1156
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:28,383
Exact

1157
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:31,455
Most of these other people look at Matt gaetz

1158
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,015
This f******

1159
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:34,783

No good this is going to be a mess

1162
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:40,159
I don't want to be involved

1163
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:44,255
I just gave you and I think I'm going to do a dime

1164
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,791
That's what I look at you think

1165
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:52,191
You're going to if I talk to you you don't get the game War place

1166
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,471
Exactly

1167
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:07,807
You can play. It's like Michael Madsen in

1168
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:11,391
For the High Senior a psychopath wildcard

1169
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,415
And I don't want nothing

1170
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,951
Do with Utah panniers off

1171
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:20,351
That's what that's not even helped us steel chip what's going to happen is you are going to

1172
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:26,751
I don't know your game

1173
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:29,311
Here's here's what I would say

1174
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,871
You got to know when to drop your appeal

1175
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:35,455
And it's the day before it's revealed that you did even worse

1176
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:39,039
And she doesn't appeal

1177
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:43,903
He's going to think know we actually can win this

1178
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:47,231
Probably doesn't want

1179
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:48,767
To be involved with

1180
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,071
Ideologue

1181
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:53,887

01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,935
Really deeply committed

1183
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:59,263
He's running scams

1184
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:03,871
These people are running like propaganda Grit

1185
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:06,687
And there are some things that you can feel passionate about

1186
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:07,711
Got to come first

1187
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,527
For people like him

1188
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:13,343
Someone like patricksburg clearly

1189
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:15,135
A zealot for his own

1190
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,415
Pet conspiracy

1191
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:20,767

1193
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:28,447
Get like and I think that's even more I think the Rodger thing is probably more

1194
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:30,751
Cover for that

1195
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:34,591

1197
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,503
I mean

1198
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,063
The extent of it they could be taken as bad as like

1199
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:49,439
Rodger didn't realize that his association with the Trump campaign will be used against the Trump

1200
01:09:56,351 --> 01:10:00,959
Crimes that could possibly imagine

1201
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:04,287
I mean

1202
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:07,359
I'm just bored

1203
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:10,687

01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:32,447
I don't like the mean but life comes at you fast I'm kind of goddamn sometimes it works

1209
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:38,847
The span of a couple days from shadowgate is the Gate of all gays

1210
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:44,735
I don't know about it I'm going back to Treading Water talking about the devil and covid

01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:53,183
But it does also go to show

1213
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:54,207
Can revert

1214
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:57,023
To this normalcy

1215
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:04,959

Beautiful pro wrestling Bookers

Something else entirely

1219
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:16,991
We'll see what happens

1220
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:20,063

Just like that that's how you get into a Gorilla Monsoon

1269
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:12,447

Oral

1274
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:22,687
Thought

1275
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:29,855
It's kind of what you been doing

1276
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:31,135

No that's it that's very insightful

1294
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:31,295
The only thing that's different about this then like

1295
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:33,087
Classic oral tradition

1296
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:34,623
Is that like

1297
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:36,671
In a classical

1298
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:38,207
Oral tradition

1299
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:42,815
Has to do with the same Stories being told over and over again

1300
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:43,583
Preserve that

1301
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:49,471
Will to preserve them and then they change organically over the over the telling of it

01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,519
Yeah it's

1304
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:56,127
If we were telling the same story about Leos

1305
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:59,199
But I guess that's the kind of

1306
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:07,391
Yeah yeah I guess so I mean he committed 911

1307
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:10,719
He's an important historical

1308
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,999

1330
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:05,759
A couple days ago

1331
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:07,295

1332
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,575

Mystic academic shrimp

1336
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:14,463
Anybody want

1337
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,231
More

1338
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:15,999
About that

1339
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:18,047
Check me out there

1340
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,215
I love the show

1341
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:25,983
So much

1342
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:27,263
Thank you

1343
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:32,639
Go to Wrigley Field and

1344
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:39,039
To Wrigley Field but never sober

1345
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:46,207
I've never recommended anyone go so I don't know how much I would have enjoyed it if I was sober

1346
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,231
Bud

1347
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:49,791
You just don't understand the beauty of

1348
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:50,559
The field

1349
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:56,703
The grass I guess I was sober when I came in

1350
01:16:56,959 --> 01:17:00,543
But I also was like

1351
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,823
And

1352
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:02,591
I was making

1353
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:04,895
Because the

1354
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:07,711
The Cubs song sucks

1355
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:09,503
Stupid

1356
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,783
Who are the playoff game

1357
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,063
Remember what year

1358
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:14,623
2003

1359
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:17,183
Yeah really really drunk

1360
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:19,231
By the end of it I was

1361
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:23,839
Singing now you understand

1362
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,655
That is how everyone watches

1363
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:29,471
I got really drunk and evict

1364
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:31,775
Caught up in the feeling of like being a

1365
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:32,543
Krowd

1366
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:36,383
An experienced at Wrigley in a way that I haven't really experienced

1367
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:38,687
Sporting event

1368
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:46,111
Powerful is one of the most powerful experiences that you can experience

1369
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:49,695
Big people are really into it

1370
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:54,559
A long time

1371
01:17:58,143 --> 01:17:58,655

1372
01:17:59,167 --> 01:17:59,679

Do do more out of

1380
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:20,415
That's a good point I need to rededicate myself to the other contacts dropped

1381
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:28,607
I think Alex used to say more out of context funny

1382
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:32,447
Liberty National

Cher merchandise

1391

Enough

1392
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:49,599
Just want to let you know

1393
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:50,623
Stanton Optical

1394
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:52,415
I cut it up into little strip

1395
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:53,951
I put those strips

Anthem

1402
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:09,055
I'm sleeping between 4 to 12 hours a night at

1403
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:10,847
I can't recommend

1404
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:11,615
Enough

1405
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:12,639
Antenna

1406
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:15,199
Secondly I have another really important

1407
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:15,967
Question

1408
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:18,783
Have you listen to Taylor Swift

1409
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,575
New album and what do you think

1410
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:22,367
Alright that's it

1411
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:28,767
Have a great day guys I really appreciate the show

1412
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:31,839
I don't know I have not listened to the new Taylor Swift

1413
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,911
Taylor Swift is

1414
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:37,471
Sort of blindspot

1415
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:39,519
For me in terms of like a

1416
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:44,895
Pop I don't know why I don't just like her at all I certainly

1417
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:48,479
Like there was there was a stretch where Blank Space

1418
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:52,831
Yeah blood was pretty good like I liked a couple of those singles

1419
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:57,695
But for some reason I never ended up listening to the album's in the same way that like

1420
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:01,535
Like cash Carly Rae Jepsen

1421
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:04,607
I got me

1422
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:05,631
No

1423
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:13,311
I don't have anything against

1424
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:16,640
The problem was I was introduced her as a but as the

1425
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:17,664
Punch line to a joke

1426
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:21,504
And I hate when the Kanye

1427
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,552
Oh no I guess that is where I was introduced

1428
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:25,088
Well

1429
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:28,416
I guess I was on Kanye's side so wrong

1430
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,440
No I was totally right

1431
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:33,536
I was right Beyonce deserve that

1432
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:40,192
You can you can agree that maybe Beyonce should have one and still not be on his side for

1433
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:46,592
Musical about people treating each other with respect get that he's a real

1434
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:52,736
For me for you

1435
01:20:56,576 --> 01:21:02,720
If I was having any kind of story

1436
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:03,744
Songs early on

1437
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,096
Country Tianjin

1438
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:11,424
But I remembered enjoying stuff like

1439
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:17,824
She wears short skirts I wear

1440
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,104
And then I

1441
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,896
Why don't want to turn into the guy was like

1442
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:22,176
Actually Taylor Swift

1443
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:22,944
Any good I don't want

1444
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:34,208
I bet there's a lot of really good stuff

1445
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:36,256
A catalog that I've just

1446
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,792
Missed because of like

1447
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:41,376
I don't know I don't know why I must

1448
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:44,448
No whenever I don't have to have a take on it

1449
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:46,240
Twenty years from now I'm sure I'll love it

1450
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:47,008
