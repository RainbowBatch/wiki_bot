Anime

17
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,168

19
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:52,640
Do the mile run

00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,016
Central racism

32
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,576
I thought that was all silly stuff

33
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,880

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,864

00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:04,064

56
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,768
Unlike people

57
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:26,751

Sick all day yesterday and

66
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:26,143
That I had a slight or a light bungling

67
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,423
Of the schedule

68
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:32,287
In California for the better part of this

69
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:41,503
2013 episodes in a week and Wacky Wednesday possibilities were all dead ends

70
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,343
Alex's in California

71
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:53,023
And that means that I got to be ready to do that episode at the drop of a hat or a fireman

72
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:59,423
And that situation has guys in football field

73
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:05,823
Running in place when you do a push-up

74
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,895
Do ghost live with Alex man I got to drop a

00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,919

Yeah

77
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,039
So by the time Alex got back

78
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,855
From California it was already

79
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:22,207
Cutting it real tight for us to be able to slip out

80
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,279
And get this out

81
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:34,239
The next best thing to Alex

82
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,031

This is insanity

118
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:11,935
I have a couple thoughts about that

119
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,215
Jessica

120
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:17,567
The first is even as a racist impression this is bad

121
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
Do the quality

122
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:24,223

Ridiculously desperate Ploy for attention

Maybe yeah yeah I mean

140
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,639
I mean what what it what is more Punk

141
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,919
In 2019

142
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:05,855
Great so I was listening to this on audio

143
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:12,255
A video that Alex in Disguise or something like that

144
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,631
Go for some kind of like a defensive

145
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,423
Right

146
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:25,567
Trudeau's Styles radar weather

147
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
No

148
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,663
Did you wear the hat

149
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,199
Okie dokie

150
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
However

151
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:38,367
It is anime

152
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,903
Why not

153
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,927
Why not

154
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,487
Didn't have wings

155
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:49,887
I think so I can't confirm or deny whether it had wings but I can't

156
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,447
This is all just a really sad.

157
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,983
Getting people

158
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:59,871
It's just racism

159
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,407
Specifically

160
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,783
I can't see it any other lines other than like

161
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:13,695
Hey it's cool now

162
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,255
Some blowback of attention that I get from

163
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,815
Maybe translate into

164
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,911
Yeah and he's going to try and call it a day

165
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,447
Right right

166
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,519
Clearly clearly

167
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,055
Parody

168
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
Yeah yeah

169
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,087
. that is

170
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,327
I'm not sure but it's

171
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:59,007
As a sign whenever you perform a piece of satire

172
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:02,079
That was that. I know that you

173
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:06,175
Probably pick that was actually it was not

174
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,783
Proposal

175
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:17,183
Jonathan Swift went through a long diatribe of why and how people should react to it

176
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,743
And then he said that he did actually do want

177
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,559
It's the mark of great

178
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,887
Commentary great satire when you have to like

179
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,983
New jerk make sure people know every f****** around here

180
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:33,055
Because otherwise it's going to look really f***** up

181
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,407
I think this is a really lame and I think

182
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
It's really interesting

183
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,503
Kicks off because I feel like every

184
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,831
Desperate Ploy for attention

185
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,391
Much like having Eddie Bravo

186
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,511
I could get some of their

187
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
InFocus

188
00:13:54,047 --> 00:14:00,191
Go on Rogan while he was in California

189
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
Bigger

190
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,983
Monroe County

191
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:08,127
And I can't imagine I have no idea what he's presenting

192
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,919
Being bigger is

193
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,967
Go on

194
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:18,111
I don't know, we are not very thorough G family that would be amazing

195
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,159
Read him on

196
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,743
Marin

197
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
5 years

198
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,679
8

199
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
It's somehow

200
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,239
More offense

201
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,031
How pathetic

202
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,335
You know like

203
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,639
It's not you know it's

204
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,943
That is terrible

205
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
And it's awful

206
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
Right but

207
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
Because it

208
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,575
It's so desperately

209
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
Fake like it's not you

210
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
He's not eating

211
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,695
It's just such b*******

212
00:14:54,463 --> 00:15:00,095
Makes me feel really sad

213
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:05,727
No

214
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,007
Minecraft

215
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:10,079
Some kind of satire

216
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:14,687
I think that's awful.

217
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,271
A bummer

218
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,063
Absolutely

219
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,391
That's that's like how I would feel with

220
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,183
In a perfect world like that

221
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,463
The last living race

222
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,511
Feeling you know where you're like

223
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,583
Really dude

224
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,655
So weird Twilight Zone episode

225
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,423
Racist

226
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:46,431
Episode of one of those Disco.

227
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,855
So you talking about

228
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,183
His equally off

229
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:02,815
4000 +

230
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,703
Set that is

231
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
Exactly what he was

232
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,567
Literally no way for Alex to have the information

233
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,871
Deciding

234
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,151
Statistics on that access

235
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:55,295
Immigration status

236
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,879
The only thing basing this on is like super unreliable

237
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,695
He's most likely getting this information from

238
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,279
Speech that Trump gave earlier this year where he planted in the past

239
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,095
2 years I sat arrested

240
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,143
Criminal records included 4000

241
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,703
Quotes violence killing

242
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,727
Yeah he's

243
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:20,383
Alex is claiming this as a statistic of crimes per year by a certain population

244
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,943
Even if words were correct

245
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,503
He's just saying the people taken in by Tyson

246
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,063
Committed that many crimes total

247
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,111
It could be over a span of 30 years

248
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,135
No f****** idea

249
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:35,743
Another similar claim Trump made last year was

250
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,279
Thousand America

251
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,815
Cancel been killed by immigrants

252
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
Weather

253
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:45,215
PolitiFact most likely got this from a noted

254
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,615
Yeah he's

255
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:57,503
Yeah that's on Brandt the larger problem is that consist

256
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,295
Studies have shown the Immigrant population

257
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,831
Regardless of documentation

258
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,903
Status are less likely to commit crimes

259
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,231
Alex knows that

260
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,255
She can even remember

261
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,535
Side of Katy

262
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,983
In the past it's not worth

263
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:22,847
That deeply again to remind everyone that was accidentally

264
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,407
We fired a gun in the bullet ricocheted off the ground

265
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,687
Ultimately hitting

266
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:31,551
He didn't Murder In Cold Blood until what happened in absolutely tragedy

267
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,879
The murderer is literally only useful to escalate

268
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
Demonization of

269
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,951
That's literally the only reason to go

270
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,023
Yeah absolutely that's that's not the problem

271
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:48,447
Jose Garcia Zarate

272
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,519
And he was at his trial because it was clear with an axe

273
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:55,359
He was however charged with being a felon in possession of a gun

274
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,407
This is a charge that was a

275
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,175
Yosemite

276
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,711
The decision came down on that

277
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,247
Late that that was overturned

278
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,295
The reason that convicted of

279
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,343
Conviction of a gun charges overturned

280
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,367
Was because his attorney

281
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:10,207
Successfully argued that he didn't know that the thing he was picking up was

282
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:10,975
Is a gun

283
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,535
He found a gun wrapped in a rag picked it up

284
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,839
And it fired and he immediately dropped it

285
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,399
He wasn't knowingly in possession of the gun

286
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:22,495
An appeals court found that the prior trials judged

287
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:27,359
Construction on the legal standards for dealing with what's known as momentary possession

288
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
Yeah

289
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:32,479
So this is the reality that Alex is yelling about

290
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,271
Which is bad

291
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,319
He answered turn to an appeal to emotion

292
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,391
Word immigrant killed this precious White Lady In Cold Blood

293
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,183
When that's not at all the reality

294
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,231
What else is doing is lying about this

295
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,023
Quite frankly

296
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:51,423
Virtue signaling

297
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,775
We stopped at the gun was it was

298
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:56,799
More

299
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,615
New information that they established in

300
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:04,479
I think it was part of the first trial but it wasn't

301
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:10,367
Reading up on the appeal for everyone

302
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:14,719
How could it be

303
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:20,095
Suck so hard

304
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,631
Enter the country illegally

305
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,911
That doesn't mean that he

306
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
He committed that

307
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,959
Open murder

308
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,519
No is there any bearing on the event

309
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,639
God that is very sad involved

310
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,431
Up for no good reason

311
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,479
Other than that there are

312
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,503
Infinite number of

313
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,063
It's very

314
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,647
So Alex did go to l.a.

315
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
California

316
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,183
Probably a lie

317
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,463
You just said

318
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:48,767
But

319
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,839
I thought he was going on Rogan

320
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,631
I was wrong about that

321
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:59,775
But my reason that I thought he was going to go to l.a. unless there's a big

322
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,311
Press opportunity

323
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,359
We're someone else's audience

324
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,407
Can sort of vulture rental

325
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:09,247
Like I said unknown podcast that he went on

326
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
It's bigger than Rogue

327
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:15,903
Pod save America they're really driving

328
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:22,304
F*** these are really trying to reach across the aisle

329
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,864
Bigots in Richmond

330
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,168
But it wouldn't be an Alex Jones

331
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:27,936
Trip

332
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,704
If

333
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,240
It didn't have a story that's

334
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,520
Something happened to him on the plane

335
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,872
So he's out of control

336
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:50,720
I know you do it all for money

337
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,192
What you want to bet that was one of Alex's fan

338
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:20,416
Water

339
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,440
Christ

340
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,512
I guess

341
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,280
Security Now

342
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,816
Which kind of pie

343
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,400
Super paranoid dude

344
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,680
Unhinged

345
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,824
I mean

346
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,664
Smart time to preemptively assume that they're going to turn on him

347
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,504
Well I mean is it just be like

348
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,784
And I am

349
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,088
Very visible so they're probably going to come after me

350
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,696
If you create an environment group

351
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,232
That is so true

352
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,536
I would say defined by

353
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00,352
Just accepting things with

354
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,120
Being

355
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,656
Incredibly paranoid

356
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,680
I just

357
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:10,080
Pull up suspicions about literally everything

358
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,664
Was the only lesson really that the French Revolution

359
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,576
Needs to do things like go to LA to be on podcast

360
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,344
Because

361
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,112
Now that he does

362
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,648
Have his social media doesn't

363
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,184
YouTube algorithm

364
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,232
Exploit he has no intake

365
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,536
This is why

366
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:35,424
His business model is falling apart eventually the people that get indoctrinated into does

367
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,264
Become suspicious of him and go away forever

368
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,056
That's low hasn't

369
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,616
But the inflow has

370
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,920
That's why it's falling apart

371
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,456
That's why

372
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,736
For someone like Alex is like

373
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,296
Valuable

374
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:57,952
Sharper fall because he had less groundwork live

375
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,744
Lessov Foundation

376
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,280
To build upon

377
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,584
Abyss

378
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:10,240
All the gears to completely stopped working but passed

379
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,288
Milo didn't actually create anything

380
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,872
20 semi deer

381
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,688
And that's it

382
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,552
And I mean obviously Alex is aware of that

383
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,832
If he's ever read it

384
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,624
Email from any of his listeners or

385
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,160
Actually experience

386
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,720
Public

387

400
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,840
This is very

401
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,656
This

402
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,448
In the past

403
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,472
Weave

404
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,776

Ready to be there

00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,456
To be like sort of a pressure release valve

410
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,736
If something's going

411
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,760
Too bad for Alex

412
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:28,064
He can just yell at Eddie about Flat Earth

413
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,160
Everything is

414
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:40,096
How this would work on Alex's

415
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,168
Infowars

416
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,192

Anyway

423
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:13,888
Do you always have to backup everything you say right

424
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:16,704
That is true you do need to provide evidence for every

425
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,416

Conversation is a lot of yelling

436
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
It is

437
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,536
Not coherent

438
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,560
Right in most

439
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,168

445
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,536
That

446
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,560
They get into

447
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,328
To the bigger issue

448
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,608
Well then

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,936
Crazy yeah it's kind of weird

462
00:28:56,192 --> 00:29:00,544
We run into like an essential problem that I have that I really don't like

463
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,152
About episodes

464
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,712
It's really difficult

465
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,760
Two different big you ate like what is

466
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,040
Trying to be funny

467
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,576
And what is actually like

468
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:16,672
Deposition

469
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:20,256
They don't want to come back as a one-eyed woodchuck

470
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,560
Yeah

471
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,120
To get a little bit of a

472
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:29,728
Being funny in there

473
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:36,128
Tell him it's in the middle of expressing an idea that I think you probably believe

474
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:40,992
Create robots never have to die in face VR cost

475
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,064
Where is you actually believe

476
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,088
And what's a joke

477
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,184
It's always hard to figure out site I try to err on the side of like

478
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,768
He's probably f****** around

479

Fox around

480
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,560
For a living

481
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:58,400
When you're on a show with

482
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,960
Alex f****** Jew

483
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,800
That is most humorless person

484
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,336
Try and get humor in

485
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,360
The show

486
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,384
I mean

487
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,432
If you're a professional

488
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,224
Obviously easiest way is

489
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,504
Make poop jokes

490
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,088
If you make poop don't you have destroyed

491
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,136
When you read the room

492
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,672
You say poop jokes are going to work

493
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:24,512
Actual comic

494
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,536
Trying to be

00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:30,400

Course

498
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,760

499
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,296
Break

500
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:49,856

Hardcore gay p*** stats

507
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:25,952

508
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:32,352

Call Mike

514
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,632
Verbally and

515
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,400
Vocally

516
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,192
Sounds almost

517
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,984
Identical to Owen Benjamin

518
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,824
Very similar

519
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:22,528
I don't know I don't know

520
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,296

521
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,320

00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,368
Slumlord exploit

523
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,136
Racist

Bullshitters who's married to the worst woman in the world

525
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,512

526
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,120
F*** off

527
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,424
Yeah

528
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,704
Making a joke

529
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,240
That's making the joke

530
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,520
Is it

531
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,824
He's trying but he's

532
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,616
He's it's at

533
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,384
The joke

534
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,712
Fletcher sucks

535
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:58,112
Well I'm not saying he's a good, kind of a joke is there

536
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:04,256
In fact you know what I'll be honest with you like please

537
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:07,840
Delivery is so similar to

538
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,888
You have something

539
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,936
Piano sound

540
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,704
Similar to seven

541
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,336
I had to go check

542
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,360
Yeah

543
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:25,760
They got a clip of Owen Benjamin video of this episode

544
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:30,624
I'm not positive this isn't Owen Benjamin pretending

545
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,232
Tower on Infowars

546
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,280
Alex would know

547
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:43,680
Although I imagine

548
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,728
Sam Tripoli would be with a horrible child

549
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,776
Probably

550
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:50,336
Very similar like this

551
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,104
Which is like

552
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,152
Understand

553
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,688
Comedian

554
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,968
Blurring of the lines

555
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,504
What do you think

556
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,296
What are you joking about

557
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:27,968
Is that mean is that proved the Rothschild

558
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,624
I just don't understand I don't know what

559
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:39,488
Are you like goofing around Hitler was a Jewish Stone

560
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:45,632
When you continue the point keep trying to argue

561
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,424
You're making an argument

562
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,984
I don't

563
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,824
Genuinely just like really

564
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,592
Committing to

565
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,200
I don't know

566
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,992
There's no possible way that

567
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:01,760
He could be

568
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,808
It's just not

569
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,672
I mean I guess the podcast with Eddie Bravo

570
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,720
He's making any

571
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,768
F****** ration exact

572
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:17,632
It's got to be him being like if I'm going to go on Infowars

573
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,656
I am going to

574
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,448
Conspiracy theory

575
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,264
I don't know that's the only thing that makes

576
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:26,336
To me it really makes me wish that I had

577
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:29,408
You know unlimited time

578
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:35,040
Just listened to hundreds of hours of Sam Tripoli

579
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,600
SNL ever hires

580
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,696
F****** with

581
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,976
Yeah I don't think it's

582
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,768
Making a g

583
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,816
Joke out of being on Infowars

584
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,120
But at the same time

585
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,424
Be funny in his own yeah

586
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,544
I can't say that he's wrong about a lot of stuff

587
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,312
Like this

588
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,832
Across that segment

589
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,136
Trainwreck

590
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:14,208
It's it's really all things all things being equal

591
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,488
It's not good

592
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,256
No

593
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,304
It made it so like

594
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,120
Eddie Bravo and

595
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,888
AAA

596
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:28,032
Two days in a row this going to be

597
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,568
I'm definitely not listening

598
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,640
Friday

599
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:35,200
It's surprising how out there

600
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:36,992
Same time being

601
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,272
Incredibly boring

602
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,880
Would you rather Alex cover cookie

603
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,648
Crap like

604
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:47,488
UFOs

605
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,256
Alex

606
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,536
Does not cover

607
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,304
Cookie Craft

608
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,840
But UFOs

609
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:26,400
So Alex is kooky crap like UFOs interdimensional demons

610
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,936
Tricky bunch of human

611
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:30,752
Entropy and collaborators

612
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:35,616
They destroy the environment in some such way that makes the demons

613
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,152
Physically materialize

614
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,688
And then everybody dies

615
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,480
Because it's

616
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:51,232
Look at all of those things are the only possible

617
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:54,816
Sherlock Sherlock

618
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,888
Bright

619
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,448
Once you eliminate

620
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,728
Impossible

621
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,752
All the

622
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,800
Just left no matter how improbable

623
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,592
Is done by the f****** global

624
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,896
Remember that

625
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:10,688
So

626
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:15,040
I do enjoy

627
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,832
Like Alex has such

628
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,600
Shabbat

629
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,648
Such a skewed towards his own

630
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,184
Ideas

631
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:21,952
Vet like

632
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:25,280
He impunes UFO ology

633
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,584
Crazy

634
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,608
This

635
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:35,776
Strategy

636
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,128
Project Camelot

637
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,432
You think the Raptors are bad

638
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,712
I beg your pardon

639
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,784
I know Mark Richards

640
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:51,648
Yeah it's these worlds that happens a lot

641
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,256
Kick you out of it

642
00:38:56,512 --> 00:39:00,608
Everything is kind of make believe

643
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:04,704
To be aggressive

644
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,752
So

645
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:11,360
What's the wrestling with whether or not I believe same tripoli's f****** around

646
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,640
Dismay

647
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:16,224
Text quick really kind of help put it into Focus for me

648
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,760
Where I'm leaning towards

649
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,808
Not

650
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:22,368
I'll let you decide what you think

651
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,904
Whatever they like

652
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,440
Flights

653
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,720
On some level

654
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,768
That he's really into this stuff

655
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,560
He believes

656
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,840
At least the good part

657
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:39,008
Google phrase to social score rice in China so scared of Google

658
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:47,200
Poison permanent kits

659
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,072
So

660
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:06,912
What are you talkin about

661
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:12,032
Words to it and that is the Eric Schmidt did take his daughter Sophia long

662
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,568
When he went to North

663
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:21,504
Conspiracy theory based on an anonymous source who talked to a group called anonymous

664
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:24,320
Claiming to be a former lover of Eric's

665
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,184
All of this completely unsubstantiated

666
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,512
It comes from a post on a Blog could have been written by anyone

667
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:36,096
Down to the claims that the trip to North Korea was about getting

668
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:36,864
Antidote

669
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,936
The daughter

670
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,240
Anonymous Patriots

671
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:46,592
Either be a part of or the same thing as a group called American and

672
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,616
Intelligent

673
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:50,432
Who does best as I can tell is a group of retirees

674
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,224
To talking to the webcams about Trump

675
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:57,600
Write one of the three of them

676
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:06,816
Interesting

677
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:12,704
With the digital no heat

678
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:16,032
They're also really big into these 432 Hertz

679
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:23,968
Which I assure you will be at the road

680
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,016
I like the evil globalist

681
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,064
Whatever

682
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:32,928
Change the vibration

683
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,464
Music

684
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:37,536
In order to put bad vibes into the public

685
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:42,656
But all of these artists that died young to go with the 4:30

686
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,728
Right

687
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:49,056
Nativity back into music

688
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,872
Alright

689
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:54,687
Debunked studies

690
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:59,807
Alright you showed up on Project Camelot

691
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,599
On Infowars

692
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,879
Super into those

693
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,647
Conspiracies

694
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,183
I promise we'll cover it

695
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,463
Down the road

696
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,535
These

697
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,327
They post a bunch of videos

698
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,375
432 Hertz

699
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,167
Music

700
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,263
10 years programming hearing aids

701
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,567
432 Hertz

702
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,591
Not anymore

703
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,359
Special event

704
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,383
Any other

705
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:30,783
Z-man you drank the Kool-Aid

706
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,367
Just a group of old people political power of memes

707
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,159
The demonstrator

708
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,743
Alex

709
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,023
To be the Alex

710
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,559
Spell colloidal silver

711
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,327
Where is America

712
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,351
Intelligence media

713
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,375
Just gives out of recipe

714
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,143
Before it

715
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:51,519
Well I mean you're going to need a little bit of

716
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:54,847
Sure

717
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:57,151
Sure and then you get some silver and you're good to go

718
00:42:57,407 --> 00:43:00,991
People who originally posted

719
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:01,759
The image of the

720
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:04,575
The judge in Rodger stones

721
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,855
Which Rodger retweeted

722
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,647
And that got him back out

723
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,767
That's what that's what you're telling me

724
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,327
Originate

725
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,167
Have your argument basically goes to China is poison

726
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,055
I'm not an expert on these matters

727
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,359
Actually sure they're real Poison

728
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,151
That work that way outside of movies

729
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:35,807
Given the lack of any specifics in this person's Anonymous post I find it convincing and impossible to look

730
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:39,391
I don't care

731
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,927
Red Sky

732
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:42,975
Gentleman bastards

733
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,743
Series and that way

734
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,815
Are there

735
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:51,167
Did they just give you and then like if you don't keep taking

736
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:56,543
No word from the biological standpoint

737
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:59,871
It goes against most of what we know about

738
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:03,455
I'm not a biologist I could be wrong but that seems like

739
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,735
What's the name of that

740
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,623
One thing that's a red flag but the way the stories

741
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,159
Being told is also

742
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,183
Chronology

743
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,719
I have expressed by Sam

744
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,767
The theorist

745
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:20,095
Start a tithe other daughter

746
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,375
Strengthen their clients

747
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,495
So they killed his other daughter

748
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:29,567
I didn't desperation he took his survival

749
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,335
North Korea

750
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,615
Do to save her

751
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,943
The problem isn't that trip to North Korea took place

752
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:35,967
2013

753
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,759
His other daughter passed away it's

754
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:38,783
17

755
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,087
What does confuse things a little bit from

756
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,367
Chronology standpoint

757
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:45,695
It doesn't matter though theories like this are based on nothing

758
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:51,071
Accommodate new information

759
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,983
Over the course of my time doing this podcast

760
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,263
Even before that in

761
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,031
Recreation

762
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:00,799
In old times

763
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,591
I've read a whole lot of dumb blogs

764
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,359
The purported

765
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:05,919
This is one of

766
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,967
And this is the

767
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,503
People get this

768
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,271
Information

769
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:11,807
This is

770
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,343
Something you know about unless

771
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,159
You looked into these worlds

772
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,695
Involved

773
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:18,975
Indomican

774
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,999
Conspiracies

775
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:26,399
Read stupid s*** A Lot in Belize

776
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,215
Cuz you wouldn't know this one

777
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:31,775
Wright's doesn't even talk about that right

778
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:35,615
Good this is this is a revealing

779
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,383
Conspiracy

780
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:39,711
Because I thought it was all just made up

781
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:43,295
What's on a rip keeping the risk

782
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,087
But if this is an actual

783
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,623
Conspiracy theory

784
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,415
Yeah you totally

785
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,183
Pastor

786
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:50,975
Otherwise

787
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:57,631
What the f*** are you doing the only other possibility I guess if you want to keep up the idea

788
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,911
Around is what it's like

789
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:03,775
LARP or whatever like

790
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,055
Eat like

791
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:11,711
Goes into the stupid conspiracy sites and find things in order.

792
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:14,015
And I find

793
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:15,295
Unlikely

794
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:21,951
Yeah it was just something I couldn't

795
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,487
Trace back to

796
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,511
Kind of

797
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,535
Kind of obscure

798
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,071
Right then

799
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:29,631
I would probably agree with you that it's just riffing

800
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,935
But this is absolutely

801
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,215
Conspiracy

802
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:36,031
Subterranean

803
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,567
This world

804
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,103
That's why I was

805
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,127
Confusing it first

806
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,151
Because

807
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,711
Could totally seem like if I start on

808
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,735
Like that

809
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,527
You know it's like weather

810
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:50,623
Closing little bit about the the stick driving how to get

811
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,159
That's just rapping and rest

812
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:54,207
I could wind up anyway

813
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,487
I have no idea

814
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,535
So

815
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:03,935
Claims that the Chinese government tried to murder Eric Smith family

816
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,959
Forward to that

817
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:08,287
So Alex insists on playing the

818
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,567
Video of him

819
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,871
Pretending to be easy

820
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:16,479
For Eddie and Sam really wants to impress them

821
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,271
Anti Eddie's response

822
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,039
Is

823
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:33,375
Amazing

824
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:43,871
Voice hours

825
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:49,759
Obama age

826
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:59,231
I have no evidence that Alex has done any voicemail

827
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:03,583
What's up cuz every time you've heard of

828
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:07,935
Turn on the radio

829
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,495
I guess

830
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:13,055
He could save it is like his own documentaries

831
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:17,919
When he does the narration

832
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,943
Take that away

833
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:27,135
I can't hire it

834
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:30,207
I don't see any reality

835
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:35,071
How does he could say that rotoscope of

836
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,423
Waking Life

837
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:46,079
That could be going to work with him anymore

838
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:48,895
Problem

839
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,199
Alex

840
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,623
God

841
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:05,279
God that would be so good to be other man

842
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:10,399
The next Before Sunrise

843
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:16,543
I don't think linklater has a place for you outside of crazy galleon rotoscope

844
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,079
Here at midnight

845
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:21,663
That Alex Jones voice

846
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:28,063
I don't I don't know what you talk about you also was on Like Jesse Ventura

847
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,111
And I guess the other one

848
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:30,879
Decoded

849
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,183
Meltzer show

850
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,279
Mangrove episode

851
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,839
They tried to sneak into book

852
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,423
They made a big production

853
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:45,983
I don't

854
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:49,823
What he's talking about if I were politically

855
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,847
PolitiFact

856
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:52,383
I would rate this claim Dubai

857
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,247
Dubious probably not

858
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:03,647
Local commercials

859
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:11,583
I do I do for a little while

860
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:17,983
Crazy stuff

861
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:19,775
Betty White

862
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:21,567
Before I get it to buy

863
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,103
Real bitter

864
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,895
Brandt

865
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:32,575
Let's move right along

866
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,903
If you'll recall in the past

867
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,439
Alex

868
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,487
That you know Trump's got to get green one

869
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:40,511
We got to get it

870
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:41,791
We need to get it

871
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,095
Alex has decided to move on

872
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:46,911
Okay good

873
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:49,727
It's that bhugaon

874
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:52,287
Never

875
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:11,231
First place

876
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,287
The Moon

877
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:32,991
I saw one of your notes Here

878
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:44,767
Real thrill

879
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:48,863
The movie

880
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,447
I do love how Eddie ruined the reveal their though

881
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:56,287
Wait a wait a second run the bed Eddie comes off the bus

882
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,943
It really frustrates me that that really

883
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:03,711
That high-pitched

884
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:06,527
Really was not where I was coming from

885
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:10,623
You're still doing the Chinese that's pretty nice

886
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:15,743
You're going to Annex the Moon

887
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:24,447
Pretension

888
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:29,567
None of this means anything

889
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:32,639
What I hear I would say something like I started apposite

890
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:34,687
Petition to make the moon the 51st state

891
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:37,247
It's something that's hard to ignore cuz it's stupid

892
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:41,087
Painfully obvious does a desperate cry for attention

893
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,415
You can almost hear Alex off are talking to Rob.

894
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:48,255
It's going to come from Media Matters

895
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,791
Post making fun of Alex

896
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,327
Competition

897
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,631
You can almost see the intention behind it

898
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:54,911
It's all about trying to

899
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,703
To use other media Outlets to give him

900
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:59,007
Free press that he doesn't have access to himself

901
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,871
The Moon is the Furious

902
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,151
Suggestion to make even

903
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:05,919
For Alex

904
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:12,575
He knows damn well very serious breach of international law and probably grounds for war

905
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:15,647
All countries that are capable of space travel assignment 19

906
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,183
67 outer space

907
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:20,255
It explicitly make space the property of everyone

908
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,815
Ever B

909
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:23,583
Outer space

910
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:26,655
Absolutely break that treaty

911
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,423
Which would

912
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:30,751
Probably pissed off literally every other country on Spotify

913
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,335
Breathe a long

914
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:38,431
Write me a weird situation

915
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,479
We have to go to war over this

916
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,015
Dumbledore

917
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,063
I don't want to do that

918
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:46,111
You know who generally make

919
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,415
Claims on Outer Space theme

920
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:51,487
Martis

921
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:56,607
There's a pretty rich tradition of con men claim they own parts of space in order to sell them

922
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,447
Spiritually continuing

923
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:08,127
This isn't it just makes me sad you see this like a racist rolling with the

924
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:09,663
Zvideo and you like

925
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:15,295
Get you and get your name in the media

926
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:20,159
You starting to change. Org petition to Annex the moon and pretend

927
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,207
I was taking it seriously in order to get

928
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:24,255
Press media

929
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:30,655
It really is

930
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:32,703
Stephen Moore

931
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,335
He would

932
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:39,359
Get

933
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,639
More people

934
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:41,663
Supporting him

935
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:42,687
Just

936
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:43,455
Just

937
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,271
As

938
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,039
Saying something

939
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:47,807
Stupid and then

940
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,599
People will

941
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:50,623
Actively

942
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,159
Circle

943
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,183
Tenzin be like

944
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,463
Care about Alex Jones

945
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,999
Whatsoever until

946
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:56,767
You

947
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:59,071
Sent this message but now I know you're lying

948
00:54:59,327 --> 00:54:59,839
And I love Alex

949
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,631
News

950
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,959
To even more so

951
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:10,079
Because that goes into

952
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:10,847
Attractive

953
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:11,871
First

954
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,639
Who's crazy

955
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,967
Like you get some

956
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,247
Runoff

957
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,783
From big ass from

958
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:19,807
People

959
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,599
Covering

960
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:24,159
But you'll get more people who are like this

961
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:26,975
Into paranormal spaceship

962
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,791
Probably

963
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:30,559
What do you need

964
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,351
PetSmart

965
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,119
Revere

966
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,143
Hardback in

967
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:35,679
Yeah yeah

968
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,215
But he's not smart

969
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:38,751
Even more land because

970
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,287
Like he came up with the idea

971
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,335
Like they were having

972
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,359
Hearings on.

973
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,127
DCU become a

974
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:44,895
Estate

975
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:50,015
Right now so it's like

976
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:55,391
And he's already done the Greenland

977
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,671
Play doubt

978
00:55:57,183 --> 00:56:00,511
A little bit about

979
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:06,911
The guy who got fired from SNL

980
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,215
Civista Bank

981
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:13,055
Complaining about the idea that you can't do anything

982
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,127
All these moralists are going to

983
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:17,919
Come down on you if you

984
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,455
And so

985
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:21,503
I think that he makes a really so late

986
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:29,439
Allegiance

987
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:48,639
Let It Go

988
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:56,575
Alex spent so much time complaining about the view like he's

989
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:57,855
So much

990
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:00,927
I'm yelling about Joy Behar in the past like

991
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:07,583
I understand that might be

992
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,375
Like

993
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:15,519
Don't try to pretend like this is an exclusive behavior of people on the left

994
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:21,663
Or upset about places I guess the complain about Louis c.k.

995
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:23,455
That's what's up

996
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,807
PK

997
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:33,439
Most people had was a create an unsafe working environment for potential

998
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,999
That might be uncomfortable being around him

999
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:41,375
That was more than conversation then like Louise going to say something offensive

1000
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:49,311
I get that I understand wanting to push back on

1001
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:56,735
You're not a guest on the show The Dudley

1002
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:59,039
Ridiculous

1003
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,487
Listen

1004
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:13,119
Because what if you live in I don't think it's that dumb position is wholly like

1005
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:17,215
Leave everybody alone if you do that yourself

1006
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:22,335
I don't know if it's not going to argue with you I'm not going to

1007
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:25,407
Right

1008
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:30,015
The universe

1009
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,487
We're not

1010
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:40,511
However

1011
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:53,823
Kind of frame and sexual acts

1012
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:45,279
Yep how crazy is the Unabomber in the next clip was

1013
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:50,143
Because his argument is

1014
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:53,727
Black guy at a party man

1015
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:56,287
That's a Drew Michaels bit all over

1016
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:01,919
Don't read the Unabomber Manifesto I don't want to be the guy who's like

1017
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:04,479
Actually if you read the manifesto there's a few

1018
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:06,527
You don't need to be that guy there's no point

1019
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:11,135
I'm not sure that that might be

1020
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,927
It's

1021
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:14,207
Alright

1022
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:16,767
I don't

1023
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:17,791
I don't care

1024
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,583
I don't care

1025
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:23,679
This is a rambler

1026
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,447
Kind of weird

1027
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:27,263
Some of the claims he'll repeat come from

1028
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,823
Muhfucka

1029
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:30,591
No

1030
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:34,431
Embody the guy I don't want to talk

1031
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,735
Just just

1032
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:39,039
Perfectly crystallized as

1033
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:41,343
Yelling the Unabomber was right

1034
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:50,303
Conclusions

1035
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,631
Was the man right

1036
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:56,447
Look you got to wake people up somehow

1037
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,471
70 Savage

1038
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,543
That's a normal things

1039
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:01,567
Sure

1040
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:03,871
But

1041
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,919
Yeah if somebody if somebody

1042
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:08,223
Seriously said the Unabomber was right

1043
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:10,015
Extrapolate all the other

1044
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:10,783
That you don't like about

1045
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,111
Yeah it's it's kind of a towel

1046
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:18,463
That's all people at parties like you think the Unabomber was right

1047
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:27,167
And I think we kind of figure out what it is

1048
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:31,007
Pushing for

1049
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:34,335
The 51st state of the United States

1050
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:06,335
51st state

1051
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:11,455
Making a White House petition

1052
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,991
Never happen

1053
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,575
He's advocating an

1054
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:20,671
Lake Hughes

1055
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:21,695
To do something

1056
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:22,719
That is

1057
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,511
It would be an insult

1058
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:31,423
This is crazy I know that the mooninites a dick

1059
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,727
So I would say we don't even want them

1060
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:36,287
Not positive

1061
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:39,359
The in the time I've listened to the show Alex

1062
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:41,407
Advocated

1063
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,943
For an international

1064
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:45,247
Uno

1065
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,015
Buying

1066
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:52,415
Greenland I don't know if that would be an international crime Uber ride

1067
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:58,303
We're possible

1068
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,327
Completely again

1069
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,863
International law

1070
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:03,935
Country

1071
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:05,727
Annexing the

1072
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:11,103
Well and then we have to Annex slaves

1073
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,407
Offset

1074
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:19,039
Alright

1075
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,855
I don't know what

1076
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:22,623
The deal is

1077
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,415
You know what I mean like

1078
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:28,511
I don't know if this is the same as like Alex trying to advocate for Trump

1079
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:31,583
Commit a different International

1080
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,119
What

1081
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:33,887
Yeah

1082
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:36,959
Goofy it's stupid

1083
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:38,495
He's advocating for

1084
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:45,407
Nope

1085
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,943
But

1086
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:52,319
Infowars.com

1087
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:03,327
Tom

1088
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:06,399
None of those other countries are going to claim the Moon

1089
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:09,983
He's acting like we've got to do it before they do

1090
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:12,799
Do well we're in a new space race

1091
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:14,335
Apparently

1092
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:16,383
This paper is to just say the Moon is

1093
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:20,735
Right that was a lot harder than the whole

1094
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:24,319
Then ask not what your country

1095
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:26,367
The Moon

1096
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:34,559
The shirts are being printed

1097
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:41,471
Lost Hills

1098
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,031
Play Symphony first

1099
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,103
Newswars

1100
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:51,711
But the shirt

1101
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:11,423
It's going to be a $30 shirt

1102
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:14,751
Yeah marketing for the shirt

1103
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:21,919
People signed it

1104
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:30,111
Drum up like

1105
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,647
Possible coverage

1106
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:34,719
For it in order to drive sales for the stupid shirt

1107
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:37,791
But also the fact that he's putting out more shirts than

1108
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:42,911
How is that B has been more of a

1109
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:43,679
Versailles

1110
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:46,495
Abilene closer to that direction than it being a

1111
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:47,775
Your existential

1112
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:50,591
Yeah it was more like

1113
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:51,359
The products

1114
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,895
That we have a year left

1115
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,455
Supplement

1116
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:56,735
It's not

1117
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,015
The show is going to

1118
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:03,391
Maybe I don't I don't know

1119
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:05,695
35% off or something

1120
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:07,231
Claiming I don't know if it's

1121
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:08,767
He's claiming some of it is

1122
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:09,535
Like below

1123
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:12,607
Talked like he's losing

1124
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,887
I don't know how much of that is

1125
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,423
Is true it could just be all

1126
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,703
Bravado and

1127
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:18,495
Sales but like

1128
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,031
It doesn't feel

1129
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:20,799
Like

1130
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:22,847
It doesn't feel like

1131
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:24,127
That was some

1132
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,663
Is what I meant

1133
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:28,479
He's responsive

1134
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,039
To be like you know you should do

1135
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,575
You change the name of that

1136
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:33,343
Operation

1137
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:35,903
He's doing a play on

1138
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,719
Alex's

1139
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:39,743
Not quite

1140
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:41,791
Picking up on what he's talkin about

1141
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:43,583
Eddie keeps being like

1142
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,191
A b

1143
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,471
Is what it is

1144
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,239
It's not that in

1145
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,799
Pinterest

1146
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,335
Is it

1147
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:55,359
Idea for Eddie

1148
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:57,407
He wrote the Declaration of Independence

1149
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:00,991
No no no he has an idea about how the UFC

1150
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,527
A very successful

1151
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:05,599
Can get a double

1152
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,159
Okay idea is

1153
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,951
Routine

1154
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:14,559
Karate

1155
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:26,591
The biggest

1156
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,599
Ask them pitbulls

1157
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:42,975
I think Eddie is dismissive

1158
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:45,279
There

1159
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:50,143
Great idea

1160
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,447
Humans fighting

1161
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,359
That is fine Eddie Bravo is

1162
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:02,431
Stupid everywhere but if you step

1163
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,455
His f****** room

1164
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:04,735
He's going to

1165
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:06,015
He's going to put you down

1166
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,439
He's maybe

1167
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:15,231
Matured a little bit

1168
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:21,631
I get I don't know this is probably no other contacts

1169
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:27,007
I would say that it sounds more like Eddie is hip to Alex more than he has been in

1170
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,543
Haha and he's

1171
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:32,895
Is less willing to believe

1172
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,431
Things

1173
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:35,711
He might have been

1174
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,991
50 years ago

1175
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:39,295
It seems like

1176
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:46,207
It seems like he's putting up with him more where is Sam is the

1177
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:49,279
The Eddy of the show

1178
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:52,351
Hasn't been burned

1179
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:53,887
It's possible

1180
01:08:59,263 --> 01:08:59,775
This is like

1181
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:01,567
He feels over it

1182
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:02,335
And kind of like

1183
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:03,871
Whatever

1184
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:05,151
And Sam's

1185
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,175
He's eager

1186
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:07,711
To impress Alex

1187
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:12,063
Chasm of the various

1188
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,087
Situation that were talk

1189
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,135
Alex's

1190
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,927
Ebon flow of liquor

1191
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:17,951
You know they

1192
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:19,743
For a while

1193
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:20,767
Listen to what Alex has

1194
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,047
They get burned

1195
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:23,583
Internet go

1196
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:25,119
I meant Sam Izzard

1197
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:27,679
Send what he has to say

1198
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:28,447
Stay for awhile

1199
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,263
Probably

1200
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:34,847
I realize that Alex has no idea what he's talking about

1201
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:35,871
Yeah yeah

1202
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:39,711
The good partnership

1203
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:44,063
But whenever the caveman's about to host the fourth hour a lot

1204
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:48,159
But

1205
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:59,679
Say that again

1206
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,471
I know we don't do that

1207
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:08,895
I like hot chicks

1208
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:12,223
Family Show

1209
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:13,247
Family Show

1210
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:17,599
Call Dad

1211
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:20,159
He was even trying to be funny with that

1212
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,975
Eddie's

1213
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:25,023
7

1214
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,143
Oh man

1215
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:33,727
Talking about

1216
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,519
A little bit

1217
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,311
This clip is really into

1218
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:38,591
Because

1219
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:39,871
Think it really highlights

1220
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,407
How Alex

1221
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:43,199
Get his story straight

1222
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:47,039
About whether or not Trump was elected by the people

1223
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:48,319
Or buy

1224
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:52,671
I think

1225
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:56,255
Square that they're mutually exclusive

1226
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:05,983
Cynthia

1227
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,775
Intelligent

1228
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:38,495
So I don't I don't think you could

1229
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:41,823
Make the argument that good guys in the intelligence

1230
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:47,455
Community installed Trump

1231
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:49,503
It was a ragtag band of

1232
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:50,271
Gyros

1233
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:52,575
We got we got our Bruce Willis

1234
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:54,367
We got our

1235
01:11:56,159 --> 01:12:00,511
Call Marcin patrzalek

1236
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:06,399
Cher

1237
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:10,495
See what was happening is

1238
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:13,311
The will of the people was but then

1239
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:15,615
CIA people

1240
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:16,639
Say we didn't

1241
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:18,431
So then.

1242
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:19,455
Gyros came in

1243
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,223
Frey

1244
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:30,207
Legitimately on his show the people only person I really know for sure

1245
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:32,511
Tell him about that

1246
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,167
Steve anymore

1247
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:40,447
And we've gone back in

1248
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:42,495
See why you should never have believed

1249
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:45,567
It's crazy that you held onto that piece of information

1250
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:46,591
The clearly is from

1251
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,687
Like you need to

1252
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,735
Reconsider

1253
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:56,319
When the source of something is shown to be a liar

1254
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:59,647
No no that's that's only going for

1255
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:00,671
You can't

1256
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:02,207
Ignore what

1257
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:02,975
Steve said

1258
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:03,999
Ex post facto

1259
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,839
Well I mean I guess if it means

1260
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:12,191
Like if you completely changed everything you do

1261
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:13,983
To accommodate the bad info

1262
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:20,383
Information difficult

1263
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:23,967
You claim to be right 99% of the time

1264
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:26,271
And then you have to go back and go through your archives

1265
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:30,879
Oh my God

1266
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:39,071
It's a problem 88% always correct

1267
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,375
Certainly nowhere near that

1268
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:46,751
On the show is to

1269
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:49,567
To play a deepfake video that's

1270
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:51,615
Kyle Dunnigan

1271
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,687
About Jeffrey

1272
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,479
Death wear like Bill Quinn

1273
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:58,783
Donald Trump

1274
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:00,319
Epstein

1275
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,087
2

1276
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:02,879
Auto-erotic lyrics

1277
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:04,671
Himself

1278
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:06,975
It's not great,

1279
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:08,511
The two of them talk

1280
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:14,143
Popcorn

1281
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:19,007
It's it's also not

1282
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:20,799
It is what it is I don't care

1283
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:23,103
What's more interesting

1284
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,895
Is it after the video

1285
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:25,919
Alex

1286
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,199
Give me the real Tramp

1287
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:27,967
He's trying to

1288
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:28,735
Impress them

1289
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:30,015
Trying to like

1290
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:31,551
This is this is so

1291
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,831
Perfectly encapsulated

1292
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:46,399
Kyle Dunnigan amazing comedians

1293
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:52,799
Instagram

1294
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:09,695
Yeah just go on Instagram and look up Kyle Dunnigan and he's got a whole bunch of videos like that

1295
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:10,719
Hysterical

1296
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:12,511
I was told by somebody

1297
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:19,935
Whatever

1298
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:22,239
He'll just be

1299
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:27,359
Just throws popcorn

1300
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:36,575
Disconnected

1301
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:43,487
Call Mike

1302
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:46,047
So

1303
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:48,607
To act like he knows the secret

1304
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:50,143
Hey man

1305
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:54,495
You know I know things that only friends would know

1306
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:58,847
You know what's more likely

1307
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:11,135
We either that or we elected Howard Hughes

1308
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:16,511
No I don't begrudge anyone for hanging out in a robe watching

1309
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:22,911
Falmer whatever for yourself

1310
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:29,055
Throw it in the air tank I took your mouth everybody likes to have fun

1311
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:34,175
It would have been

1312
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:38,783
It could have been any details

1313
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:41,599
Oh man I know people who said that

1314
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:47,999
You could be drinking through a straw I'd like to know the Trump all the way to the floor all no matter what

1315
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:53,887
It could be

1316
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,935
B complex

1317
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:59,263
I got impressed you guys like

1318
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,031
Stop

1319
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,055
I'm in it

1320
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:04,127
To get us.

1321
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:09,247
Complaining

1322
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:12,063
Glass clipart because

1323
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:14,111
It's all over the place

1324
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:17,951
Whatever it's really worthwhile to go over

1325
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,487
Was yelling about how companies

1326
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:21,791
A lot of songs go

1327
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:25,631
Alex Epstein stuff I really don't find it

1328
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:27,167
Hang it all

1329
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:31,263
But Alex

1330
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:33,567
The gas

1331
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,359
Are complaining about the

1332
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:36,127
Young Turks

1333
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:38,943
Whatever

1334
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:40,735
I'm sick of them right

1335
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:43,551
I don't know

1336
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:49,183
Mixed feelings on some of this

1337
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:52,511
And then also Sam Tripoli says

1338
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:53,279
The end of this

1339
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:55,327
That is a strong indication

1340
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,863
It's some of his beliefs

1341
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:58,655
Might be much worse

1342
01:17:59,167 --> 01:17:59,935
Then even

1343
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:00,959
He's pretty

1344
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:16,063
Kazarian but you know that's another store

1345
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:23,487
So what is zero interest in going to bat for

1346
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:25,023
And The Young Turks

1347
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,815
Particular

1348
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:28,351
Really f****** terrible pain

1349
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:35,007
Respond to criticism

1350
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:35,775
And all that s***

1351
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:38,591
That's probably not the case for all the things

1352
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:42,431
But I know these absolutely address the horrible things

1353
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,711
Written on his blog

1354
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:47,551
Denying of the Armenian

1355
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:51,903
Oh s*** yeah

1356
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:52,671
Tipton Iowa

1357
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,231
Okay

1358
01:18:55,743 --> 01:19:00,607
Yeah there's a streak on his credibility but assisted in the Maurice

1359
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:05,215
In the more recent past but no one else back then

1360
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:07,007
You shouldn't have commented on the issue

1361
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:08,543
But many believe the genocide is

1362
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:11,359
I don't know they let him off the hook or anyone's

1363
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:16,735
To trust his Judgment at all I don't know that's a choice everyone's got to make for themselves and I don't really have a strong position

1364
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,015
I don't think

1365
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,063
I don't think

1366
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:26,975
Genocide denialism is something that you can take lightly even if someone correct their position

1367
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:28,511
Pretty out there

1368
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:30,559
But at the same time

1369
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:36,959
Learning more yeah I don't think it's impossible to change

1370
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:38,239
I give the benefit

1371
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:43,359
Is

1372
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,383
Progression of them

1373
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,151
Like

1374
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:47,455
Apologizing and coming around

1375
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:51,295
I had terrible information I didn't know enough I never should have said those things

1376
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,903
Really typical

1377
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:57,951
Of people who are dyed-in-the-wool

1378
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:00,511
Denial

1379
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:03,839
I don't know exactly what to make of Jank

1380
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:06,911
His position

1381
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:10,751
I have a strong position on it I guess

1382
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:12,543
Iona

1383
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:15,616
Think it's a

1384
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:17,664
Prince to the militia that was involved

1385
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,944
Did The Armenian Genocide

1386
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,224
Is Alex and Steve

1387
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:24,832
Original shows just called

1388
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:25,600
The Young Turk

1389
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:26,880
Because he's young age

1390
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:27,648
Turkish

1391
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,440
What are the problems with Alex

1392
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:31,744
I'm Tripoli deciding that The Young Turks as reference

1393
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:38,656
Ignore all the other time

1394
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:40,192
Groups of use the name Young

1395
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:42,496
It's a pretty common name

1396
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:46,080
Typically the name that's been taken on by people who are trying to change

1397
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:48,384
Change the direction of their own party from within

1398
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:51,200
Princeton's group of New Zealand politicians

1399
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:54,528
The National Party were trying to push for reform in the

1400
01:20:57,088 --> 01:21:01,952
The same is true of group of Republicans who work together after Barry Goldwater Law

1401
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:05,024
Really embarrassingly

1402
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:13,216
These groups all take their name from the Turkish nationalist

1403
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:15,776
Young Turks who were involved

1404
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,080
True

1405
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:21,664
And based on that these groups should have used that name

1406
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:26,784
Rod Stewart shouldn't have made the song called Young Turks

1407
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,088
Different names for all of it

1408
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,112
He should have

1409
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:30,880
You should have left

1410
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:33,440
Sure

1411
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:37,536
That's said I think it's far more plausible just term

1412
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:38,304
Young Turks

1413
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:40,096
It's taken on a completely different

1414
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:42,144
Contacts by the time

1415
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,168
Started the show

1416
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:45,216
And the colloquial meaning of the word complete

1417
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:47,776
Wanted to change the

1418
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:51,360
It also fit the description

1419
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:53,152
Young

1420
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:55,712
It makes sense

1421
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:57,248
Use of the name

1422
01:21:57,504 --> 01:22:00,832
Yeah in political world

1423
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:03,136
Urban South I don't

1424
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,416
That he was trying

1425
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:06,208
Named himself after the turkey

1426
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:06,976
Militia

1427
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:08,512
As much as he was using

1428
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:13,632
If you want to argue about whether any of these

1429
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:15,680
Is the term like I said maybe

1430
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:19,264
Not right

1431
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:23,104
Just because something

1432
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:23,872
Has been

1433
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,272
Laundered

1434
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:32,832
I don't know very very negative

1435
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,648
Threw a bunch

1436
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:37,440
Iterations of

1437
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,000
Positive

1438
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:43,584
You still don't want

1439
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:45,632
Just because

1440
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:47,424
You still not going to call you

1441
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,216
You know

1442
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:51,264
Just don't just don't

1443
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,848
Stormtroopers

1444
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:56,896
Stormtroopers

1445
01:22:58,176 --> 01:23:04,320
Star Wars Universe version

1446
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:08,928
It's not

1447
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,256
Whatever

1448
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,536
I'm not going to defend Jay

1449
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:14,304
Aggressively

1450
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:17,376
Whatever whatever the situation is

1451
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:18,144
Appositive

1452
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:18,912
Far more complicated

1453
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:22,240
He named his group after this

1454
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:23,520
Militia

1455
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:26,336
But what

1456
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:27,872
For sure

1457
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:31,456
Is it dropped an unfortunate bomb

1458
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,480
At the end of his

1459
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,296
Alex is saying that it was Muslim

1460
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,064
Chris

1461
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:40,416
But that's another story

1462
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,232
Definitely another story

1463
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,328
It's a strong indication that Sam Tripoli might be one of these guys who thinks

1464
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:49,376
The most Jewish people are actually Jewish

1465
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:51,680
And actually are the descendants of Kazarian

1466
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,496
That's the same

1467
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:55,264
1

1468
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:57,056
Yeah

1469
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:57,824
God

1470
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:04,224
Maybe maybe maybe unknowingly is pushing for this

1471
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,272
Conspiracy theories maybe or is it

1472
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:11,392
Possible surrounded contacts

1473
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:12,416
That conclusion

1474
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:16,256
Why did that rebuttal come up when Alex said it was Muslims killing Christian

1475
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:22,144
I actually was the Jews hid behind a little code that most people want

1476
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:26,240
Don't even realize

1477
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,008
Right

1478
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:30,336
Free dump

1479
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,616
Since you read online

1480
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:34,432
You show up on the Alex Jones Show and make Eddie Bravo

1481
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:36,992
Super rational

1482
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:39,808
The point you're trying to make would you bring up Kazarian

1483
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:42,624
It's a gigantic buzzword

1484
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,160
Devore anti-semitic areas

1485
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,720
And this

1486
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:47,744
Inform to douche

1487
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,024
Hosta show called

1488
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:52,864
So just go ahead and

1489
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:53,888
This is

1490
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:55,424
This is a red flag

1491
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:00,544
You get somebody who hates

1492
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:06,688
No I'm not

1493
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:12,576
Believe that you'd understand that yeah man

1494
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:18,464
The New World Order is not really really actually

1495
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,256
Turkish people

1496
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:27,424
Take over the world

1497
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,960
You get the birthright back

1498
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:29,984
Esau lost

1499
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:31,008
Man

1500
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:33,824
Compari Lansing

1501
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:35,616
It makes me worried

1502
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:36,896
It makes me worried that

1503
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:40,480
Yeah that

1504
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,576
You can't really definitively say what he means because nothing

1505
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:47,392
Another story

1506
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,672
The way that Alex

1507
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:51,488
Doesn't respond and leaves it hanging Lakes

1508
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:54,816
Alex's maybe you'll wear that like

1509
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:58,656
If this do talk some more

1510
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,032
It's troubling

1511
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:06,848
So I know I guess

1512
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,408
Sam Tripoli on

1513
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:10,688
Alex

1514
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:11,968
Jasper Ephrata

1515
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,088
Obvious

1516
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:21,696
Bait people into

1517
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:22,464
Covering it

1518
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:23,744
Just do it

1519
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,280
Let's take over the moon

1520
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:32,448
You jump back and forth from

1521
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:33,472
Past to present

1522
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:35,264
Used in the past

1523
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,824
He's terrible but

1524
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:39,104
Remove the president

1525
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,200
You see why he's doing

1526
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:46,528
You like

1527
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:51,904
He's the character from Glengarry Glen Ross

1528
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,440
He's what

1529
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:55,232
Lemons character

1530
01:26:55,488 --> 01:27:00,096
Yeah yeah yeah

1531
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:01,376
Realizing that

1532
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:03,168
He doesn't have it anymore any

1533
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:04,704
Did his desperation

1534
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,240
Reek so bad that

1535
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:07,776
Whatever it was

1536
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:09,312
That he was trying to do

1537
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:10,592
So turned off by

1538
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:12,384
Are you out Baldwin

1539
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,576
Are there extra

1540
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:24,160
There's got to be somebody in the background or like

1541
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:33,120
Might be like a bartender

1542
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:37,216
Husband

1543
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:40,288
I'll be the husband

1544
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:44,384
Most venomous place in an office I think Nana restaurant booth

1545
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:51,808
I really sincerely think they're babies

1546
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,160
Okay

1547
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:03,584
Define it's like he's past his prime

1548
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:07,936
Absolutely

1549
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:11,008
In order for him to pull

1550
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:13,056
Needs immediate attention

1551
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:15,616
Pretty heart

1552
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:17,408
Is it

1553
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:18,688
People post

1554
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:19,712
Think about this

1555
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:24,576
The video where he's a dragon

1556
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:25,600
Just over

1557
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:27,392
Racist Asian voice

1558
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:29,440
And that's good I think that

1559
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:33,280
Yeah I wish we didn't talk about it cuz I think

1560
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:34,048
Is it more attention

1561
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,584
But this contacts

1562
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:36,352
Really help

1563
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:37,120
Promote him

1564
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:38,912
It's okay on

1565
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:40,448
On some level for us

1566
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:41,216
Disgusted

1567
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:45,568
This is just a desperate cry for look at

1568
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,384
Yeah look at the saddest man in the world

1569
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:52,480

1570
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:53,504
Yeah

1571
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,296

Covering

1573
01:28:59,392 --> 01:28:59,904
Damn drunk

1574
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:04,768
Cover those things

1575
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:06,304
In order to spread the message

1576
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,584
It's further than he has the

1577
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:08,864
Ability to

1578
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:12,192
So resistant that impulse seems to be what people are doing

1579
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:18,848
I know I don't know we're going to do for Monday

1580

What time to listen to another episode with Eddie and Sam

1581
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:31,904
You are yelling over each other

1582
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:32,672
Trying to get to this

1583
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:33,440
Same benefits

1584
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,328
Everybody's listening and responding appropriately

1585
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:41,120
In the moment they crushed

1586
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:43,680
All the sex
