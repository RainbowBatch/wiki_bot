Another installment where I

4
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:17,408
As a man who listens to

5
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,944
Too much Infowars

6
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:25,600

00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,720
I do you ever heard of it

10
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:35,328
You're right you haven't passed

11
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,096
Into the news

12
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:40,448

18
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,864
Are you at the junior college you dropped out

19
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,168
I mean he did well for himself

20
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:15,520
He's very much like a like one of those Tech billionaire or like Eminem

21
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,848
Proud of it

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,504
Quote from Eminem 12 song

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,112
We got a lot of business to cover so you guys know if your Eagle listeners

24
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,904
You know that last week

25
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,928
Alex Jones

26
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,952
Was on vacation

27
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,232
He was on break

28
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,536
He wasn't in studio and we had tons

29
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,816
Have these been

30
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,840
Dingbat

31
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:43,424
F****** co-host we had the David Knights of the world

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,984
Filling in we had Rodger Stone doing a day

33
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,080
Did Paul Joseph Watson hosting I don't want it I don't want to cover those guys

34
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,640
So we're not we're not we don't have

35
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,432
Flash episodes

36
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,968
The cover right now

37
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,736
So to speak

38
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,784
But when it comes out it'll be Monday

39
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,832
Alex will be back into yo

40
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,136
Super excited about

41
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,184
But while Alex was off

42
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,720
He sent in

43
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,024
A lot of dispatches from the road

44
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,096
Okay he's in a lot of special reports

45
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:16,448
I think those are worth talking about a little bit that's going to be covering

46
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,008
I hear this episode before we do

47
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,800
I wanted to check in because

48
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,360
Our first episode

49
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,640
We listen to Alex

50
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,664
Explain

51
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,224
Was going to take some meeting

52
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,992
Yes

53
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,784
But you didn't want to explain to meeting

54
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,184
But the mainstream media could put two and two together

55
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,952
Was going to be with

56
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,280
I don't need to tell

57
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:45,632
Need to get kudos or a pat on the back

58
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,448
Lots of afraid to leave occupied

59
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:53,312
Texas

60
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,080
Call truck

61
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,664
A little blanket over a lipstick

62
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,992
But on this side when he called to give a special report

63
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:06,368
Music slightly different take on it he's his own in Spain color

64
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,416
Yep okay

65
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,720
Addresses

66
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:16,608
In this clip his co-host

67
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,400
Who's filling in David Knight

68
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,936
Explaining the situation

69
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:31,200
Regardless

70
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,184
Talking to meeting with people everybody I talked to basically against political correctness film almost everybody

71
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,656
Are you taking meetings with people and everyone hates political correct

72
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,960
Hooray

73
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,800
Here's and reveals in his own sentence Wyatt is

74
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,104
Nobody else is talking to him

75
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,504
If somebody likes political correctness

76
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,296
Instigating then run the f*** away

77
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:14,720
Probably

78
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:21,119
With someone giving a warning to break up a party

79
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:29,567
So he's been telling people it's a family vacation

80
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,663
Who's the conspiracy

81
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,783
His mind

82
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,879
Everybody cares where he's going

83
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,439
Sometimes you lie about things you don't have to

84
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,999
I think that's what he thinks he's doing in his head

85
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:54,399
Not realizing that he revealed on his show what he was doing

86
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,751
I'm going to go meet with Trump

87
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,055
Then reveals that

88
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:07,711
While he's been lying and saying he's going on family vacation what she hasn't been doing

89
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:12,063
Now say that he was on a family vacation I haven't heard

90
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:18,463
Patient has never been fed in the history of the world right

91
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,743
Even credit

92
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:24,863
This is working in a different place he's doing his work from the road and God bless

93
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,751
He is our true traveling Kung-Fu

94
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,031
Hero

95
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,311
Geico

96
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:40,223
Video that you put out right before he left

97
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,831
I feel like it's still the beginning of the year and I feel like

98
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,879
You know a lot of people is made resolution

99
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:50,719
You made a resolution

100
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:55,327
At a certain point here but he

101
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,095
Called

102
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,655
The Secret of 2017

103
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,239
And I feel like

104
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,567
He already knows the secret he knows the secret

105
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:10,943
Is this is a really I think it's probably like a 20 minute long video

106
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,759
I've cut out the parts that are superfluous

107
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:18,879
Like what

108
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,303
We're going to take a look at this this video today

109
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,583
This

110
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,375
The Secret of 2017

111
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,655
That I think

112
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:34,239
It's pretty indicative like if you look at this as

113
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,775
Just a microcosm

114
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,567
Of Alex Jones broadcast

115
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,335
Dial

116
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,663
Him to a f****** tea

117
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
So here we go we're going to kick it off

118
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,735
I remember

119
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,271
2006

120
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,391
Over half a year ago

121
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
I was in

122
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,023
Cleveland Ohio

123
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,095
Covering

124
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,655
The RNC

125
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:06,239
I want to be clear I'm not putting in pauses

126
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:12,895
Tom Waits telling story right

127
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,687
Just a little bit

128
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:21,087
Pick it up part of me that thinks like from listening to this that Alex is itching to do

129
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,391
Foodarama

130
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,463
Really wants to start doing dramatic monologue

131
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,999
I don't like it

132
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,119
Wednesday

133
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:39,007
This video is that long I'm not playing 20 minutes

134
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,591
Went over to the Ritz-Carlton

135
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,895
For the main Republicans worst

136
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,735

140
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,951
Keep in mind I want to cut in here real quick to remind you that the name of this video

141
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:01,023
Is the secret of 2017

142
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,839
So just remember when he starts down this road

143
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:10,239
This is the first thought he had in his mind when he made a video called The Secret of 27th

144
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,775
You forgot to add the part where he's at

145
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,311
The way we learn about

146
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:22,271

I don't know if I have to go to you

149
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,511
And we talked about Megyn Kelly

150
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,815
And I said Megyn Kelly

151
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
Seems like

152
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,679

This is true

172
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,783
But it shows how

173
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,575
She gets her hair done in Manhattan

174
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,391
Beautiful little elf woman

175
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,279
I still believe

176
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:43,423
You were laughing over him calling her solace

177
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:49,823
This again but I'm going to attractiveness

178
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:55,967
Disagree with her on her stance is Andres

179
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:08,767
Everyone is gorgeous

180
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:14,655

181
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,727

182
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,055
This clip is gone

183
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:25,919

Harlem to get your hair done you a lefty

185

Is emblematic

191
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,519
The fall

192
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:56,895
Of the peacock globalists narcissistic brainwashing

193
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
That's really

194
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
The takeaway

195
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:07,391
So that this is the first clip and it's like it's a thesis statement

196
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,439
It seems like that's

197
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:12,255
The thesis

198
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,559
To go on this particular subject

199
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,607
Percent

200
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,423
Button

201
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,031
I believe they were

202
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:30,687
I don't know if she I don't know the statistics on that but I know that they did offer her a fat contract to stay at the church

203
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:35,039
Harassed by all

204
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:41,695
Numbers were slipping

205
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,743
A little bit but not like to a profound

206
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,767
Extent

207
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,535
Now

208
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,631
Has he ever criticized Megyn Kelly in the

209
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:56,287
I think so yeah she was the moderator of that debate and

210
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:03,455
Yeah absolutely shouldn't have gotten in the line of fire with a good man

211
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:09,855
I know he's a good man can I ask you question these elves are coming up on our Orange

212
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,135
Toes

213
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:17,535
Overarching narrative that they have that is like the

214
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,559
Media are bullies

215
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,607
And that like keeps coming up

216
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,191
And it's so like I do believe that Alex would think that like

217
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,983
Asking Trump hard questions

218
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,007
Is bullying

219
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,287
And it sets

220
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,311
Nuts

221
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:35,711
Spell completely. That control the Press everything he always says this

222
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,783
Everything that you accused of

223
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,807
Asif

224
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
Is what they're doing

225
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:44,159
Yep

226
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
If we don't do it

227
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
They're going to do at 2

228
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:54,143
Preemptive justification in the same way that China

229
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,167
Russia have reserved

230
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,703
The right to First Strike

231
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,031
Nuclear attack

232
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,591
I assume they didn't cancel that reservation right

233
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,919
I mean tables ready

234
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,783
Interesting Lee that is his

235
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,623
Opening volley of the secrets of 2017

236
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,719
Maybe that's the direction he's going to go

237
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,511
This might not be the case

238
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,303
Here's some more words about Megyn Kelly

239
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,351
Houston

240
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
And

241
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,983
Look at these parts

242
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,919
Megyn Kelly is a dumb blonde cheerleader

243
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,735
Looked okay

244
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,551
Fox

245
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,111
See that's

246
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:52,511
That's so unfair on a number of levels he's justifying

247
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:58,911
Sounds drunk who is

248
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:05,311
Like he's been on the road for a long time he's sitting next to

249
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,079
He's drunk

250
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
He's just

251
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,687
Rambling she's like what I thought about her appearance

252
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:17,087
The directions. He's the only one who seems intelligent at all

253
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:21,951
Like a dumb cheerleader archetype

254
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:28,607
Kind of archetype with her position but she does seem like a f****** whip-crack

255
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:32,191
Tracking smart lady and substantial

256
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,263
She seems like someone who has borne this out

257
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,287
In interviews

258
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,567
She's Not Just

259
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:42,687
Repeating things in the interview and questions based on what the people say

260
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:49,087
Which is why the haters because if you respond with an answer and then

261
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,135
That's hard

262
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,671
Skip over

263
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,487
Insinuates

264
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,767
Like a certain

265
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,703
Super the school might have a Gravely

266
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:11,103
For the second time in the Phantom 3 minutes women but this woman isn't ugly coups

267
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,151
Really went after why is he going

268
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:17,503
Appearance looks like a witch Bush League

269
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
But

270
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:22,111
You know when you really get down to it I don't know if he has many other tools

271
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,903
You know like other than Bush League

272
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,999
Stop in in Peru consult

273
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,023
We got more

274
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,303
Pixar soul

275
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:36,191
Ugly

276
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,239
Failed ship

277
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,287
Because she feels reject

278
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,127
After buying a lie

279
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,759
This is just her thinking oh my God I'm hated Fox

280
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,807
Let me go

281
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,855
NBC

282
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,463
Cuz those failures those vampires

283
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,767
Swindling

284
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,303
So that was just fanfiction

285
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,375
Assume what she was thinking

286
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:08,959
He thinks

287
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
She told her friends

288
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
But I'm ugly

289
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:17,151
Now he's absolve himself

290
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:23,551
He just repeated what she said never heard anybody telling us

291
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
Psychic

292
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,391
Cup me absolutely knows what she's dealing with

293
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,951
Okay

294
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,975
Alright

295
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:37,887
Is he everywhere at all times does he have everything bugs because it seems like everything's does is like

296
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,167
I know that

297
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,447
3 people

298
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,007
Yep

299
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,591
Small little camera setup wherever

300
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,151
Well I mean

301
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:53,503
Right now

302
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,807
He probably does

303
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:00,927
Let me think about it generally don't come out of people who don't have some sort of feeling

304
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:06,047
No outright hate is usually covering up some sort of

305
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,839
Conflict

306
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,911
You must have loved

307
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,935
At some point

308
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:16,543
Yeah you'll feel betrayed

309
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,383
Feels like he's been left behind

310
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:27,039
By the one she's the one that got away so now again I have to remind you and I'm going to constantly remind

311
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,855
This is the secret of 27

312
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,159
Describe the opening minutes

313
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:38,559
We're on 10 minutes

314
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,375
We have the focus abilities

315
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:45,471
Taking crack speed and Azan

316
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,751
Yeah

317
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,311
Taking up the beginning of the secret 2016

318
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:55,967
It personally attacked the appearance of Megyn Kelly over and over again and assume what she's thinking but

319
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,527
Really what it's all about

320
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,575
Also about how good a man

321
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,391
Alex Jones

322
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,671
I'm just an average person

323
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
Who has a will

324
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,255
Justice bound

325
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,791
Northrup

326
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,447
I don't want to go

327
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,055
Weird functions

328
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,591
Dinners

329
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
Fake

330
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,639
Charity event

331
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,247
Take photos of you just so you feel big

332
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,927
I'll tell

333
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,511
Luby's

334
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,351
500

335
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,143
Mountain

336
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:52,543
You might think that this is going to a I support local business

337
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,079
Redeeming factor in this

338
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,103
Log truck

339
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,455
Long and seemingly drunken

340
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,015
He is about to tell a story

341
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,575
That never happen

342
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,903
To illustrate why he's a great man

343
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:11,231
So we're back to the spaceship car

344
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:14,303
1000%

345
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:20,959
Champagne and enjoy some

346
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,727
Bulshit time

347
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:22,751
Already

348
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,287
When I grow up

349
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,919
It wasn't till about 6 years ago that I don't know

350
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,527
That your old ladies online would always been in line with stoves

351
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,599
Have the money

352
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,159
And a little purse bag

353
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
There weren't

354
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,151
And what's that

355
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:08,831
What is currently

356
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,367
This whole life

357
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,207
Here's why this didn't happen

358
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:20,607
I don't think of Alex Jones number of reasons isn't possibly a charitable

359
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,399
That's entirely possible

360
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,447
But this story didn't happen

361
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:29,311
Because no one goes to a restaurant and being

362
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,335
You stay home

363
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:35,199
One day out of

364
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,527
He's again this is Megyn Kelly's thoughts he's assuming you have no idea

365
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,575
So okay

366
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:44,927
Alright

367
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,999
So this is happened a few times

368
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,071
Apparently

369
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,631
Cmovies

370
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,423
If you know these peoples names

371
00:20:55,935 --> 00:21:00,543
Can he give us any details about them other than their there old women cry

372
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,103
Xavier son

373
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:09,759
Do a news report

374
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:13,599
Feel better

375
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,416
It was at my whole life

376
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,280
My two years old

377
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:22,816
Never heard

378
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,168
Equality

379
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,216
Cheaper

380
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,104
License

381
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
Songs ever had

382
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,944
Relate the story to Obama

383
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,248
Also inflation

384
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:45,088
Food is worse Melville

385
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:51,232
It's cheaper but there's inflation

386
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,280
I don't understand

387
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,096
Is that is that is a

388
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,120
Twisted

389
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,400
That's a

390
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,680
Pretzel of a thought

391
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,472
Against like you're getting

392
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,800
This is the secret of 2017

393
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:11,712
Megyn Kelly is ugly and insecure so she ran away to NBC

394
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:18,112
Increasing inflation and it Alex Jones is a good man because he overheard some

395
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,160
Old women talk about

396
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,208
Paper food they ordered

397
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:27,584
Coin purses business supposed to be now

398
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,984
But he's still referencing coin purses from occupied Texas

399
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,920
Now he get I don't know when Texas is in the world

400
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,992
It's in the 50s

401
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,784
So now here's where he gets

402
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,088
A little bit

403
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,368
Off the chain

404
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,928
Obama

405
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,072
On a jumbo jet and playing golf

406
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,936
And sitting around delusional cuz he's black so it's okay to say

407
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,472
Black people got to be poor

408
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,568
He was chosen by the stick

409
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,104
Inbred corporate

410
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,128
Blue blood

411
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,320
The screw is over

412
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,600
We got a bunch of Narcissus

413
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,648
Who want to be on their news

414
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,440
Their shows their channels

415
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,976
Feel like we've arrived

416
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,768
So we'll sell our own family

417
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,304
Be part of them

418
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,840
Yeah

419
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:35,424
Okay

420
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:42,592
He's playing these clips on his phone and in lieu of actually having anything to look at

421
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:48,224
Just been staring at his phone so stupid paper cuz I don't understand

422
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,016
He went

423
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,064
That was a

424
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,184
What was the crazy triple Lindy triple axel

425
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,024
That was the Tony Hawk hitting a 720

426
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,072
Random

427
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:09,472
Because Obama's black he can tell black people there should be pores that's one thing

428
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:14,336
Understand you get off okay

429
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,640
I know he said he's not saying that

430
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,432
Literally saying that the world

431
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:24,320
Think that which is also not true

432
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,136
It's because Obama's already even more racist

433
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:27,904
Then me

434
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,256
Double Reverse Racism

435
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:36,864
Now the cars and microwaves thing

436
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:46,336
That's an old that's an old Chestnut of Alex's X

437
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,688
Obama telling third-world Nations

438
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,224
But they can't have cars

439
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,992
And air conditioning

440
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:58,880
Are you didn't really tell them that as much as it is

441
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,744
Uplifting

442
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,280
Conversation

443
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,072
Before we begin

444
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:08,608
No cars

445
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:12,960
For now on

446
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:16,544
What the f*** I think

447
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,640
I looked into this a while back because it was one of those that I was like

448
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,176
There's no way that's accurate

449
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:28,576
Azure modernizing we should find better way

450
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,136
To modernize than the ones we've used

451
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,464
Which is a very sensible thing to do

452
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:40,096
But you know it's easy to paint with a broad brush and say like nope

453
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,632
No cars

454
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,912
Really easy

455
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,936
Because he did it in

456
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,216
20 words

457
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:45,984
Yep

458
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:50,336
So now we get into the at the end he was talking about how

459
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,920
Everyone wants to get involved peacock Network

460
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,712
Yes he does

461
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:59,040
Which actually I come up a couple times

462
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,808
I believe

463
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,112
Yeah no a great-aunt

464
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:02,880
You know like

465
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,440
Do you think do you think anybody's offered him a job

466
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,256
No one bigger than he is

467
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,048
I don't think okay

468
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,912
I don't think maybe at some point in the past like Fox News might have

469
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,728
Or something like that I don't think

470
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:21,056
Michael Savage had a show

471
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,592
I don't even know who Michael

472
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:28,224
Of the Savage Nation no idea

473
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,016
Horrible

474
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:34,368
It's like Alex Jones but without right hate

475
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,160
From an old Jewish dude

476
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,720
Actual name is Michael weiner

477
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,000
But

478
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:46,656
He calls himself we did good change himself The Savage Nation

479
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:58,688
Listen to all the time when I was younger

480
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,456
A wiener

481
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,016
He's going to go to prison

482
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:03,808
In

483
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,112
A tweener nation in there

484
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:09,184
Michael Savage

485
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:12,512
Is an amazing storyteller

486
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,584
Do you tell these stories about his daily life that were in

487
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,352
Gauging

488
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,424
Full of detail

489
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,728
Unfortunately was a hateful big

490
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,056
Fox News gave him a show

491
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,104
Like around 9

492
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:31,456
I think they gave it to him before but then it was canceled

493
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:34,272
Pretty close

494
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:38,624
Was imagine his anti-muslim bigotry would have gone weight

495
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,392
Too far even for

496
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,952
For them he made a guy cry on air

497
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:45,536
Jesus blew his Muslim who was just like

498
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,328
Still trying to have it it's like

499
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:52,448
A debate about stuff

500
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:56,800
He also had a gay rights activist on the told me hope he died of AIDS

501
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,336
Yeah

502
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:04,736
Yeah it sounds like they gave him a show on Fox News and then had to cancel it cuz it was f****** like

503
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,784
And I don't think Alex is nearly as bad as

504
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:07,808
Michael Savage

505
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,856
But I think I take those Networks

506
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,904
I think those networks learned a lesson from that

507
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
That was like

508
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:15,232
Hog and even Rush Limbaugh can't have it

509
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,256
TV show

510
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,536
Will get sued

511
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:21,376
He does do the live broadcast

512
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:25,984
That's not Food Network

513
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,752
Senor fox hunting

514
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,032
What would

515
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:32,384
So easy if he did go if else

516
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,480
I assumed he would lose

517
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,760
Just about all of his

518
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:40,064
Listener bass like using now

519
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,856
I think

520
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:48,256
It depends if you went to like a cable network I think you might be able to pull off some of the bulshit but he says

521
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,680
Independent credibility

522
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:00,288
25 years of

523
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,056
Isabel news out

524
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,896
Okay

525
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,688
Be specific

526
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:10,272
The point of this was I do believe him when he says that he doesn't want to go to

527
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,856
He says he wants to do is what he's doing

528
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,416
Hundred percent

529
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:23,328
Now we have agreed with Alex Jones I just want to give him a

530
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,216
So now he goes on to talk about other

531
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:29,984
Stuff that

532
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,008
Is maybe more.

533
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,616
I've been on air 21 years

534
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,640
Almost

535
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:38,944
In April

536
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,784
Say this to say I'm sorry

537
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:43,808
Kickback

538
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,136
I say this to you realized

539
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:47,904
Wall Street

540
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,440
Madison Avenue

541
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,488
All of them an offer

542
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,096
I've been in major

543
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,656
I just realized early on

544
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:09,408
Don't you love that Mama

545
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:11,968
Set the drunk moments

546
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,112
The Gorge

547
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:26,048
Because I'm still agreeing with him that idea that Wall Street has nothing to offer you

548
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:29,632
Independent this is LP

549
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,936
Ford

550
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:34,496
So far the only thing and that's it

551
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,288
He's not saying this

552
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,056
To make him sound like

553
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:37,824
Like a badass

554
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,616
Exactly

555
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:46,272
Movies I want to I am I did a little research

556
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
Credits

557
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:51,136
Documentaries like loose change

558
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:53,440
Who directed those or store funded

559
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:57,024
The three movies he's been in as an actor

560
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,328
Well he was into Richard linklater movies

561
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,680
As the guy driving around in the car screaming in a bullhorn

562
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:09,312
About how humanity is too good to be taken over by opposing forces

563
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,080
F****** cast

564
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,152
Equator Boston

565
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:18,272
Alex Jones when Alex was like a public access host

566
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,320
So whenever you started make movies

567
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,600
He always had like this

568
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,392
Image of this guy in his head

569
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,696
And to also he was in A Scanner Darkly

570
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:35,680
Both characters who are crazy people screaming on the street and bullhorn

571
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:39,520
Then called amerigeddon

572
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:44,128
Amerigeddon

573
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,944
He plays a minor role as a politician

574
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,760
It was directed by Chuck Norris's son

575
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:55,904
Another movie also features Infowars as a media outlet that tells the truth in a sea of Lies

576
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,184
David Knight

577
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,720
Plays the broadcast

578
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,768
Infowars in the movie

579
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,072
Being in this movie

580
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,608
Kind of his PR

581
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,960
Like being in it isn't it's not a major movie also it's amerigeddon

582
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,616
I watch the trailer

583
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:22,016
And it's Wacky Tacky hours on IMDb

584
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:27,136
I don't know I don't want to watch the whole thing behind

585
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:32,768
Thank God it's that as LSD

586
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,560
Ride that out

587
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,328
Here's the plot

588
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:41,472
A fictional depiction of a future where in a globalist terrorist organization aligned with the United Nations

589
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,800
To disable the United States power grid in insta

590
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,824
Tatuta martial law

591
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:50,176
It will take a dedicated family of Patriots

592
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:56,576
And the remains of the Second Amendment to save America and reclaim its freedom

593
00:32:56,832 --> 00:33:02,720
Plot point in the movie took from the trailer is that The Army Goes Around

594
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:03,488
Wow

595
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:09,888
Which is just basically the wet dreams open till 1

596
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,264
Obsessed with the power grid

597
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:19,104
Keeps coming that keeps showing up here is that

598
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,920
He thinks that the power grid is

599
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,224
Only thing between us

600
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,040
And granddaughter Zombie Chaos

601
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,600
I don't

602
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:32,160
Things I've read I don't know I'm not next

603
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:36,000
The power grid is fairly vulnerable

604
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,792
Okay that could be attacked

605
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,072
Inner wave at

606
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,352
Would leave us

607
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,656
I mean like

608
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:45,984
It is it is someone you don't think about all the implication

609
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,752
Comes of it

610
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:49,824
Lakers effect that would go through like

611
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,664
Internet going down markets would that would suffer from it

612
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,224
The ability to around

613
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,248
There would be

614
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:03,648
If you're going to choose a paranoid fantasy that's not a terrible one

615
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,232
It's much better than like bird flu

616
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,512
Like

617
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:12,096
Although he was scared of Berkeley

618
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,728
Okay

619
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,360
Alright

620
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:26,432
Elizabeth Blackwell

621
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:33,344
Communist Chinese

622
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,160
Play Russia

623
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,000
But but here's a what

624
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,816
Is that in

625
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:45,120
Like if the globalist

626
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,448
We'll destroy them

627
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:54,848
More so than anybody else

628
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,200
Get down like

629
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:05,600
What would you even consider like

630
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,696
If it drops

631
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,488
15000 because of a

632
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,024
Powergrid meltdown

633
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:19,424
The entire world falls apart

634
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,776
Is a lot of war room to drop

635
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,080
I think the A's argument that he would make

636
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:29,152
Put words in his mouth but he would say that the globalist

637
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:33,248
Something know that they're going to do what they've made preparations for they have underground bunkers

638
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,272
They have

639
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,832
Supplies and Munitions and stuff like that

640
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:40,160
They can hide it out while the rest of us kill each other off in the street

641
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,464
Because

642
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:46,560
Because hunger sets in and you become an animal

643
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:51,424
Do you know how this happens in small-scale situation

644
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:57,056
I don't know like how when Russia invaded the Ukraine

645
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,592
I can just call it you

646
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,456
The Ukraine extreme risk

647
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:08,320
Seinfeld

648
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:09,856
Vietnam

649
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,672
So this happened

650
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,744
Situations like

651
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,560
Got any number of the

652
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,400
What always happens

653
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,168
And is not

654
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,704
Everybody starts killing

655
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:28,288
What always happens if people actually go

656
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:31,872
The band We're All in This Together We are all trying to say

657
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:37,760
Yeah

658
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,576
Channels that are normal because

659
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,696
Explode optimism doesn't sell

660
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:48,256
Survival supplies

661
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:54,144
Paranoia and fear is really the only marketing force that works when your business model is set up to

662
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,472
Anyway Alex Jones

663
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:00,032
And like I need to do a way better job of

664
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:05,664
This one's just called Integrity Rambo

665
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,688
So

666
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,456
Android

667
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,528
You want a book deal every year for free

668
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,624
10 million dollars

669
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,696
You want $10 for your contractor

670
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,024
You will be

671
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,560
The next Rush Limbaugh

672
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,376
I told no they said

673
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,400
I am

674
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:27,936
President

675
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:28,960
Program

676
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,008
I don't

677
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,568
You're going to turn down three.

678
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,432
That didn't happen

679
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,200
No

680
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,736
How much does he make

681
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:45,344
I assume that he threw out

682
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,880
1.8

683
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:49,952
Do not use doing that as roleplay

684
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:56,352
He was being the head of another Network offering him a job

685
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:04,800
Head of a network isn't making $2000000 a year

686
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,848
Really small in that one might be like

687
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,176
Like QVC even with

688
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:10,944
Cops

689
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,760
Liquid

690
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:20,672
Net worth

691
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,976
Listen to this I used to work at a lab

692
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:29,632
I am the owner like not even the owner of the lab but like the head of one of the departments in the lab made

693
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,728
So like

694
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:40,128
But like the idea that the head of a broadcast network isn't making two million a year is b*******

695
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:44,736
Are we talkin programming head cuz that's probably what

696
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:52,672
So we will be looking at

697
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,232
Let's just throw out a wind

698
00:38:55,744 --> 00:39:00,352
For the major motion picture

699
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:06,752
What is happening

700
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:09,312
But before we go any further

701
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,872
I couldn't possibly

702
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:13,920
I could not have to

703
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,736
It's it's very mysterious

704
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,528
Cuz I don't think

705
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,576
Actually done a bunch of research

706
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:26,464
In the last couple days about his advertising model

707
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,280
I don't understand where the money is coming from

708
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,840
Necessarily

709
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:35,424
Millions of people are buying these weird supplement

710
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,704
I don't

711
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,472
Like

712
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,264
On his show there aren't

713
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,288
What time is that

714
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,336
What is website there are

715
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:45,152
So I don't know what's going on exactly

716
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,200
And like shows like Glenn Beck

717
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,224
Sean Hannity

718
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,296
They actually had waist smaller audience

719
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:56,672
They were being propped up by billionaire republicanism

720
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,208
For the longest time

721
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:04,608
Like even if the show isn't profitable

722
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:07,936
It's to their advantage if they have a fear-mongering monster

723
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:14,592
Throwing everything at the wall to see who's going to do it's conceivably the I think they would look at it as

724
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,384
Like through the antidote to NPR

725
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,432
Or something like that

726
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:24,576
That has been the model for very long time I think it's entirely possible.

727
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:34,816
Speak quickly I think he might be getting some sort of money from somebody some like Angel

728
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,608
Or something like that

729
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:43,264
I don't know I would say that a lot more people are buying this up

730
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,288
Bloomington

731
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,104
The amount of money that it would take to run his operation

732
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:48,640
Big

733
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,944
Yeah how many people does he have on staff

734
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,808
If you talk about just in front of the camera personalities there's at least like 7

735
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,088
I know there's got to be so

736
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:59,392
Behind-the-scenes crew editors

737
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,672
Cuz he puts out likes

738
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,208
So much f****** material

739
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,232
Like

740
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:09,632
Operation

741
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,472
It makes me

742
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,520
F****** SoJO

743
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,544
Quit like a

744
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,384
4 hours of the Alex Jones Show on a daily basis

745
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:25,248
And that he has Infowars Nightly News

746
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,552
Would you like another 2-hour show usually

747
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:32,160
Hosted by likely Ann McAdoo or one of the other

748
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:38,304
I love her so much

749
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:44,704
The classic Outlaw day but she's got big old big old titties

750
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,824
And I hate to say that because we just got done critiquing Alex for his

751
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,640
That's more just a reference to the days of yore

752
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,431
Sure and I would never

753
00:41:55,967 --> 00:42:02,111
I just had on I-25

754
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,903
Maybe from

755
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,183
Several

756
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,463
Well-known

757
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:10,815
People from that set era

758
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,583
Call myself

759
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,119
Whenever starting

760
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,655
You know we're doing it

761
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:21,055
Pretty harsh criticism job apply to myself as well

762
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:25,407
To a higher standard than drunken Alex

763
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:26,943
My

764
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:27,967
Integrity

765
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,735
It's like saying

766
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,527
Would you give up your eyeball

767
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:31,807
Probably.

768
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,367
Wine

769
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:39,999
Totally would have money

770
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,047
7

771
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:44,351
School hero

772
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,423
That's a normal move somebody that's

773
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,447
Wake Ally

774
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,263
It is a partisan

775
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,311
That's what I don't get

776
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,615
Is it it's so clear to me

777
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:58,431
The world

778
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,991
Trailblazing

779
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,295
Resist

780
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:09,183
Arkansas pathetic I told dirty

781
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:12,511
My half-assed attempt

782
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,751
Who I am

783
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:31,711
So this is where we Greenwood just kicks in

784
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:36,831
What do you say at the end of there that's really where I think he's itching for drama

785
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:37,855
Set like

786
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:44,255
Yeah take out tomorrow that would be Independence that's what that was

787
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:48,863
Independence Day speech

788
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:55,263
Taking out the eye for a billion dollars that he's just suggested himself is a literal offer that someone's made

789
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,055
I mean white and also what would they

790
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:04,735
They probably put them in with the fetuses if they harvested and pizzagate

791
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:07,807
Well what I would do is put them into an Alex Jones

792
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:11,647
The great that you could look into

793
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:17,279
To the truth already stolen

794
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,047
If you steal his eyes

795
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:20,351
That's true makes perfect sense

796
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:25,727
I think you look you first came in with the Alex Jones is drunk Theory which is amazing

797
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,775
And then you come in with the second

798
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:30,335
I think you're killing it

799
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:35,199
Who's another note you made

800
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:40,319
Has anybody ever described a rocket scientist

801
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:50,815
Demerol

802
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,095
Debatable

803
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,031
Rocket scientist

804
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:04,895
I can think of one season of Survivor

805
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:14,879
He was f****** hot as s*** and it was a rocket.

806
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:17,439
For people on Medicaid

807
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:21,279
Work on on the Manhattan Project

808
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:24,863
I can't remember his name

809
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,935
He was a Satanist

810
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:32,287
Rocket scientist who got mixed in with Aleister Crowley

811
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:38,687
Crowley is absolutely bananas

812
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:43,551
Manhattan Project

813
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:50,975
F****** gorgeous about this clip is in the same way earlier he was like

814
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:54,047
That was when they were trying to get me into the club

815
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,071
Maybe they weren't

816
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:59,167
Who's the same moment of insecurity here where he's like

817
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,191
He's like

818
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:02,751
I don't think that what we're doing is that great

819
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:09,151
That was my half-ass.

820
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:12,223
I'm worried the name of the rocket scientist is Jack Parson

821
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:15,807
Okay

822
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,671
But do you think you the flavor

823
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:25,023
I didn't probably

824
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,047
Because Alex has some bad thing

825
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:27,839
Okay

826
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,031
Totally unhappy

827
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:38,335
That managers about to kill him

828
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,103
Mafia

829
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,407
I don't have that

830
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,175
Big houses

831
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:43,967
Kardashian

832
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:45,503
Closet

833
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,087
Pupils small

834
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,767
See here's the thing

835
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:03,423
I totally agree with him on that one hundred percent agree with absolutely

836
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:09,823
Listen to drunken introspection

837
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,943
Jvna

838
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:19,039
Threesome the others

839
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:19,807
Tim Gunn like

840
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:20,831
I don't know what

841
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,135
My half

842
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,183
This world

843
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,023
He's like

844
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:35,423
Maybe half an hour of tape away from saying I'm not sure

845
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:39,775
I'm making this up

846
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:46,175
Things that are like

847
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:51,039
Celebrity worship is kind of a toxic idea

848
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:03,839
Instead of having a celebrity

849
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,887
Name of the celebrities for the situation they're in

850
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,167
I'm secondarily

851
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,959
It's wacky to be like

852
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,895
The fund the founder

853
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:21,503
The foundation of Alex Jones is understanding of celebrity culture is the everyone

854
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:24,831
Who's famous has gone through like MK Ultra conditioning

855
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,599
They're all

856
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:27,391
Ritualistic abused

857
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:31,231
Maybe that's not fully what he believes but there's colonel.

858
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:37,631
Anything of handlers that will kill him to get out of Houston died

859
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:42,495
Okay Marilyn Monroe

860
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:47,103
Of course absolutely she's the original right before that but she's

861
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,383
Couches big one

862
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,663
Anyway

863
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:52,991
Agreed on the celebrity worship stuff

864
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,271
This clip

865
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,295
Is not over

866
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,319
Get

867
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,343
Weird

868
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,647
Excellent it is further proof

869
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:02,207
Tickets might be dropped

870
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,231
It doesn't

871
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:09,631
Okay we get a glimpse into his psyche and what life he would like to be living and it's

872
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:12,191
Rain

873
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:15,263
You might have with my dad cuz I think you're going to blow glass

874
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,895
I don't care

875
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,663
Power Trip

876
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,735
I've been

877
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:26,783
The top

878
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,623
Top

879
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:39,839
Farmhouse

880
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,119
Fields around

881
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,423
Growing

882
00:49:55,711 --> 00:50:00,831
Now keep in mind we have to finish the clip butts

883
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:05,439
His what I think is fake crying

884
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:09,023
Is what's going on

885
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:11,583
He's doing the hand over the face and they like

886
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,375
Kind of noises but yeah it

887
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:15,679
He's presenting crying

888
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,959
Coronavirus video

889
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,727
Final

890
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:18,495
Part of this.

891
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,799
A holster

892
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:30,271
Otherwise much like there I thought I thought there was more it's just a farmhouse

893
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,599
Filter supposed to be agrarian apparently

894
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:39,999
If that's your fantasy I mean to me the first thing I thought of was

895
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:43,583
He thinks of himself as Russell Crowe in the movie Gladiator

896
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,631
That's what's happening

897
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:49,215
Movies

898
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:52,287
Can you toss me my coat safely without knocking this over

899
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,055
Absolutely

900
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,103
This is

901
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:55,871
Dude Perfect

902
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:00,991
Okay so he's sounds

903
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:07,647
So f****** depressed

904
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:13,791
Can Alcoholics Anonymous meeting

905
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:14,559
The desk

906
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:18,655
He's like his the top

907
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,983
Rain being

908
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:25,567
Famous and in the system that's the bottom

909
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,591
Where he's at

910
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,615
At the top baby

911
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,663
Here's something that I want to propose

912
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,199
A potential

913
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:40,671
Amerigeddon

914
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,719
Three major motion picture

915
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:48,351
Suggestions of will give you a 3 million-dollar book deal every year

916
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,119
The bottom

917
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:55,519
Three-year contract for ten million they offered him a lot Alex

918
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,383
So I think

919
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:02,687
I think this assessment that he's pretty depressed

920
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:07,295
Might be right on and here's what I want to suggest in terms of if we look at the narrative

921
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:10,367
Before he left for break

922
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,903
Right before he left for break

923
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,439
This is

924
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,231
And I think

925
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:20,351
There was a piece in his head that he thought he was going to die

926
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:21,887
Really

927
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:24,703
I think that there's a chance that he thinks

928
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:26,239
This is his last message

929
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,823
Supply Maybe

930
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:36,479
Because I don't know I don't know still haven't established whether or not we believe he believes what

931
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:40,831
We're still in this Labyrinth

932
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:47,231
Is he is he playing us does he believe it does he believe some of it as we would like another communist

933
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:50,815
Bolivar like a just a

934
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:52,607
Propaganda onions

935
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:55,679
It's insane I want to know I want to know more about

936
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,775
I genuinely want to go to a bar with him

937
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:04,895
And just listen to him talk in a I'm not sure you do

938
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:05,919
Maybe that's a good point

939
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:09,247
Cuz he act like this when he's drunk

940
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,271
Wellbutrin

941
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,039
This is

942
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,319
This is fascinating

943
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,719
A bummer

944
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:25,119
Which is kind of why I have this little turtle of thought that maybe he thinks he's

945
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,143
Going to die

946
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:29,471
If you look at it through that prism

947
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,495
It's fascinating

948
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,359
It's fascinating because it's like

949
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:38,431
What would your last message be if you had a flock

950
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,479
And this is what he chooses to do

951
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,527
If you look at it through that lens

952
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:46,367
It's super bizzarri started by shiting on Megyn Kelly

953
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:52,255
But it makes sense why you wouldn't talk about Ruby's Diner

954
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:55,071
I wish I lived in a farmhouse in new my neighbors

955
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:58,911
Like this sort of thing kind of comes into focus a little bit

956
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:01,215
Bristol Moravian die

957
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,007
Why am I

958
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,799
Feeling sorry for Alex Jones

959
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:09,919
I think we have empathy within our hearts and

960
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,199
The others don't

961
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:18,879
You goes on from nothing out in between those two clips talks about how we should live in farmhouse

962
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:19,903
How's the newer Neighbors

963
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:21,439
Into this next thought

964
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,487
Which he liked the band

965
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:25,535
He would hate them

966
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:28,351
You would hate to have a good song

967
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:30,911
Highlights

968
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:33,983
One of their songs

969
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:40,383
I think you realize that he's forgotten that

970
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:42,175
He's doing the political show

971
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:44,991
He had to jump back to politics

972
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:48,319
And he says one of the things that I think is this

973
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,855
Rangers

974
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,903
I've even heard come out of his mouth

975
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:54,719
Get your butthole ready

976
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:57,535
Trump doesn't

977
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,143
Superhot

978
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:03,935
He does that

979
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,471
Because he knows.

980
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,031
And its whole life

981
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,567
Plan

982
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,175
Wow

983
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,455
Wow

984
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:18,271
Unpack that f****** settings

985
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,295
So this

986
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,855
The whole Trump thing

987
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,391
Has been age

988
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,671
Sleeper Cell

989
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:28,255
What's Bronx from

990
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,023
Baby

991
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,047
From her

992
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,839
From birds

993
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,143
Okay now is he is striving

994
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:35,935
Trump

995
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,495
Consciousness

996
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:39,263
From

997
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,287
More less

998
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:46,943
One of the front birth I'm being I'm being hyperbolic but when did he think this plan came up because

999
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,479
Trump has been Rich since

1000
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:49,247
Yes

1001
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,527
But he's not into it

1002
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:57,439
Although every indication all of his behavior

1003
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:02,303
I mean obviously he's really good because that's being rich

1004
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:13,311
Because he knows it because he knows that we're trapped in materialism

1005
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,615
And that that is what's going to

1006
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:18,943
Empresa that's what's going to endear him to us

1007
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:19,967
He's like

1008
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,015
He's a good man

1009
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:24,063
It's like it's bad

1010
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:28,415
Yo that's a good point

1011
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,695
That maybe Trump

1012
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,231
Is not the man he thinks

1013
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:34,559
I'm going to bed I'm just bending someone who's undefendable

1014
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:38,399
To some extent I think I think there is that that that glimmer there

1015
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:41,983
Also has to have started to figure out

1016
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,007
That

1017
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,287
All of the stuff that he

1018
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,311
Thought Trump was going to

1019
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:47,359
To do he's signaling that he's not going to do

1020
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,895
I don't think he's starting to

1021
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:49,663
Figure that out

1022
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,943
So you don't think so

1023
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:55,551
In much the same way that I do believe there are forces

1024
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:56,831
Behind the scenes

1025
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:58,879
That are a bit more nefarious

1026
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,671
Fan are being presented

1027
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,207
I think Alex might

1028
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,231
Be

1029
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,023
He might become a

1030
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:08,351
He might also be compromised

1031
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,119
Okay

1032
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,679
I don't mean he was on Russian television

1033
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:16,799
Being told American

1034
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:23,455
What an americanism is over

1035
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:27,295
So long and stupid

1036
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:33,695
Don't go there

1037
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,231
Don't give them any more twice

1038
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,535
Definitely don't mind

1039
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:43,167
I'm not saying for sure that he is and I don't want to speculate cuz

1040
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,703
Obviously there's no evidence

1041
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:48,799
Change so dramatically about Trump

1042
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:51,615
That it does bring into question like what

1043
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,639
What is going on

1044
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:54,943
I was watching clip with him earlier today

1045
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:58,783
He was talking about how Ted Cruz and Sarah Palin would be a perfect ticket

1046
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:03,903
He literally was saying you was having wet dreams

1047
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:09,023
About that being a ticket he was like

1048
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:14,143
It's insane like to go from that head Cruise

1049
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,191
Is so big a jump

1050
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:19,775
Yeah let me that clip was in like a late 2015

1051
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:21,055
So it's not like

1052
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,079
That was

1053
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:24,127
Decades ago

1054
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,919
That it's bizarre

1055
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:30,783
The the

1056
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:34,367
Compromising this is from Trump himself

1057
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,671
Or from Rodger Stone

1058
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,719
Do you think Trump gives him a lot of problems

1059
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:39,999
Oh yeah

1060
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:40,767
Okay

1061
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,303
No

1062
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:45,887
Talk about this

1063
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:48,703
For one of the ways you can compromise

1064
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:53,567
Like without any threat due to butter up there you go

1065
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:56,639
As Trump shown any inclination towards

1066
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,687
Putin

1067
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:03,039
Okay that's good compliments Putin all the goddamn time

1068
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:07,135
I don't know

1069
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,927
Trump was on Alex

1070
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:13,535
So he appeared on the show when he was running

1071
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:14,815
No thank you

1072
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:16,351
Basically

1073
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:18,911
You're going to be really excited

1074
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,191
About me

1075
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,727
I won't let you down

1076
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:23,263
That kind of that was the center

1077
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,799
Fajita

1078
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:30,175
No but you also talks about how the good work that he's doing if you believe the things that Alex

1079
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:34,783
Trump called him to thank him for his help after he wants okay

1080
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:38,367
Bli

1081
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:40,671
But that does seem like something that is plausible

1082
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:41,439
Definitely

1083
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:44,767
Put no

1084
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:52,447
No I think you did way too far into the world of like speculation and it's

1085
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:58,847
You're right we need a plan that Trump has had

1086
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:01,407
Yeah it's to put together this entire persona

1087
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,199
Well

1088
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:05,503
In order to trick us into loving him

1089
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:10,879
Isn't the whole

1090
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:12,671
Supposed to be in like a benevolent

1091
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:17,535
Decent person actually like you

1092
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,583
The people who don't like him

1093
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:20,607
Are the ones that

1094
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:23,167
Are mostly like aren't they the ones who Heath

1095
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,703
Thinkserver into celebrity culture

1096
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,263
Yeah it's convoluted

1097
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,031
Let It Go

1098
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:31,103
It is like a weird

1099
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:34,943
Ouroboros when you unpack the the logic

1100
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,479
Well cuz there's no

1101
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,759
He pretended

1102
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:44,159
To be like that loving richness and all this to get in with the Insiders only two double

1103
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:44,927
Across them

1104
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,719
At this point now that he's president

1105
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:51,327
That I think that's the underlying like if you want to put it in a sentence

1106
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,375
Yes but it's for the Patriots

1107
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:57,215
Do The Manchurian Candidate For the true American

1108
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:59,519
Who art brainwashed by the globalist

1109
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,079
Alex Wassabi

1110
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:03,871
But has he

1111
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:04,895
So-so

1112
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:07,199
With no

1113
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,479
Previous

1114
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:10,015
Inclination that this is happening

1115
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,295
Because all of Trumps tax

1116
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,343
Up until this point have been

1117
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:15,135
I love Trump

1118
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,439
I'm a big fan of trump

1119
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:21,279
And a lot of positions he's probably taken have been contradictory to

1120
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:28,447
He has an hour to what

1121
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,983
Goldman

1122
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:30,751
But

1123
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:39,455
They have golden confirmation bias

1124
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:41,759
Behind the scenes

1125
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,807
Whole everybody

1126
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,367
Has been everybody has been working

1127
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,159
Toward this exact

1128
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:51,999
This is the most important moment in human history

1129
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:55,839
Let's give him some credit

1130
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,887
And say Trump didn't have this plan

1131
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:58,911
Until he was

1132
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:00,703
19

1133
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:04,543
Maybe I go as far back as we can reasonably go

1134
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,079
Trump has this plan

1135
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,615
At the same time

1136
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:10,687
All of these other people develop this exact same plan

1137
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:15,551
They eventually get this plan

1138
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:18,367
To bring us all to this point where they've successfully

1139
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,135
Trick

1140
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:21,439
Everyone into worshipping money

1141
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,207
Yeah

1142
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,487
And now

1143
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:24,255
Now

1144
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:28,351
They're going to go back on literally their entire life

1145
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,375
Yep

1146
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:31,167
To protect the Patriot

1147
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:35,007
The true message of America

1148
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:35,775
Yes

1149
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:41,919
What is the truth Maybe

1150
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:48,319
Maybe we already heard it

1151
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:51,647
No other life

1152
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:07,775
Okay the secret of 2017 that is that all of your Newsradio episode

1153
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:10,591
The Secret of management yes it's kind of like that

1154
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:17,503
With stupid it reminds me of that it cuz it's like okay

1155
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:23,135
This is supposed to be about the secret of 2017 if we want to give a full breakdown

1156
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:25,183
Is that Megyn Kelly is ugly

1157
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:28,767
Ruby's Diner is where Alex Jones proves he's a good man

1158
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:31,839
Obama criticized because he's black

1159
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,631
And he doesn't want people to have cars

1160
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:40,031
Alex has been in big movies he hasn't billion dollars to cut his eye

1161
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:46,431
Celebrity worship sucks farm houses are cool

1162
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,711
Amazon website

1163
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:49,247
Yeah it's all the plan

1164
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,527
But we're not done

1165
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:52,063
More

1166
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:56,159
I don't really remember with his foot all the label is

1167
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:59,231
Hypocrisy so we'll see you there

1168
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,375
Because I said we should be healthy

1169
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:08,447
Because I say we shouldn't

1170
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:11,775
It doesn't me

1171
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,567
I don't do all the things

1172
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:22,015
Experience

1173
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:24,831
Okay that's

1174
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:27,135
That is the most correct label

1175
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:31,743
To do but I can't

1176
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,071
I got

1177
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:41,727
I'm turning down major movie Motion Pictures

1178
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:45,311
I'm doing it what

1179
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:47,103
Bhatiji Moses he ever

1180
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,895
Where did GMOs come from

1181
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:55,295
What do you mean he said I'm telling you not to eat GMOs

1182
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,319
Those fake Foods

1183
01:04:57,855 --> 01:05:01,695
But where is robot from

1184
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:03,743
He believes that like Monsanto

1185
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:05,023
Poison

1186
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:18,591
Next Level don't produce their own self-destructive happy

1187
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:22,943
Which is maybe the most evil thing I can ever

1188
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:24,735
Conceive of is like

1189
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:27,807
Where were drug dealers birthday

1190
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,087
We had the idea of

1191
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:29,855
Making

1192
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:33,439
Salmon more likely

1193
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:35,231
Being real

1194
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:36,511
Stingy with water

1195
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:41,375
Those two things I think are fundamentally literally evil

1196
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:45,215
Literally

1197
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:48,543
You're literally tying lives now to money

1198
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:51,359
No longer no longer any subsistence

1199
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,383
At all it is

1200
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,151
Purely

1201
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:55,967
Oligarchical money stretch

1202
01:05:59,295 --> 01:05:59,807
Tying

1203
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:03,647
Poverty that like morality of being like you're bad people cuz you're poor

1204
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:09,535
Who's that came out was like if you can't afford birth control you shouldn't have sex

1205
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:13,631
What the hell

1206
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:19,007
That's an argument 30-40 years ago they would've been like

1207
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:20,287
Have you tried the Rhythm method

1208
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,383
Stood by a Catholic

1209
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,151
2

1210
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:26,943
Just stimulate the Rhythm

1211
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:31,295
If you are legitimately against abortions

1212
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:33,087
You are a f****** hypocrite

1213
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,367
If you're against birth control

1214
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,159
You are a massive

1215
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:36,927
Massive hippo

1216
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:43,583
Yeah morning after pills and stuff like that would eliminate 100% of

1217
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:48,703
As we all learned

1218
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,471
Jurassic Park

1219
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:50,751
Life finds a way

1220
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,823
Anyway this is not over yet not by a long shot

1221
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,615
List

1222
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,383
This biscuit

1223
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,943
But the only setup you need

1224
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:02,271
Ears on her demise

1225
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,039
Of what is

1226
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,831
In the potentiality of

1227
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,391
Look at every

1228
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:08,671
Weave.

1229
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:09,695
I love doll

1230
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:14,303
I love tigers I love Allison from Magic

1231
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:16,607
They aren't one

1232
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,959
But the problem is is that

1233
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:22,239
An elephant

1234
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:27,871
It doesn't have those Lowe's

1235
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:31,711
We can go to the very bottom of her

1236
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:41,695
Mahec legitimate

1237
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:45,279
Also does not know how do

1238
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:49,375
What do you mean, like dolphins

1239
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,143
Spell outfit

1240
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,423
They do love fish

1241
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:54,751
Santa's a key thing in the animal world

1242
01:07:57,311 --> 01:08:00,383
Lincoln Center the weird thing for them

1243
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:04,735
That is

1244
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:07,295
Definitely Kenneth Branagh

1245
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:10,111
Dramatic speech right there

1246
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:13,183
I love dolphins

1247
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,975
What the f***

1248
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:17,023
Why can't I get his sort of like

1249
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,559
Look animals are cool

1250
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:20,351
But they are capable of what we are

1251
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:21,631
We can be the devil

1252
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:22,655
Or we can connect

1253
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:25,215
It's like it's forced

1254
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:25,983
Profundity

1255
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,055
Weird

1256
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,871
Such a weird

1257
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:36,223
What supplements shedfat

1258
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,503
Supports your

1259
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,807
You know like this is his last missive

1260
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:45,951
Before I death row

1261
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,279
Spirit of evil

1262
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,815
Laying

1263
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,703
Very smart

1264
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:57,471
These churches

1265
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:05,151
She's talking about how this is something that I actually think

1266
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,943
Is really dangerous

1267
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,735
In the same way that

1268
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:11,039
They try and demonize the Press

1269
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:13,087
I like know where the real threat

1270
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:18,975
Single

1271
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:25,119
Today Trump started

1272
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,911
Like to have this whole thing where he's trying to

1273
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:33,311
Take out the Associated Press from literally saying that

1274
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:35,871
You're the only voice aloud

1275
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:42,015
Yeah Vivid that

1276
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:47,647
Referencing specific churches

1277
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,415
Probably Oliver

1278
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:55,071
To that was he's more talkin about

1279
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:57,631
Not literal churches but like the church

1280
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:59,935
To know he's talking about literal churches

1281
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:03,007
Because if he's talking about like the megachurch

1282
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:05,567
Like those whole things you might actually be in

1283
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:07,615
Really but don't

1284
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:08,383
Evil

1285
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:13,503
We know that cuz we've been to them as children

1286
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:18,623
Do you love prosperity

1287
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:22,463
That's true also Prosperity is

1288
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,023
Maybe I don't know

1289
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:28,863
F****** hard to unpack is this inherent contradictions everywhere

1290
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,399
But here's the thing

1291
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:32,959
When you talk about like these churches being evil

1292
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:33,727
I'm stuff like that

1293
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,263
I think there's a really

1294
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:39,103
FairPoint you can make about like child abuse in the Catholic Church

1295
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:40,639
I think there's

1296
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:44,735
Fairly abusive things done to people in almost Church

1297
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:47,551
In terms of brainwashing in terms of

1298
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:50,879
No just sort of foundational problem

1299
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:52,671
Organized religion

1300
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:59,327
That's not what he's talking about he's talking about the message of Christ has been bastardize by these churches

1301
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,607
But he understands the

1302
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:01,375
True

1303
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:02,655
Okay which is

1304
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:05,983
But of course he gives zero bastardization

1305
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:06,751
Example

1306
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:09,311
But it's also like in the early church

1307
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:11,359
They would do and that's why

1308
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,639
People rebelled against

1309
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:13,663
It was that

1310
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:17,247
Back in the day there would be the priest who had the holy of holies

1311
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:21,599
The center of the church where he could communicate with God everyone else

1312
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:22,623
What God wanted

1313
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:25,183
Them to know which is a great

1314
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:30,047
Beautiful stamps

1315
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:37,215
And that's sort of reformation happen

1316
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:42,847
No I'm not saying that he's going to be like only I can talk to God

1317
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:43,615
He's like

1318
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,687
Only I have I have the right

1319
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:48,223
View of it

1320
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:52,831
And if you agree with my view of it then your right to

1321
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:58,207
Situation going on here

1322
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,231
Fitness hits

1323
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:02,303
3 days before

1324
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:05,887
Churches

1325
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:14,591
Humble yourself

1326
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,431
Destiny

1327
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:23,551
That's a creepy f****** sense

1328
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:28,415
Just said the enemy is basically everything

1329
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:31,999
Everything all institutions

1330
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,279
I've been corrupted

1331
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,047
Yeah

1332
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:37,631
By the new world order by the Illuminati by the globalist

1333
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:39,167
By these evil forces

1334
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,447
I may have

1335
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,727
Twisted the messenger

1336
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,263
They've twisted

1337
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:44,543
The message of freedom

1338
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:45,311
Which

1339
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,079
I mean

1340
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:50,943
It's not like that's a like that's not an insane thing

1341
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:52,479
To stay in a

1342
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:53,759
Smaller sense

1343
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:56,319
Yeah cuz all of these things

1344
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:58,879
Power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely

1345
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:05,279
Absolute lambiyaan institutions are just collections of people if you have bad people

1346
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:06,559
That is inherently good

1347
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:12,959
The institution will turn back I mean you can have a single church with bad people in it now you got to bed

1348
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:15,775
I want to get into the humble yourself before

1349
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:18,847
Yeah boy

1350
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,151
Utopia

1351
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:22,943
Is if everybody

1352
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,759
Just humble themselves as Alex understand

1353
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:32,159
Is Alex does himself because

1354
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:34,719
No never

1355
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:41,375
Cheat yourself

1356
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:44,703
What you're doing is just evil

1357
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:46,239
You're just being mislead

1358
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:49,567
It sounds like he's such an absolutist

1359
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:54,175
Like there's no

1360
01:13:58,527 --> 01:13:59,807
Later he's David koresh

1361
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,855
That's what's funny you should say that

1362
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:09,535
No that's not the next next time I swear to God I would have killed myself right now

1363
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:11,839
Incident

1364
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:16,447
Call

1365
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,215
Oh really

1366
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:18,751
Really isn't Texas

1367
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,799
Waco isn't super far from Austin

1368
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:25,919
That was a serious overstep and

1369
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:33,599
Really f***** up the cult was really f***** up what happened

1370
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:34,367
Direct

1371
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:40,767
Way too which is an even weirder and he has all kinds of ideas about how Clinton was

1372
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:46,655
Personally involved and had to cover up cuz they were child sex Rings involved I like that

1373
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:50,239
The conspiracy that he's dreamt up

1374
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:52,799
Evolved over the years but that was like

1375
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,335
Waco to him

1376
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:55,103
Was

1377
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:58,431
What year was Alec 92

1378
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:01,503
I have no idea

1379
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:04,063
That was when he was sort of like

1380
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:05,087
Just starting

1381
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:06,367
To get these ideas

1382
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:08,159
That's probably when he was in junior college

1383
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:09,695
The timeline correct

1384
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:10,975
And that was when he was starting

1385
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:11,743
To get

1386
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:17,887
Read that book none dare call it conspiracy and all this stuff starts to Bubble Up in his head

1387
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:19,935
It becomes the

1388
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:21,215
Okay

1389
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:23,519
After years of pressure cooking

1390
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:26,591
This is where we find ourselves

1391
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:30,687
Because to me like just going by our last episode whenever you talked about

1392
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:31,455
The Y2K

1393
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:34,271
He seems more like just a

1394
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:35,807
Conspiracy theories

1395
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:37,087
Yep just like

1396
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:39,903
I am throwing all this stuff at the wall

1397
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:40,671
2

1398
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:41,951
To tell you

1399
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,231
Survival

1400
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,511
And gold angle

1401
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:45,535
At that point

1402
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,839
Instead now this is a

1403
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:48,863
A full-on

1404
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:49,887
Cult leader message

1405
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:51,935
There's no

1406
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:52,959
Because in this

1407
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:53,983
Missive

1408
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:59,871
As we all know is where Russia

1409
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:01,663
Trucking radar blockers

1410
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:04,223
Cuz I go down

1411
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:05,759
There's no sales

1412
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,295
There's no sales pitch

1413
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:09,343
No do you hear any sales pitch

1414
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:15,743
It's one of the longest stretches I've ever heard him talk without bringing up iodine or super male vitality

1415
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:17,023
Fear

1416
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:18,303
Loathing and

1417
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:19,583
Depression

1418
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:23,423
That might be a snapshot of his soul

1419
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,703
Really sad

1420
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:30,847
Feel really bad for him if he's in this headspace and it sounds like really is

1421
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:34,687
It does seem that way the first time I've heard him and I thought this

1422
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:36,479
Rings so genuine

1423
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:38,527
I also believed every single thing

1424
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:44,415
I also should say if you were watching the video you would see that the guy is a little fish

1425
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:46,207
Maybe his body language doesn't

1426
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:47,743
Support the

1427
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:54,143
I'm not disagreeing with your conclusion but if you watch the like body language there is like a bit of Showmanship

1428
01:16:54,399 --> 01:17:00,543
After 22 years in April

1429
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:04,127
But I think that what is important

1430
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:05,407
That we can take away

1431
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,943
Is that like

1432
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,735
This is kind of what happened

1433
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:10,783
When you go down these roads

1434
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:13,087
2

1435
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:14,623
These conspiracy Road

1436
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:16,671
What ends up happening is it evolve

1437
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:18,975
When you wear a mask long enough the mass becomes

1438
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:20,255
Sure

1439
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:23,583
It's more than that you also wear an outfit

1440
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:27,423
It's not just the mask anymore

1441
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:29,215
It becomes something different

1442
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:32,543
In the movie of Alex Jones

1443
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:33,311
Yeah

1444
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:34,079
1

1445
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:36,383
Who plays him

1446
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:38,943
What does he wear

1447
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:44,063
Cuz we're talking about somebody with a low

1448
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:46,879
We're talking about I would say if it were me

1449
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:48,671
Sir Anthony Hopkins

1450
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:50,463
Rush it

1451
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:52,511
To all no way Anthony have

1452
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:59,167
Can play any age I would say let's Meryl Streep say we f*** around

1453
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:03,007
Okay Alex always talks about how back-in-the-day he was a great athlete

1454
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:05,055
And you could have gone pro

1455
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:09,151
No I'm not leaving

1456
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:11,199
We got to go younger I'm stuck

1457
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:14,015
Table

1458
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:20,671
Let's stroke Alex's eco

1459
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:27,071
The guy from f****** Magic Mike's to play you you sign onto this.

1460
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:30,143
You get him I think he can do voices

1461
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:32,447
Channing Tatum if not

1462
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:34,751
He just lip-synch that we get a domian to do it

1463
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:41,151
That yeah that would work this voice Perfection probably already does

1464
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:47,551
Equals

1465
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:51,647
Anyway Alex has one last

1466
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:52,927
I bet here

1467
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:54,719
I don't want to be clear I cut up

1468
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,743
Very little

1469
01:18:55,999 --> 01:19:00,863
I made sure to not cut out anything between these clips that has to do with Khan

1470
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,399
Nothing

1471
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:03,423
Was lost

1472
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:07,519
In the shuffle if you watch the video it's a little bit longer

1473
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:09,311
But I have not betrayed

1474
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,591
The spirit of this

1475
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:11,615
Anyway

1476
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:12,895
Alright

1477
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:14,687
All right I just have to say that because

1478
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:16,735
Again if this hole like internalizing

1479
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:17,759
Yeah I have to

1480
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:19,039
This Waverly

1481
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:21,087
Anyway

1482
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:22,367
F****** hard to do

1483
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,391
And it's so hard

1484
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:26,463
Here's his Farewell to this

1485
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:29,279
Clip

1486
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,559
This whole video

1487
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:34,911
By the end of it we'll see if we know the speaker

1488
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:40,543
2017

1489
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:43,871
And in that experience

1490
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:46,687
Everything

1491
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:47,711
What's good

1492
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:49,503
Wetransfer

1493
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:53,855
And this whole world

1494
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:59,231
2070

1495
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:06,655
I will always be

1496
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:18,688
Spirit

1497
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:20,736
Come to kill this

1498
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:23,808
We are the garden

1499
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,672
We could prove ourselves

1500
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:36,608
Film

1501
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:37,376
Modesto

1502
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:44,032
And that's the end of the video

1503
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,568
Okay

1504
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:50,944
Welcome

1505
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:53,504
I think he would do a great job there

1506
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:58,368
His head shape is Right bald

1507
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:01,952
How tall God

1508
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:02,976
Okay

1509
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:09,376
I think Chris Pratt's got to robust ahead

1510
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:11,168
We're making Kelly and Chris Pratt

1511
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:17,312
Will fantasy book this movie

1512
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:18,080
So

1513
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:20,640
That sounds

1514
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:21,920
So much

1515
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:22,688
Like the

1516
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:23,968
Prayers that my

1517
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:24,736
Dad

1518
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:26,016
Has before like

1519
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:29,856
The prayers of our fathers

1520
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:30,624
Classic

1521
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:32,928
If you were raised

1522
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:34,464
Kind of

1523
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:36,512
Rindge Church in the 80s

1524
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:38,304
Clearly

1525
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,400
I'm not sure about that he might have been

1526
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:49,056
Yeah but he might have adopted it later so the Reformation

1527
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,080
My dad still doing it

1528
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:50,848
It's not like it's gone

1529
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,152
No like you can pick it up in a lot of

1530
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,272
At the same time

1531
01:21:58,528 --> 01:22:02,112
Trying to be humble while giving yourself all of the Power

1532
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:04,416
It's it's like it's like

1533
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:05,696
You

1534
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:06,976
Need to Humble you

1535
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:08,000
Set yourself before

1536
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:11,072
And I already have

1537
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,864
Is dependent on you

1538
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:17,216
But God has nothing to do with it until your

1539
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:19,776
Yeah

1540
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:21,568
Turn your will over to God

1541
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:28,224
But God doesn't have any control over that's such a weird way of thinking about it

1542
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,784
Do you know your hard biblical Calvert Calvinism

1543
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:33,344
Fascinating

1544
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:35,904
Feces really bums

1545
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:38,208
Cuz that is not

1546
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:39,488
That's not what he's

1547
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:40,256
Really

1548
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:42,560
He doesn't understand what the species

1549
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:43,328
Nope

1550
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:44,608
He's not a scientist

1551
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:47,936
Healing

1552
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:48,704
Find to know

1553
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,496
Which as we all know there are tons of

1554
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:56,640
Assessment is not taking into account that he's again crying

1555
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:58,432
At the a

1556
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:04,832
And when he's when he's talking at the end here at ear does go down

1557
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:10,976
Like the Italian play the Native American in the commercial likely like that member of our species

1558
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:14,816
Species member

1559
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:19,680
What do you is the secret of 2017

1560
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:26,080
I need I need to know what you think you have a lot of scriptnotes

1561
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:32,480
Listen to Amy rittenour twenty or so of breaking down this video I promise

1562
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:35,808
I didn't edit out the actual Secret

1563
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:42,976
This isn't some game show now we're in the match game

1564
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:47,328
Butter pie crust

1565
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:53,728
Without

1566
01:23:56,544 --> 01:24:00,640
Even throw in at the end like a support their Network or anything like that

1567
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:07,040
Unified field theory of all the bachelorette things it's very disjointed

1568
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:09,600
What is the connectivity

1569
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:16,256
I feel like I'm the zodiac

1570
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:27,008
Pictures up on the wall tying them together like Sherlock like-for-like

1571
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:33,408
Eventually I'm going to have to buy like a weird chalkboard yesterday photo stuff up

1572
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:36,736
Glenn Beck

1573
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:37,504
So

1574
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,040
The enemy is every

1575
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,856
Government

1576
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:44,160
He can't

1577
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:45,952
To the things that he tells you to adhere to

1578
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:52,096
Is unsalable

1579
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:54,144
He knows the truth unfair

1580
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:58,496
But he can't move it

1581
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:01,056
He's really depressed

1582
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:07,200
That's the secret

1583
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:11,808
Because

1584
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:14,112
It seems like

1585
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:21,536
Here's here's what I'm putting all this together as I hope it's the same thought

1586
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:22,304
It is that

1587
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:25,632
He doesn't understand how to win

1588
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:27,680
After winning

1589
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:28,704
After winning

1590
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:34,080
Yeah because the whole thing is actually building an opposition

1591
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,616
Lost the opposition

1592
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:37,920
He doesn't have any

1593
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:39,968
So he's really depressed because

1594
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,784
The government that he has been railing against

1595
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:47,904
Is now what he wants you to believe in

1596
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:51,232
Tell you that they are all an enemy are there Aldi

1597
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:53,024
Global

1598
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:59,936
I think my response perfect my response

1599
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:00,960
I think he is

1600
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:02,752
Bingo

1601
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:09,152
That's really what I think the message is I don't know who I am now

1602
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:10,432
Dana Goldberg about

1603
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,456
Astronauts

1604
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:14,016
If you gone to the Moon

1605
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:18,368
Everything after that must be completely a letdown like her

1606
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:20,160
Oh man I'm getting these

1607
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,184
Double a batteries

1608
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:23,232
I use these when I want

1609
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:30,912
I think that's an unfair comparison to that pic because I don't really think

1610
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:32,960
Achieve that much

1611
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:36,032
I think to him

1612
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,824
He ended anti-American

1613
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,104
Well that's true

1614
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:45,504
He's achieved a lot more than even if you believe literal Russian propaganda

1615
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:54,720
Space command

1616
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,512
I think

1617
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:57,280
That

1618
01:26:58,048 --> 01:27:00,608
There's also a change of buyer's remorse

1619
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:01,632
Thrown in there

1620
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:02,400
Okay

1621
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:05,472
There's a little bit of I didn't want it to go this way

1622
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:07,264
I might be putting too much on him

1623
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,288
Yeah right

1624
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,152
I didn't want to win

1625
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:15,712
Or something like that is just a like

1626
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:23,392
We got play a different game now

1627
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:28,000
Alright

1628
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:31,840
The only way to do it is now changed the entire narrative to be like

1629
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:32,864
Well

1630
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:34,912
You know who's good at playing from the bottom

1631
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:35,680
Globalist

1632
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:42,592
That has to be the net like there's there's no other way to do it

1633
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:47,968
What's the defense but it also turns into when you're this sort of

1634
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:50,528
Becomes witch

1635
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:55,392
Something that I think is particularly scary

1636
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,672
It's it's

1637
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:57,696
Tort jump

1638
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:01,536
You don't remember McCarthyism fun

1639
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:04,352
No I'm pretty sure that I read a book where is like

1640
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:12,288
Who wrote that Rob do a

1641
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:18,432
We'd like to would like to say you're welcome for explain to you guys the Seeker

The ship

1652
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:58,112
It was bleak

1653
01:28:58,368 --> 01:29:00,928
And even if we are kind of we don't see eye-to-eye

1654
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,976
