1
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for its knowledge B

2
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:34,048
Knowledge

3
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,064
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Nike.com

5
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:08,608
Groundworks but the elders Lane and also talked a little bit about Alex Jones

6
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,448
Question for you my friend

7
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,472
Today

8
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,032
My bright spot today Jordan

9
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,336
Side braids

10
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:23,456
My aunt was in town this weekend for dinner

11
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,016
But she was

12
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,552
Flipping the bill

13
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,344
Went to Morton

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,744
The steakhouse almost got a Sunday there legendary Sunday

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,352
Mccreamy summer

16
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,656
I saw them walk by with one and

17
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,448
There was no f****** way I was

18
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,824
It was like a fishbowl massive

19
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,432
You should go there just for that

20
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,736
Bright spot is

21
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,504
Polar

22
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,528
Self

23
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,880
Haha and I tried it and it is

24
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,672
Really honestly thing

25
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,464
This would do numbers

26
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,512
In the year of the seltzer

27
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:12,352
Haven't been around it is a pink Apple lemon

28
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,888
Flavored seltzer

29
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,680
Entities

30
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,240
Honey Honeycrisp apple

31
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,848
I'm fascinated by this pink Apple m

32
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,432
Plus a Honeycrisp apple

33
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:32,832
No pink Apple and lemon not pink lemonade and apple but I mean the Apple before

34
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,112
Pig lady

35
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,696
What about the kind of apple I understand people

36
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,192
I know exactly what I'm saying

37
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,216
Pick up the phone

38
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,520
It's so good

39
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,592
It's a refreshing

40
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,360
I believe you

41
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,384
Oh my God

42
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,408
I like apple juice

43
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,992
Too sweet I also paid little bitter

44
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:05,856
Bright sometimes you get at a bar

45
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,928
Little stupid little too sour

46
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,208
This is right in the middle

47
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,256
Nice sweet spot good stuff

48
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024
So good

49
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,424
Alright probably 97

50
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,960
Make a few ways but it could be better

51
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,984
Right

52
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,544
I think Loki might be the best

53
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,384
See if that's recency bias I'm going to have to say that you're not

54
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,504
Just start over from the beginning Andre taste all of those up

55
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,040
My bright spot

56
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,600
What is a Dragon Ball Z

57
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,880
Vu my friend

58
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,928
As we progressing

59
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,256
I'm clearly regressing into a childlike state

60
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,792
And I was like

61
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,864
What am I what do I need to do and I realized

62
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,656
I needed a soap opera

63
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:56,032
Dragon Ball Z is it's just like professional wrestling it's a soap opera

64
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,800
With fight

65
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,080
Scenes from time to time

66
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:02,432
It's all about the build-up and then the fight is actually kind of boring honestly

67
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,736
Edibles

68
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272
The formula is

69
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:10,880
Non-stop this a commitment

70
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,416
Formula

71
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,464
So staid and boring

72
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,256
Then it's almost admirable

73
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:23,679
I'm sorry I'm barely paying attention I'm really trying to figure out a way to make RuPaul's Dragon Ball races e work

74
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,215
No

75
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
Can't make it work

76
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:32,895
It's not going to happen there's a pond in there my friend I really wish there was but I think he I better Minds than you

77
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:37,759
Giving themselves mad trying to fight it I've seen the best

78
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,319
To make this pain

79
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:45,695
Well I'm glad you're enjoying.

80
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,815
So Jordan today we have an episode to go over and I'll explain all about it

81
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
Let's say hello.

82
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,167
Does the new Wok

83
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:01,567
The look of confusion on the waitresses face at Olive Garden when I tried to order the Lionel's ferlinghetti thank you so much you are now

84
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
Ewok

85
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:09,759
I'd like to do punch up on this and meatballs

86
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:16,159
That's a little bit better in a workshop talking about your jokes

87
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
That's the meatballs

88
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
Live tonight it's.

89
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:24,095
Pizza in The Bachelor Squatch Trio thank you so much you're now about siwa

90
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,959
Sorry about this one a little bit late

91
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:35,359
This is a Happy Father's Day

92
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:41,503
Father's Day

93
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
Narc

00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,319
Funko thank you so much

95
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,415
Thank you very much

96
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:54,559
So first

97
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:59,679
And Luke loves Josie and both of us love this podcast thank you so much

98
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,471
I'm a policy

99
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,239
I have

100
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,775
Risen above

101
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,711
A little breaking for me

102
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
And then we're going

103
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,039
To come back

104
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
And I'm going to

105
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,111
Start the show over

106
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,231
F*** you

107
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,511
F*** you

108
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,303
I got plenty work for you but

109
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,327
At the end of the day

110
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,119
F*** you and your new world order

111
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,423
She rode in on

112
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,703
And all your s***

113
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,239
Maybe later on West Broad

114
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,799
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby

115
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567
I'm Yours

116
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,127
Walk out of here tomorrow

117
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
And you never see me again

118
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
Really what I want to do

119
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,271
Back here again

120
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,807
Apologized

121
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,343
To the crew in the Lester Chester

122
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,927
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

123
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,487
Better tomorrow

124
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,023
Never will be a never was

125
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,047
So

126
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:58,815
Today

127
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
Jordan

128
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
I'm sick of Ali

129
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,655
What is bulshit

130
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,447
The publicity stunt ship from last week

131
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,751
Just very annoying

132
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,287
Really drains you

133
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,359
But simultaneously there's not a lot of other

134
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,151
Very good Outlet

135
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
Still looking

136
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:20,831
Jim Bakker dry well

137
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:28,255
I don't know where to go with that go back to the forest on that one too many times

138
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,535
2003

139
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,071
Boring boring Lake

140
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,119
Wasting my time

141
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
Justin

142
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:39,519
Until I realized there was something that I had been meaning to do for awhile

143
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,799
And that is

144
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,335
Go over

145
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
September 11th

146
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,407
What's 2001

147
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,527
Oh my god do you know how funny that is

148
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,391
Because of the did you see the picture going around apparently

149
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,951
ESPN Yankees

150
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
Red Sox

151
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:05,119
Oh that picture funny super embarrassed

152
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:11,263
A little bit of timing

153
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,335
Here's the situation like

154
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,359
One of the

155
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,663
Reasons we haven't covered this already was

156
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,431
Was I

157
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:22,271
Have access to the audio initially when we first started this

158
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,575
Cafe

159
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,623
That was a limiting factor

160
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,927
Actor Eminem as we go further into

161
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,695
The podcast

162
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:34,303
I kind of thought like I will save this right this for something and

163
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,839
Stupidly I was like

164
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,935
What's up with her like we do it live or do it live on land

165
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,495
Gradually that felt like

166
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,263
That's never go

167
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,591
Going to be a good idea

168
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:54,271
I don't know an argument could be made that a professional podcaster might have done this for like episode 700 as opposed to

169
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,319
I really don't understand

170
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:02,975
Why why have we numbered are episodes in the first place it was a bad idea either of us remember

171
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:09,375
It's just for people to have shorthand for like it was

172
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:14,239
You do it's like putting a piano your your pulled into the numbers game not

173
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,263
Exactly

174
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,663
September

175
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,991
Importantly number episode

176
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,623
During the day

177
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,671
Write a letter we're going to be talking about

178
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
Then on what

179
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,511
Today we're going to be covering Alex's

180
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,535
Evening show

181
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,375
These back on air from 9 to midnight that night

182
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,959
And so obviously there's going to be different amounts of information that he

183
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,263
He's privy to different things will have happened right

184
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,567
Into over the course of these next

185
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,335
Couple episodes

186
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
What's we will

187
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:55,967
Experience he's immediacy and he's like a little time to simmer

188
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,759
I'll see if there's any differences will see

189
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,063
We will see how this goes

190
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,879
Texting him being correct about Saddam son still being alive

191
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,671
That's

192
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:11,071
Doesn't come out

193
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,119
Made it to go forward to this

194
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:17,983
For now is it also we're going to be in Austin going to be

195
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,775
Doing a bit of like

196
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,567
Present-day coverage of Alec

197
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,103
It feels like let's

198
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,151
Let's have some fun while we can

199
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,711
Where to be doing plenty of present-day Alex

200
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,783
640 wires

201
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,575
Super informative

202
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,135
In the way that I kind of like a lot of the

203
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,671
Botanigard show to me

204
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,719
It is theirs revelatory thing

205
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
Cuz when you go to the Past

206
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,327
What the f*** are you talkin about

207
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:47,167
Runner-ups not as much of that in the present-day so

208
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,191
In the present is supposed

209
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,239
Was too revealing

210
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:55,615
Can you believe this

211
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,687
Smoke them all you got them

212
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,479
I'm feeling I got that we live

213
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:06,879
Here we go here is how Alex is starting off the show and I will say that this is about exactly what you would expect

214
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,183
He's recounting the events that have happened

215
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
Uphill

216
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,743
But he gets on arrogance out

217
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:18,399
Released 5 years wow

218
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,191
Oklahoma City to Waco

219
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,495
Has been government action

220
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,287
I need versus a pre-tax

221
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,823

Breather using

224

Couture Arabs in allowing a druid

225
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,503
Or this is for complicit

226
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
Complicity

227
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,575
How will the federal government

228
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,135
The evidence is overwhelming to bring you up to speed on what

229
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:39,903
What's happened

230
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:45,023
Add to a 8:50 a.m. EDT plane hits World Trade Center 920 FDIC

231
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
At least one plane

232
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
Hijack

233
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,839

Eastern second jet crashed in the World Trade Center

235
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,703
Plane hits Pentagon 945

236
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,543
Official said at us airplane

237

All u.s. building

Anchor

246
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,487
Another hijack plane

247
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
Reported 20

248
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,535
Minutes south of Washington

249
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,583
DC second tower North collapse

250
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
Hijack plane crash

251
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,399
Pittsburgh PA officials

252
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,191
Investigating another hijacking

253
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,983
For the plane headed towards d.c.

254
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,311
Federal Building

255
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,615
DC have been evacuated so

256
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,175
Airplanes are in the antler finding bombs

257
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,967
Stools

258
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,783
Cracks in the World Trade Center

259
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,111
So here we see the way Alex opens up the show on 9/11

260
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,183
Then there's a couple of things that stick out to me in a pretty serious way

261
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:51,071
The first has to do with the end of a clip where Alex says that we're told there other planes in the air and they're finding bombs

262
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,095
The school

263
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,887
Uclear in the statement at this point

264
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,959
They have no idea if the things that are coming in or Acura

265
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,031
There's an understanding that the immediacy of the event

266
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
That's great the fog of uncertain

267
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,591
The end that's not something

268
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,639
The feels the same as how Alex operates

269
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
Today

270
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,271
The second thing I found really interesting is that Alex's take on this is exactly what

271
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,295
You think it would

272
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:16,927
Immediately this is declared a false flag it has to be because that's how the globalists are going

273
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,207
To bring in martial law

274
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,743
Happen

275
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,303
There would have gotten worse since

276
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,327
In terms of surveillance

277
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,863
Police militarization

278
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,167
To martial law

279
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,495
These are the objectives of this false flag

280
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,031
Because they're the objectives Alex

281
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,615
It's always immediately declares to blame his imaginary

282
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,895
Periphery tragic event

283
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,919
Sakura's in this just

284
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,199
Sing with that for sure

285
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:44,319
The third thing I want to point out is that Alex is already declared this a false flag

286
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:49,183
He knows literally nothing that will eventually appear in his documentaries about 9/11

287
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,999
All of the real or imagined anomalies

288
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
In order to build his case

289
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
This is critical

290
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:00,447
Because it really does illustrate how he arrived at his conclusion long before seeking out evidence

291
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,983
Which is not a good process

292
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,031
I guess what I'm saying

293
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,871
Is it Alice if Alex knew that this was a false flag hours before building

294
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
7-Eleven

295
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,479
Then he shouldn't be able to use Building 7 in his explanation of what makes

296
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,503
If the argument

297
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
This was a false flag

298
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,855
All the evidence he should need to present Hast

299
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,415
Has had prior to his determination that this

300
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
The false flag

301
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:26,047
Girls that evidence is no longer really evidence necessarily released its suspicious

302
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,351
Just that it could be trivia that he sought after

303
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
To justify that

304
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,143
Conclusion that he wanted

305
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
To push

306
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,215
And I think that description is really app

307
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,239
If you look at the

308
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:38,591
Conspiracy theories that were pushed in films like the Alex produced loose change

309
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,383
Which is also produced by Infowars

310
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,663
Employee Jason bermas

311
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,711
Aka the info Warrior

312
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,271
You start to get the picture that this was the

313
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,343
The process that Alex world was using to deal with information

314
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,159
That documentary had to be re-released Multan

315
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,463
Bull times because things at the Fillmore debunked

316
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:58,047
To the point making their inclusion in the documentary embarrass

317
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
For instance

318
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:06,751
It's in various incarnations of the film Flight 93 was originally shot down and then it was diverted to Cleveland Hopkins

319
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
Airport

320
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,823
And then that entire storyline was edited out

321
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,847
The Final Cut

322
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:15,967
It's important to keep his dynamic in our heads as we experience the way Alex covers Today's tragedy

323
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,247
He already

324
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,527
Has a conclusion

325
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,807
And he's trying to find Justin

326
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
Vacation

327
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,111
Conclusion whether or not

328
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,671
That justification means anything or is he even real

329
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,975
You have quite a response there though

330
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,023
I mean.

331
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,863
The new have you seen the new edit of his 911 movie

332
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,911
I've not it's just him gone

333
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:41,311
NFL all the embarrassing part was left behind all that's left behind

334
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,359
This is about me

335
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:52,063
Yes I know that the World Trade Center is literally still on fire but I told Kyle

336
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,367
That is amazing to meet you know

337
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,391
Pretty shity like

338
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,183
In the present day

339
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:02,559
You hear him do s*** like that for a mass shooting and you go Jesus Christ that's f***** up

340
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583
Yeah I know

341
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,447
What you feel like that's with 30 years of being a giant piece of s*** under your belt

342
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,751
You know that right out the gate

343
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,543
On 911 he's like

344
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,847
Called it story

345
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,871
Yeah

346
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:21,759
Insane Psychopathic narcissist serial killer level s***

347
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,807
911 and being it's cool

348
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,903
I remember the teachers being very

349
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,463
Somberg there was a tonne of like

350
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,231
A lot of

351
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,047
I just ate

352
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,095
Feels really absent from Alex

353
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,679
I mean this to is

354
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,959
Like

355
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,287
If you listen to the episode of like Bill Cooper after a tragedy

356
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,335
I believe

357
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,615
I think it was the episode

358
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
For Columbine

359
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,663
That you can

360
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,431
Confined

361
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,711
And he's crying

362
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,527
About the tragedy and

363
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,319
How he feels are these families

364
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,599
I got the kids

365
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
You know a lake

366
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
I don't want to

367
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:05,535
Bf5 Bill Cooper he's an a****** absolutely

368
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,839
Recognized on some way that there's

369
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
The people are hurting

370
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,399
And it's okay to hurt

371
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,959
At all

372
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:19,359
No he's an absolute psychopath like there's really no way to describe them other than a complete psycho

373
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,431

That was amazing

378
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,439
There were high school kids

379
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,207
In my

380
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:40,607
Leaving prayer circle people who weren't religious were joining

381
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:47,007
Unlock the door in there people in circles like all the sudden there rip rained all kinds of Gods

382
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:52,383

Dude the school the high school that I went to they

384
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:59,039
Basically made a thing goes like if you want to go home you can

385
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,599
Yeah but if you want to stay at school all the rest

386
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,623
The classes for the rest

387
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,159
The day I just basically going to be weird

388
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:09,791
Work through like how to process what happened

389
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,607
Weirdly I had a psychology class

390
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,679
Bad afternoon

391
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:19,519
Actually kind of failed with like

392
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,567
Dealing with trauma and like

393
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,359
I think I think there was

394
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,895
A lot of that process

395
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
LOL

396
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,479
This is not that

397
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
No

398
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,903
That's amazing really weird to fix it like I was in this

399
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,671
Class

400
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,719
Talking about Lee everyone's opening up with her

401
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,255
The feelings about this and like

402
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,815
Some people had family who lived in New York

403
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:47,167
If you're talkin about their fears about it absolutely not being able to contact folks

404
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:50,239
Simultaneously in Austin Texas

405
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:56,639
Alex's recordings this

406
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
Board for

407
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:00,223
Alex

408
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,295
Thank you so he

409
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,855
Talking about who he's got

410
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,623
How to talk to the

411
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
This is

412
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
Pandemic

413
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,255
This is one of the biggest stories

414
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,559
Alba last century and now in

415
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,583
20

416
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,863
First century

417
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:21,727
We're going to have Dave on class enjoyed finally joining other Genesis host at want to wish

418
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,495
Limbs

419
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,519
In New York

420
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,823
That's coming up at this break

421
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,871
Is cell phone hold

422
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:31,455
Jim right we don't have a landline for in the landlines aren't working too well

423
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,991
The pleistocene

424
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,015
Sort of

425
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
No

426
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,575
Recognizing the gravity of the

427
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,135
The situation I suppose sometimes

428
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,439
There'll just be like some weird anti-vax

429
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:48,095
Fake talking point. Traffic is the biggest story of his wife

430
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:52,191
Is recognizing that fact is the biggest thing by century

431
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:58,591
Great you almost expect him to call Steve and Steve is in New York City

432
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:02,175
Call Jesus Alex you didn't even ask if I was doing alright

433
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:08,575
I was I wasn't in the building but I'm next door malak's this isn't going to make sense but you've got a call Leo zagami

434
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,047
Bench for his guest is shallow

435
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,863
But there are no Heavy Hitters that he can get on the show

436
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,631
Just others

437
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,655
Gcn host

438
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
And this

439
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,239
Jim Wright guy who's a personal friend of his who is

440
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:29,311
They are and saw the attack first

441
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,335
I think he's

442
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,103
Married

443
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,711
To Alex's sister or something like that shares a familial connect

444
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,735
Said he's a friend of his

445
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,575
He doesn't actually meet Steve pieczenik until 2

446
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:44,671
2000 to 12 years

447
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,695
But it seems strange

448
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,719
But he couldn't get likes

449
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,023
Steve Quayle or Joel skousen on

450
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,071
Some of these Old-Timers who are like

451
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:55,167
Real anti-communist weirdos be Loosely connected

452
00:20:55,423 --> 00:21:00,799
Did the gcn folks they would later be his standby experts like Webster Tarpley or Stanley Monteith

453
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,079
Reven Alan Watts

454
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,615
Not Alan Watts

455
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:11,039
This doesn't mean anything but it's something to know none of the good weirdos are around at this point it is just

456
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:15,391
Whoever else is associated with dcnr is friends with Alex

457
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:20,768
Yeah is it that so much or is it possible he tried to get in contact with them and they were like

458
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,560
Do you realize that

459
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:25,376
911 is happening right now

460
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,912
Cut this clip

461
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,704
Because there's they're psychos.

462
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,008
I think if people recognize that Alex

463
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,056
Was a useful

464
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,360
Place to appear then right

465
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,920
Then I think they would probably make time

466
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,968
I think that Alex is a useful place

467
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,504
To appear at this point

468
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,296
He does mention

469
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,320
Benton Capehart

470
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:51,232
Who's the guy who OKC Oklahoma City conspiracy theory and

471
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,512
Farmer General

472
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:55,072
Airport

473
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,352
Development that sounds true

474
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,144
And at 1

475
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,704
Point his producer says that

476
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,800
They're trying to call him and they're getting a busy signal Alex

477
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,336
Announces on air

478
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:12,736
Stop trying to call Ben 10

479
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,808
Have his phone number

480
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:20,672
Larry Nichols gave out his number on air

481
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,976
Now I'm in this place where I'm like

482
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,792
Is there a is there a heist

483
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,352
Putting together a crew moment for Alec

484
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,632
He's like

485
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,680
Walking into Webster Tarpley

486
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:34,752
Bar one time and just like looking at him across are just like

487
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:39,360
It's time to get back on the horse you know I kind of assumed it was a borrowed be Big Jim Tucker

488
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:45,504
That's what I was thinking of an alcoholic

489
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,040
From a glass of whiskey neat

490
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:47,808
Denny's like

491
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:48,832
New York

492
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,624
It's time for another job

493
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,720
A ride horses to Bilderberg

494
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,256
It needs to happen

495
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,048
So Alex has some

496
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,584
Evidence that he points

497
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,448
To build his case that this is a false flag

498
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,264
Can you go to infowars.com you'll find some

499
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,360

We're going to blow up

503
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,224
Civilian airliners

504
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,504
Attacked Marines

505
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,784
Guantanamo Bay

506
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,808
Army company

507
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,344
Disguised as Cubans

508
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,672
A bomb Washington DC

509
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,720
We have a James Bamford

510
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
Story

511
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,072
Best selling author for 2020 executive

512
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,632
With the CIA and NSA documents

513
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:36,960
The past wanted to blow up civilian Airlines wanted to bomb Washington

514
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,240
Wanted to shoot

515
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,776
How people in Miami is

516
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,800
The pretext to invade

517
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,568
Cuba

518
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,360
In 1962

519
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,920
Infowars.com

520
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,224
Mainstream

521
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,248
Later

522
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,784
His head was blown off

523
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,808
We are becoming

524
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,088
Society in 2000

525
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,112
71

526
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,904
This is Operation Northwoods

527
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,440
But he doesn't use the name

528
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,488
You mentioned it multiple times

529
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,792
But I don't know if he knows the name

530
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,328
Or if he just doesn't

531
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,888
Trust that the audience will know the name

532
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,984
And understand what he's talking about that is interesting

533
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,008
Has that be I mean

534
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,032
Clearly

535
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,312
I didn't know about it

536
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,592
In 2000

537
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,152
A White Wave wouldn't surprise me if that

538
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:21,504
Spit particular thing gained more prominence awareness in the greater

539
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,672
If you're going to talk about this

540
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,208
And you know a lot about it

541
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,792
You might want to give people shorthand they can use to look into it

542
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,072
A little bit easier than

543
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,096
I guess

544
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,376
I'll try and figure out what

545
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:43,776
Land JFK turn down an operation Northwoods it's a little bit easier to

546
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,800
Look into it that is true

547
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:48,128
I don't know if it's a negligence or if it's

548
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:48,896
Just Alex being a

549
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,760
I could be could be anything

550
00:24:54,272 --> 00:25:00,416
Could just be he's Green Man he's not he's not that he's still young he doesn't know everything yet.

551
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:06,304
Years and hours of study to put in 15 hours a day

552
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,584
Same amount of effort

553
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,120
How many beats

554
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,656
He could make if he was coffee

555
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,680
16

556
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,704
A total of

557
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,728
16 Beats

558
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,008
Is the number he could bake

559
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,568
So I look

560
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,592
I think

561
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,384
Alex

562
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,408
Doesn't have

563
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,176
Have a great evidence

564
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,456
Here's a little

565
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
But more evidence

566
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,528
Back in 1993

567
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,576
What's in the New York Times October 28th

568
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,368
Rainbow bomber

569
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,160
Crane betrivers

570
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:35,232
And allowed that bombing to go forward

571
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,768
They got caught

572
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,584
Telling him to like Obama

573
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,376
She was worried about

574
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,400
Ben cream for

575
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,192
What am I saying I'm saying who

576
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,472
Who stands to gain from this

577
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,752
Who has the motive

578
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:56,736
So prove any of this stuff about the prior bombing

579
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,016
Another World Trade Center

580
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:58,784
This all comes

581
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,856
Comments made by Ahmad Salaam

582
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:05,184
The FBI who had a fuse inside the group

583
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,976
But that was planning that bomber

584
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:11,840
Small concrete information the FBI was aware that a bombing was being planned but they weren't aware of the

585
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,864
The specific details

586
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:19,776
After the bombing salaam recorded conversations between himself and the FBI where he made claims like that the

587
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,824
Bomb was cooked with the supervision of quote

588
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,616
The bureau and the DEA

589
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,432
But that's not something that's been substantiated

590
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,992
And it was widely investigated and reported

591
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:35,392
Impressed at the time committed admitted to committing perjury and also

592
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,160
Flying a bunch

593
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:42,816
For instance he admitted that quote when he met his wife he brags falsely that he acted as security for the president of Egypt

594
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,376
This is from an article for 1995

595
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:50,496
When the LA Times began working with the FBI in May 1991

596
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,568
During that time he said he lied to an FBI

597
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:59,968
Bragging that he knew Libya's leader moammar Kadafi and a rock's president Saddam Hussein

598
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,272
Military anatomic capabilities of other come

599
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:09,440
In addition to that he lied under oath while serving as a state witness so his credibility isn't strong enough to serve as the

600
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:14,560
Firestone have a conspiracy that the government did the prior bombing or Dynamite

601
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:18,656
This is exactly what you want to believe so he

602
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,984
Critically accept whatever information allows him to justify the

603
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,008
Conclusion he would

604
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,544
With or without ever

605
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,592
This is basically his whole game

606
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,640
What we got

607
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:29,920
Yep

608
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,224
Here's my here's my feeling

609
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,504
Okay

610
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,272
It's

611
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,064
You lied to the FBI

612
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,344
And they believed you

613
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,368
That's on them

614
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:41,184
I feel like that should be the rule

615
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:47,840
For the FBI's you should be able to you should know you're the FBI or the CIA

616
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,888
The FBI or the CIA and have them go

617
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:52,704
Sounds good to me boss and then get to work

618
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,544
It's fanciful the way you think

619
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:02,176
I hold them to a higher standard of being able to at least look into whether or not a liar is lying to them

620
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,248
Weather whether or not

621
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,784
4 alive

622
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:13,440
I think that it is indicative of your credibility if you lie so that's more

623
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,208
Mypoints

624
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:23,424
Killer only got caught because

625
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,960
He said

626
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,728
A disc

627
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,496
To the police

628
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:30,848
Part of the conditions of him sending this floppy disk to the police

629
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,640
Was that they had to promise not to trace

630
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:39,040
Until they did absolutely. I'm just saying that the

631
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,856
Play I should take responsibility for their own f******

632
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:48,768
They should be like Oh I'm mad at this guy I'm sure that guy committed perjury.

633
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,864
A fair world and just

634
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,496
Shouldn't be able to be punished for successfully lying

635
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:03,360
To feel that way if you successfully lied to the FBI venue will Nikki

636
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,384
Trouble anyway

637
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,808
Food delivery

638
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:18,464
Want you to the statute of limitations I feel like that's important

639
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,864
That's great I'm glad we had this policy has a number that he's going to put on the percentage

640
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,424
This was a false flag

641
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
Media

642
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,032
Able to get him via his cell phone

643
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,568
They're on the scene a month

644
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,896
Please be praying for the dead and dying

645
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,200
Yeah you sound sincere

646
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,272
Babylon

647
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,320
Create something like this

648
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,856
I'll tell you the bottom line

649
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,648
98%

650
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,952
Orchestrated

651
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,720
Control Bonnie

652
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:54,048
I've been telling you this was going to happen 98

653
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:54,816
Percent chance

654
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,608
Hi

655
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,144
Trinity

656
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,192
Boilerplate for him it's

657
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:04,800
Do you know there's a little bit later we can already see the kernels of it

658
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:08,640
Feels like a little bit autopilot here on 9/11

659
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,944
I mean other than like

660
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,248
I feel like he's excited

661
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:19,648
You know he's like oh s*** 911 this is a big deal

662
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,672
The amount of audience

663
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:26,048
Probably does this is a very early example of the tragedy is good for business

664
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,352
Kind of situation here

665
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,632
Yeah I definitely think so

666
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,424
911

667
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,984
It's cynical man

668
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,568
Yeah it's really Bleak delivered to this this image of

669
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,872
Wolf yeah

670
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,992
It is it is always interesting to me

671
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,272
Whenever he's

672
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,552
Adding like

673
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,600
This modern-day Babylon wear

674
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,368
Like

675
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,904
He saying we haven't,

676
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,672
2

677
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:55,232
You know he's saying time

678
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,816
The government did it to us

679
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:05,728
If we hadn't created such a shity society then the government would have done this to understand

680
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:12,128
Push and pull exist in the present day to like destroy us

681
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,432
Go because we have abortions

682
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,576
Stream Christian right

683
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,600
This this

684
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
Like

685
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:26,464
Notion that we deserve this punishment that's coming

686
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,768
That the punishment is almost

687
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,048
It's like a holy

688
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,912
And the unspoken part of that is

689
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,960
Everybody else that there's that punishment

690
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:43,104
Right we are The Devout who will be the remnants binocular 5 this

691
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,688
This holy punishment

692
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:49,504
Hold on to those thoughts because this

693
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,272
A rollator

694
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,112
Explicitly the feelings are already getting

695
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,392
So

696
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,440
Look Alex had some other stories

697
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,768
In addition to stories that he covered

698
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,304
About the

699
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,072
Becoming of

700
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,864
Realized

701
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,400
I should probably stop saying look

702
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,800
But before every Clips appointed me as well

703
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,616
Digression

704
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,640
I'm getting a little self-conscious

705
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,920
About that out of nowhere

706
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:22,528
But Alex has some other stories that he was covering that he feels

707
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
Possibly perfect

708
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,344
Everyday

709
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,392
I read news stories today

710
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,160
They were telling you that

711
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,696
We're going to be hit by terrorists

712
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,000
But it was going to happen anytime give up your ride

713
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,560
I've been telling us we're going to get hit by an

714
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,840
Anthrax

715
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,608
Smallpox

716
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,912
The API

717
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,448
Report on a secret meeting

718
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,728
Stop the heads of the

719
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,496
The media

720
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,776
Was fake news cast

721
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,544
They produced

722
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,312
I'm back

723
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,592
Gianna Jun

724
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,384
What I predicted 124

725
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,664
Going dead from anthrax

726
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,712
Martial law

727
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,736
The term used

728
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,760
I'm not saying this

729
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,528
Going to happen

730
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,832
But they've been preparing for it and they

731
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,856
Haven't seen

732
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,136
It's going to happen

733
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:04,512
It's a little interesting to note that Alex was in a decent ballpark here in terms of talking about smallpox

734
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,280
Anthrax

735
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:11,680
I don't necessarily give him credit for protecting anything but it was a topic that would become much more relevant to the days after 9

736
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,728
It's not surprising

737
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:18,336
After a giant terrorist attack you would be concerned about another attack happen

738
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:22,176
Putting antibiotic agent would be a really devastating second hit

739
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,736
So if you're the government you'd want to be safe

740
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,320
Thus after 9/11 discussion about the

741
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,600
Agent since they are

742
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,880
Pretty common

743
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,672
Accessible and Dangerous Ones

744
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,952
But you'll be worried about terrorist

745
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,488
Getting ahold of end-user

746
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,816
As for why I was talking to bunch about these things

747
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,096
Before 911

748
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,120
I have a few theories

749
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:46,496
The first is that in 1998 the military made Anthrax vaccination man

750
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,288
Natori

751
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,592
2000 with a very high-profile case

752
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,640
Eye of major Sunnyvale

753
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,432
Who refused to take the vaccine

754
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,968
And was ultimately discharged

755
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,736
From the service

756
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:03,648
After this base embarked on a long journey of trying to sue folks about the vaccination if you consult some of the

757
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,928
Contemporary material

758
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,720
It really reads a lot like

759
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,768
The talking points about the covid vaccine

760
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:09,792
Today

761
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,584
For instance here's a bit from the washing

762
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,448
The Post article about Sony's lawsuit against the FDA from May 2001

763
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:21,568
The suit seeks a court order that would require the FDA to treat the vaccine as anak

764
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,592
Experimental drug

765
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,872
Such a ruling with me

766
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:27,200
I mean the military could no longer without informing

767
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,784
To be clear enlisted person still have the right to informed

768
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:35,392
Toby policies in place where refusal to accept something will violate the terms of their

769
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,440
But these are not

770
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
Killed

771
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,536
Don't sneak up on them

772
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:47,936
Behind

773
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,984
Going to spend the next twenty years in the brig

774
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,264
It's just like oh I mean

775
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,544
Yeah we get it

776
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,944
And if that's what you want to do that's dumb but I mean you're just fired by that's fine why would we not want

777
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,272
All of our soldiers to be immune to a possible weapon

778
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,808
Cuz what if

779
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,112
Dand

780
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:13,024
So this is a going I'd like you hear that same thing like the emergency experimental drug

781
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,352
Kind of language that is mirrored and echoed

782
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,888
Entirely 20 years later

783
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:21,216
This is essentially right now it's his wheelhouse this story

784
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,776
So I would guess that the odds are very good

785
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,544
But he was following this

786
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,616
Entire situation in creating exaggerated narratives out of it

787
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:33,248
Which would make Anthrax a really hot topic on his show in the anthrax vaccine now they want to force it on you

788
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:37,088
And honestly maybe it wouldn't have been relevant to most

789
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:40,672
People until after 9/11 gives the appearance of Alex talking

790
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,952
Think about this whole lot

791
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,488
Rite Aid package

792
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,024
Because he was

793
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,304
Hey Matt hey

794
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,072
Niche

795
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,864
Area of focus

796
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,632
Guess for instance

797
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,168
The military and tobacco

798
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,192
Oxidation

799
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:55,008
He will have that kind of information to other people

800
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,288
Just wouldn't be aware of it

801
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:03,456
I'm so for the meeting of the media and the Joint Chiefs this took a little while to sort out what I think is going on

802
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:09,856
Pretty confident about this 2000

803
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:13,952
Tabletop tabletop exercise where they simulated biological terrorist

804
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,232
Attack that you smallpox

805
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,280
The agent in the fictional scenario

806
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:23,424
This with a lot of the details that Alex was talking about and some of the participants in the exercise included members of the press

807
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,264
Like Judith Miller from The New York Times and Mary Walsh from CBS News

808
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:32,896
It also included people had policy experience taking on the roles of people in important government position

809
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:36,992
For instance David gergen played the National Security advisor

810
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,784
Although he was not

811
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,160
General John student

812
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:44,928
Chiefs

813
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,952
In the scenario

814
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,768
And unfortunately high percentage of Alex's narrative

815
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:52,608
About reality come from selectively misrepresenting things that people do

816
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:55,680
In scenario exercises so I'm going to bet that this is where he's pulling

817
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,960
Yeah that's

818
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,752
Steph lockstep enough for me

819
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,520
Totally

820
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:02,848
Other examples

821
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:09,248
My point is that at first glance it feels almost impressive that Alex is bringing up how he's been talking about smallpox and Anthrax

822
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,528
Prior to 9/11

823
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:13,344
Knowing what we know that these will become Hot Topic

824
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,392
Pics of conversation in the coming days

825
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,416
But it's not really

826
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:19,488
When you take a moment to ask yourself if there's a reason why

827
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,280
He would be talking about the subject

828
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,560
The time

829
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:28,704
Almost always you'll end up disappointing yourself when you realize that he's basically been doing the same week bulshit for over

830
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,752
Does really

831
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,568
Kind of deflating man it is

832
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,336
It is

833
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,104
Like

834
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,152
It is like just seeing

835
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:43,552
It's just a giant mass shooting to him it's just a bigger mass shooting with property damage

836
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:47,648
Eight like he doesn't have any emotion towards this Beyond

837
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:54,048
Feels very emotionless and that's who is a little bit robot

838
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,072
You calm down

839
00:37:55,328 --> 00:38:00,960
You've got a deep inner turmoil I can't calm down

840
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,848
I'm going to give a tiny warning before this nightclub because there's some discussion of

841
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,384
You know some of the

842
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,152
Bodies

843
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,688
Carnage

844
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,224
And he does that so graphic

845
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:15,808
He doesn't really he's getting the report from Jim

846
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,832
His buddy

847
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,112
Who was there

848
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,392
Yeah

849
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:22,464
There's only one reason that I really want to play this clip

850
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,256
And it's to give

851
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,792
One example

852
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,328
A couple times throughout the show

853
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,144
Alex seems to have a bizarre preoccupation

854
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,448
With details about the p

855
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,216
People who jump

856
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:36,800
Oh okay and I find that super distasteful

857
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:41,408
Write because that detail as like

858
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,736
Vocativ image

859
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
Terrifying

860
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,784
And it's straight out of a movie

861
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,088
Yeah

862
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,368
Here here is that

863
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,904
Skip ahead if you don't want to hear

864
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:52,928
Assertive

865
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,696
Recounting of

866
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,464
Details

867
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:57,280
Tell us where you work what you saw

868
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:58,816
The Rundown

869
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,608
For this audience exactly what developed

870
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,376
This

871
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,144
Morning

872
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,168
Add 28

873
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,728
The first plane slapped in

874
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,032
I slammed into the south at World Trade

875
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,176
Directly across the

876
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:17,248
Straight from the World Trade Center

877
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,016
Sunriver

878
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,648
Cancel 9 or so

879
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,440
I actually saw

880
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:29,024
Vibrating in some of the neighboring building

881
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,840
Cherry bombs

882
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,864
Call Ty

883
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:40,032
Workout

884
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,080
Pappadeaux

885
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,456
Setup point server number

886
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,248
Are people lined up on the 5th

887
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:53,088
Watching One World Trade Center burn

888
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,768
You could actually see

889
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,704
Were they on fire

890
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,128
Getting the details

891
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,688
Anyway

892
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:27,648
Necessarily think that there's anything to like horribly graphic but there is

893
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,928
The preoccupation that you

894
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,952
Contrack

895
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,256
I felt like it was

896
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,024
Was worth mentioning

897
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,560
Just that is

898
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,584
Response to it is

899
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,632
His hearing about people falling

900
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,168
Yeah jumping and he asks

901
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,192
Are they on fire

902
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,984
Tell me more gruesome

903
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,264
That's so

904
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,288
Weird

905
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,848
Trying to get a Faces of Death

906
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,616
Story

907
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,408
I'll just like

908
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,064
Oh man yeah what else is going on always it was there a foot flying to like all that's so gross.

909
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:01,440
More information view game by finding out if they were on fire

910
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,232
Oh I mean well you get to

911
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:07,328
Find out if they were on fire I don't know how it changes The Siege

912
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:11,424
It's very weird

913
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,448
Because it feels

914
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,752
Kind of exploitative in

915
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,776
Engrossed

916
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:19,360
Yep and I thought it would be exploitative engrossed if I played

917
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,640
Like the number of him

918
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,408
Fences that that

919
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,200
For like

920
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,992
Talks about people falling gross stuff

921
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,808
So this guy

922
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,576
It turns out

923
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:31,648
Yeah it's not only Alex's friend he also went

924
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,672
College

925
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,584
Implosion

926
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,864
I've ever seen in my life

927
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,168
Straight down

928
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,448
71 monolith

929
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:47,264
How could

930
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,032
Bonner

931
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:51,616
In the upper floors you say one playing at about 200 floor the other day

932
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,151
Route to 75th floor

933
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,687
How does that cause

934
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,455
The building

935
00:41:55,711 --> 00:42:00,831
Completely collapsed

936
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,671
It looks like there was charges

937
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:08,255
I just got to believe that was also charged

938
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,047
He's just

939
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,327
Guessing this

940
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,887
Straight up you the guy who is

941
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:16,191
Only on the show because he's a friend of all

942
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:16,959
Alex

943
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,495
And he is not April

944
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,263
Professional

945
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,079
Structural engineer

946
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:25,919
He turned on CNN is an expert for them so we could go on Alex's

947
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:31,551
Or are you just going to do a favor for your breath

948
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:34,367
Saturday

949
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:38,719
Structural Engineering

950
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,767
You may have had a degree

951
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:43,327
He said he studied at the Masters level

952
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:48,191
Which to have a master's degree

953
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,471
I don't know what that means

954
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:55,359
But I'll give you maybe an undergraduate degree in some kind of engineering that means he knows something I'm not.

955
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,663
I'm not necessarily going to take

956
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:01,503
Alex's friend who may be studied engineering

957
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,295
Oh

958
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,575
Well there must have been Bob

959
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:07,391
Then I'm not going to throw this out at you

960
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:11,487
Anybody who within the span of under 4 hours

961
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:17,375
Can suddenly decide that they placed charges around the bottom of the World Trade Center without anybody noticing

962
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,399
Well

963
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,935
That is somebody I don't trust

964
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,215
Well I think

965
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:21,983
You could talk

966
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:22,751
To somebody

967
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:26,079
And they could say it was surreal watching them go down a bit

968
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,639
It's like they had bombs or something

969
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,919
Casino time to

970
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,711
Deal with what you have experienced

971
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,735
How do you say

972
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,271
The closest corralero

973
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:36,575
I can think of to try any processed was it

974
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,111
Controlled demolition

975
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:44,511
That makes sense but you're on Alex's show Wildflower doing a credential of I'm a structural engineer

976
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,535
Nydia yeah

977
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,815
Yeah that's not me and

978
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:52,447
Some dude in a bar going like interesting that's cuz I remember I saw one of those on TV

979
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,983
It's a little a response

980
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,543
Alex is like

981
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:59,615
Phuc yea

982
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,407
This is government

983
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,199
What you have just told us her

984
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,223
I saw those build

985
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:04,991
Collab

986
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,527
You were right there I was watch

987
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,551
Watching it on the news

988
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,599
They wanted massive death

989
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,415
So you're saying as a structural engineer

990
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,183
You

991
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,463
Are witnessing this

992
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,999
It is collapsing

993
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,535
I'm in both the structure

994
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,071
Pictures only place

995
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,351
Charges are sober

996
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,887
Is that what you're saying

997
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,519
T.i. Alex is taking this and he is now

998
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:30,079
A professional structural engineer

999
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,103
We are going with

1000
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,687
This is a 98% now man this is one

1001
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:38,271
Hyundai I despise whenever you get asked

1002
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,551
Still yes or no question

1003
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,575
And you answer with something

1004
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:44,671
Sing wishy-washy what are you talkin about

1005
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,207
You know of course it didn't

1006
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,487
What are you doing

1007
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:51,839
I think it's a weird thing on out to show because you know that no matter what you say

1008
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:55,167
He's going to make it a quick unequivocally they like

1009
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:58,495
This is 100%

1010
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:02,847
Digicel structural engineer

1011
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,407
I started the Masters level because I was

1012
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:11,807
Picked out of college by the greatest structural engineers in the world

1013
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:18,207
George married but no one has ever even heard before I'm secretly Frank Lloyd Wright

1014
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,743
Frank Lloyd Wright

1015
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:22,559
So Alex is just pushing

1016
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:26,911
It's pretty hard when he's going with actually

1017
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,447
Do you see how the government

1018
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,727
Could stand to gain to bring us

1019
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,519
Release date from this happening

1020
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:36,639
I'm not even going to go there I have no opinion on that

1021
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:40,735
Tell you the facts I said

1022
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,439
Terrorism

1023
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,463
Martial law

1024
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,535
Hitler burning the reichstag is a

1025
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,071
Protection declare martial law

1026
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,399
Ridiculous

1027
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,447
For five years I'm just so glad that

1028
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,215
You're alive

1029
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:01,983
Have you had a chance

1030
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:02,751
To talk to your wife

1031
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,287
I have Alex

1032
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:07,359
A jarring turn I'm so glad you're alive

1033
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:13,759
Said it with no gladness if his voice whatsoever so this is approximately 15 minutes into the show

1034
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,039
And it's still

1035
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,831
Chaos and New York at this point

1036
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,599
In the day

1037
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:23,743
It's honestly hard to express exactly how distasteful it is to hear Alex covering the story This Way knowing what people were living

1038
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,511
Through

1039
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,047
I understand that he pretends

1040
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,327
Vdx the way

1041
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,095
He does because

1042
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,375
Smarter than fighting a larger

1043
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,399
Your evil entity the

1044
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,703
It's pulling the strings behind all world events

1045
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:34,239
Coming on the air at like

1046
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:39,615
11:15 on 9/11 and rambling about the reichstag fire and trying to get your guests

1047
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,383
Who's Justin

1048
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:44,991
A friend of yours who worked in a building near the World Trade Center to agree with you that the government

1049
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,015
Probably did this

1050
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,295
Is a b disrespect

1051
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:53,183
Record while after 9/11 people respond to any joke about the event by saying too soon

1052
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:57,791
Intelligent people can disagree about what is and is not too soon to joke about a trash

1053
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:58,815
The aristocrat

1054
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:05,215
Categorically undeniably

1055
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,495
Snow soon for this

1056
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:07,775
They're joke

1057
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,055
What's better too soon

1058
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,335
But this is not busy

1059
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,615
Is not never

1060
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,407
Soon or late

1061
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,175
Just don't do

1062
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:16,991
Especially

1063
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,551
I mean evening

1064
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:24,415
I was trying to put it in my head like maybe if you do subscribe to this worldview

1065
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,207
This doesn't have the view of address

1066
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,999
Even if it's a false flag

1067
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:32,095
People are still dead.

1068
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:38,495
Knowing what we know now we know the number of deaths was and I will say that Alex

1069
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,287
Believe that to be

1070
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,567
Much higher

1071
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,663
I think a lot of people myself included I thought

1072
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:48,479
There's no way that possibly couldn't have killed tens of

1073
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:52,575
Alex

1074
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,855
Stew in his head

1075
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,903
Believe this to be

1076
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,951
Do you know much

1077
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:02,047
More deadly than it was still bi

1078
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,327
This way

1079
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,911
An indication that like okay if you're arguing

1080
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,191
His conspiracy world

1081
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:10,495
Do doesn't make him see this as a tragedy that's

1082
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,287
That's macabre

1083
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:17,663
I don't even know what to think about what that kind of worldview would do to your

1084
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,431
Ability to a

1085
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,223
I really don't

1086
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,503
And then imagine

1087
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:25,599
If you have that worldview and you assumed that there were tens of thousands

1088
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,367
The Dead

1089
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,647
And then somebody's like

1090
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,671
Don't know

1091
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:30,719
The real number is actually much lower it

1092
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,535
I bet he felt disappointed

1093
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,375
I wouldn't want to I would want to speculate but

1094
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,399
That's so dark

1095
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:44,287
I think the only way you can go about the only way you can go about it I guess is

1096
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,311
To just be like

1097
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,847
F*** it's awful that

1098
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:47,871
These people died

1099
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:49,919
But I have to transmute that in

1100
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,687
Anguirus

1101
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:52,223
The globalist because they did the

1102
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:53,503
You know that's

1103
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:58,367
The only way you can do it and I don't even really feel that no I feel Highfield feel like

1104
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,647
There's an increased

1105
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:05,535
Anger that is being sublimated from now the pain or a vegetation

1106
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,583
Excitement it's easy

1107
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,399
There's a little bit of

1108
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,703
I got a lot of eyes on me

1109
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,495
Sure.

1110
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:18,591
Yeah I told you so I've been finding love is a good too I told you so

1111
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,615
It doesn't it doesn't

1112
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,663
Feel-Rite

1113
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,455
So this doesn't feel right either

1114
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:27,295
The amount of time between

1115
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,647
Imploded

1116
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,839
Could be evacuated

1117
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:47,007
About 45 minutes

1118
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,799
Like they were giving them

1119
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:49,567
Time

1120
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,103
To evacuate again

1121
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,895
The grid

1122
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,431
Engineer

1123
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:57,247
Area you're saying your most

1124
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,015
Beautiful image

1125
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,295
Implosion you've ever

1126
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,063
See Nana

1127
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:05,695
Absolutely what is that voice tone is just

1128
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,255
Bizarre

1129
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:11,583
Spock and then also you noticed he's like trying to build up those Prudential

1130
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,887
Trying to really stress the

1131
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,167
The credentials cousin

1132
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:18,751
This is gone from a first-hand account from a friend of his

1133
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,287
Into a store

1134
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:24,383
This is now something he's going to try and rely on as like

1135
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:28,479
The day off structural engineer said that they were bombs in the building

1136
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,783
Is your friend talkingshit

1137
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,831
Things were a little bit loose

1138
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,599
Oh totally

1139
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,647
Do you know I think

1140
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:42,047
I think that that part of the mythology is something that you hear a code in his show in later years

1141
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,095
It is it is such a like

1142
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:47,679
Don't get Orwell all this friends kind of know this like

1143
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,703
Drop

1144
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,751
Something that makes you a little bit

1145
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:53,567
More than just a regular layperson in there

1146
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,895
And Alex will immediately run with it Beyond

1147
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:58,687
Reason

1148
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:01,759
Hope that you're if you were friend he's friend

1149
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,527
You know that

1150
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:04,575
Maybe you'd hope that you'd be a little careful

1151
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:05,599
You would think

1152
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:09,183
But apparently you don't maybe subconsciously they want to make him happy

1153
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,207
Maybe now

1154
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:12,511
So we have some early misreporting

1155
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:16,607
Aircraft Landing the boat

1156
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,655
World Trade Center towers they have

1157
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:22,239
Praying for everyone

1158
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:23,775
We have another plane

1159
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:25,311
Smashing into the Pentagon

1160
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,615
A part of the structure has caved in

1161
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:28,639
Being reported

1162
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,431
Another one slammed into the

1163
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:31,711
Pittsburgh PA

1164
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,479
Airport

1165
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,503
Run outside

1166
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,783
International Airport

1167
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,343
Just Dance US Canada

1168
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,391
Mexico borders have been

1169
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,183
Shield that is martial law

1170
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:41,951
Gentleman

1171
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:46,047
You can see hear some preliminary reports that Alex is Aaron that are not correct

1172
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:50,143
And in some ways this is stuff that's expected and you can give him some leeway

1173
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:50,911
On some of this

1174
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:54,495
However the Tonys using is completely different than at the

1175
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:58,335
The beginning of the show where you said that there were reports of bombs in schools but that may not be

1176
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,103
True

1177
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:03,455
Now things have a much more factual delivery from Alex but what he saying

1178
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:06,271
Is the same unreliable fog of immediacy

1179
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:13,695
The plane in Pennsylvania didn't hit the airport and I don't know if that was something that was even widely reported in Arab

1180
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:16,511
Gypsy some kind of miscommunication Happening Here

1181
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,047
I'm not going to be a huge dick about

1182
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,095
The other piece of information

1183
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:20,863
Is a bigger

1184
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:25,471
The US Canada and US Mexico borders were not closed in response to

1185
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:26,239
911

1186
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,519
Security was tight

1187
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,543
As one would expect

1188
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:33,151
But the fact that Alex is reporting that the borders are just sealed is definitely not

1189
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:33,919
Correct

1190
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:37,503
This again would be something I wouldn't be a huge dick about because

1191
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,039
I think that it also seems like

1192
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,319
The kind of information you could

1193
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:42,623
Here and it makes sense on a day like that

1194
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:48,767
It's also understandable as an errored some sort of the miscommunication I can say they're clamping down on security and you should

1195
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,559
Misinterpreted or whatever

1196
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,863
But then Alex says that next sense

1197
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:55,423
That's martial-law ladies and gentlemen

1198
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,983
Ceiling borders is not martial law

1199
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,775
You may think that a state

1200
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,311
It's in martial law Woods

1201
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:05,663
Fuel their borders but it's not a defining characteristic of Martial law at all

1202
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:07,199
Why would you seal your borders

1203
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,527
I mean not let anyone in or out

1204
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,063
Wilshire but that does

1205
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,343
Doesn't make sense in the long term

1206
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,111
Nope

1207
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,903
Martial law is something that needs

1208
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:16,671
Be invoked

1209
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:22,815
And it involves the military taking over governing and law enforcement operations which traditionally are held by civilians

1210
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:29,471
Princeton's in 1954 Russell County in Alabama had been consumed by organized crime to the point where

1211
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:30,495
Corruption

1212
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:35,103
It made the existing political and law enforcement apparatus essentially a rogue and a t

1213
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,895
Culminating with the deputy

1214
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:39,199
TV Sheriff assassinating a candidate for district

1215
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:41,503
Who is seen as a threat to the racquet

1216
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:46,367
So the governor declared a limited martial law where the National Guard came into controlling

1217
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,135
Clean things up

1218
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:49,183
They're obviously more messy

1219
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,975
Incarnations of martial law

1220
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,999
Principle is the same

1221
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:58,143
Martial law requires that the civilian authorities are temporarily replaced by military authorities

1222
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:00,703
And sealing the Border does not qualify is that at all

1223
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,007
This is a big deal because

1224
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:06,847
I really don't think Alex understands the concept of Martial law at all

1225
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:11,967
I think he just uses it as a scary buzzword to evoke negative feelings in the listeners

1226
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:12,735
But it often does

1227
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,783
Don't seem relevant to the things he's discussing at all

1228
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:20,927
Marshall are supposed to be his big thing like his main topic of expertise and I don't think he even understands it on

1229
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:21,951
Basically

1230
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,487
Really

1231
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,535
He wants to just say like

1232
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,559
Totalitarian

1233
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:34,495
Say it has to be Marshall I can't because she wants to see you scary

1234
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,287
Like he's still expect

1235
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,311
He thinks that

1236
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:41,663
Biting could be president during martial law you know like

1237
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,711
You know like all of those things

1238
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:47,551
Match up with marshmallow

1239
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,087
Biking

1240
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:52,159
Could rely upon himself General ahead of the armed service

1241
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:58,047
I understand I understand the technicalities there but I mean

1242
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:58,815
You know what I mean

1243
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:03,167
He just means that there is complete and total control over what you can and cannot do

1244
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:03,935
Not that

1245
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:06,751
The military is going to run things slightly different

1246
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:10,335
No I think I agree I agree but I think more

1247
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,615
Specifically I think

1248
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:14,175
It's just a catch-all word for like

1249
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,199
When cops

1250
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:21,599
Are doing things that make me uncomfortable black masks as martial law

1251
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:23,903
But you this is martial law

1252
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:24,671
They don't

1253
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:29,023
Give you their names and back

1254
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:32,095
Martial law

1255
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,119
In fact

1256
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,423
You could ask if you could argue that some things

1257
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,447
Could be

1258
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:39,519
In hindsight should it ever get to that point

1259
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,799
Step Sports

1260
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:43,359
Martial law

1261
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:47,199
You don't know at this point necessarily that's

1262
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,247
BEP.

1263
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,015
The conclusion

1264
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:52,063
That all

1265
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,855
Tigrett so gym

1266
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:55,647
Has another little

1267
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:57,695
Piece of information that I find fast

1268
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:02,047
Right now I can tell you a third building that's across

1269
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,959
About a 56

1270
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:13,311
I Can See Fire Through the Windows on a bout

1271
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:22,015
5260 story building on fire

1272
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,295
As well do you know the name of that build

1273
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:26,623
It's one of the World Trade Center buildings

1274
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,743
Something like that

1275
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:32,511
Is Building 7

1276
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:38,911
In the World Trade Center complex there were a bunch of buildings but it's important to understand their relative sizes

1277
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:42,751
1 into were the Twin Towers which were much taller than the other

1278
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:47,103
Building 3 is the Marriott Hotel in was 22 stories tall

1279
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,919
Buildings five and six were Nine Stories till

1280
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:53,247
Building 7 is the one that Jim is talking about

1281
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:56,063
For sure given that it was 47 stories tall

1282
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:59,391
And Jim mentioned that he's on a boat on the Hudson

1283
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:02,207
A bit of figuring out his vantage point

1284
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:05,279
Eddie had to have been a little bit more time

1285
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:07,839
Geo locate where he would have been chair

1286
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,887
I don't think that any of the other buildings

1287
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,423
Would have been visible to him

1288
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,959
Other than Building 7

1289
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:15,519
Based on where his view would have been

1290
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:17,055
The other ones would have been

1291
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:17,823
Obscured by a

1292
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,383
7

1293
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:23,455
Fall beginning at approximately 5:20 p.m.

1294
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:26,015
Phillies 5 hours after this call

1295
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:31,391
The conspiracies that Alex will be pushing later characterized the Fire and Building 7 is insignificant

1296
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:34,463
But here on Alex's own show he hasn't eyewitness

1297
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,743
Is an friend of his

1298
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:38,815
Reporting that the whole side of the building is smoking

1299
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:41,119
Alex probably doesn't remember

1300
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,655
This part of that conversation

1301
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:44,447
And it doesn't match

1302
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,727
His later

1303
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:48,543
Later information base

1304
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,847
Despoiled by your own friend

1305
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:56,991
Terrible yeah it kind of makes Building 7 female less like The Smoking Gun

1306
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:59,807
Tony vallot it seems more like the smoke

1307
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:00,575
King Garden

1308
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,367
It's a smoking building

1309
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,695
This is not a time for ponds

1310
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,743
Anyway Alex has another Gaston

1311
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,351
Heavy Hitters

1312
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,399
Harry thank you for holding

1313
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,167
Ensure

1314
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:15,935
Tom

1315
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:20,031
You been covering the stuff for years you know I've been on your show predicting this

1316
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,311
Warning people

1317
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:22,591
I put out press release

1318
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:23,359
Places on it

1319
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:27,455
This was going to happen and take my ride is your take on all of this

1320
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,223
Brownfield

1321
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:29,247
But you know

1322
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:32,063
Alex believe it or not it did not Shock

1323
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,087
Very much

1324
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:37,183
Cool wrong with these people I don't know

1325
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:43,583
The dairy Brownfield is a seventy-year-old radio guy from Missouri who hosted the show that's described as

1326
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:45,119
Agricultural news

1327
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:47,423
I think it's less of a show like

1328
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:52,543
Breaking news about growing corn and more like news that's tailored towards the agricultural community

1329
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,847
Except I'm not sure if that's the case

1330
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,919
He started something called the Brownfield Network

1331
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,199
Which still exists

1332
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:03,295
It's like a news distribution service

1333
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,319
You go to their website

1334
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:07,647
It's all about Farm okay

1335
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:09,695
When I Was preparing this episode

1336
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:11,487
Is quote rain comes at

1337
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:13,535
Optimal time for Illinois farmer

1338
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:15,327
That's Farmers singular

1339
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:21,215
This is an article about Sanborn who was thrilled that it rained because it helped his Bean crop

1340
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:23,263
This is the top headline on

1341
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,335
Website

1342
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:30,175
I mean yes oh of course he's not surprised that 9/11 happen

1343
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,711
You know

1344
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,991
Pass to someone else's

1345
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:35,551
Maintaining the Brownfield

1346
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:36,831
Like

1347
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:40,159
Indicative maybe of the news who's putting out Daddy's

1348
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:41,951
Rain helped my b

1349
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:43,999
Twist

1350
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:47,071
I was really expecting you to go the opposite direction

1351
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:52,191
I was expecting that agricultural things to be some sort of like smokescreen at you don't like

1352
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:58,591
Americans for Prosperity you're not really surprised I probably was right wing weirdo conspiracy

1353
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:01,663
A fair amount of it might have been like

1354
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:04,479
Weevils are actually robots from the government Maybe

1355
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:09,087
This old man out of Missouri is apparently someone out

1356
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:11,391
Had to get on to get his take

1357
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:14,463
And apparently he does not give a s***

1358
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:17,023
A gives a s*** but he's like I'm not

1359
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:19,839
Surprise

1360
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:20,863
But here's the thing

1361
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,143
There's big

1362
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:24,191
Dairy has to bring

1363
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:26,495
It's Jerry but if I could be

1364
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,263
Like milk

1365
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:31,103
A big news that he has

1366
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:34,687
Bring Alex's attention of course already knows about this

1367
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:39,295
My original plan today was to talk with Charla

1368
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:40,831
Hazel Burke

1369
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:41,599
And

1370
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:45,695
I called her she was one of the individuals that didn't know a thing about this

1371
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,719
Listen to my contacts

1372
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,023
Need to change our program

1373
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:51,327
And she just called back

1374
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,351
A moment ago

1375
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,399
She said that her husband

1376
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:57,215
Friend that's a Belgian of the Belgian

1377
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:58,239
Businessman

1378
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:00,799
And he stole in all of Europe

1379
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:02,591
Pull up the news that two men

1380
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,383
Passports

1381
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:06,175
Entered into Afghanistan

1382
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:07,967
Sandlot

1383
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:08,735
Today's

1384
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:09,503
Citgo

1385
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:11,807
He says this is all over here up

1386
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,343
Not here in the United

1387
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:16,415
You heard anything about that

1388
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,463
Yes

1389
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:19,743
Yeah

1390
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:25,375
This is about Ahmad Shah massoud

1391
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:28,191
Masood was assassinated on September 9th

1392
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:30,239
2001 by men who had fake Belgium

1393
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,007
Passports

1394
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:33,055
All of the details are lost

1395
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,335
Totalitarian Alex

1396
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:37,151
Who just want to fudge details in order to prop up there

1397
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:37,919
Predetermined

1398
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:38,687
Conclusion

1399
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:42,271
That everything is a conspiracy that only they can see through

1400
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:48,159
And there is no correcting of this there is no like it comes up again later

1401
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,183
To Belgian

1402
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:52,511
Why not into Afghanistan

1403
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:56,863
Got to do what you're up to talking about it but it's censored in the American

1404
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,655
You guys have to have this wrong

1405
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:00,191
Shouldn't you have

1406
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:02,495
A real good sense of something

1407
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:05,311
Alex response you with

1408
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,847
Yeah

1409
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,663
I guess that be a big

1410
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:15,295
RedFlagDeals if you feel like

1411
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:21,951
Horse confident about what I'm hearing

1412
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:26,047
My instinct is to say yes but I know that this is stupid so I'm going to go with

1413
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:30,911
Barry has a bottom-line

1414
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:35,007
What is your bottom line analysis what's Your Gut level

1415
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:37,311
Feeling on all of this who do you think's behind

1416
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:38,591
Well

1417
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,431
Telephone number

1418
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,223
But what

1419
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:46,783
Earlier in this showing I have had 1000

1420
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,575
Sometimes on the air I read the back

1421
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,927
And I'm real referring here to the holy scriptures

1422
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,463
Lindsay on earlier this

1423
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:55,743
Going to see what he thought

1424
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:56,767
Couldn't

1425
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:02,399
But that we know that we're going to have I one world order a new world.

1426
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,423
We know it's coming

1427
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,959
We know the Antichrist

1428
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:06,495
Standing by

1429
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:11,103
I don't know

1430
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,895
Certainly don't have the power

1431
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,943
To clean all this mess up

1432
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:15,711
Make it

1433
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:18,527
Currently the Antichrist

1434
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,831
Standing by

1435
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:21,599
Jesus

1436
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:25,183
Proud boys

1437
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:27,743
Could be could be a woman as well

1438
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,279
I have to save it

1439
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:30,559
I guess for dairy

1440
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:31,839
He

1441
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:34,399
Gummy he died at like almost 80

1442
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,167
Yeah

1443
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,959
The new world order did not come

1444
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:39,263
To being the devil didn't come back

1445
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:41,567
Nope

1446
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,591
Pretty like

1447
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,711
I think I'd be disappointed

1448
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:53,087
Furious if I spent my entire life predicting the Antichrist is coming and then I just

1449
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:53,855
Died

1450
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:58,975
Like it was fine feel empty climatic

1451
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:00,255
Words would have been like

1452
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,911
To be like I guess I'm the Antichrist panel

1453
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,191
Like you got it

1454
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:11,775
Maybe an action movie Antichrist

1455
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:12,543
This

1456
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:14,335
Not going to work

1457
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,615
So

1458
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:16,895
Yeah we've got

1459
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,431
Alex's body

1460
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,455
We got Dairy

1461
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,991
Again Alex has another guy

1462
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:24,575
Let's go to Ted Anderson owner of Genesis

1463
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:25,599
Communication

1464
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,391
Resources

1465
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:33,023
Very upset about all of this

1466
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:34,303
My testosterone level

1467
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,351
Glowing just like yours are out there

1468
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,119
Ted Andrews

1469
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,399
God bless the server

1470
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:39,167
For providing

1471
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:40,959
This network in a place for people to get accurate

1472
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:42,239
Information

1473
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,007
Financially

1474
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:44,543
Well obviously there's a lot of

1475
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,823
Crazy mixed-up

1476
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,871
Emotions going on in the Auto Mart

1477
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:48,895
Right now

1478
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:52,479
What's the World Trade Center that is where gold and silver trays in

1479
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:53,503
In the United States

1480
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,527
Is the largest market

1481
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,551
For gold and silver

1482
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:57,343
I was

1483
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,879
Trying to be

1484
01:04:59,135 --> 01:04:59,647
Ghoulish

1485
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,975
With my exaggeration but I expect

1486
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:04,255
I was way wrong

1487
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:06,047
I was not ghoulish enough

1488
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:08,351
No no

1489
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,631
Nope

1490
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:11,167
Hi

1491
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:16,799
Crack I think there's no bottom I'm convinced there's no bottom

1492
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,591
And it just keeps going

1493
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:21,663
Just keeps going hit those floors

1494
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:25,759
Men's shoes

1495
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:27,807
Try this song

1496
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:32,671
Forsyth

1497
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:36,255
It's very amazing to me to watch this happen I've never experienced this

1498
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,023
20

1499
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,815
Three years now that I've been in the business

1500
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:39,839
For the mark

1501
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,631
Actually been shut down like this

1502
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,423
And I won't open up at

1503
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:45,727
Until further notice

1504
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:46,495
Shield

1505
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:48,543
Troops Federal Protective

1506
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:49,567
Control of downtown

1507
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:50,335
Cities under

1508
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,615
Security Arrangements

1509
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,895
Well obviously Alex

1510
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:53,919
A major concern

1511
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:54,687
As for the p

1512
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,711
People that are sitting there

1513
01:05:56,223 --> 01:06:01,087
The paper wondering what's going to happen

1514
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,623
And hopefully the market

1515
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:03,903
Disabled

1516
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:07,999
I can get out with reasonable cost

1517
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:09,535
Well there's a

1518
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,303
B of a stamp

1519
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,327
He going on here at

1520
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,351
Midas resources

1521
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:14,143
Even calling in on the 800 number

1522
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,679
Please be patient we got a lot of

1523
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,447
People working them

1524
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:17,727
But

1525
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:19,007
You will not you will be

1526
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:19,775
Taking care of

1527
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:22,335
A lot of people are looking to have gold right now with the

1528
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:23,615
Shut down obviously

1529
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,639
Play the United States

1530
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,663
To be much tougher

1531
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:26,687
Buy the stuff

1532
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,991
Not every

1533
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:29,759
Not every year

1534
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:32,063
Not every Ops

1535
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:33,343
Anymore

1536
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,647
So if you are calling and do that

1537
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,695
Be patient

1538
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:41,535
You responded to also hit me like a semi truck

1539
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:45,119
Obviously we should be concerned and I thought he was

1540
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:49,471
Going to say about those words

1541
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:54,335
On 911 I'm not finish it with listen to Grossmont Center because that's

1542
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:59,711
Third on your list we should be really concerned about the people who are stuck invested in paper money

1543
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:07,903
What is the number one thing that we should be concerned about is some people are just too

1544
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:11,487
Quit right now unbelievable I I just

1545
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:12,767
The sauce

1546
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:13,791
What is the I mean

1547
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:14,815
Wolf

1548
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,631
One Tower goes down and you think

1549
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:21,471
Lot of people are going to be stuck in paper money

1550
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,519
Yeah that's what I thought that's what I thought

1551
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:24,799
I need a tire open

1552
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:27,871
Ivy

1553
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:28,639
Cheese's

1554
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:29,919
Stouts

1555
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:33,247
That's grim

1556
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:35,039
There's just not enough lightning

1557
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:40,927
Furious that people believe in God cuz I think if we all just believed in Zeus only

1558
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,719
Then maybe we could get one person

1559
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,999
Struck by lightning bolt

1560
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,535
Whenever they pulled s*** like this

1561
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:46,559
It's

1562
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:48,351
Amazing

1563
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,399
A words fail

1564
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:52,191
Irish Times

1565
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,471
Because this is like

1566
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,495
You know I mean

1567
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:58,079
Without mincing words 911 is what made Alex is

1568
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:58,847
Career

1569
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:02,431

1570
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,199
Seem

1571
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:04,479
That concerned

1572
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,503
About

1573
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:08,831
Gathering accurate information about what's happened

1574
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:11,135
He is all over the place

1575
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,671
He doesn't seem like

1576
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,207
Lucky's emotionally

1577
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:17,535
All that affected by what's happening

1578
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,327
The guest

1579
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,351
AR

1580
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,631
Weirdo Farm guy

1581
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:24,703
Friend who he gets turned into the biggest

1582
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:26,495
Structural engineer in the world

1583
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:28,543
And his gold guy

1584
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:30,591
Does not great

1585
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:34,431
Yeah these are these are three certifiably insane people

1586
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:37,503
Well four of them obviously but one of them

1587
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:40,831
Well beyond that point

1588
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:42,879
Insanity history people

1589
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:44,159
Saying those things

1590
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:45,951
Astonishing

1591
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:49,279
Jim you could make

1592
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:51,071
Some argument

1593
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:53,887
For being less complicit

1594
01:08:54,143 --> 01:09:00,031
Cuz there were opportunities that Alex gave him to double down on some of his stuff

1595
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:02,591
I do believe

1596
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:03,615
But you know Alex

1597
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:04,895
You probably would know his tendons

1598
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:06,687
You know that you're

1599
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,991
Essentially doubling down by Nas

1600
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:09,759
Not pushing back

1601
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:10,527
Oh yeah

1602
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:11,295
Oh yeah

1603
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:17,951
That's good advice. Get out of paper money

1604
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:20,255
I would tell everybody make

1605
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,535
Make sure you got your cars

1606
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,559
Pull up gas

1607
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:23,583
Make sure you got plenty of

1608
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:24,351
Food

1609
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:25,631
Does water filters

1610
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:28,959
In the martial law stuff starts cranking up I'm going to go to

1611
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:29,727
My parents house

And you're taking my little sister out of here now

1615
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,151

01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:46,367
And I'm going to stay here and I'm going to fight for this

1620
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,647
Country

1622

Jerry Brown

Wow

1630
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:21,695
Amazing to me how these people handle emergencies cuz they have no concept of scale

1631
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:22,719
And reaction

1632
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:24,511
You know like you do

01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:30,911
Covid there's only going to be lone survivors and then 2 weeks later they're like well I'm not dead yet so this isn't even real

1634
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:38,847

Humped though about Buddy

1641

01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:56,159
Well honestly I don't know whether I

1662
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:57,439
There's a lot of other words

1663
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,999
Just keeps coming back up there's a lack of

1664
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:00,767
Respect

1665
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:01,791
4

1666
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:02,815
Dude

1667
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,863
Reality

1668
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:07,423
Notion that we're all

1669
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:08,959
Experiencing something together

1670
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:12,031
You know yeah maybe I'm to collect

1671
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:13,567
Activists maybe I'm a sauce

1672
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:16,127
Berlin that way but

1673
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:18,431
I just wanted I find it abhorrent

1674
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,223
4 weeks

1675
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:22,271
There was no news organizations

1676
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:24,831
Who would begin to speak this callously

1677
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:25,599
About

1678
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,391
3 years

1679
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:30,975
No mainstream news organization would ever dare make

1680
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:32,511
Joke about 9/11

1681
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,303
This dude

1682
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:35,327
F******

1683
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,607
20 minutes

1684
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:38,399
Twin Towers falling

1685
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:44,799
Is like this is a great f****** day for me we got martial law going

1686
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:51,199
Non everything isn't

1687
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:54,527
Pretty f*****-up

1688
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:57,087
So I know that

1689
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:59,647
You know in 2008/2009

1690
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:01,695
When we've been listening to some of those episodes

1691
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:03,999
About half of the police are waking up

1692
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:07,327
Good people in the army or Waking Up

1693
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:09,119
A little bit higher numbers there

1694
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,215
About half

1695
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:19,871
Of the military and the police are woken up that's great

1696
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:23,967
Police

1697
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:28,063
Are woken up 2001

1698
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:30,623
Don't let him give you a police-state out of it

1699
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:31,903
We have the power

1700
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:32,671
The American

1701
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:33,439
People

1702
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:35,743
Police agencies in military

1703
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:37,023
I know that 75

1704
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:37,791
Isabella Perry

1705
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,071
Is awaiting what's happening

1706
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:39,839
About how

1707
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:40,607
The cops are

1708
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:43,679
We need to pray for the people that have died

1709
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:45,215
Our house go out to

1710
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:45,983
The family

1711
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:48,543
And I would just bring her on the airlord

1712
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:52,127
Heal our land do that

1713
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:53,919
Just landed the hill we don't want to be

1714
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:55,199
Parts of a needle

1715
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:56,735
Our country

1716
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:57,503
To be brought back

1717
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:00,319
And please.

1718
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,599
We pray that no biologic

1719
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:03,903
Have the government

1720
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,927
Predicting what happened

1721
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,487
Fox and ABC

1722
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:09,023
You seen the last month that I read

1723
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:09,791
They talked about 1

1724
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:14,143
God doesn't need citations from Fox News

1725
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,471
Weird

1726
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,751
Wow Alex

1727
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:19,775
So when

1728
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:20,543
You pray to me

1729
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,359
Now I wrote it down

1730
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:24,895
Long time ago

1731
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,687
So you should really know this by now

1732
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:27,967
But.

1733
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:34,367
Don't also be broadcasting your opinions about bulshit to other people

1734
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:40,767
Very specific relationship between you and me I'm glad you're you we do it that way okay I believe

1735
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:45,119
I don't remember the exact verse but there is something about like when you pray on

1736
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:46,911
Toomey's provide sources

1737
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:53,567
Peter the letter to the Thessalonians said

1738
01:14:54,079 --> 01:15:00,223
You should start a pirate radio station and really start getting into it with people you know what I'm saying like correction

1739
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:01,503
I believe it was

1740
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:06,623
Copic apologies

1741
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:12,255
Gross that's really f***** up

1742
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:14,815
Interesting thoughts

1743
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:17,375
I was one of the people

1744
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:19,679
That cuz you're going to have to go whenever watching

1745
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:20,447
2K was

1746
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:21,727
You know what they're trying to do

1747
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:23,007
I'm sorry what

1748
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:25,055
Believe that this was

1749
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,847
Going to piano

1750
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:31,455
We were going to see some

1751
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:32,991
Sing of this nature happen

1752
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,063
At the turn of the century

1753
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:38,111
Maybe I'll even on New Year's Eve

1754
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:39,647
But that was too. Just

1755
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:41,695
The pretext for them to put in their female bunker

1756
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:48,351
Control grid

1757
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:50,399
Why didn't they go ahead and do it

1758
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,167
That night

1759
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:52,703
Because the world was ready

1760
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:54,751
Also bladimir

1761
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:56,799
Put that just taking power Yeltsin it

1762
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:57,567
Disappeared

1763
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:58,847
A lot of power jockey

1764
01:15:59,103 --> 01:15:59,615
What's going on

1765
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:03,199
But I still believe

1766
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:06,271
The plan

1767
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,551
If they had four wife

1768
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,319
2K

1769
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,599
Wow

1770
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:11,391
Highbury alright

1771
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:12,671
Okay so here's

1772
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:14,207
Here's what I gathered from that

1773
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,231
1

1774
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:18,047
Whenever Y2K was is not an

1775
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:19,327
Unacceptable thing to say

1776
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,095
It's in the name

1777
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:26,751
And that but it was it was kind of a long stretch for people like them

1778
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:30,591
Yeah that's true

1779
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:32,895
58 could have been

1780
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:34,175
2010

1781
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:35,711
Tournament 2020

1782
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:37,503
2100

1783
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,527
You have decided

1784
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:41,087
Whatever happens after you've decided that white

1785
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:42,623
UK is the plan

1786
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:43,647
If that's part

1787
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,183
Well I don't think

1788
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:47,743
I may be perfectly honest

1789
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:49,023
I haven't listened

1790
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:51,071
Come to the entirety of dairy Brownfield

1791
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:52,607
Lowe's catalog

1792
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:55,167
New new buses

1793
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:59,007
Farm Report

1794
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:01,055
No would but I don't

1795
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:04,895
Prior to Y2K he was like they're going to blow up the Twin Towers

1796
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:08,223
So he's just sort of retroactively being like

1797
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:10,015
This is what I thought was going to happen

1798
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:12,575
Also you have to understand

1799
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:13,855
Grassroots

1800
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:14,623
Basic

1801
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,927
Nuts and bolts level chair

1802
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:17,951
This means

1803
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:21,023
This is what the globalist or planning to do

1804
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,303
They didn't do it

1805
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:23,839
So now they did it

1806
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:25,375
It is

1807
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,655
A hundred percent

1808
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:28,447
Conspiracy

1809
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:29,983
It somehow

1810
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:31,007
The brakes on a

1811
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:35,871
For some reason whenever you want was jockey for power

1812
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:37,151
They couldn't get things up

1813
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:40,479
Two-speed organization is lacking

1814
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:43,295
Kind of sloppy let's just face

1815
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:46,623
There's no way around

1816
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:47,391
Receive

1817
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:49,183
Groundwork

1818
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:51,743
It's a it's an assumption that's cooked

1819
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:53,023
Into every conversation

1820
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:55,583
It's silly

1821
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,119
So

1822
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:58,655
Sounds very familiar

1823
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:00,959
They have the feds taking over

1824
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:02,239
Central areas of downtown

1825
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:03,007
Cities in

1826
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:03,775
Capitals

1827
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:04,799
Confirmed

1828
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:07,615
This is the New World Order

1829
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,663
And look for the next

1830
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:10,431
He wait to say we

1831
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:11,711
Turning our guns

1832
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:13,759
So the terrorists don't blow up

1833
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:16,063
It'll be something along those lines

1834
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,391
Only big brother

1835
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:20,671
Trans the game

1836
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,999
Also I was thinking about this

1837
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:27,071
Disney keep saying that like only big brother it stands to gain

1838
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:30,143
I kept thinking like you do Elsa

1839
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:31,167
You

1840
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:35,007
That's why he's excited

1841
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:36,799
Obviously I don't think that's a motive

1842
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:37,567
Forward

1843
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:40,127
Alex doing 911 or something

1844
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:43,967
The game greatly from behaving the way he

1845
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:44,991
He is

1846
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:47,807
As as we're listening to that so like

1847
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:48,831
I don't know

1848
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:50,623
If I were him I

1849
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:51,903
I would be

1850
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:52,927
Thinking very

1851
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:54,463
Very little of my audience

1852
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,999
If I were stressing

1853
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,791
Akebono kind of ideas

1854
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:00,863
Apply

1855
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:07,007
Who gains from turning this into a conspiracy

1856
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:07,775
Conspiracies

1857
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:11,359
Once you start doing that though then you're just never going to come back

1858
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:13,919
You know who's who's benefiting off of

1859
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:15,711
This sandwich that I'm about to

1860
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:18,015
Is it me or is it Potbelly

1861
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:23,391
I bet it's Potbelly I'm at Potbelly's put evil should inside my sandwich and they're going to kill me and that's

1862
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:26,207
Because they don't want the money for me going back wait a second

1863
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:30,815
Who benefits from me by in the sandwich Terry Brownfield

1864
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:34,399
So Alex picks calls

1865
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,703
A little bit of a temper

1866
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:39,007
I can't believe somebody would call

1867
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:45,919
I can't believe this

1868
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:50,783
Can I listen to it every night

1869
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:53,855
Adam Carolla and dr. Drew where my guys

1870
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:57,951
Unfortunate Nightside but I love that show it made me

1871
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:59,487
Me feel very

1872
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:00,255
Comforted

1873
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:01,023
It felt like

1874
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:03,071
They're people who are struggling with stuff

1875
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:03,839
Fans

1876
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:05,119
Yeah you're not as alone

1877
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:07,167
Even if

1878
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,215
Making fun of everybody

1879
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,751
And being a little bit meme

1880
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:13,567
Really funny way

1881
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:16,640
On 911

1882
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,176
I think even the day after

1883
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,200
They

1884
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:21,504
Just took calls about what people wear

1885
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:24,832
And you know like just opening up and being like

1886
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:29,184
These kinds of fears and anxieties that you might be feeling our normal totally

1887
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,464
And

1888
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,744
You know we're all in

1889
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,024
This kind of together

1890
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:34,560
And it was really

1891
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:36,096
Meaningful man

1892
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:36,864
Alex doesn't

1893
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:38,656
HD

1894
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:39,680
Opposite

1895
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:41,728
It's like it makes it worse

1896
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:42,752
Yeah

1897
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:45,312
Kohl's makes things worse

1898
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:46,080
I really

1899
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:51,968
I find it so f***** out that Alex would take calls I know that's unacceptable to the first one

1900
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:55,296
Subway

1901
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:56,320
Okay

1902
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,856
I just listen to me for a second

1903
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:58,624
Place

1904
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,744
Oh God Revelations

1905
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:04,512
17

1906
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:06,816
Right now

1907
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:07,840
At this very moment

1908
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,888
What happened in New York now

1909
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,424
If you take the airline

1910
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,960
Read it to us

1911
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:15,264
It's it's huge

1912
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,312
Is lots of words

1913
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:18,336
Yeah yeah

1914
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:19,872
Dad is too long

1915
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:21,408
What's happening

1916
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:23,200
Is exactly what's in there

1917
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:26,272
If you take the airlines out of it and you take the

1918
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,576
They didn't know what planes were revelation

1919
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:32,672
They didn't know that this continent existed

1920
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:34,464
Any of you take that

1921
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:38,048
They'd never heard of I don't know the world

1922
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:43,680
He was going with if you take the airline

1923
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:47,776
He'll get into this year as actually

1924
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:50,592
Numerology

1925
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,664
Here are the flight numbers

1926
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,432
Play

1927
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:56,480
Flight 77

1928
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:57,760
White ones

1929
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:58,784
175

1930
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:00,320
It's like 33

1931
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:02,880
Number is aligned

1932
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:05,440
It's like 33

1933
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:07,744
All of us are obsessed with

1934
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,816
Okay you take these numbers and you add them together

1935
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:12,096
And you get a total of

1936
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:12,864
209

1937
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,448
Take two

1938
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:17,216
+ 9

1939
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:17,984
Is 11

1940
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:19,264
Bus 6

1941
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,288
Is 17

1942
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:21,568
Revelation

1943
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:22,336
17

1944
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:23,616
It describes what

1945
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,968
I have no idea if it's

1946
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:29,504
Coincidence or whatever

1947
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,040
Still the numbers are there the length

1948
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:33,856
Is there so this is stupid but it's also not correct

1949
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:34,624
Be played

1950
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,184
Are you saying is 33 is actually united 90

1951
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:39,744
Which ruins Alex's number riff

1952
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:42,304
Panda basically screws up his own weird

1953
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,584
Cryptic math videos

1954
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,352
Pull off here

1955
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:46,656
Either way this is a great use of time

1956
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:47,936
On the day the world

1957
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:49,728
This is

1958
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:50,752
This is bad like

1959
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:53,312
Alex should have cut him off when he started doing that

1960
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:55,360
Absolutely this is not like

1961
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:57,408
This isn't something that you should

1962
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:59,968
Humor

1963
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:02,784
I mean

1964
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:06,112
How do you not just letting sir sir

1965
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:11,488
Sir sir stopping topless right now sir and make things make sense

1966
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:12,256
You can't

1967
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,280
Because that's what your whole thing

1968
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:15,584
It's just that this is a different

1969
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:19,168
Nord unhinged or more detached from reality

1970
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:24,288
More obviously detached how about how about I'm going to throw this out at you sir

1971
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:30,688
If God speaks in order of operations addition and subtraction

1972
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,224
Then go f*** yourself

1973
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,248
I don't even want that

1974
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,040
If you are right

1975
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:40,160
I'm rather more stupid devil than a god whose like 2 + 4 is 6

1976
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:46,560
6 - 33 and that's where the Devil comes in God to saith unto me please excuse my dear

1977
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:50,400
I got that X

1978
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:54,240
Parentheses OnePlus and you moron

1979
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:55,776
Yep

1980
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:57,824
I find this very depressing

1981
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:00,128
Partially because he's got the flight

1982
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:04,224
Yeah that really sucks with his whole Revelation testing

1983
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:04,992
Suspend because

1984
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,272
The thing that he attached

1985
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:09,600
Are you took from earlier

1986
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:12,672
Wow okay so we entered the city is

1987
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:13,952
17

1988
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:14,976
Describe

1989
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:16,000
Going on right now

1990
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:20,608
What are we doing here to 17th number qanon

1991
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:22,144
Wow you're right

1992
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:29,056
Also it was very is talkin about a small town in Missouri named Sandy

1993
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:30,848
Call Noe

1994
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:37,504
It's just a short mention it doesn't mean anything

1995
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:38,528
I'm sorry

1996
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:39,808
On this show

1997
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:41,344
If there are things better

1998
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,136
Even slightly perhaps

1999
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:43,904
Not

2000
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,184
Tangentially related

2001
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,464
We're going to have to make a

2002
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:51,840
Fine I'll find a plate on the next episode of Derry Saints

2003
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:53,120
Thank you very much

2004
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:54,400
All right with this

2005
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:57,984
Cuz whenever Y2K happened or whatever alright we knew

2006
01:24:59,264 --> 01:24:59,776
That's all I got

2007
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:05,408
Those buildings went straight down John what are you

2008
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:07,200
You see happening there really gearing up

2009
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:13,088
I don't think we can accept one with expected I don't

2010
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,416
Make of all of this stuff

2011
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:17,184
It's up

2012
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:21,792
So what are you going to do

2013
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:25,888
I'm going to clean my weapon man I'm going to clean my weapon

2014
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:32,544
Don't you do that anyway

2015
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,592
I'm afraid to go but I just want to go by myself

2016
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:35,872
Oh my God

2017
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:39,200
These people

2018
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:43,296
Precise

2019
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:44,832
And

2020
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,440
They ought to be ostracized

2021
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:51,488
And everywhere else

2022
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,792
John I appreciate your call we don't know

2023
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:54,816
If the government did this

2024
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:55,584
We know they did the other way

2025
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:58,144
We know who Sam

2026
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:58,912
The game

2027
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:00,448
Final

2028
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:02,240
Ladies and gentlemen I'm not going any

2029
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:03,520
Any payment center what about you

2030
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:08,896
It's legitimately nuts to listen to this cuz it seems like Alex is in many ways on autopilot

2031
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:13,504
This whole song and dance here is so cookie-cutter that it almost doesn't seem like you need to be awake

2032
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,272
To do it

2033
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:19,648
He already said that he believes 98% chance of government did this and then later said the government did do that

2034
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:22,464
This caller is saying things that get into violence

2035
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:25,280
So how it's a little bit

2036
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:27,840
Who did this

2037
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:30,912
Wink wink and also I'm not going to let them take me Ohio

2038
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:35,520
It's really the same couching type of presentation he does all the time and it's really weird to see it being

2039
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:36,544
Deployed when talking about the

2040
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,080
The biggest event of his life

2041
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:40,640
Which happened a few hours earlier

2042
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:42,944
Yeah weird to say this but I don't

2043
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,224
Give a strong sense that Alex

2044
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:45,504
Cares that much that

2045
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,272
9/11 happen

2046
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,320
I don't think he gives a s*** at all

2047
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:53,184
It's weird it is one of the weirdest things that I love all the things

2048
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:55,232
That I was expecting Alex

2049
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:56,768
This is 911 episode to be

2050
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:58,304
Apathetic

2051
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,328
Was not one of them

2052
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:00,352
I think it

2053
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:03,424
It's more cynical than apathetic

2054
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:09,824
There's definitely a line of apathy that goes deep vein

2055
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:10,848
White

2056
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,152
But look

2057
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:14,432
He believes that it's the cover

2058
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:15,712
He's already said that it was

2059
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:21,088
But we don't know that for sure we just know that everything that would point

2060
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:22,368
To the government means the government

2061
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:25,952
And you know there's one person

2062
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:30,048
Saddam Hussein

2063
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:33,376
Why does government ever put him in power in the 70s

2064
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:35,680
Why was our big buddy to fight Iran

2065
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:37,984
Why was giving the chemical biological weapon

2066
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:38,752
Houston

2067
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:41,824
Through this and there is a chance

2068
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:44,128
Saddam Hussein

2069
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,920
I want that country note

2070
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:49,248
Buccaneers why

2071
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,528
Didn't they

2072
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:51,808
Take Saddam out

2073
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,880
1991 I asked you that question

2074
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:55,648
Fair enough

2075
01:27:56,928 --> 01:28:02,560
So I guess he's into blaming a rock sooner than George W bush

2076
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:04,352
That's that

2077
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,120
Themes

2078
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:11,008
Really not like what I would like to present himself that he would be nuked immediately

2079
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:18,176
Don't want you to be emperor of anywhere Ayr response why would that work out well

2080
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:18,944
At all like sugar

2081
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:22,016
You recognize the amount of Civilian death that would cause

2082
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:24,064
The pointlessness of

2083
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:24,832
Of

2084
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:26,368
Of that response

2085
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,136
Like that's

2086
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:27,904
Bucked up

2087
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:28,928
No people don't know

2088
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,256
You know

2089
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:34,560
I think we need to go back

2090
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:35,328
2

2091
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:36,352
Everybody being

2092
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:42,752
Really really terrified of nuclear weapons like the bombs and schools like they did

2093
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:45,056
Covers

2094
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:46,592
Instilled into children

2095
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:49,152
Way more afraid of nuclear weapons

2096
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:51,200
Apparently our

2097
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:52,480
It's it's a

2098
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:57,600
A lot of that stuff was so silly that it becomes mockable

2099
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:59,392
You know you might have a tendency to

2100
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:00,416
Take lightly

2101
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:01,952
The affair

2102
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:04,000
Modern weaponry

2103
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:10,400
No when I was researching for my book

2104
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,680
I found out that

2105
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:14,240
Most of the missileer course not most but like

2106
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:16,032
A massive chunk of them

2107
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:17,568
Are always high

2108
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:21,920
At the people who have all the computers are from the 1980s like

2109
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:22,688
It is

2110
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:24,736
Verifying if you look Morgan

2111
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:27,040
Crazy it's crazy

2112
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:28,832
People still using Punch Cards

2113
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:32,416
To control nuclear weapons in 2022 with bananas

2114
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:36,000
And they're doing ecstasy

2115
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:37,280
It's pretty cool

2116
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:38,560
Hell yeah

2117
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:50,848
You got it so Alex takes another call and this guy is a little bit of a longer clip it wanted to play

2118
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:51,616
Sort of.

2119
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:54,688
This guy disagrees with Alex

2120
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:55,968
About some of the premise

2121
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:57,504
That he's coming

2122
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:58,272
Forthwith

2123
01:29:58,784 --> 01:29:59,552
And this

2124
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:01,344
Foster's Alex to a point

2125
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:03,392
That he ends up making

2126
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:05,952
Of totally bizarre claim at the end of the

2127
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:07,488
Go ahead bill

2128
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,280
But I don't see you first

2129
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:11,840
That's my opinion

2130
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:12,608
Healthcare

2131
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,888
Second wave

2132
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:15,424
How

2133
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,448
And act like this

2134
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:17,984
With the illegal in

2135
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:18,752
Immigration in the

2136
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:24,640
I think it's going to make people read

2137
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,456
NYU legal immigration

2138
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,320
Checkpoints today

2139
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:33,088
Heartland

2140
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:38,208
But then I dropped the borders wide open and porous and then advertising how open we are

2141
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:40,000
The terrorist attack

2142
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:41,536
So is a grand Prime

2143
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:42,560
No question

2144
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:44,096
I think the People Get Ready

2145
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:45,632
Refocus

2146
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:47,168
If you have a really tough

2147
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:48,960
Modifying

2148
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:50,496
I really don't

2149
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:51,264
Martial law

2150
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,080
It's already

2151
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:56,896
Dental emergency in NM

2152
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:58,432
States

2153
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:01,248
The normal response to a major issue I mean

2154
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:02,784
So you are you in the military

2155
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:06,112
Okay

2156
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:10,208
We support the military

2157
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:11,744
We don't know who's done this

2158
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,792
But are you telling me of some of Bin Laden

2159
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:14,560
Could coordinate

2160
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:15,840
All of these

2161
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:18,912
Leesport

2162
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:21,472
But telling you that there are lots of

2163
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:25,824
How many country

2164
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:28,640
Mercenaries going to fly a plane into a building

2165
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:30,176
No you didn't let me see

2166
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:32,736
I believe that there are enough

2167
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:34,272
Tentacles by organization

2168
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:36,576
World can have enough points

2169
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:39,904
I will say this

2170
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:41,440
A good chance Europe to be behind

2171
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:42,720
Esther Rolle

2172
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:43,488
Euro

2173
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,280
Right now

2174
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:47,072
And a half months

2175
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:51,936
Yeah but your railroad has decided that it's

2176
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:54,496
Like he's so thrown by this guy but

2177
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:59,616
Impune imbibing a even in the military

2178
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:01,152
Do like make him.

2179
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:02,688
Appear to know anything

2180
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:04,736
I guess

2181
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:06,016
You know what

2182
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:11,648
The road at the attack

2183
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:13,696
Symbol of the economy

2184
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:15,744
What do you get hearts at all makes

2185
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,304
Send it is a little bit like

2186
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:20,864
If a blindfolded kid

2187
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:24,448
Kept trying to hit a pinata and eventually the pinata

2188
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:25,984
Couldn't break it

2189
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:27,520
I told them they just hugged

2190
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:30,080
So like that's what happened there he was like well I guess

2191
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:33,152
I guess I just believe Europe killed everybody then

2192
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:36,736
Let's find a you don't agree with the crazy stuff I'm saying so I'm going to say something

2193
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:40,064
Crazier how about that how you like that how do you do it

2194
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:43,136
We're doing a nuke Europe now

2195
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:44,416
I love

2196
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:46,208
I love the response at

2197
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:52,608
I don't think martial law going to be I love that for any any question like that

2198
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:55,168
And I really don't think that they're going to ban

2199
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:57,728
Cigarettes

2200
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:03,872
Yeah and there's also two things that have already come up that are interesting

2201
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:06,944
Counter-arguments to the ideas that Alex is expressing

2202
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:12,064
The first is when Jim was on and he was talking about how there was a long delay but

2203
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,088
Between the

2204
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,368
Crash

2205
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:17,696
The buildings falling right

2206
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:19,232
Giving time for Chevrolet

2207
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:20,256
Evacuate

2208
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:26,912
Bring up the point that like it's almost as if there would have been time for emergency

2209
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:33,312
First Responders to be there and they were the main target of the attack to believe

2210
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:34,336
The diet is

2211
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:35,872
A nefarious

2212
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:37,664
Plan of

2213
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,456
A terrorist organization

2214
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:42,016
Takeout firefighters I am

2215
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:45,344
Please write infrastructure people as opposed to

2216
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:47,136
Adjust civilian death

2217
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:49,184
That is an exam

2218
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:53,536
By Alex how that would be a motive not of the globalist shut up

2219
01:33:54,560 --> 01:34:00,192
2nd Viscount caller is bringing up the idea that immigration would become a much larger issue

2220
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:02,496
In the wake of a foreign terrorist attack

2221
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:05,056
And it sure did and that would not be in

2222
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:05,824
The interest

2223
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,104
Of the globalist

2224
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,896
Does Alex has presented them

2225
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:11,200
Because they want all the immigrants

2226
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:12,736
Become a

2227
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:14,528
Exactly into this

2228
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,576
Stick from a motive stamp

2229
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:18,112
And this

2230
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:19,136
Also isn't

2231
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:20,672
Fully examined right

2232
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:26,816
Lingering hanging questions breister ignore

2233
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:28,608
And let me throw this one out there at

2234
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:34,240
Osama has already attacked the World Trade Center

2235
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:35,776
And not just that

2236
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:40,128
He is incredibly Rich true has connections all over

2237
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:40,896
Over the world

2238
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:44,736
He is infiltrated most terrorist organization

2239
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:52,416
My guy was saying that there are groups of mercenary tendrils and Jeff

2240
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:54,464
I think it would happen in Alex's mind is like

2241
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:56,000
What are organizations that I

2242
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:57,536
Vu

2243
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:59,072
She probably higher

2244
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:02,656
Kind of like what he's saying

2245
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:06,752
End up going down this road

2246
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:08,800
Travesty

2247
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:10,336
There is a fissure is internal

2248
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:11,104
Struggle

2249
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,640
Between the new world order right now

2250
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:14,432
Germany runs the EU

2251
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:18,528
They swarmed and dilation of the u.s.

2252
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:20,832
Oldest country

2253
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:22,368
What's panda

2254
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:25,952
Muslim terrorist Bank

2255
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,280
It's in between our government

2256
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:31,840
Frank Lampard

2257
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:33,632
PowerBlock

2258
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:34,656
It runs a lot of our news

2259
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:36,960
Wow that was so fast

2260
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:39,008
98% sure

2261
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:42,336
I'm leaving towards to you

2262
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:48,992
Dude I had a weird phone call and now I take it you didn't

2263
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:52,064
98% sure your update

2264
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:52,832
Yeah

2265
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:53,600
At amazing

2266
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:54,624
Who's Europe

2267
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:57,696
Did Germany install president Germany

2268
01:35:58,208 --> 01:36:00,768
Germany for the deaths of the United

2269
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:01,536
Everybody

2270
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:06,400
Sure

2271
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:08,704
But I have no idea

2272
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:09,984
Don't know

2273
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:11,776
This is whiplash

2274
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:18,176
I could not have been less prepared for this is why you go back to the past

2275
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:21,504
Never really expect I got T-boned by Europe

2276
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:23,808
That's what's going on Jesus

2277
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:27,392
So one of the things I think is really fun about this broadcast

2278
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:28,928
Is that Alex is like

2279
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:29,952
Juggling gas

2280
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:32,512
Traffic jam was on earlier

2281
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:35,328
Recovery was on earlier he comes back

2282
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:37,632
Jim's back now

2283
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:40,704
Alex's upgrading this banter

2284
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:41,728
About the EU

2285
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:44,800
Listen carefully to the way he expresses

2286
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:47,104
Did you ever think you'd see this

2287
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,128
In the United States

2288
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,712
Not really didn't

2289
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,064
The one place we haven't

2290
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,344
A10e over

2291
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:08,864
Insulated

2292
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:11,936
The EU

2293
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:14,496
Now they're rolling out in the currency

2294
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:16,800
It's already clean

2295
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:19,872
The Distributing

2296
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:21,152
Middle East

2297
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:24,992
Financial Center is brought down

2298
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:26,784
We've been into Wars of Europe

2299
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:33,696
Getting analysis

2300
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:34,976
By which I mean

2301
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:36,256
10 minutes ago

2302
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:41,888
Tossed out the idea Vu randomly minutes ago I talk some s***

2303
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:44,704
Analysis paralysis

2304
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:50,592
You heard me talk s*** and then they were like wait a second and I looked into it

2305
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:56,992
The Heritage Foundation is it called my cell phone

2306
01:37:57,248 --> 01:38:03,392
We're getting it at like there's more analysis on the ground being done right now outrageously said somebody for me

2307
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:05,952
Belgium to see if the stories true

2308
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:12,864
Russell's suspiciously silent

2309
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:14,912
Brussels has yet to respond

2310
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:21,312
Did you do 911 comment from Leo zagami as of yet

2311
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:23,872
So Terry is not in hiding females back

2312
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:25,664
Gotcha

2313
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:27,968
Farms at flight 175

2314
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:30,272
From Boston to La has crashed

2315
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:31,552
6 passengers at 9

2316
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:32,320
Crew members

2317
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:34,624
Emergency Personnel at the

2318
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:35,648
The theme say there are no

2319
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:36,416
No survivors

2320
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:37,952
Why are these airplanes crash

2321
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:40,512
Do you have any idea

2322
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:43,328
Now is this a plane other than the for that

2323
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:45,632
Went into the Trade Center in Dubai

2324
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:46,912
Independent Burger

2325
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:47,936
Into

2326
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:49,728
Into the Pentagon

2327
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:51,008
I don't have any idea

2328
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:55,616
Well we know they've got fighter jets scrambled everywhere

2329
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:58,176
So they could have shot

2330
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:02,272
And I will probably never know that's

2331
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:05,600
These guys have nothing to say

2332
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:07,392
And this is not good radio

2333
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:14,048
You have a guy who's running late to do the wheat report giving Alex updates on stuff that neither of them have any car

2334
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:15,072
Context for so

2335
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:20,960
I can do it instead of sorting the information out Alex just dismisses it all the way by saying

2336
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:21,728
Probably cancer

2337
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:23,776
Piercing will never get the truth about this

2338
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:25,568
It's legitimately pathetic

2339
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:31,712
United 175 was the plane that hit the South Tower or World Trade Center

2340
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:32,480
R2

2341
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:37,600
I believe the dairy is getting some Intel ra3 the

2342
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:39,904
Crashed but the number passengers

2343
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:41,696
That you besides actually matches

2344
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:42,720
Is 175

2345
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:44,512
So I don't know what's going on

2346
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:47,584
You might have the number wrong or there's something we got missed

2347
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:48,608
Translation

2348
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:51,168
Either way this is a pointless dissemination of

2349
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:53,984
Correct information that only serve

2350
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,288
There's two kind of boring annoy Alex

2351
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:01,920
Yeah this whole National tragedy pretty well all

2352
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:05,760
This was the first time I honestly related to anybody on the show

2353
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:06,784
Whenever he was like

2354
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:10,880
I don't know what's going on I was like that is the first legitimate

2355
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:14,976
Acceptable phone called wild to have

2356
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:18,048
The dairy has where it's like why are these planes crashing

2357
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:20,608
It sounds stupid to us now but

2358
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:24,192
No I wouldn't I wouldn't have known that they were hijacked

2359
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:28,544
Absolutely like obviously that's an assumption that you can make but like

2360
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:32,640
Yeah there is a reason for at this time of day for dairy to be like

2361
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:37,760
I don't know why they're crashing I don't know what's going on

2362
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:44,928
Human resilience I can think of right here too much because I think it is normal

2363
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,464
Serve to help

2364
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:50,304
Radio show that supposed to be disseminating information

2365
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:56,704
I am screaming in this scenario I'm screaming I don't know what's going on so I'm going to go to the news

2366
01:40:57,472 --> 01:40:59,264
For information about what's going on

2367
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:01,312
I do not want to go to the news

2368
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:07,712
And see me screaming I don't know what's going on and then Alex ways to 10

2369
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:10,016
At the conspiracy ever know

2370
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:12,064
So Alex got that caller

2371
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:13,600
Downs talk about numerology

2372
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:15,648
Really wish you didn't

2373
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:17,696
Going to get into a little oven

2374
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:20,000
Attack somebody level

2375
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:20,768
Entire country

2376
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:23,328
In Florida.

2377
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:24,096
Education

2378
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:25,376
Speeches

2379
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:26,400
The president's crap

2380
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:27,424
Schedule

2381
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:28,192
The first reports

2382
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:29,216
The facts on New York

2383
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:29,984
Came up on

2384
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:32,032
The board and said the

2385
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:32,800
9

2386
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:35,872
Stands for judgment and 11

2387
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:36,640
A disorder

2388
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:38,176
Really

2389
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:39,712
And it shows how the global

2390
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:41,504
Everything is 33 everything

2391
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:42,272
7-Eleven

2392
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:43,552
All of these

2393
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:45,600
That makes sense

2394
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:48,416
That doesn't make sense

2395
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:49,440
Look at the flight now

2396
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:50,720
33

2397
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:52,000
That's not accurate

2398
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:53,024
It's not one of the flight no

2399
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,048
What's 7-Eleven

2400
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:58,400
I-77 and 11 is the number of minutes that you wait

2401
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:02,496
What was the 7-Eleven wasn't a flight number

2402
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:03,776
It's 9:11

2403
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:04,544
Right

2404
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,080
The store

2405
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:06,848
Yeah

2406
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:08,640
What does that have to do with

2407
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:14,272
I couldn't get anything to eat 7-Eleven

2408
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:18,368
Brutal brutal Flamin Hot

2409
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:21,952
Nacho Doritos it didn't have the cooler Ranch

2410
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:23,232
I know brutal

2411
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:25,280
I wanted a donut

2412
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:27,840
So Alex has more bad prediction

2413
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:30,656
Then we can see nuclear war with

2414
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:31,680
Wood in the day

2415
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:34,240
We covered

2416
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:35,008
No.

2417
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:38,080
Israel very upset saying Iran now has

2418
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,640
Nooks and the missiles

2419
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:41,408
Deliver them

2420
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:44,736
It's just supposed to be

2421
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:46,016
Could be the beginning

2422
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:47,040
Armageddon

2423
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:50,880
I hate to say that but we certainly have the ingredients only Terry

2424
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:52,416
It looks like it does

2425
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:56,000
We say time and time again once you read the back of the book

2426
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:58,304
Beginning to see a difference

2427
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,352
Picture and you look at the overall pick

2428
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:04,448
Definitely say we are in the end time

2429
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:07,264
I believe it's right as well Alex

2430
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,872
That doesn't mean that means

2431
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:15,456
You see what I mean

2432
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:16,992
Glacier

2433
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:17,760
Not good

2434
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:18,784
Is there

2435
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:22,368
He's good I want

2436
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:24,416
We we are excited

2437
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:25,440
MP idea of

2438
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:28,768
Possibility of nuclear war kicking off tonight and this being Armageddon

2439
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:30,816
I just want my sensors

2440
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:32,608
Did his apocalyptic version of

2441
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:34,144
Cher

2442
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:37,216
Can we have one National

2443
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:38,240
Or world

2444
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:40,032
Or even local tragic

2445
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:41,312
That is not

2446
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:43,360
Evidence that were in the end times

2447
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:44,384
Just one

2448
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:46,944
I just don't want to know that we're in the end times

2449
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:48,224
Every single time

2450
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:52,576
How many enzymes are we going to be in bad on my end times

2451
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:53,856
Yeah there's a limit

2452
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:57,184
Yeah so I had this really interesting

2453
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:59,488
Thought of a way that I would like to talk

2454
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:00,256
Talk to Alex

2455
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:01,536
If I ever were to

2456
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:05,120
I know that he has a lot of

2457
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:05,888
Evidence

2458
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:07,168
That 911

2459
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:11,776
And he has a lot of videos that he's posted or inside

2460
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:16,128
There's a lot of videos that has posted that are like smoking

2461
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:17,664
Gun evidence

2462
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,456
Get the title of it right

2463
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:21,248
I thought I would I would bring up

2464
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:24,064
I like to talk to you about this article

2465
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:25,856
Smoking Gun evidence that 911

2466
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:26,624
Inside Job

2467
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:28,160
What is this about

2468
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:31,744
Smoking Gun what is it about

2469
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:34,048
Guarantee

2470
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:36,096
Like he would guess wrong

2471
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:38,144
100 articles

2472
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:43,776
Or even like a Smoking Gun covid is a killer

2473
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:46,848
Which Wich Smoking Gun

2474
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:50,176
You never get it right I would just put them in a room

2475
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:51,456
Where that

2476
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:52,224
Ever had

2477
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:54,016
Did the floor covered in guns

2478
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:55,040
And

2479
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:57,600
30% CO2 and then we could

2480
01:44:57,856 --> 01:45:00,160
Really get to the bottom of all of his issue

2481
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:01,184
Casino

2482
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,720
Is CO2 good for you

2483
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,000
Turn.

2484
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:08,096
How many floors can you have how many guns can you have on a floor that's another question

2485
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:10,656
So Alex and Dairy

2486
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:12,704
This gets back to where

2487
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:15,264
You were talking earlier about how the

2488
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:19,616
Seems like they looked at this as like a righteous

2489
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:21,408
This is where like

2490
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:22,944
It really gets into that

2491
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,736
Really messed up

2492
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:31,136
To them to this next to this next

2493
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:33,696
So

2494
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:40,608
Again you have to have studied this

2495
01:45:41,632 --> 01:45:42,912
Absolutely

2496
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:44,192
People don't

2497
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:45,984
Damn this I caught world

2498
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,520
It's been an Esquire

2499
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:49,568
The Press Democrat

2500
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:50,336
Mainstream

2501
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:51,872
San Francisco paper

2502
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:54,176
Spell National Television

2503
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:54,944
Is in Europe

2504
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:58,272
I snuck into caught world leaders in black and red robes

2505
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:02,880
So why are you offended by us talking about how we're Christians and how are

2506
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:03,904
Bible tells us

2507
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:05,696
What happened in detail

2508
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:07,744
And we're cookies

2509
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:09,024
Dance around

2510
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:09,792
Molech

2511
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:11,584
How many world leaders are Warm Springs

2512
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:12,608
The devil we're going to be

2513
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:17,216
Our judge that is the bottom line with your agreement around

2514
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:23,104
Absolutely that's what I said earlier today I think I'm headed to three times on National National radio

2515
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:24,640
That it's difficult

2516
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:27,200
For me to pray for America today

2517
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:28,736
I can pray for God

2518
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:30,528
And I can pray that

2519
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:32,832
The people going to be saved as they popped

2520
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:33,600
Wake me up

2521
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:34,368
When our own

2522
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:35,136
Children

2523
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:36,416
Cannot go to a public

2524
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:37,184
American

2525
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,232
Stand up

2526
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,536
And sing God Bless America

2527
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:46,144
America I think the fetal tissues part of it I

2528
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:47,424
Pretty

2529
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:49,984
China giving them the Olympics when they kill their political test

2530
01:46:52,032 --> 01:46:52,800
Pissed off.

2531
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:54,848
So bad

2532
01:46:57,152 --> 01:47:00,480
GoPro to the home now. All of murdering we're doing to our own children

2533
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:01,248
Yes

2534
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:03,040
The drugging of them aboard

2535
01:47:04,064 --> 01:47:05,344
We're being judged

2536
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,112
Jennylyn

2537
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:09,184
Beginning Ali

2538
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:11,488
Societies are always judge

2539
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:14,304
They have 10

2540
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:16,608
And they will continue to be

2541
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:18,912
Since you guys are exactly right I'll leave you alone

2542
01:47:20,448 --> 01:47:20,960
Thank you Darren

2543
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:21,984
Blessed is the nation

2544
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:25,312
Chicken that has been that believes in God you know

2545
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:27,360
And cursing is the ones that don't

2546
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:30,176
Yeah so 9/11 was

2547
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:31,200
Political Punisher

2548
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:32,480
From God

2549
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:36,576
No different than like Pat Robertson's kind of s*** people

2550
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:37,600
Rightfully

2551
01:47:39,392 --> 01:47:41,184
Throw this out at

2552
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:42,720
Okay

2553
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:44,512
Did you ever notice how God is it

2554
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:46,560
Exactly as dumb as the people talking

2555
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:47,328
Sing About God

2556
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,376
You know like it is so crazy

2557
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:51,680
Crazy to me that we can hear Alex Day

2558
01:47:51,936 --> 01:47:53,216
I want

2559
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:56,800
And then we can hear him talk about his God just

2560
01:47:57,312 --> 01:48:01,664
Milking people whenever he feels like they need to be so crazy

2561
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:04,992
Interesting other sort of branch that goes off

2562
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:06,272
These thoughts sure

2563
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:08,832
God is

2564
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:10,368
Right and God is

2565
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,904
You know infallible

2566
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:12,928
Answered

2567
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:13,696
Judgment

2568
01:48:13,952 --> 01:48:14,976
For the political decision

2569
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:16,000
You disagree with

2570
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:17,536
If he's doing a 911

2571
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:18,304
Right

2572
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:19,840
The kind of implies that

2573
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:21,376
You want to do that

2574
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:24,704
4 things

2575
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:25,472
Things like

2576
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:26,496
Abortion

2577
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:30,592
Yeah it is almost like the people in those playing the fights

2578
01:48:30,848 --> 01:48:32,896
Spiritual flying into those buildings

2579
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:34,944
Justify their behavior

2580
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:36,736
Almost exactly the same way

2581
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:38,528
You just justify their baby

2582
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:44,416
How crazy is that are weird wrinkles but it would be you

2583
01:48:45,184 --> 01:48:46,464
It's right so maybe.

2584
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:49,536
That's right I forgot this show is

2585
01:48:54,144 --> 01:49:00,032
Absolutely I don't know what happened we were Ninety Acres that shows the government now the EU

2586
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:01,824
I'm happy

2587
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:04,896
Convinced it's going to be Swatch by then

2588
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:06,688
Got to be the squad

2589
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:09,760
There's only one hero for us and that's the

2590
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:11,552
So there is a

2591
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:12,576
This is dumb

2592
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:15,392
Warriors

2593
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:18,976
Ever been an attack

2594
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:20,000
On American

2595
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:28,192
What

2596
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:30,752
And never was attack

2597
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:32,800
Not true

2598
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:34,848
Yeah we had some

2599
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:37,152
Agents

2600
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:39,456
The New York comedian ever covered that they said

2601
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:41,504
I don't know

2602
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,832
Pearl Harbor dum-dum I was going to say you realize that that

2603
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:45,600
Big

2604
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:46,368
Attack

2605
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:47,648
The biggest attack

2606
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:50,208
But literally anybody could remember before this point

2607
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:51,232
Yeah

2608
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:54,304
Those big huge ears on American soil

2609
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:55,840
But I guess there's some

2610
01:49:56,096 --> 01:49:57,632
Kind of maybe Alex

2611
01:49:58,144 --> 01:49:59,680
Doesn't look at non mainland

2612
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:01,728
America

2613
01:50:01,984 --> 01:50:02,496
Define

2614
01:50:02,752 --> 01:50:05,056
If we're just going to make arbitrary rules about f******

2615
01:50:05,312 --> 01:50:06,336
Everything

2616
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:09,664
Part of the United States

2617
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:16,064
I understand

2618
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:20,160
Also the f****** earlier bombing of the world

2619
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:21,440
Hey remember that one

2620
01:50:21,952 --> 01:50:24,512
Anyway Harry should learn more

2621
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:28,096
I do appreciate any times

2622
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:32,192
That's only what I can remember and then you can just be like we learn

2623
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:34,240
Go go find more

2624
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:37,312
Sodus Point Alex reset

2625
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:40,640
Recaps the news in case you're joining late

2626
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:43,200
I just don't know what to say to any other

2627
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:45,248
Sing about

2628
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:46,528
Fort Wayne

2629
01:50:48,832 --> 01:50:49,600
10000 people anime

2630
01:50:49,856 --> 01:50:50,368
Collapse

2631
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:51,904
I hit my lard

2632
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:53,184
Passenger plane

2633
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:56,000
Plane hit the Pentagon

2634
01:50:56,512 --> 01:50:57,024
Large portion

2635
01:50:58,048 --> 01:50:58,560
On fire

2636
01:50:58,816 --> 01:50:59,840
And then outside Pittsburgh

2637
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:00,608
PA

2638
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:01,376
One slamming

2639
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:03,680
Shot down by

2640
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:04,960
My Fighters

2641
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:08,288
Swarming everywhere for carriers

2642
01:51:08,544 --> 01:51:09,824
Have delivered their payload of plane

2643
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,104
Out into the air

2644
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:12,384
And we got

2645
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:14,688
Jets scrambled everywhere they're flying around here

2646
01:51:14,944 --> 01:51:15,712
Texas right now

2647
01:51:15,968 --> 01:51:16,480
About us

2648
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:18,016
And there

2649
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:19,040
Declaring civil emergency

2650
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:22,112
Major Capital Cities

2651
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:24,160
Why would they be flying over off

2652
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:28,768
The jet

2653
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:30,304
Find mine

2654
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:33,632
So this is interesting because later on part of Alex's

2655
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:37,216
Conspiracies will revolve around why didn't they scramble jet

2656
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:39,264
Right reporting

2657
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:42,336
Four things have deployed their payload in

2658
01:51:42,592 --> 01:51:43,104
Inskeep

2659
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:44,896
Personally saw fighter jets

2660
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:46,688
Scrambled over Austin

2661
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:47,712
So

2662
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:52,832
I guess you just forgot about that he knows that he can just

2663
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:55,136
Reckon it whenever he feels like

2664
01:51:55,392 --> 01:51:57,952
Really comforting thought

2665
01:51:58,208 --> 01:51:59,232
How to be able to relax

2666
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:00,512
Listen I'll just

2667
01:52:00,768 --> 01:52:06,912
Say that this is different like you don't even have to fix it in post you know it's like you you do the show

2668
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:09,472
Says something and then yours is like I tell you it didn't

2669
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:10,752
And that's it and that's why

2670
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:12,544
Basically like

2671
01:52:13,056 --> 01:52:14,336
If you are doing a sitcom

2672
01:52:14,592 --> 01:52:19,456
And like it's episodic every episode is a new set of circumstances

2673
01:52:19,968 --> 01:52:24,576
Consequences brightness are the carryover

2674
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:25,856
You can't carry something

2675
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:28,928
You get to choose

2676
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:34,816
What is reset and what is it

2677
01:52:35,328 --> 01:52:41,472
F****** jarring breaks my brain its narratively untenable

2678
01:52:41,728 --> 01:52:42,240
Just not Payette

2679
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:45,056
You have to passively

2680
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:47,872
Or else

2681
01:52:48,128 --> 01:52:48,896
You're f*****

2682
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:51,200
So this is really a

2683
01:52:51,456 --> 01:52:52,224
Bad call

2684
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:54,528
Pierre Alex takes a call and it really

2685
01:52:55,296 --> 01:52:56,064
Kind of pissed me off

2686
01:53:00,928 --> 01:53:03,232
Immigration policy is flawed

2687
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:13,472
You're able to get in this country

2688
01:53:16,032 --> 01:53:17,824
And pray you and your family biometrically

2689
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:20,384
It's a scam to get food is already putting a man

2690
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:23,200
If your

2691
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:27,552
Big reveal that Alex mostly just talks out of his ass

2692
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:33,696
Hear the caller suggest that borders should have been closed a long ago so they could keep immigrants out and Alex agrees

2693
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:37,024
But earlier Alex was erroneously reporting that the borders at

2694
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:38,816
Concealed in response to the attacks

2695
01:53:39,072 --> 01:53:39,584
And that was

2696
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:40,608
Was martial law

2697
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:44,448
Sealing the borders up is good when it's a part of Alex's xenophobic

2698
01:53:45,728 --> 01:53:46,240
It's bad

2699
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:48,544
When is the theoretical part of a country respond

2700
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:49,568
Terrorist

2701
01:53:50,592 --> 01:53:54,688
You can pretty easily see the flaws in Alex's thinking and how this lacks any real can

2702
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:57,248
This clip is actually worse

2703
01:53:58,272 --> 01:54:04,416
When he's ripping around with this collar about how bad immigration is Alex's that the government isn't going to close the borders because they

2704
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:06,208
Just want to track and trace your family

2705
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:08,768
But we've already established as a

2706
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:11,072
Confirm piece of Alex's reporting that the Border

2707
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:11,840
Have been

2708
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:12,608
Concealed

2709
01:54:12,864 --> 01:54:16,192
Which is part of its Being Framed as part of the martial law takeover

2710
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:20,800
That detail with Alex's coverage is now inconvenient for his more

2711
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:23,104
Complain about how bad immigration is

2712
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:23,872
So you just did

2713
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:27,200
This is how information works and Alex's world

2714
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:30,784
Something could be presented as a fact in order to scare the audio

2715
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:32,576
It's about how the police state is here

2716
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:34,368
And then without any explanation

2717
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:35,136
Opposite

2718
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:37,696
Can be presented to scare the audience about immigration

2719
01:54:39,232 --> 01:54:40,256
To recognize here is

2720
01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:41,536
The claim anthem

2721
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:42,304
Negation of the

2722
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:43,840
The claim which is to say reporting

2723
01:54:44,096 --> 01:54:44,864
The borders are sealed

2724
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:47,168
And also saying they never would close the border

2725
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:47,936
Wide open

2726
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:49,984
Serve the same perp

2727
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:53,824
Which is why it doesn't matter to the audience that are contradictory

2728
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:56,128
And on the surface would make out with the show in Cohan

2729
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:58,432
Both of these Center on the list

2730
01:54:58,944 --> 01:55:00,224
The white conservit

2731
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:02,528
Christian American listener in general

2732
01:55:02,784 --> 01:55:04,320
Pettit centers them as the Vic

2733
01:55:05,088 --> 01:55:06,624
If the borders being sealed

2734
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,672
Because bats martial law in there

2735
01:55:08,928 --> 01:55:11,488
Argon to put you in a FEMA camp cuz you're conservative white Krista

2736
01:55:11,744 --> 01:55:12,256
In America

2737
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:14,304
If it's the border is never going

2738
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:16,096
To be sealed it's because they want to solve

2739
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:16,864
The problem

2740
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:20,192
A foreign terrorism by tracking and tracing your family instead of stopping

2741
01:55:20,448 --> 01:55:21,216
Immigrants from coming in

2742
01:55:21,472 --> 01:55:21,984
Into this country

2743
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:27,360
Both of these ideas that Alex is pitching satisfy the emotional need to be under attack

2744
01:55:27,616 --> 01:55:28,384
Vaquitas audience

2745
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:29,152
Are addicted

2746
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:32,992
It doesn't matter if he's things make no sense because they're not meant to

2747
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:35,552
The emotionally resonate with the thing

2748
01:55:36,064 --> 01:55:37,088
Did people come to Alex

2749
01:55:39,136 --> 01:55:39,648
Is

2750
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:41,184
Really really

2751
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:42,720
I don't know if it's

2752
01:55:42,976 --> 01:55:46,304
Because the intensity of the event that he's covering but

2753
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:48,864
Will become so clear in stock

2754
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:49,888
Contrast

2755
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:50,656
That Alex

2756
01:55:50,912 --> 01:55:52,960
Simultaneously be reporting

2757
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:55,264
That the government is seal the borders

2758
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:58,592
And it's martial law and we should seal the borders

2759
01:55:58,848 --> 01:56:00,128
Because otherwise

2760
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:01,664
The Conspiracy to

2761
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:02,944
Attack

2762
01:56:03,456 --> 01:56:05,248
Mainstream America with

2763
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:07,808
That's nonsense

2764
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:09,344
If I were in America

2765
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:12,672
And I would have closed the borders right around the time of the First Crusade

2766
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:15,232
And then saved yourself a lot of f******

2767
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:16,000
In trouble

2768
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:20,096
I find this

2769
01:56:20,352 --> 01:56:20,864
To be honest f

2770
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:23,424
It is really illustrative

2771
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:24,448
And I think the

2772
01:56:24,704 --> 01:56:25,984
You can you can learn a bit

2773
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:26,752
About

2774
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:33,408
How to process a lot of the ways that other narratives that seem weird on his show why they're there

2775
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:34,176
How

2776
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:35,968
How a lot of this is navigate

2777
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:38,784
It Centers The Listener as the

2778
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,344
The aggrieved one the one who is put upon

2779
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:43,392
By whatever the larger

2780
01:56:43,648 --> 01:56:44,416
Conspiracy is

2781
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:47,232
Some of it is some of the funk

2782
01:56:47,744 --> 01:56:48,512
Conspiracies is to make

2783
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:49,536
Things

2784
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:51,328
That are complicated makes sense

2785
01:56:51,584 --> 01:56:52,352
Forgive some sense

2786
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:53,376
Comfort Inn

2787
01:56:53,888 --> 01:56:55,680
Chaotic world but some of it is also

2788
01:56:56,192 --> 01:56:56,960
TubeMate

2789
01:56:57,216 --> 01:56:57,728
Do you feel like

2790
01:56:58,496 --> 01:57:00,032
To just educate you into a friend

2791
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:02,592
To always be in a fighter

2792
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:04,384
Your flight mode with your adrenaline

2793
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:06,432
Glands f****** pumping into your brain

2794
01:57:06,944 --> 01:57:08,224
Give

2795
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:15,904
Excuse for why maybe you're not as happy as you wanted for sure because there's a

2796
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:16,672
Firozi

2797
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:18,208
That centers on

2798
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:20,768
The identity that you are

2799
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:25,376
Massive excuse for why you believe that they're coming

2800
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:27,168
Going to kill you and all you're doing is

2801
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:28,192
Sending him money

2802
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:35,104
And it's a rationalizes fairly extreme politics because the alternative is submitting to the people who already

2803
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:37,408
Play going to kill you

2804
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:39,712
He's got to vote for the lesser of two evils

2805
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:42,528
Anyway

2806
01:57:42,784 --> 01:57:43,808
Text clip

2807
01:57:45,088 --> 01:57:45,856
This is this

2808
01:57:46,112 --> 01:57:46,624
Is the

2809
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:47,648
Core of what

2810
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:48,672
This becomes

2811
01:57:49,184 --> 01:57:49,952
And it's just

2812
01:57:56,608 --> 01:57:59,168
All Housewives

2813
01:58:02,496 --> 01:58:03,520
That's on my website mean

2814
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:04,288
Mainstream news stories

2815
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:12,736
Chinese military in the Panama Canal

2816
01:58:12,992 --> 01:58:14,272
The threat is a housewife

2817
01:58:14,784 --> 01:58:15,808
That has an old revolver

2818
01:58:16,064 --> 01:58:16,576
Closet

2819

You know that guy

2826

Irresponsible

Just needs another bro to come in

2832
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:47,552
So Ted comes back naturally

2833
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:49,600
And this is Bisquick was

2834
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:50,624
Depressing

2835
01:58:51,648 --> 01:58:52,160
Because

2836
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:53,184
It start

2837
01:58:53,952 --> 01:58:54,464
With

2838
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:56,512
Giving voice to

2839
01:58:56,768 --> 01:58:57,536
Very

2840
01:58:57,792 --> 01:58:58,304
Futile

2841
01:58:59,072 --> 01:59:00,096
In this entire show

2842
01:59:01,632 --> 01:59:02,656
Concern

2843
01:59:02,912 --> 01:59:04,192
And Humanity

2844
01:59:04,448 --> 01:59:05,472
Israeli Express

2845
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:07,008
Domenico's

2846
01:59:08,288 --> 01:59:11,104
Are you going away like I am in my heart goes out to

2847
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:11,872
The People First

2848
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:12,896
Thing every night I just

2849
01:59:14,176 --> 01:59:16,480
Well there's your second appearance so

2850
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:17,248
Family member

2851
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:18,784
Caught up in this thing

2852
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:19,552
You're just

2853
01:59:19,808 --> 01:59:20,320
It's mine bought

2854
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:21,856
Tragedy

2855
01:59:22,368 --> 01:59:22,880
Kurds

2856
01:59:23,136 --> 01:59:24,160
But you do that

2857
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:27,232
The financial institution you know that those two

2858
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:28,256
Two buildings are worth it

2859
01:59:28,512 --> 01:59:29,024
From Men

2860
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:29,792
Amount of money

2861
01:59:30,304 --> 01:59:31,328
Dahlia invest

2862
01:59:31,584 --> 01:59:33,632
Doctors that will put you to put the money behind that for

2863
01:59:33,888 --> 01:59:34,400
Particular thing

2864
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:37,984
In the financial industry

2865
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:39,776
Freezers no question about it I mean

2866
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:40,544
Basically

2867
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:42,336
You don't billions of dollars at

2868
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:43,616
Just been lost within a matter of

2869
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:45,408
Right as the

2870
01:59:45,664 --> 01:59:46,688
EU Europe

2871
01:59:48,992 --> 01:59:49,504
And then delivered

2872
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:51,552
What you know but that's one of the reasons why a lot of

2873
01:59:51,808 --> 01:59:52,320
People get in the Gulf

2874
01:59:52,576 --> 01:59:54,880
All because there could be gold sitting in the basement of that building and I have

2875
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:56,928
The gold still valuable

2876
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:57,952
Oh God

2877
01:59:58,720 --> 01:59:59,232
Yeah

2878
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:01,792
But I mean on one hand

2879
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:03,328
It is

2880
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:05,376
More empathetic

2881
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:06,144
Lake van

2882
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:07,936
Or at least begins more empathetic

2883
02:00:08,192 --> 02:00:08,960
Make then pretty much

2884
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:10,496
All of this show so far

2885
02:00:11,008 --> 02:00:14,592
But it got it it goes pretty quickly to financial conversation

2886
02:00:15,104 --> 02:00:18,944
Some of that I think is why you just wouldn't want to have him on

2887
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:20,224
On that

2888
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:21,760
I think that's the world keys

2889
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:22,528
He's in

2890
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:26,880
Processes the event

2891
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:29,696
Is it is my livelihood in my entire life

2892
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:30,720
Is based around

2893
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:32,256
Commodities Trading

2894
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:33,792
In precious metals and currants

2895
02:00:34,048 --> 02:00:34,816
I mean the

2896
02:00:35,072 --> 02:00:35,840
They're god-king

2897
02:00:36,352 --> 02:00:39,936
On the day said now I have the tallest building so yeah I was

2898
02:00:40,448 --> 02:00:46,336
Kind of wondering if that would come up on the episode that would be that would be really a knot on his day show

2899
02:00:46,592 --> 02:00:49,920
I think that's why you just I mean I understand Ted's your boss

2900
02:00:50,176 --> 02:00:51,200
The runs all the companies in

2901
02:00:51,456 --> 02:00:52,224
And stuff but like it

2902
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:52,992
It's not

2903
02:00:53,248 --> 02:00:54,784
It's not necessarily

2904
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:57,344
It looks tacky

2905
02:00:58,112 --> 02:00:58,880
Okay

2906
02:00:59,136 --> 02:01:03,232
Unless your show is entirely Financial base

2907
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,048
Or if you have a segment like

2908
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:08,864
10 minutes of every hour is the Ted corner

2909
02:01:09,376 --> 02:01:14,752
The Ted Talk we could have branded that before have gotten their way earlier

2910
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:17,056
That makes some sense

2911
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:19,616
Sure we got the financial minute with Ted

2912
02:01:19,872 --> 02:01:20,384
But this is

2913
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:21,664
This is this just look

2914
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:23,456
What's gauche

2915
02:01:23,712 --> 02:01:24,224
Bumi

2916
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:25,248
Away

2917
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:26,016
Was

2918
02:01:26,272 --> 02:01:27,296
Won't someone think of the land

2919
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:29,088
Please

2920
02:01:29,344 --> 02:01:30,624
Someone please think

2921
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:31,904
Of the land law

2922
02:01:32,672 --> 02:01:33,952
Who are the most

2923
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:35,232
Agree

2924
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:36,256
Amber Reeves

2925
02:01:36,512 --> 02:01:39,840
That was f***** up

2926
02:01:40,096 --> 02:01:40,608
Here's what God

2927
02:01:40,864 --> 02:01:41,888
Here's what

2928
02:01:43,168 --> 02:01:44,448
And that's why you buy gold

2929
02:01:44,704 --> 02:01:46,496
Even if even if

2930
02:01:46,752 --> 02:01:49,312
Put gold at the bottom of the World Trade Center

2931
02:01:49,568 --> 02:01:54,176
You can dig that up that's still valuable if you are selling me gold

2932
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:56,736
Under the Twin Towers

2933
02:01:56,992 --> 02:01:58,528
Yeah

2934
02:01:59,040 --> 02:01:59,552
It's not good

2935
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:03,648
You could have used an example like a pirate ship

2936
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:10,304
Using the image of the tragedy in order to

2937
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:13,632
Promote the value of the thing you sell

2938
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:14,912
And that sucks

2939
02:02:15,168 --> 02:02:15,680
Anyways

2940
02:02:15,936 --> 02:02:16,704
Yankees Red Sox

2941
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:19,008
That sucks too

2942
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:22,336
The other thing that I was thinking about Tuesday like

2943
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:23,360
Okay like

2944
02:02:23,616 --> 02:02:25,408
Obviously this looks bad and is gross

2945
02:02:25,664 --> 02:02:26,432
Yeah

2946
02:02:26,688 --> 02:02:27,712
The same time you do have to

2947
02:02:27,968 --> 02:02:28,480
Except

2948
02:02:28,736 --> 02:02:30,272
The people who own the building

2949
02:02:30,528 --> 02:02:31,040
The busy

2950
02:02:31,808 --> 02:02:33,344
That were affected by it

2951
02:02:33,856 --> 02:02:34,880
It's naughty naughty

2952
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:36,672
Bowels not the time

2953
02:02:36,928 --> 02:02:37,440
No

2954
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:39,232
It's not the time

2955
02:02:39,488 --> 02:02:41,536
You you handle accounting issues

2956
02:02:42,048 --> 02:02:43,584
Days later now that said

2957
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:45,120
The gold

2958
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:51,520
Underneath the Trade Center is

2959
02:02:53,568 --> 02:02:54,080
Shock

2960
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:56,128
That a human being could do that

2961
02:02:56,384 --> 02:02:56,896
Yeah

2962
02:02:57,152 --> 02:03:03,040
I would never ever in a bit I can promise you for his creative is my mind may or may not be

2963
02:03:03,296 --> 02:03:05,344
Never would have gotten to here's my sales pitch

2964
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:07,392
That's right

2965
02:03:07,904 --> 02:03:08,416
To write

2966
02:03:09,184 --> 02:03:14,560
Like what do you think I want to show on 9/11 was like you couldn't imagine that it was Moses at

2967
02:03:14,816 --> 02:03:17,120
No I would never in a million years of thought

2968
02:03:17,632 --> 02:03:18,912
That he would have said

2969
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:20,192
That

2970
02:03:20,704 --> 02:03:21,472
That's amazing

2971
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:25,312
So here he goes off air after a few more pointless calls

2972
02:03:26,336 --> 02:03:28,384
And here is our last clip

2973
02:03:28,896 --> 02:03:31,712
From Alex's show from the day of

2974
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:36,064
I mean do you think any Arab country would really do this I want to be turned into a parking lot

2975
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:38,112
I never give ever going to do that they would

2976
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:49,632
I believe in you was involved in this

2977
02:03:50,656 --> 02:03:52,448
There is a fissure there is a tick

2978
02:03:52,704 --> 02:03:54,496
Tectonic power struggle

2979
02:03:55,776 --> 02:03:57,568
Right I don't believe that

2980
02:03:58,848 --> 02:03:59,872
This was done by the

2981
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:01,408
By the Arabs

2982
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:02,944
So we have

2983
02:04:03,968 --> 02:04:06,272
At the end of Alex's

2984
02:04:06,528 --> 02:04:07,552
Broadcast day

2985
02:04:07,808 --> 02:04:09,600
For his daytime show

2986
02:04:11,392 --> 02:04:12,160
The conclusion that the

2987
02:04:12,416 --> 02:04:13,440
You was probably involved

2988
02:04:13,696 --> 02:04:14,976
911

2989
02:04:16,512 --> 02:04:17,536
So this is

2990
02:04:17,792 --> 02:04:20,352
I mean like honestly it's hard to some this up

2991
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:21,376
Because

2992
02:04:22,912 --> 02:04:24,448
So weird anyway

2993
02:04:24,704 --> 02:04:26,496
You kind of expected to be weird

2994
02:04:26,752 --> 02:04:30,080
Okay of there's unfolding information

2995
02:04:30,336 --> 02:04:32,128
But here's the thing it's blowing my mind

2996
02:04:32,896 --> 02:04:35,456
The unfolding information does not affect the broadcast

2997
02:04:35,712 --> 02:04:36,224
That much

2998
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:42,624
It's at all a couple of things that Dairy brings to his attention some of which are not accurate at all so

2999
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:43,648
Accurate

3000
02:04:43,904 --> 02:04:46,208
Outside of that there's not much like

3001
02:04:46,464 --> 02:04:48,000
In terms of update

3002
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:50,048
That are being Incorporated

3003
02:04:50,304 --> 02:04:50,816
It's kind of

3004
02:04:51,328 --> 02:04:52,096
S*** talking

3005
02:04:52,352 --> 02:04:55,424
Yeah yeah I think I can sum up the episode pretty well

3006
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:56,704
And it's

3007
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:57,472
33

3008
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:01,056
+ 175

3009
02:05:01,312 --> 02:05:02,848
Team Plus

3010
02:05:03,104 --> 02:05:05,152
Well actually - 93

3011
02:05:05,408 --> 02:05:06,688
Because they got that one wrong

3012
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:08,224
Well actually

3013
02:05:08,736 --> 02:05:09,248
-60

3014
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:11,296
Cuz they got 33 right

3015
02:05:12,064 --> 02:05:14,624
So that puts us at where do I have you been

3016
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:15,904
Keeping track of this

3017
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:20,512
No but I like where you're going with it all right

3018
02:05:22,816 --> 02:05:23,328
Okay

3019
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:24,608
So

3020
02:05:25,376 --> 02:05:26,656
98% chance

3021
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:28,448
Inside Job

3022
02:05:28,704 --> 02:05:30,752
It was the government for sure

3023
02:05:31,264 --> 02:05:32,800
Now it's the EU probably

3024
02:05:33,312 --> 02:05:36,640
So weird much like Alex will be taking a break

3025
02:05:37,152 --> 02:05:39,712
He goes off there and then comes back at 9 that Eve

3026
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:43,040
I will be back on Wednesday to go over

3027
02:05:43,808 --> 02:05:46,368
What strange Wilson still vu

3028
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:48,672
We deserved it

3029
02:05:48,928 --> 02:05:49,440
God knows

3030
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:52,256
