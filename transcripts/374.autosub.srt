00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge but I'm sick of them posing as if through the good guy

3
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
I need money

Don how would you handle your family

10
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,384
Have you ever had a huge

11
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,432
Argument at the Thanksgiving

12
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,200
Dinner table

13
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:26,272
Yeah probably I'm probably yeah I don't have

14
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,576
Nothing that sticks out as a

15
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,880
Individual 10 nothing notable

16
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:34,976
Mainly you agree right on Lotto Texas

17
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:39,584
I particularly might at least my parents and my brother and I are all pretty

18
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,632
Left-leaning

19
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,656
There's not too much

20
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:47,008
Concerned about that I guess my dad's parents like my daddy was a Mennonite preacher and

21
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,032
I got a real sense

22
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,312
Even though we never really talked

23
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,080
Fox politics

24
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,640
We got to get a sense that he's a bit to the right

25
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,712
I have no idea though really like a lot of that stuff never leak

26
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,480
Came up

27
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,296
I'm pretty open and

28
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,880
Progressive growing up but again I don't know I've never really had those Converse

29
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,416
That's fascinating

30
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,976
That's it I think I feel like that's a fairly unique

31
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:12,096
Experience right maybe there's a little bit of a disconnect between a lot of the extended family

32
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:18,240
Number of years growing up we lived in Hawaii

33
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,544
Almost the entire family lives

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,872
In California like seeing each other at all

35
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,968
Cross oceans we lived in Missouri

36
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,016
And they all still live in California

37
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,320
And no one's going to come to Missouri

38
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,648
California

39
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:40,256
Play dr. Under appreciated state

40
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:45,632
Rent-A-Car the extended family during the summer

41
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:51,520
And so there was a summer break and we would take a road trip

42
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,288
Across the country

43
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,104
Go visit family generally

44
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
These are these

45
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:58,944
Family

46
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,224
Thanksgiving

47
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,272
And Christmas is weren't necessarily

48
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:08,672
Super, there'll be more like phone calls on Christmas or Thanksgiving stuff

49
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,440
Specific

50
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,464
Terms of like

51
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
Family Guy

52
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,072
Visit in person

53
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,864
This conversation

54
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,632
Never

55
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,192
Coming up a lot of it like was more religious

56
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,496
Yeah my dad's side of the family

57
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,544
And I was my mom's side

58
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,408
I like that I like

59
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:34,528
I assume you have a lot of more experience

60
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,600
I am beset on all sides

61
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,880
You're surrounded

62
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,672
Yeah good luck with that

63
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:47,072
2 hours I will have a turkey sandwich on Thursday

64
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:57,056
I don't know too much about Thanksgiving fights over politics

65
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:01,152
But I do know a lot about Alex Jones hell of a lot about one and not much

66
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:07,808
Is beer in the present-day we're going to be taking a look at November 20th

67
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,856
2019

68
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,904
To use

69
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,744
Tuesday

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,791
Monday

71
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,559
My day is next

72
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,607
Anti-Venom

73
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,911
Episode there's a lot that I found very disturbing

74
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,471
On this show there's nothing

75
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
About

76
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,287
Thanksgiving or news

77
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,311
There's a slight mention

78
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,871
Thanksgiving

79
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,919
There's nothing really about news

80
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,967
Alex is singularly obsessed with

81
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,735
One thing

82
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:40,063
And it gets very very out of control

83
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,647
Okay thank you

84
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,695

Brilliant produce

90
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,895

00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,919
Yacht Rock

92
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,247

Technocrat

We got to go

103
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,159
Money off that heroin

104
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,695
Why you pimp so good

105
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,999

106
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:59,423
Thank you so much Travis and Sarah

107
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,359
Sure we would appreciate

108
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,151
I am done before we get down to

109
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:13,503
Do business business just a little programming no we are not going to have an episode on Friday

110
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,367
Take the end of this week off due to you having a holiday

111
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:25,791
It's tough when you know you got to go do you do these at the family Thanksgiving and that's on a Thursday weekend

112
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,583
Surly record on Thursday so

113
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:31,167
I'll be back on Monday so don't get too alarmed

114
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,191
There's not

115
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
Episode

116
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,567
On Friday if you're listening to this right now posit

117
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,359
Whenever your family starts talking on

118
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,663
Stop those earbuds in and you

119
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,943
Can hear us scream about not

120
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,783
Jerk so we start here on the 25th and Alex

121
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,575
It does have a tiny things

122
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,879
To say about Thanksgiving but this is the only

123
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:58,303
Well as we can predict there is a full-on assault on Thanksgiving and any other

124
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:11,359
He does not hold no I don't even want to imagine what his

125
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,407
Quote Real History of Thanksgiving

126
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:19,807
Yeah I'm sure be a little bit stilted I was I was like well here we go

127
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:23,391
Who is researching the pilgrim

128
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,951
None of that is relevant at all

129
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
It's a Alex

130
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,791
Is completely obsessed with something

131
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,071
Office episode

132
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:35,423
They didn't get to it immediately because there is a

133
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,703
She probably does believe that

134
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,799
There is a story out of the UK that Alex believes is evidence

135
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,335
That the demon called

136
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,407
Pedophile globalist

137
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
Starting to lose

138
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:46,943
Control

139
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,503
And because they're losing control they have to

140
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,039
Crackdown on language

141
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,367
All right answer this story out of the UK as evidence

142
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
That's why they're now

143
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
Salute

144
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,535
Complete warm

145
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,119
Rebels never-before-seen

146
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,399
On language

147
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:10,495
That's why National Television the censor board in the UK

148
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,847
Onward

149
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:17,919
Somebody

150
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,735
It was once used in connotation to black people

151
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,807
So that's the

152
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,855
The level of the control and I would

153
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,647
The ATL to call for anyone

154
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:31,999
Because it's about

155
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
Hysterical

156
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
Total

157
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,839
Complete

158
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
No control

159
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,399
Power graph

160
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,679
Alright

161
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,703
Okay so

162
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,983
Can I

163
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,519
Proposed

164
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,567
That we only talked about Thanksgiving

165
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,895
That he never speaks of this again

166
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,223
Right he doesn't speak of Thanksgiving again nobody speaks

167
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:58,623
The additional narrative

168
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,927
The Great Wave

169
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,023
Busov races

170
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,815
Pacifica

171
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,143
So this situation here that he's talking about is about a guy named

172
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
Eamonn Holmes

173
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:15,263
Who is appearing on the show at in the UK called this morning

174
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:19,359
Anti he described Meghan markle's attitude when she didn't want people take

175
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,919
Tons of pictures of her at Wimbledon as uppity

176
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,759
That naturally does have connotation

177
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:29,087
Since the term has been historically used to describe non-white people

178
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,927
Particularly black people in America who know their place in society

179
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,975
Ender to act like equals

180
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:41,375
The only way that that work and not necessarily there are other connotations of it but it is largely take

181
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,655
Make a nonfat connotation

182
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:49,311
It's very possible that Holmes himself was unaware of that historical use of the term particularly when it's being used

183
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,639
Describing on white person behaving in ways that you have a problem with

184
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,687
But the message is the same regardless

185
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,991
Whether or not he intended it to be

186
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,807
Airbnb reported that Holmes

187
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
Has been reprimanded

188
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
Which the network ID

189
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
Denied

190
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,951
And then you know it started be

191
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,255
Reported is the word uppity it been banned

192
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,279
And from ITV

193
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,583
Immediately the right-wing media went

194
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
Active mode

195
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:16,447
Because this was a fringe case or potential racism needed their help

196
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,007
They can't resist that brand of free speech issue

197
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:24,639
Seems like that's the only kind there really seems to matter all that much today

198
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:31,039
Wow I mean you good at you could almost use a certain word to describe the way that they are

199
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,343
You like that is the world of free speech

200
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
That they are

201
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,671
Only uniquely interested in

202
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:41,023
One thing that places like zerohedge made a very serious point in stress

203
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,327
Sing is that only one person complained

204
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,631
And it led to the Banning of a word

205
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,679
Best PC culture run amok Jordan

206
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,263
I noticed the same overemphasis V1 complaint

207
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,567
Issue in the coverage of the story nrt

208
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,127
But in other articles about this that wasn't

209
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:56,895
The focus

210
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,711
Like in the express the metro in the Sun

211
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:05,855
All the stories seemed to imply that there was only one complaint to the broadcast regulatory organization ofcom

212
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,159
But that detail isn't used to minimize

213
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,439
Is the complaint where it is

214
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
These other

215
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:16,095
Sphere it's used to drive it even further as as like it should have to be 1,000 people who

216
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,119
Complain before they

217
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
Get bothered by

218
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,167
Is that what they're doing

219
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,727
I guess I don't know they're just trying to say like all

220
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,799
This is one person was butthurt about this and that

221
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
Don't send

222
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,639
It's entirely possible that there were other complaints to

223
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,967
To the network but this one to ofcom is the one that prompted a reaction

224
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:36,575
Also it's possible that only one person followed through with the filing of a formal come

225
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:42,207
Even if that's the case that doesn't have anything to do with whether or not the single complaint is valid

226
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:47,327
In this instance if there's one person complaining that one person is absolutely correct

227
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,191
The term uppity does have racist connotations specifically in the way that Holmes was he using

228
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:58,847
As far as I can tell Holmes doesn't seem to have a history of racially inflammatory commentary so it's entirely possible that

229
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,871
You didn't mean there's an

230
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,663
In the way that it came off sounding

231
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,735
And that's probably why he didn't get in trouble for

232
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
The comment

233
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,807
The context was just explain to her

234
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,831
I am so that he could choose

235
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,855
Better words in the future

236
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,647
And the word wasn't banned for

237
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,975
A representative for the network was very clear

238
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,743
You're telling me

239
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,815
Quote it is incorrect to state that this is an it

240
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,351
TV ban on the word uppity

241
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,143
There's no such ban on the word up

242
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,959
Per se rather care will be taken regarding

243
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,495
Text of its use

244
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,055
Business situation where things played out

245
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,847
Pretty much exactly how they showed up

246
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:37,503
A guy on TV said something that he didn't realize was kind of racist someone pointed out that what he said was kind of races and their spawn

247
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,319
Good point let's try to be more careful about how we say

248
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,087
Things in the future

249
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,623
Right-wing in the United

250
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,415
Apparently can't stand that

251
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,999
To the point where they have to manufacture narratives about banned words

252
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
Adam schitt

253
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,607
Pouches versus even crazier he's saying that the word is being outlawed

254
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:56,447
Is it just say you're going to go to jail for saying absolutely

255
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
Apathetic

256
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,239
This desperation

257
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,799
To clean to and defend these remnants of a racist

258
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,871
Past well pretending it's all just about free speech

259
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895
Crazy

260
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,455
Like the details of the

261
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,735
Story are real

262
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
To go like

263
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,063
The thing is it's just

264
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
Any

265
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,391
Anyting any small thing that they can find

266
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,695
They will attack on that just

267
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,743
Like my theory on that is

268
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,279
Is that if they

269
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,583
On those like

270
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,351
Edge

271
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
Edge race

272
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
Situation

273
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:31,263
Then you then we're all over here looking at these Edge bullshits going like

274
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
No you can't

275
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,591
It's something you can't say the word it said

276
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,151
Always been used in the

277
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,223
We're just very careful about the car

278
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,247
Context of this word

279
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,551
I end a turn that into f******

280
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,087
And then we still can

281
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,111
Can't get back to life

282
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:52,767
The mortality rate for black people is 10 million times more of like

283
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,791
That's the only battle vake

284
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:59,679
Like they can't really fight some of the other related cases

285
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,983
You know that's

286
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,799
He's in cages now hold on this is a First Amendment issue

287
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,591
So that's

288
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,431
This episode

289
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,711
Into a sort of like

290
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
Can I see where Alex

291
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,831
And it got where it gets so much worse.

292
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:20,671
We now get to what Alex takes most of this episode responding

293
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
And

294
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
It's

295
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,279
I don't know how to tell you this but

296
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,303
Is Borat

297
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,655
Eyewitness to space getting at the national

298
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
I sausage

299
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
Baron Cohen

300
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,567
I know that every bit of it was written by

301
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,639
Sure

302
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,407
Sure

303
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,223
The very Sinister forces by in the 80s

304
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,295
He called for the arrest

305
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,319
The big Tech

306
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,087
Specs

307
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,391
Starting with Mark Zuckerberg

308
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
Whoa

309
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
Can you do

310
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,631
Punished accordingly

311
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:06,239
Target

312
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,847
The silencing of Alex Jones

313
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,479
Has not been enough

314
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,063
He says that it was just the beginning

315
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,695
All Americans must be silenced

316
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,607
This isn't some old black-and-white film footage

317
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,167
Hitler saying things like that

318
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,191
Is me

319
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,751
This is

320
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,783
This is a unified front of authoritarian Danger

321
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:56,159
So I heard that clip and I was like this is I hope he's just talking about this for a minute

322
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,231
This goes very far off the rails

323
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,767
That's not good so Jordan

324
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,399
I don't know if you saw the video but last week Sacha Baron Cohen gave a speech at the adl's never is now

325
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,959
O'Mara's kind of a very big deal

326
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,495
Nexus 4 years

327
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:14,591
Cohen's been a performer that very seldom appears as himself

328
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,407
He prefers to exist in public almost entirely as one of his

329
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,175
Character

330
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,967
Dropping that facade in speaker

331
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,015
Bluntly Big Sur

332
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,063
A bit of a powerful statement on its own

333
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,111
But even beyond that it was pretty good speech

334
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
I found it

335
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,415
Pretty well.

336
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:33,023
A large part of Cohen's message about linking his own work to the growth of affect

337
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,815
That social media has had on society

338
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,119
Facebook and Twitter are profoundly

339
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,703
Powerful propaganda tools which are able to lead people to believe in

340
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,983
Completely insane thing

341
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,567
Which has led to a mainstreaming of previously Fringe conspiracy theories

342
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,151
He discusses how has his Israeli Commando character

343
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,943
Is part of the show who is America

344
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,223
He told the guy that

345
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,039
Attendees of the women's March were putting out chemicals to

346
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,063
Turn people Tran

347
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,879
And instructed him to plant explosives on

348
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,927
The man did it

349
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,743
And actually push the detonation button which would have killed

350
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,279
Tons of people if they weren't

351
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,303
Fake explosives

352
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,607
Cohen I believe rightly

353
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,631
Canex this person

354
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,959
Willingness to believe the dumb conspiracy that his character presented to him

355
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,031
With his prior interaction with online misinformation

356
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,567
It's a good speech

357
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,687
And honestly Cohen makes a lot of points that are completely compatible with the goals Alex pretends to hold

358
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,223
He's arguing for big Tech

359
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,503
Tech companies to be

360
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,039
Responsible for what goes on on there

361
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,319
Platform which Alex

362
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,879
Mr.wok they both don't want these

363
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:36,767
These companies to be allowed to hide behind the excuse that they're just a space where anyone can post whatever they want while their operation

364
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:42,143
The primary difference seems to be that Alex wants more unhinged racist

365
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,167
Conspiracy theories.

00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,431
Aspect of his business

372
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,479
Without the erosion of objective

373
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,247
Reality

374
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:01,087
You weigh less able to trick people into believing that his subjective delusional Fanta

375
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,367
Are real

376
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:09,023
I mean his subjective delusional fantasy is on display perfectly right there right there

377
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,375
Any sense or is true it doesn't reflect Cohen speech at all like he didn't call for

378
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,655
Zuckerberg

379
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
Execution

380
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,727
And Alex himself is barely even a footnote

381
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:24,895
Going didn't say that everyone needs to be silenced he was specifically talking about tech companies removing content like home

382
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,479
Because it's Sasha Baron Cohen puts it quote

383
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,271
That is not some random opinion

384
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:33,599
Those who deny the Holocaust aim to encourage another one

385
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,159
Again I can't help but notice that it

386
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,207
It seems like every free-speech issue Alex

387
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:44,095
Decides to get on a soapbox about his nothing or it has to do with someone who says hey there's a lot of races black wraps

388
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,887
I don't think that's a coincidence

389
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
I don't understand

390
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,495
I know it's nothing new but it feels particularly over

391
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,055
It seems like a lot of these

392
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,335
These free speech

393
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,407
Protestations that he has are too

394
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,687
Specifically director

395
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,991
Towards people who are pointing out a problem

396
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
Of

397
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,783
Racist harassment

398
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,343
Issues surrounding

399
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:07,903
Racist

400
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,207
Justin

401
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,487
You just representing

402
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,279
The

403
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,303
The idea

404
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,631
What what Sacha Baron Cohen

405
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,935
I don't know. Like

406
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:24,031
Prank guy I couldn't say I almost a performance artist

407
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
Tustin

408
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,079
In many ways

409
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,407
Immersive satire

410
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,759
He probably said that I don't know

411
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,551
I've heard him described

412
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
That way that's

413
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
The way it looks

414
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:42,463
To me like his character is often the satyr satirized version of something

415
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
And then people

416
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,023
Responses to it are the

417
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,559
Then inform the

418
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,839
Yeah they are

419
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,143
He talks about that a little bit

420
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,423
About

421
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,191
How

422
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,751
Derrick Eric like in Borat there

423
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,775
There are scenes that are

424
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,567
Defensive but he's doing something

425
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,335
Pensive

426
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:02,943
But what comes out of it is the illustration that people are willing to go along

427
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,247
Is a shocking

428
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,527
Thing to see

429
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
Of course not

430
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,319
The effect of the art

431
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:12,159
The guy doing the racist stuff which is the Borat character

432
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,207
Eastside Tire of that

433
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,487
Yeah

434
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:21,375
But it's far more powerful coming from him

435
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,167
Because of its

436
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,703
Infrequent

437
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:28,031
You know because he's spending so much time in this character

438
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,823
Alex has to

439
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,663
Personally just because he popped out

440
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,479
You know he's so used to say hello like Borat is

441
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,295
Why are people complaining about Borat he did

442
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,831
Then I'll like all of this stuff

443
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,135
And now Sacha Baron Cohen because of

444
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,415
Is lack of character

445
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:49,791
It taken attention I think that's some of it

446
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,327
But I also think that

447
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,631
Alex understands that

448
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,655
The themes that

449
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,447
Cohen was talking about

450
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,239
Are things that are dangerous to

451
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:01,311
To his ability to operate

452
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,591
He does mention Alex

453
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
In passing

454
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,151
In the speech I didn't know that

455
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,223
He does mention like Alex

456
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:12,063
Then I throw out all the stuff I said it purely because you mentioned Alex to Alex

457
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,831
He's going to talk about it

458
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,903
I think that's a big part of it but also theme attic

459
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,696
What he's talking about

460
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,232
Is relevant to Alex's ability

461
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,792
So that is also peace

462
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:22,816
But

463
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,864
Largely speaking

464
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,192
Most of what he was talking about was things

465
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,752
Like Holocaust denial right being

466
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,568
Acceptable on places like Facebook Twitter

467
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,848
Like why

468
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,640
Your

469
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,712
Yeah you make a choice

470
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,760
Right you cannot allow it

471
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,296
So anyway

472
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,344
I thought like maybe

473
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,136
Alex is just going to

474
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,928
Talk about that a little bit

475
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,208
He gets back to it

476
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,744
But there's another Ellen

477
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,280
This episode that I

478
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,816
I saw this at

479
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,584
And I'm like

480
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,864
And there's a storm brewing

481
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,424
I shot a very important sentiment report

482
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,472
Reposted the front page

483
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,752
Infowars.com

484
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,288
Few minutes I hope

485
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,616
You'll share the album tearing at the bottom of the hour

486
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,152
Voorhees

487
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,456
A major Google whistleblower

488
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,736
Megashare

489
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:19,392
So I'd like I said I just feel like a really over

490
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,696
Really problematic Storm is Coming

491
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:27,840
He begins talking about this completes bulshit story out of the UK about the word uppity be

492
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:32,448
Being band primarily to I guess argue that it's cool to call non-white people uppity

493
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
Weird

494
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,544
Then he gets a bit of a tizzy about Sacha Baron Cohen

495
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,312
Jdl speed

496
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,360
Most of which he should agree with

497
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,664
It seems to think a terrible because going to Maine

498
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,016
Point has to do with the need to remove things I call it cost to Niles from mainstream conversation

499
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,064
And now Alex says

500
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,648
This Google whistleblowers act Voorhees coming back on the show

501
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,440
That just fits too

502
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,232
Because if you were call

503
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,024
Zack's big cache of documents

504
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,584
It's that he released the project Veritas were all based

505
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,608
Meaningless

506
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:05,728
But in the Fallout of him going public it was revealed that Zach a track record of posting anti-Semitic

507
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,520
Conspiracy theories on social media

508
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,360
On multiple occasions you posted about how America had his dog

509
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,152
Zionist occupation government

510
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,176
Inside quote

511
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:18,784
Is very simple either you go along with the Zionist or you end up like Andrew Breitbart

512
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,064
Which is of course

513
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,344
To save there's also a

514
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,928
Zom or sinus occupied media

515
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,952
And I assume

516
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,488
He's saying the Breitbart was

517
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,256
Was murdered by

518
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,840
The Daily Beast reviewed his Twitter account and found

519
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,656
Zach believed that the prevailing concept of

520
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,192
Free Speech really meant quote

521
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,728
Free speech for Jews

522
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,520
Not free speech for Goya

523
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,616
He claimed the Jews were using vaccines to attacking on Jews of the world

524
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,688
When Alex wants to do the big free speech

525
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:50,272
Pageants in mysteriously only ends up bring up cases where racist

526
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,576
Stuff is the subject of possible curtailing

527
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,368
Any lies about the circumstances of

528
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,184
Sub-story and that has the guy on his show

529
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,000
To discuss the issue believe there's Azog

530
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:06,400
In the free speech is quote free speech for Jews not free speech for goyim you really have to ask yourself what's really going on here

531
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,704
This isn't the defense of free speech

532
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,728
It's protect

533
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,800
Racism and dabbling a little bit and daddy semitism

534
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,080
I think that's all this is

535
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,872
Yeah is Alex like

536
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:19,456
Is he going to tell for the for the

537
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:24,576
The real Holocaust denial Waters

538
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,368
No no

539
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:30,976
Show gets a little closer to that than I'd like

540
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,000
I am not saying

541
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,024
Hellboy

542
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,072
Thank you

543
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,120
Start stalking a little bit about

544
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,656
Baron Cohen

545
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,704
About soccer

546
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,008
Explain that on the other end

547
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,800
This club

548
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,592
This is this is so

549
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,616
Vintage Alex

550
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,712
Felicia met2

551
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,296
Batl University combine

552
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,832
I've left it there

553
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:02,464
Protection feel like myself and others Georgetown University is

554
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,256
Organized and funding

555
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:07,072
The fake Charlottesville case in many others

556
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,936
In the first two men

557
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,520
I'm going to take your speech

558
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,312
Everything until

559
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,592
We start refusing to bow

560
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,688
Refusing to be slaves to the system

561
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,856
Enrage the enemy staying on there this long

562
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,160
It's about the products wow

563
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,184
Wow

564
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:38,816
He's saying that Sacha Baron Cohen was saying you need to arrest all the Tek heads

565
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,864
Execute Zuckerberg

566
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,400
That's not what he said

567
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:46,240
He's actually Alex will play the clip a little bit later

568
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,288
Are you saying that like

569
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,312
Facebook ads

570
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,104
I've been involved in

571
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,128
Facilitating

572
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,712
Bi-Rite hanger genocide in Myanmar

573
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,248
We have seen these effect

574
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,832
If this happens again you have to go to jail

575
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,856
That's a knife

576
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:07,232
I believe I'll make this comment again later that is an overly generous position

577
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:11,840
I was 18 with Alexander I expected you to say

578
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,864
He didn't call Vdara

579
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,776
But you don't get to be a billionaire without committing some crime

580
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:24,384
I believe as I as I put it in my notes for later it's like

581
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,152
This is

582
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,688
Kind of

583
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,224
Too soft

584
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,528
Because the way that

585
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,808
Besides Baron Cohen

586
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,344
Is is a framing

587
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:37,184
He puts the deaths of these ranga people into a

588
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:43,328
You know fully once kind of situation

589
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,936
Take all of it seriously looks like

590
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,520
It's trouble but you see there at the end Alex gets

591
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,288
Into the

592
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:58,688
It's a very clear like

593
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,480
My cat just very normal

594
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:06,880
They're they're taking her your ability to say that the Holocaust didn't happen away from you and the only

595
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:10,208
Only way we can get your abilities they the Holocaust happened back

596
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,744
Cuz if you buy these products

597
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,072
Yeah so in this next clip

598
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,376
You're a little bit more in Alex's sales pitch

599
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,728
Play even more of it is because I think there's an indication

600
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,752
Some real trouble

601
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,896
Supergiant

602
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:33,248
Remodeling

603
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:37,088
First Watch

604
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:44,768
So the new special is basically the same as so many of these other we're selling off the store sales that we've seen in the past but now there's

605
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,792
An added bonus

606
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:49,120
For the first time ever you get Triple Patriot Point

607
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,936
Which I honestly can't imagine means anything

608
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,472
Anyone who's on the fence

609
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:56,544
About buying products cuz I don't think anyone's on the fence

610
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:02,944
Proud man is a triple. Once I let you know the devil didn't do it for me but you triple it now we're now

611
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,968
We're dealing with gold

612
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,040
By this point you're either in or you're not

613
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,344
And the temptation of building up even more points

614
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,648
The system that you're not even engaged with

615
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,928
Probably doesn't move the needle

616
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:17,024
Different kinds of sales are targeted at different demographic

617
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,304
For instance

618
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,864
A giveaway just a free giveaway that's intended to

619
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,680
Specifically increase your customer base

620
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:26,752
You have faith something that you're selling but you need Market awareness

621
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,568
So you give it away for a brief. Of time to get the word out

622
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,896
This is a strategy often employed by a lot of booze

623
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,248
Is there at the shop people go around like oh my God this is great

624
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,296
Everyone loves booze

625
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,064
Strategy

626
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,856
Get you to enjoy their thing

627
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,904
And then maybe you'll become accustomed

628
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,184
That's one

629
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,720
Tactic the people can use

630
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,280
Offering triple Patriot Point

631
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,304
Is the exact

632
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,072
Text opposite

633
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:54,144
That's a special that cannot appeal to new customers

634
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,216
Since the incentive to buy is accruing points in a loyalty

635
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,752
Campaign the patriarch part of

636
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,592
This is a strategy that you only employ if the people you're trying to

637
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,896
Increase sales for are the people who are already

638
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,664
Customers

639
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,944
Which absolutely tracks

640
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,224
The state that Alex's business

641
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,784
The focus of his advertising shoot

642
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,808
Geared towards

643
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,088
To maximize the amount

644
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,624
You can get from existing cost

645
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,440
Because he's probably not getting a ton of new customer

646
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,744
That's putting money

647
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,536
Towards expanding the customer base

648
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,328
It's probably fishing in a dry well

649
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,096
Not not going to have

650
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,400
At a certain point though that's strategy

651
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,680
Become very day

652
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,264
Eddie's Baseline two-way Patriot points work

653
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,592
Is if you spend a dollar at the Infowars store you get 5 paper

654
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,640
If you build a point

655
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,712
You can exchange 500 of them for $5 in

656
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,480
In-store discount

657
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,552
Basically you get a point for every $0.20

658
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,576
To spend at the store

659
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,624
And then you can redeem them for $0.01

660
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,392
Discounts

661
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:52,000
That's been our tracks

662
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,792
Under normal

663
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,376
Accepting losing 5% to incentivizing

664
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:01,472
But this can get really hairy when you start adding multipliers

665
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,240
Thanks

666
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,032
Because the triple Patriot points

667
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,848
If you if you do that with triple paper tube lights

668
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:10,944
Customers are now getting 15 papery points for every dollar they spend

669
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,248
Or one point for every $0.06

670
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,576
If the exchange rate still holds over 500 points

671
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,112
Equals $5 in store credit

672
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,904
You now have to spend six

673
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,184
Scents to make one cell

674
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,744
We're supposed to before was 20

675
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:24,768
To make one cent

676
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,792
What's that in crooner

677
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,608
You can see how these two

678
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,632
Prospects are pretty different

679
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,168
In terms of how much of a loss

680
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:34,496
You're willing to accept in order to increase repeat sales

681
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,568
This s*** will really cut into margin

682
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,592
At a certain level

683
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,128
It's just not a good idea

684
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,408
From a business perspective

685
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,688
Mostly because

686
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,480
If someone is going to be inclined to purchase

687
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,248
Product because of

688
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,272
Triple Patriot Point

689
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,832
They're probably going to be Justice Way by BB

690
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:52,416
This feels like a really desperate attempt to sell things off

691
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,952
To the base that he has left

692
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:54,976
Profit margin be

693
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:55,744
Be damned

694
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:59,840
Honestly he could offer 10 times Bakery points and it probably wouldn't matter

695
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,864
If he knows that

696
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,400
He's probably going out of business

697
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,936
Write rewards program

698
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:10,336
Specifically have no monetary value so if you go under and all your fans are left with thousands of unused Patriot Point

699
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:13,664
You don't have to pay them back for their imaginary value

700
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,224
This might be a good plan for him moving forward

701
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,784
Police the last people

702
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,064
Rabbit create

703
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,880
These absurd sales I just hope people know

704
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,648
Hope they don't

705
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,184
Cash in before you

706
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,744
Yeah this does seem like a

707
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,512
If they

708
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:32,352
Grab as much revenue as possible as soon as they can

709
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,120
And then they

710
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,936
Final that out into I guess

711
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:36,960
Legal defense

712
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,008
And then whenever they declare bankruptcy

713
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,056
They don't have to give up any

714
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,360
And they don't have to pay back all the pictures

715
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,896
This strategy

716
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,688
That one would be using

717
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,760
That looks like this

718
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,528
It does

719
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,296
Just feel like

720
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,832
Trying to patch up a hole in it

721
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,624
Yeah it it feels like uni

722
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,928
Squeeze the base

723
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,976
Immediately

724
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,536
I just don't I don't know

725
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,608
It's definitely tracks with a lot of the other indications

726
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,376
That we weave

727
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,168
It's not a long-term business

728
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,496
So

729
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,288
Alex Goes To Break

730
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,056
There

731
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,848
Try giving the triple Patriot Point

732
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,896
And he comes back

733
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,944
And he's playing that 7-minute

734
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,248
ATL Sacha Baron Cohen

735
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,296
Report that he had mentioned that he

736
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:29,440
Is he using the weird Chinese accent. He's not doing something all the track on Dragon

737
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,744
I'll just say this right

738
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,304
My title of this clip is

739
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,840
Not good stuff

740
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:42,240
Influential Jewish organization in

741
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:46,336
Yeah, that issued a public statement at their main

742
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:50,432
Conference calling for the arrest of the big six

743
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:55,296
Fully turn control of their

744
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:59,136
Carbone's moderation and content

745
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:04,000
This is literal terrorism

746
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,024
Find

747
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,048
I'm not enough

748
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:12,704
Maybe it's time to tell Mom Zuckerberg and the CEOs of these companies

749
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:19,360
You already allowed one foreign power to interfere in our elections

750
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:24,736
Facilitated genocide Indiana Mall

751
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,040
Go to jail the ATL then

752
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,624
Further and calls for a purge of everyone who does not

753
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,416
Agreed with them

754
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,464
Insist on fire

755
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,864
These lies and conspiracies from that platform not even hit

756
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:47,264
Conion

757
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,080
Holyshit

758
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,128
Eloise

759
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:00,064
No no no that's not bad

760
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:06,208
That's that was the point in the episode where I was like well

761
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,000
Where job where you are in deep

762
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,584
F****** trouble so he keeps

763
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,376
DL put out this announcement

764
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,680
There's a speech that Sacha Baron Cohen

765
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,448
The ATL

766
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:20,288
ATL didn't come out and make a statement

767
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:22,080
Keynote speaker at getting an award

768
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,640
Alex could argue all the walks at the ATL

769
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:30,784
Italy agrees with the Cullens comments but it's a gross mischaracterization to say it's a public statement put out by the ATL

770
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,088
He knows what he's doing and it's called lying

771
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,184
Also the like I talked about with the my Anmar right angle

772
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,208
Situation I think

773
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,512
I think that he's being a little bit too generous

774
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:43,840
But at the same time I understand why someone wouldn't make this feature

775
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,144
To be like you should be in prison right now

776
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:52,544
Just a little inflammatory I get why you would phrase it this way but I disagree

777
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,336
It'll be stronger

778
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,456
What the f*** is that what he's talking about this Hitler s***

779
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:03,552
He said quote not even Hitler gave speeches this evil in this draconian

780
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:06,112
He just took over and carried out the evil

781
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,928
Is that somehow better yeah absolutely

782
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,976
What the f*** is this point

783
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,256
Give a speech

784
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:16,864
That's rude it sounds like this is just an attempt to save the ATL is worse than

785
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,912
I'm pretty sure that's what he said yes

786
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:25,312
Also for someone who claims to be as much of a history buff is Alex does what with the 25,000 books on World War

787
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:30,432
Bread visit some of Hitler speeches

788
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,504
This evil as I was going back through my mind like

789
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,296
Whew man he sent them

790
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:41,696
I would hate for Alex accidentally say that those beaches weren't evil into Coney because he just forgotten

791
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,488
You know how evil and Draconian they

792
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:49,120
I could come up with plenty of examples of very evil and very Draconian things that Hitler said and speeches

793
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:53,984
Things that are far more evil than Sacha Baron Cohen suggesting the tech company should platform Holocaust

794
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,544
Denial carryout genocides

795
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,104
Right it's really hard

796
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:04,736
To say that the guy who is saying no more genocides is worse than the guy who said

797
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:09,600
Yes to Jenna's well the underlying thing here is that Alex wants to argue that

798
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,880
The abl is

799
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:16,256
Complicit and actively working towards a white genocide but he knows it'll be way too overt

800
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,280
Yatso

801
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:20,608
He wants to use all the rhetoric that's around that

802
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,656
Without actually saying that

803
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:26,240
Conservative

804
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:29,824
To really really want to see you all the time and

805
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,360
Those two things are not related

806
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,664
So this is kind of double prong situation

807
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:36,992
I'm 1/2 oz trying to demonize the ATL because he

808
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:40,064
He's a gigantic bigot in the ATL is kind of a threat to bigots

809
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,832
Cuz they take them

810
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,600
I'm seriously

811
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:45,184
But on the other hand in the process Alex's whitewashing Adolf Hitler

812
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,232
By implying that you wasn't as bad

813
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,048
Oz very very f*****-up

814
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:56,448
And the most generous reading that is that he has so little idea what he's talking about that he's willing to hand wave Hitler speech

815
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,984
Beaches in order to attack the abl

816
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:02,080
The least generous reading is it he actually does know what he's talking about

817
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,872
Any thinks Hitler speeches warranty

818
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,688
Well I would say that

819
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,456
If you're reading

820
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:10,016
25,000 books on WWII

821
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:16,416
Let's go

822
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,232
I'm going to go with

823
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,536
Between 40 and 60%

824
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,072
Of those are Holocaust

825
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,144
In in some form

826
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,192
Saudia the Special Report

827
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,264
Multinational corporations

828
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,872
Working with groups like the ATL have decided to Brand any

829
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,944
Resistance to their takeover

830
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,088
This is so incredibly dangerous and it's going to blow up in the face

831
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,368
Of those that are trying

832
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,976
The ATL spokesperson

833
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:57,376
Jew down the well so my country can be free

834
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:05,056
So I think that Alex is starting to realize that more people are taking

835
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,616
Seriously How Deeply rooted and anti-semitism

836
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,640
His worldview is

837
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,688
And then he needs to come up with a good defense

838
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:14,784
I didn't predict it would involve him saying that Hitler speeches worth

839
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,808
Medieval but Alex's

840
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,928
Consistently unpredictable pretty sure His Brilliant strategy for

841
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,464
Claims that his worldview is deep

842
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,488
Atlanta Semitic

843
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,536
Is I know you are but what am I

844
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,888
We were far from the only people who were previously pointing out that Alex

845
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,424
The conception of his villains

846
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,728
People have really from old-time antique

847
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,496
East Metro

848
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,544
But lately it seems to be more of a public

849
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,312
Text thing

850
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
Princeton

851
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:42,432
Last week we saw Fiona Hill testify in the impeachment inquiry during which points

852
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,224
I asked pointed out that the

853
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,016
Conspiracy surrounding George Soros

854
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,576
Are are little more than a modern-day update

855
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:51,648
To the protocols of the Elders of Zion which 100% means

856
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:56,512
Did she listen to Arch that was a forged document specifically designed to spread antipathy

857
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,280
Detour to

858
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:00,608
Alex has nothing to worry about from the sort of talk in terms of his body

859
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:06,240
They don't care or probably even support at least some of them support that element of Alex's

860
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,264
Broadcast work

861
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:11,360
But the more and more the rest of the world understands how much Alex's show does fitting

862
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:15,712
Into the box of this sort of propaganda the more likely it is that he'll be seen for what he is

863
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,480
Instead of some

864
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,504
Patriot truth

865
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,064
And so it makes sense that I don't realize it

866
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,648
He's probably going to be accused of being an anti-semite a bit in the future

867
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:26,464
So it's probably best to come up with the preemptive defense around that

868
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:30,048
They're just calling everyone loves America anti-semitic now

869
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,608
In Cohen's

870
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,144
Speech at the ATL event

871
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:40,544
He discusses that sketchy did Borat getting a group of people at a bar to sing along with the song Throw the Jew down the

872
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:47,712
The reason I've seen in Borat is so resonate is because it demonstrates how there are places in the country where anti-Semitism is so casually

873
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,480
Acceptable

874
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,504
But no one thinks this

875
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,296
Speak up when a complete stranger starts

876
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,576
Sing about how the Jews

877
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,368
Are the problem in their country

878
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,392
And how they take all your money

879
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,208
That scene is an actual example of satire

880
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,024
Sacha Baron Cohen did something very risky

881
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,304
Going onstage at a country

882
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,072
Free music night

883
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:06,400
Insignia explicitly anti-semitic song cuz he how people would react

884
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,960
And it turns out they reacted by clapping along and

885
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:15,360
This is like Roadhouse but better Alex can pretend all he wants at this clip he has is like a

886
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:18,688
The gotcha moment there proves that Cohen is the real anti-semite

887
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:22,016
That's our behaviors so intentionally obtuse you really have to question

888
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:22,784
To the motives behind

889
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:26,880
I'm I'm I just got to tell you nobody understand

890
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,648
And satire

891
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,672
White as

892
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,696
Well as

893
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,256
You know cuz that that

894
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,792
Satire requires bike

895
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,840
2nd level order of think

896
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,120
That Alex

897
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,144
Specialized

898
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,936
That's his game

899
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,216
And he is all about

900
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,520
So in this special report

901
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,288
Weaves

902
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,824
Seeing already

903
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,128
Alex saying that this

904
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:51,200
Speech that Sacha Baron Cohen is more evil and

905
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:51,968
Draconian

906
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:52,736
Then

907
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,272
Hitler's Ray-Ray

908
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,808
Which is nuts

909
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,576
I don't want

910
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,600
Even if you're

911
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,648
How is it that he

912
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,184
Play that clip of like

913
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,976
We saw what happened

914
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:05,024
With the rohingya in

915
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,792
Myanmar

916
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:10,400
If you precipitate another genocide you're going to jail

917
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,424
Even play

918
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,192
More

919
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:12,960
Of that clip

920
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:18,080
That's very straightforward

921
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:21,664
Don't know

922
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,760
This the Special Report is

923
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:28,320
It really blows my mind

924
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,880
Because it's deeply anti-Semitic

925
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,648
Oh yeah

926
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,976
Are We Done Yet

927
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:43,168
So the ATL going to protect us from all these Nazis and then we learn their Alex Jones Donald Trump

928
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:49,568
Stephen Miller George Soros it was an actual Nazi collaborator

929
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,128
This is dangerous

930
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:58,527
Then just about money

931
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,831
Dollars a year

932
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:04,159
Run their moderation and the training of their sensors

933
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:10,815
There's a lot of stuff going on there

934
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:13,375
So of course Alex Berry bullseye

935
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,143
More rank

936
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:18,751
Holocaust revisionism in the form of lying about George soros's actions during WWII

937
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:24,383
This is no surprise but I was pretty shocked when I was followed that up by saying that the ADL is out for power

938
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,919
But they're also out for money

939
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:29,503
Did I realize the characterization of Jews having no morality pass

940
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,295
Cast of lust for money is a deeply auntie

941
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,063
Pizza medic 40

942
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:32,831
From history

943
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,135
It's almost like he's going out of his way to appeal to

944
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:39,743
Tons of anti-Semitic shittin is weird attempt to defend himself or claims that he's anti-Semitic

945
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,791
Weird it's wild

946
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:45,375
Need leaning into being an anti-semite while claiming that

947
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,399
That's

948
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:48,703
This is doublespeak that I just can't hang with

949
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,983
It's about

950
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,007
He literally

951
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:54,591
What are the weirdest special reports that I've listened to on

952
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,359
Michelle it's

953
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,919
It's so Incubus

954
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,967
Lick everything

955
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:04,575
Together man are getting paid a lot of money they're doing this for all of them

956
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,367
Play and they control moderation

957
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,647
Sandwich in other ways

958
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,671
Basically says

959
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:11,999
The Jews control the media you can see there so maybe I am

960
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:15,071
Jesus isn't paid Millions by big Tech

961
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:15,839
Back to drain their scent

962
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,607
As far as I can

963
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:23,519
I was referring to a 2017 story he read and Breitbart about the ATL teaming up with Facebook Twitter Google and Microsoft

964
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:26,079
The creepy cyber hate problem-solving lab

965
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:29,407
A place where issues across platforms that have to do with hate oriented

966
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,687
Did Rasmus could be discussed

967
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:35,039
I can see how this would be construed by Alex's the ATL being paid Millions

968
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,063
The train sensors

969
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,367
But there's no evidence I can find that that's what

970
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,135
What's going on

971
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,439
Butea wasn't even the only advocacy

972
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,975
The group is involved in that project

973
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:48,351
Legitimately this special report is that Alex plays his mother was f***** up things he's done in awhile

974
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:51,679
It's completely misrepresenting Cohen

975
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
On every light

976
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,007
Is a misrepresentation of the contest

977
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:59,103
It's a misrepresentation that it's a public statement from the ADL

978
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,407
It even beyond that Alex's rebuttals to

979
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:05,503
To the strawman argument

980
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,039
Embarrassed

981
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,575
It's very f*****-up

982
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:11,903
Yeah it does seem like this is the beginning

983
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:15,743
Maybe he pivots one more time but boys

984
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,023
This is this

985
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,071
KKK level kind of s*** right here

986
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,863
It's it's weird and honestly

987
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,143
Anything where he says

988
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,679
They say that

989
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,447
We are Nazis

990
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:29,567
He's like me and Donald Trump and Stephen Miller and it's like yeah you all say the same Nazi

991
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,335
Play s*** like

992
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:36,991
This isn't worse than Hitler has said very publicly don't compare things

993
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:43,391
To the Holocaust I don't they've made many public statements about not comparing people to not to use

994
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,415
And

995
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,439
The concentration

996
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,487
Camps at the border to concentrate

997
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,767
Cap City

998
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:52,351
Like they may have been the people who aren't

999
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,119
Doing that

1000
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,423
They are the people most

1001
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,215
To call you at

1002
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,263
Which is why this is so

1003
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,591
So Alex comes back after the

1004
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,615
Special Report

1005
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,383
And

1006
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,967
Easy seeing a trailer for

1007
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,503
You show

1008
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:12,319
Amazon show features white people wearing red Maga hats

1009
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,111
Hunted as Nazis

1010
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,415
Al Pacino

1011
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,975
There's numerous similarities to the Hein

1012
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:20,767
Flirting

1013
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:22,815
The name of it

1014
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,863
Is it called The Hunt

1015
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,631
Nope

1016
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,679
And that's just so sick

1017
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,983
We're calling for violence

1018
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:35,615
They're the quote anti-fascist funded by the most famous living fascist

1019
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,663
To work directly for Hitler

1020
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,527
Makeup the magnitude of that

1021
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,551
So that mean

1022
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,623
You can't you just

1023
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,647
Yes you care

1024
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:52,255
You making up with it throws work for Hitler not directly for Hitler like uses

1025
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:58,655
This is straight-up defamation you can sue him he's making up the Soros fund

1026
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:02,751
That's based on those fake contract yet

1027
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,311
And he's the most famous fascist in the world

1028
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,335
George Soros

1029
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,639
The most famous passage in the world

1030
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,407
Sorrel

1031
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,199
George Soros

1032
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,991
Nazi Jinping

1033
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:15,807
No none of those

1034
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:16,831
Definitely not

1035
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,855
Hitler

1036
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,415
It wasn't that evil or draconian

1037
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:23,743
So I'm not sure how Alex get this is you talking about the

1038
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,511
The show Hunters

1039
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,559
Latest news

1040
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,863
The hunters

1041
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,679
So I'm not sure how you can see that trailer

1042
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:34,239
I'm come to the conclusion that it's about Jews hunt

1043
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,263
Coming down Christian

1044
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,823
Or that it has anything to do with Trump or Maga

1045
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,895
Answer that last part the show takes place in the 7th

1046
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,919
Maga hats

1047
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,455
Trump being president

1048
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,991
F****** an anachronistic

1049
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,807
Do the larger issue though

1050
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,599
Which is that Alex sees this show.

1051
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,879
Besides about Jews

1052
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:51,903
Hunting down Christian

1053
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,183
That's not the

1054
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:53,951
Plot

1055
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:58,303
It's about a ragtag group of Nazi Hunters who are not so much hunting down Christians

1056
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:02,399
They are hunting down Nazi play I really feel like Alex

1057
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,423
Connects those two

1058
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,959
You know like that

1059
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:05,727
Christian

1060
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:08,799
And the Nazi party really identifies both of those

1061
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:11,359
Play in a little bit

1062
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,895
So

1063
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:16,479
The show just released its first trailer and I have a few thoughts about

1064
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:20,319
The first is that Al Pacino looks a whole lot like Marc Maron

1065
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,087
The show

1066
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,623
Honestly that's probably My Bae

1067
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,647
Okay good

1068
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:27,231
It's just another this this right here is just another in a long string of hits

1069
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:27,999
Azar Alex

1070
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,279
Seems to be running damaged

1071
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,071
Control4 imaginary races

1072
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,399
We saw him do this with that other TV show while back about the

1073
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,679
Time traveler going back to

1074
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,447
Stop a white

1075
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:42,335
The bombing range Alex claimed was about a time traveler trying to stop Patriots from fighting Global exact

1076
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,383
It's pretty much the same thing

1077
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:49,247
He's talking about Michelle where a rabbi puts together a team of Nazi hunters and

1078
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,295
He's claiming it's about Jews killing Christian

1079
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,087
It's really f***** up

1080
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,647
To see how consistent his identification with the bad guys

1081
00:47:57,183 --> 00:48:02,303
Like this is not real I don't know for what reason or another

1082
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,375
For some reason he really didn't like the ending of Inglourious

1083
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:11,519
These people are not real that he's pretending

1084
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,311
It's it's bizarre

1085
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,591
It's bizarre that the way he

1086
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,871
Craft Bistro menu

1087
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:16,639
Surrounding

1088
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:17,663
He shows

1089
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,967
But he talked a little bit more about the

1090
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:26,879
The hunted coming out

1091
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:33,279
People wearing a farm

1092
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:40,447
Fox News I was going to cause mass shootings and so they

1093
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,775
But now they've released

1094
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:44,543
Hunters

1095
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,359
Anyone wearing make America great again hat

1096
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,151
Shirley secretly Nazis

1097
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,943
What about the ones who aren't

1098
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,735
800 down and killed

1099
00:48:54,527 --> 00:49:00,159
This show as best as anyone can tell at this point there's one trailer for it

1100
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:06,559
Has nothing to do with trump it has everything to do with a real actual

1101
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:10,143
Escaped into the United States and they're being hunted down by a group led by a rabbi

1102
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,167
Who's pretty anti-nazi

1103
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,191
I just

1104
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,215
Just it

1105
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,263
It cannot

1106
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,287
Be said

1107
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,335
These are the type of

1108
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,127
Claimed that we are also

1109
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,663
Haha yep

1110
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:27,039
This is the type of person who sees the trailer for an owl Pacino

1111
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,063
TV series

1112
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,343
How long is the trailer

1113
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,927
Minute 40

1114
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:33,951
Offer him to

1115
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:36,255
Decide to show that is when is it set

1116
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,303
70s

1117
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,863
Is actually about

1118
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,143
Okay

1119
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:46,239
One shot in the trailer where guys holding a red hat to his

1120
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,031
Is chest as one might when they're in

1121
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:48,799
Prayer

1122
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:54,431
Well which is apparently enough for the whole joke actually secretly be about hunting down Trump supporters like laying with a Nazi

1123
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:57,759
The redhead is not a trumpet it has yellow lettering

1124
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,295
And it doesn't say make America great

1125
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,319
It's just red

1126
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:04,927
Other people in the same shot have no hats other another guy has a pork pie hat

1127
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,207
Also there's no evidence

1128
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:09,535
From the trailer this guy who has a red hat is one of the targets of the hunters

1129
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,815
That's just an assumption that Alex

1130
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:13,119
Is making there is a red hat in the trailer

1131
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:16,703
Ipso facto

1132
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:18,751
Okay so how about the end of Schindler's List

1133
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:24,383
Did he not like the red balloon was that is that the part that really got it just programming for the hats

1134
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,919
So this is just an assumption

1135
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:27,711
Actually

1136
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:29,247
Alex is just reporting

1137
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,527
Honor Paul Joseph Watson

1138
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:34,367
This is just outright white identity victimhood

1139
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,647
Taken to a point of self

1140
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:36,415
Parody

1141
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:39,743
Paul Joseph Watson article on Infowars legitimately says quote

1142
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:46,143
The plot of the show appears to Bear numerous similarities to Jason Bloom's the Hutt a horror movie that centered around a group of live

1143
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,679
Liberals who hunt down red state

1144
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,447
Conservatives

1145
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,263
That's not really a good description of the plot of The Hunt

1146
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:57,663
It has some relevant points in there but if I run Middle School teacher and that was the plot description little Paul Joseph Watson

1147
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,455
Turned in for a book report let's say

1148
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,735
I probably give him a seat

1149
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,039
It demonstrates a lack of critical thinking

1150
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,063
Contextual analysis

1151
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:08,415
That's it there's nothing really similar about the plots of the hunt and Hunters

1152
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:11,487
Their names are close and enforces turn the both

1153
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:14,815
Open to attacks on Trump and white people but beyond that they're very

1154
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,583
Stories

1155
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,887
If you're a hammer everything is a nail

1156
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:20,447
If you're a rabbit white identity propaganda

1157
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,471
All you ever see

1158
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:22,239
Or Temps

1159
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,263
To make white people look

1160
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,055
All that's going on here

1161
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:25,823
This is pathetic

1162
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,103
So we're dealing with

1163
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:31,199
Second-degree bulshit here there they're not engaging with the hunters

1164
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:34,015
But they are drawing a connection to the hunt

1165
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,575
Which they already have narratives about

1166
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,855
Because it's Hunters

1167
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,647
And they know that nobody who watches

1168
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,439
Is dealing with this s***

1169
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,207
Is going to ask

1170
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,231
Play give a s*** about

1171
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:44,255
The Bachelor

1172
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,327
I think they're huge Al Pacino fans

1173
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:53,727
Infowars I think that's how you write article but I think the inspiration for it is there's a red hat

1174
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:54,751
Great

1175
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,287
I want to be

1176
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,311
I want to work for

1177
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,615
Because that is the easiest job in the world

1178
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,199
You know what when I was doing

1179
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:03,967
Stand up

1180
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,527
One of the things that made it the most difficult was

1181
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:09,855
Constantly being like someday people will find out I'm not funny

1182
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:12,927
Imposter

1183
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,487
I can't imagine how difficult that would be

1184
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,511
If you work at Infowars

1185
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,071
Like I don't know how you would

1186
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:22,655
I see now I think it's one of those things where

1187
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:29,055
It's like when you like how rich people become more sociopathic when it when you're living when you're riding the bus

1188
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,079
You know

1189
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:33,919
You're much more close to your fellow man and then as you get Richie

1190
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:35,967
You start to become back

1191
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,783
I think the same thing happens when you're in

1192
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:42,623
Like you're in the pitch meeting and you're trying really hard the first couple weeks you're like

1193
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:46,719
I'm going to really dig down on the story then after a couple weeks everybody's like

1194
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:47,999
You don't have to

1195
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,047
You're probably right

1196
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:56,447
You're probably right and then you pick up a nice booze habit

1197
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,215
Combat medic

1198
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,007
3

1199
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,799
3 whiskey lunches

1200
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:03,103
So

1201
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,407
This guy calls into the show

1202
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:10,783
He has some information about the ADL that Alex should know

1203
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:24,095
You can get a pretty good synopsis if you look at the executive intelligence review from 1993 called The Ugly Truth

1204
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:24,863
Video

1205
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,631
Bass

1206
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:30,239
Larose group in a very good analysis

1207
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:35,103
A lot of people say that the larousse group

1208
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:35,871
Did a lot of

1209
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,639
Greater Dallas

1210
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:41,759
Okay

1211
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:44,831
Got to call her calling and saying you got to educate yourself about to eat

1212
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,623
Abl may I refer you to

1213
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:48,415
Lyndon larouche

1214
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:51,743
No cuz you please say what you really mean what

1215
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:52,511
Which is that you just

1216
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,047
Could you just stop right

1217
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,327
So Alex is Intuit

1218
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,351
Without heat

1219
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:58,911
Talk a little bit about the route

1220
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,959
Inaccurate

1221
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:03,263
Go back to chases

1222
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:06,335
From the roof patched analysis of the ID

1223
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,151
Reading that report like a big

1224
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,175
Magazine

1225
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:17,087
Because he was a real progress in front of quantify things and

1226
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:20,159
Yep peace with Russia and China

1227
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:24,255
Capital One credit cards

1228
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:31,423
So what are you can tell they're that Alex is trying to imply that there's

1229
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:35,263
Some kind of a connection between LaRosa's publication about the ATL in his arrest

1230
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:38,079
That's impossible since the pamphlet came out in 90

1231
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:40,383
1892 whereas lorusso's convicted of

1232
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,407
Receipts

1233
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,943
Mail fraud involving more than

1234
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:45,503
30 million dollars through 11 counts of

1235
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:47,039
Actual mail fraud

1236
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,319
Credit card

1237
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:50,111
Conspiracy to defraud the IRS

1238
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:53,439
In December 1988

1239
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:58,047
These guys they deal pamphlet was released wow larousse was in prison for the things for horses

1240
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:00,095
Then One credit card receipt not being right

1241
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,887
This is a rule of thumb

1242
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:05,727
I'm going to say this anyone you here saying positive things about Lyndon larouche

1243
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,519
In the year of Our Lord 2019

1244
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,567
You should walk away from

1245
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:15,199
They're either members of his called or they're just too dumb to recognize what a conman Lyndon larouche was

1246
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:18,783
And either way it's a gigantic red flag you do not need to engage.

1247
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:19,807
Gogo

1248
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,855
Larussa the name that you

1249
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,623
Just pass on

1250
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,927
No I'm going to look into what he's

1251
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:27,231
You don't need to you don't need to he's larouche

1252
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:28,511
So Alex talked in the

1253
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,303
Baron Cohen

1254
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,351
Has really

1255
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,911
Prompted something in his collar

1256
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:41,567
Does we get this called this when I was like hey you should educate yourself about the what the larouche

1257
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,871
People had to say about the ATL

1258
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,151
No will not

1259
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,943
Omani get another caller

1260
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:54,623
Hey Alex it's really great to hear that you know you're talkin about these kinds of issues

1261
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:00,511
What it comes down to groups like the ATL

1262
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:03,583
I've been using terms like anti

1263
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,351
I sell my

1264
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:10,239
As a weapon against their enemies that used to be an anti-semite with someone that

1265
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:14,847
And now it really seems like it's turning into someone

1266
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,127
Jews don't like

1267
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:17,151
What

1268
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:22,015
That caller accidentally revealed a little bit about himself in that brief sentence

1269
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:27,135
He's an anti-semite used to being somebody didn't like Jews but now it's some of the Jews don't like

1270
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:30,207
What does it mean by someone the Jews don't like

1271
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:33,791
Who are these Jews or deciding who they like and who they don't like

1272
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:35,839
Dear man

1273
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,119
I've exist

1274
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:37,887
Jasmine call

1275
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:42,495
Anti-semite recently he might and I heard that I was like

1276
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:46,079
Bet streaming of this he's so f***** up

1277
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,359
Indicated

1278
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,639
Give me something really bad

1279
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,919
Sounds like you know what man

1280
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:51,455
I might be

1281
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:53,503
Guilty of the same a hammer nail

1282
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:56,575
I dwell in a lot of Worlds of

1283
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,111
Do you know pretty anti-Semitic

1284
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:03,487
Conspiracy theories that are passed off as anti-communist in nature

1285
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:05,791
I was like I was worried that I was maybe

1286
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:08,607
Unfairly castigating this guy in my mind

1287
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:11,423
No he's opened a space

1288
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:17,823
I'm glad you started talking about these issues you know what these issues means to this dude

1289
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,615
Could be just us

1290
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,407
Hypersensitive.

1291
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,967
We're not

1292
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:26,527
Because he goes on and you makes a recommendation

1293
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,807
For someone Alex should have on the

1294
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,367
Hitler really really

1295
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:33,951
Scary to see what what these people are doing and

1296
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:40,607
There's a guy who's been writing about this for a very long time

1297
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,375
Talk to him

1298
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,935
I know this

1299
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,959
Noe Michael

1300
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:50,847
All I know is I promote Freedom Americana

1301
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:54,431
So I'm always interested when a collar recommend someone that Alex

1302
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,199
Should have on

1303
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:57,247
And to Alex's credit at least you didn't say

1304
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,271
Guy like him

1305
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,063
Yeah I know

1306
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,111
When they make recommendations that

1307
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:05,439
What kind of thing speaks volumes about who Alex's audience thinks

1308
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,463
He's in line with

1309
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:09,791
This caller apparently thinks that Alex is on the same wavelength is

1310
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:10,815
Michael Jones

1311
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,095
Which is really f***** up

1312
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:13,631
Because that dude is a huge

1313
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,655
Bigot

1314
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:15,679
Jones isn't

1315
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:17,727
Extremist Catholic speaker who sets

1316
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:20,031
Free outrageous things of the past few years

1317
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:23,615
A lot of it having to do with how the Jews are behind all the evil in the world

1318
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:26,175
Princeton's he said in an interview quote

1319
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:29,247
If you turn away from the Catholic Church you will end up a Slave

1320
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:30,527
A slave to the Jews

1321
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,831
Either through their pornography or their user

1322
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:40,511
That pretty well sums of his perspective it's not some kind of

1323
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:44,607
Anti-zionist thing or something for their policies

1324
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,167
This is a guy who literally believes that Jews are in

1325
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,447
Intrinsically against

1326
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,471
The good of the world

1327
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:53,311
That is really bad I mean it's not as bad as like hey if

1328
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:57,151
If you facilitate another Holocaust we're going to be real bad earlier

1329
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,431
It's not that bad

1330
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:00,223
It's not that bad but that is still

1331
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:03,551
In the aftermath of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting Johnson

1332
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:06,623
Quote you have undermined the moral order and now don't be

1333
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:08,159
Be surprised if people start acting

1334
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,183
Sing out there regression

1335
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:13,791
Okay which is explicitly saying those 11 people who were murdered brought their deaths

1336
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,839
Support themselves for being Jewish

1337
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:19,423
Yeah yeah well I mean when your Jewish your immoral and

1338
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,983
If you're immoral don't be surprised when people murdered

1339
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,519
I feel like that makes

1340
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:27,359
Since 1996 Jones has put out a magazine called culture wars

1341
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,639
Which is pretty much

1342
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,175
Just about had the Jews are bad

1343
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:36,063
He's called Jews quote Outlaws and subversive who use religion as a cover for social Revolution

1344
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,111
He said Judaism has a quote

1345
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,903
Particularly malignant spirit

1346
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:43,231
You legitimately argue that it's a requirement of being Christian

1347
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:44,511
The anti-jewish

1348
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:51,167
In 2003 he wrote an article for his magazine to blame the Jews for bring the Holocaust upon themselves as well as the pogrom

1349
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:54,495
Incidentally e Michael Jones is a big influence

1350
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,775
That's currently on one of the Alex

1351
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:57,055
Former friends turned

1352
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,335
Outright anti-semite

1353
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:02,431
He's been interviewed by Benjamin a number of times and

1354
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:03,967
Who played an important role

1355
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:05,503
In him going down the path

1356
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,783
But he's currently on

1357
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:10,623
This caller knows exactly who e Michael Jones is and how much he hates doing

1358
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,671
He's recommending him to Alex

1359
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:14,463
Because to anti-semitic ears

1360
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:17,023
Alex seems like he should be hanging out with this dude

1361
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:19,327
They seem to be on the same page

1362
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:23,167
AA Speakers volume

1363
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:25,471
I do love a b soul

1364
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,007
It's so transparent

1365
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,799
And just write on

1366
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:32,127
To be a Christian you have to

1367
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:33,407
Is could not be

1368
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,175
More obvious

1369
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:39,039
Yeah if you think about that you also have to hate Christ

1370
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,831
Dude are you getting this

1371
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,367
Are you getting what you are

1372
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,159
You are

1373
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:46,207
What's the best

1374
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:48,511
This virulent strain of Christianity

1375
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,047
Hayden Christ

1376
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:51,839
F****** awful

1377
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,375
So when you look into

1378
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,399
Michael Jones

1379
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:57,471
These sorts of these things were like after the synagogues

1380
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:58,495
Can you sing

1381
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,263
Could use brought this

1382
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,287
Upon themselves

1383
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,823
Who sang they brought the Holocaust

1384
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:02,591
The pogrom

1385
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,615
Upon themselves

1386
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:05,663
Great things

1387
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:08,735
I need to hear a little bit of Alex

1388
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:09,503
Threatening

1389
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:11,039
Clip

1390
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,319
Sort of similar

1391
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:15,903
Crazy megalomania

1392
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:25,887
ATL

1393
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:32,287
When push comes to shove

1394
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:34,591
17 Russia

1395
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:44,575
So in many ways what he's expressing there is that the ATL is going to bring on whatever backlash

1396
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,343
They have

1397
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,623
Which is obviously

1398
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,159
Some sort of a code for

1399
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:50,719
An attack

1400
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,743
So sorry

1401
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,279
I'm so scared for the ADL

1402
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,303
Because

1403
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,583
If they keep

1404
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:58,399
Eight you know asking my friends not to

1405
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,423
Maybe y'all entice

1406
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:01,727
Semitic my friends are going to start killing them

1407
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:02,495
And that's not

1408
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,263
My fault

1409
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:04,799
Their fault

1410
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,079
Beijing

1411
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,615
Of course

1412
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,919
It's a very similar mentality

1413
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:12,223
Speaks again volume

1414
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,503
As to why someone would think

1415
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:15,551
You should be hanging out with you Michael Jones

1416
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:18,367
So Alex says the

1417
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,391
In the next clip that

1418
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,159
Jdl

1419
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,439
Stephen Miller

1420
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,463
Because I

1421
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:25,535
Everybody loves America

1422
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:28,863
The New York Times that very day she heard Stephen Miller

1423
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,167
These are white supremacist

1424
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:36,287
Egypt conservative Jewish guy that loves America unify us around America

1425
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:45,503
I guess your nationality

1426
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:46,783
But some

1427
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:49,343
I think they're going after him because he's white supremacist

1428
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,623
Nothing unites

1429
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:51,903
Quiet life

1430
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:54,463
Building a giant wall between

1431
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:58,303
United States

1432
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:01,119
That's that's

1433
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,143
Real

1434
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:03,935
F****** absurd shock

1435
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:10,335
Alex has Zach Voorhees on the show The Google whistleblower

1436
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,359
You're having this kind of a

1437
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,383
Show like you

1438
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:15,967
It's just like you having this guy on it's really f***** up

1439
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:16,735
It is

1440
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:20,063
It is so weird to me that we are dealing with

1441
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,111
100 year old Russian

1442
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,391
Propaganda and

1443
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,695
Present-day propaganda

1444
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,231
Mixing together at the same

1445
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:28,511
You know that

1446
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,559
That Protocols of the Elders of Zion

1447
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,839
And still being around

1448
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,375
While the same time all of this

1449
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,399
Is new s*** is being

1450
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:35,679
Pushed out

1451
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:36,703
It's bananas

1452
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:38,239
They're good at problem

1453
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,799
So there are Zack

1454
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,359
I think it's absurd for anyone

1455
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,895
To believe that there are any donut

1456
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,431
I don't understand

1457
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:47,455
I don't either

1458
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:49,247
I know that he says

1459
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:52,319
Explain why it's

1460
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:53,343
Yeah let's

1461
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:55,647
His argument is

1462
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,183
Is bad but it's even worse

1463
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:01,791
You know they're saying that there's a bunch of neo-nazis that there

1464
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,679
About how ridiculous this distinct

1465
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:12,031
We need to stop the neo-confederate movement in Russia

1466
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:13,567
Like

1467
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:15,359
Russia might be you know.

1468
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:17,151
Taken over by me

1469
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,687
This is what

1470
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:22,271
They're trying to say in America is that we're going to be

1471
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:24,319
Taken over by neo-nazis

1472
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,623
German

1473
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,903
Political party

1474
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:32,255
What is on the verge of taking over America

1475
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:35,583
So that's a huge slip up on Zach's bar

1476
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:41,727
He's trying to say that it would be absurd to say the Confederacy would take a foothold in Russia the same way would be absurd for the Nazis.

1477
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,263
Take a foothold in the United States

1478
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:44,543
What problem is

1479
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,567
The Confederacy was

1480
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:49,663
Not really an international thing where it's Nazism involved in World War I

1481
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:50,687
I supposed to be civil

1482
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:51,711
Yeah which

1483
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:52,735
Is a little different

1484
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:55,551
But the bigger reason this is a fuk up is because he's on

1485
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,319
Alex Jones

1486
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,087
The show

1487
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,623
Alex's entire Grande

1488
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:05,023
Conspiracy involves the same globalist to Rand communism and overthrew the Czar in Russia and installed Hitler it did little

1489
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:08,607
Really everything through history they were the Illuminati Adam weishaupt

1490
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,911
They're now in power in the United States

1491
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:16,031
Alex for Zack to mock the idea that a centuries-old group could possibly be relevant

1492
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:16,799
The present day

1493
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,079
Starbuck Alex is in

1494
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:18,847
Tire world

1495
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,127
This show

1496
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,663
Is it's very pathetic

1497
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:23,199
Endorphin self-contradictory

1498
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:27,295
Mostly because they're all just making this s*** up based on their feelings of aggrieved

1499
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:28,831
Also Zach

1500
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,391
The u.s.a. Zionist

1501
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,159
Occupied governor

1502
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:34,719
Receives relevant to this conversation but weirdly

1503
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:36,255
Never comes up

1504
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,791
I don't understand why

1505
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:39,071
Alex wouldn't ask about that

1506
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:39,839
Awesome

1507
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,375
Imagine if

1508
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:48,543
When the Confederacy lost they were just kicked out and a lot of them went to Russia and became a political party

1509
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:49,311
You've been yes

1510
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:51,103
Anil Confederate movie

1511
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:59,039
Absolutely take over Russia

1512
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:06,463
Joined the Confederacy in order to fight back

1513
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:08,511
Against

1514
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:10,559
The difference between like 18

1515
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:11,583
60 + 19

1516
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:14,655
20 is pretty big in terms of international connect

1517
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:15,423
Yeah

1518
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:19,519
So like the possibility that in other circumstance

1519
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:21,311
Chances that could have happened

1520
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:24,127
That there could have been absolutely

1521
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:28,735
Feasible on someone's slave owners took their slaves to Russia and

1522
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:29,759
Being

1523
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,295
Rich's s*** started

1524
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:37,695
Doing the whole thing of course it's not as laughable as he's trying to make it snow

1525
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:41,023
But I do think that the bigger issue is that what he

1526
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:43,839
Describing is being absurd is literally with Alex

1527
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:47,167
Good job Voorhees good job

1528
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,215
Bears

1529
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,007
Being

1530
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:51,775
Equivalent to

1531
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:52,543
Confederate sky

1532
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:55,103
Kind of makes a lot of sense

1533
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:55,871
Now doesn't it

1534
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:58,687
Alex's parents bought for the grandparents

1535
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,455
Great-grandparents

1536
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,223
Answer whatever

1537
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,039
It makes perfect

1538
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,575
Wow that's not true

1539
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:06,111
Alex's of the ATL or not

1540
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:15,583
The Holocaust

1541
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:22,751
Who

1542
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:27,615
Even rhymes with I'm rubber you're glue

1543
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:31,199
Rubber you're glue you're the best

1544
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:36,831
Come on man

1545
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:38,623
You can get a sense

1546
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:40,415
Alex is really freaking

1547
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:43,487
Like he got pretty mad once Zach

1548
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:44,511
Comes into Studio

1549
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:46,815
Like he has someone else to bounce off of

1550
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:50,911
And I think I brought this up the last time exact is on the two of them don't have good

1551
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:53,727
There is a real lack of

1552
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:56,031
Not ready for primetime

1553
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:04,479
He's not very smart is not very quick socially he is maybe having a conversation

1554
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:10,879
Privately he could bring a little bit more the table puppy

1555
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:12,671
Camera and on on bike

1556
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:14,719
And so the two of them just had eight

1557
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:16,767
It's tough answer when

1558
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:18,047
Alex is already in the

1559
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:19,583
State really

1560
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:22,911
Mad about Sacha Baron Baron Cohen in the speech at the

1561
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:23,679
ATL

1562
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:28,287
He's had these callers call in and really validated his anti ATL

1563
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:29,823
Is the direction to

1564
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:31,359
He's launches

1565
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:33,663
Isn't the yelling about how he's the Jew in this

1566
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:35,967
Is equation in there Hitler

1567
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:40,319
It's so far so far on the show we've had a

1568
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:44,927
What a total of four white men bitching about being

1569
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,463
Under attack by the

1570
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:47,743
More or less

1571
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:50,815
So earlier Alex said that he isn't

1572
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:52,351
I'm scared of the ATL

1573
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:54,143
You scared for them course

1574
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:56,703
And that always troubles me a little bit

1575
01:08:56,959 --> 01:09:03,103
Play something bad could happen to your ATL I'm not saying something I'm just saying that if you keep talking like that

1576
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:09,503
There's probably a word that we've used that's been associated with another race for a while you can't remember what word

1577
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,807
It is maybe we talked about it earlier in the day

1578
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:14,111
Azd IDL is getting

1579
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:14,879
That word

1580
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,415
It's a little bit worse

1581
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:23,583
What's happening is the 80 open sitting back of the Southern Poverty Law Center in 11 single then get away with it I've gotten away with so much

1582
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,703
And I'm just sorry that's not going to happen

1583
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:34,079
Yeah I agree

1584
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,615
Oh f***

1585
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:39,455
Dallas officer game plan for him

1586
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:48,159
I just can't believe it I just cannot believe this

1587
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:54,815
So we know that largely a lot of the ways that Alex deploys false flag narrative

1588
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:56,095
R2 mask

1589
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:59,423
Apologize for terrorism that's related to people in his

1590
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:04,543
Community the militia Community the white supremacist white nationalist

1591
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:07,359
Yeah there are ever a

1592
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:08,383
Acts of violence

1593
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:09,151
That are carried out by Pink

1594
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,687
Community makes them

1595
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:11,455
False Flags

1596
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:15,807
When Alex says something like you know the next step they're going to false flag themselves

1597
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:19,903
What I hear is Alex believes that someone is about to attack

1598
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,207
I never know cuz he

1599
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:23,231
He's done that a few times

1600
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:23,999
Times where it's at

1601
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:25,535
Swear to God

1602
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,559
I don't know if he's

1603
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,327
Getting a

1604
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:31,423
You don't think so either what there be crazy

1605
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,959
There's a tutorial

1606
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:34,751
It's like he in it you know

1607
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:39,103
Oath Keepers are are hanging around and he's

1608
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:39,871
Overhearing

1609
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:44,223
I think Alex is plugged into those communities

1610
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:44,991
Baby

1611
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:45,759
Can you get a lot of it

1612
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:46,783
Information from them

1613
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:47,807
In terms

1614
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,087
So just like blog post

1615
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:51,647
I think that it Borgeous

1616
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:53,951
Might be a situation where he hasn't insta

1617
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:59,071
Sexual ability to read the tea leaves

1618
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:00,095
From the rhetoric

1619
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:01,119
It's being put out

1620
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,143
And

1621
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,935
I'm going to have to defend it

1622
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:10,335
Yeah so I better get started now it doesn't really matter but

1623
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:11,359
Track ahead of time

1624
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:13,919
Let's say someone blows up the ATL headquarters

1625
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:14,943
Of course

1626
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:18,783
The Patriot

1627
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:20,319
You do this sort of thing

1628
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,343
Preemptively in

1629
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:22,111
Incase

1630
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,391
And I think that Alex

1631
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:24,927
That's one possibility

1632
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:26,975
I do think that Alec

1633
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:27,743
Sphinx-like

1634
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:28,767
To an extent

1635
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:31,071
But there's also the possibility that you just talkin

1636
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,375
And that day also

1637
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,399
Possibility

1638
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:37,983
That's what I'm saying I'm never sure like it you can get in your head

1639
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:40,799
This guy is over hearing conversations

1640
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:41,823
Indoor getting attack

1641
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:43,103
Text from his buddies or

1642
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:43,871
Whatever

1643
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:44,895
And he's like

1644
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:47,199
I know something's come

1645
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:48,479
They didn't get share the

1646
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:50,015
The details cuz I'm not

1647
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:50,783
Supposed to

1648
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:51,807
Not know that info

1649
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:54,111
But somebody's planning something

1650
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:56,671
I don't I I have to push back I know you're not

1651
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:59,231
But I have to push back just in case anyone takes

1652
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:00,255
Away like that's a

1653
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:02,559
Legitimate possibility

1654
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:03,839
That's a legitimate possible

1655
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:06,399
I think the only two options are Alex talking

1656
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:07,935
Is very possible

1657
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,471
Or him having a son

1658
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:11,519
The B climate is right

1659
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:13,055
In terms of the wave

1660
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:13,823
Peoples

1661
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:16,383
Moody's coming up on a really highly.

1662
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:18,431
Time with the

1663
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:19,967
The election season coming

1664
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:20,991
You have

1665
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:22,527
Qanon is back

1666
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:23,551
Now what

1667
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:25,343
I don't know if it's even

1668
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:29,695
I don't I don't know I do see posted I gave the most someone posting again

1669
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:32,767
Yeah. Dude got to read ice just got

1670
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:35,327
Kicked off Facebook

1671
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,095
These things

1672
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:37,375
Did r

1673
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:38,911
Are things that will

1674
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:41,215
Right

1675
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:44,287
The worst that I would say

1676
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,567
Is this Alex

1677
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:46,847
Views it as a Justin

1678
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,127
Incase

1679
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:50,943
Yeah no no I'm not I'm absolutely not saying

1680
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,223
That that that

1681
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:53,503
The Conspiracy Theory

1682
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:55,039
Is the case but it's hard

1683
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:55,807
Think it

1684
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:58,367
At least for at least for a little bit

1685
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:00,671
So Alex

1686
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:02,975
Next clip

1687
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:04,255
Ideologies going to

1688
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:05,535
Turn a lot of people into

1689
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,551
Wow

1690
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:32,671
I got an ABO working with Hitler on this one I would ask Alex to prove that claim

1691
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:33,951
Because

1692
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:38,047
That would be something I'd like to see you demonstrates that this claim if he's rushing out to break

1693
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:39,071
Cuz he knows that he is

1694
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:43,935
Could just reset when he comes back from commercial and never asked to demonstrate any of his f****** claims

1695
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:46,239
All I can do is really sit back and think

1696
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:50,335
Seems like a lot of the Jewish people that Alex disagrees with politically

1697
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:54,943
Happened to secretly worked with Hitler in WWII

1698
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:59,039
I do I do have a little bit of a tip of the cap

1699
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:02,367
For anybody who out-and-out defames

1700
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:04,159
The Anti-Defamation

1701
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:06,975
If you're you're really

1702
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:11,583
Talking Heads with locking horns swinging for the

1703
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:13,887
So in this next clip we learned the exact thing

1704
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:14,911
Thinks that

1705
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,447
Still alive course

1706
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:20,287
And the thing is is at Keating kill himself

1707
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:22,591
He was transferred out of prison and I think

1708
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:27,967
Probably living in some Island right now

1709
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:29,503
Bryson's

1710
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:39,743
Can't make this stuff up

1711
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:43,583
That Song Is Back

1712
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:46,143
Weird

1713
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:48,191
3 Charing

1714
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:50,239
It is

1715
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:57,151
The guy who's lied to me for years says I know

1716
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,431
Idabel

1717
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:01,503
Revisit that I hate that are

1718
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:07,135
If it if they keep calling us Nazis people who weren't Nazis are going to become

1719
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:11,743
If that was if that were true Obama would be a f****** socialist

1720
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,023
Troop that's

1721
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:13,791
Bulshit

1722
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:16,351
There's a lot of examples of people who don't turn into

1723
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,631
The things you called them

1724
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,399
Almost

1725
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:20,447
Olive

1726
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:23,007
People who are mostly

1727
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:24,799
Likely to say that they'll be

1728
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:25,567
Turned into

1729
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:28,383
Really already there

1730
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:32,479
Zach believes that the ATL is an extortion racket

1731
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:35,807
Okay court again the Jews are extorting Chris

1732
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:37,599
I've never heard anybody

1733
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:41,439
In in his defensive that or is explanation for it is

1734
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:43,999
Really absurd rewriting

1735
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:44,767
Of a reason to

1736
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:51,679
I mean it's an extortion racket like I'll come to you and let you make a donation

1737
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:55,263
Send to our organization

1738
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:57,567
YouTube largest video producer

1739
01:15:58,847 --> 01:15:59,359
PewDiePie

1740
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:00,895
And he ended up

1741
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:04,479
You know capitulating and then you know saying I'm going to

1742
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:06,527
$50,000 to the ATL

1743
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:07,807
Something amazing

1744
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:08,831
Happened when that happened

1745
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:15,231
The whole internet said what are you doing and it was such a commotion because

1746
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:21,631
Landry operation is $50,000

1747
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:29,311
Was all one about which one of these hate symbols

1748
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:41,343
Go to phone call

1749
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:44,415
The way he laughs at the end there is really troubling

1750
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:48,767
But he's also not being honest about the PewDiePie situation

1751
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:54,143
I don't believe this lady I was like Hey we're supposed to stop if you give us money

1752
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,167
Which is

1753
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:56,447
Bizarre

1754
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,215
Notion

1755
01:16:57,471 --> 01:17:03,615
Then eat at the entire internet did not get up in arms about PewDiePie making a donation to the ATL

1756
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:05,151
Neo-nazis

1757
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:06,431
And white supremacy

1758
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:08,735
It couldn't have been me or not

1759
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:10,783
Sleep aid

1760
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,575
Neocurly favorites

1761
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:13,343
People is

1762
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:15,135
Good God-fearing Folk

1763
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:19,231
Who for some reason decided that a video game streamer

1764
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:21,023
Saying anti-semitic things

1765
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:25,119
Is a hill worth dying on there was a bigot backlash

1766
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:26,655
And that's

1767
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:27,935
That's what happened he's he's

1768
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:30,751
Completely mischaracterizing very

1769
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:32,543
Important elements of the story

1770
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:38,943
That are really the capitulation was PewDiePie capitulating to the biggest audience

1771
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:45,343
It's amazing how they can turn a guy deciding to make a public donation is by way of

1772
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,367
As an as an app

1773
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:50,207
Overture

1774
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:53,279
I wouldn't give him I wouldn't give him too much credit for it

1775
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:55,071
Making that decision

1776
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:55,839
On his own

1777
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,631
Is capitulate

1778
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:02,751
Whereas him being screamed at by thousands of online neo-Nazi

1779
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:04,543
Is him

1780
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:06,591
Doing something amazing and retract

1781
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:11,199
Real real sensible stuff

1782
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:12,735
Who believes in Ozog

1783
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,039
Really good it's

1784
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:17,343
Engineer I don't know

1785
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:19,391
I know right

1786
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:20,415
Nothing because this guy

1787
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:22,719
I have not seen his work

1788
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:25,279
So we're done like with the

1789
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,303
The content of this Epic

1790
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:27,327
Episode

1791
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:29,375
An insanely

1792
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:35,775
Make it very difficult for me because on the one hand I recognize that the abl is not the same thing as Jewish be

1793
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:38,847
So when Alex is really mad at the ADL

1794
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:42,687
I don't want to say that that is directly empties

1795
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:43,967
Somatic

1796
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:45,503
Be very easily

1797
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:46,783
Construed that that's the

1798
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,319
The response that I'm happy

1799
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:52,159
And I want to clarify that I don't believe that there are many criticisms

1800
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:53,183
Can have a boat

1801
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:54,463
Southern Poverty Law Center

1802
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:56,255
Andy

1803
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:57,279
The ATL UK

1804
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:59,327
Tim have criticisms of all of them

1805
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:01,631
And I would not say that it's

1806
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:02,655
Intrinsically

1807
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,703
Anti-Semitic

1808
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:07,007
Disagree with ATL or bigoted

1809
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:08,543
To disagree with the splc

1810
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:09,823
There are fine

1811
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:10,847
Ways to do that

1812
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,127
My response

1813
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:13,919
To this and the way that this

1814
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,455
Carried out

1815
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:17,247
Is that Alex is using

1816
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,271
Very much

1817
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:19,807
Anti-semitic ideas

1818
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:21,087
To lash out

1819
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:22,367
At the ATL

1820
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,647
And the thing

1821
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:25,695
He's responding to that they're doing

1822
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:26,975
Has nothing

1823
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:27,999
To do with

1824
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:30,047
It has to do with

1825
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:32,351
Tamping down on things that are

1826
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:35,167
In his content

1827
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:35,935
People's content

1828
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:37,983
Avi hotel

1829
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,519
Like outright Holocaust

1830
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,823
So when you respond to

1831
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:42,847
Things like

1832
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:43,615
Hey

1833
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:45,151
This isn't

1834
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:45,919
Opinion

1835
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:48,223
Propaganda that is met

1836
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:48,991
2

1837
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:50,271
Normalize mean

1838
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:52,319
Stream up take the

1839
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:55,135
He's out of the history of a genocide

1840
01:19:56,415 --> 01:20:00,767
We shouldn't be you should go out on your platform Facebook that's not the government censoring

1841
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:02,559
That is not against the First Amendment

1842
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:03,583
You have a choice in

1843
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:04,351
In the matter

1844
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:07,167
When you respond to something like that would like

1845
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:08,191
This is worse than

1846
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:08,959
In Hitler's

1847
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:09,727
Speeches

1848
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,519
That is not

1849
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,799
Responding to the ATL

1850
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:15,104
That is an expression of an to Summit

1851
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,896
I was going to say we are not talking

1852
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:19,200
He is using

1853
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:19,968
ATL

1854
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:21,504
Not talking

1855
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,272
Think about the 80s

1856
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:24,064
No you and I and

1857
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,856
And he knows and packing

1858
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:27,648
Annie's callers no

1859
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:28,928
The ATL

1860
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:30,208
It could be

1861
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:30,976
Anybody

1862
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:32,768
It doesn't mean it doesn't matter if

1863
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:33,792
Batl

1864
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:35,072
It doesn't matter if it's

1865
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:36,096
The splc

1866
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:38,144
We know what they're really bad at

1867
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:40,960
The moment you say it's worse than Hitler

1868
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:41,728
And the thing

1869
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,288
Take the take the reason I want to make a clarification

1870
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,568
Because I think it would be easy

1871
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:46,848
To hear this episode and get it

1872
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:48,128
The

1873
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:49,408
Impression that weird

1874
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:50,432
Treating it with the

1875
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,712
The same like a memes

1876
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:53,760
Oh yeah I'm not

1877
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:54,784
Immensely

1878
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:58,624
Secondarily you have to look at the way that Alex is audience response

1879
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,928
It's to his discussion of the 80

1880
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,464
You coming with

1881
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,256
You know like larouche

1882
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:06,816
Publications about the ATL lyrics

1883
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:10,144
Well that's not good another caller who's like hey you should talk

1884
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,680
Michael Jones

1885
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:12,704
Would you have

1886
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,728
The audience.

1887
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,264
Clearly understanding

1888
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:16,800
Is that like okay

1889
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:18,336
You going in this direction

1890
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:19,360
Lights

1891
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:20,128
Let's

1892
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:22,176
Let's blow his mind with

1893
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:23,456
Real

1894
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,248
Hardcore Asian

1895
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,784
Somebody called it the laruffa

1896
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:29,344
Alex

1897
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,624
Obviously was sick

1898
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,392
Second only to

1899
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:34,464
Yeah and I

1900
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,232
I am fun

1901
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:39,072
When I when I hear all this stuff I'm left with like

1902
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:40,096
A real

1903
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:40,864
Troubling

1904
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,144
Feeling

1905
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,680
Because

1906
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:44,704
This is

1907
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,472
A

1908
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:47,776
Almost entire episode long

1909
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:49,824
Breakdown

1910
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:50,848
About

1911
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:54,688
Feelings of being accused of being anti-Semitic

1912
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:55,968
Responding with

1913
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:57,504
Some pretty antisymmetric

1914
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:00,064
That's because they called me

1915
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:01,856
The Medicaid turned him into an anti

1916
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,904
And then beat that

1917
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:06,464
Sort of repetition of something

1918
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:07,232
He's going to happen to

1919
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,024
That

1920
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,560
Is not it just really

1921
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:12,096
Doesn't make me feel good

1922
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,912
So we end with one last clip

1923
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:17,984
I think I think my biggest issue is this is

1924
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,520
Maybe the most

1925
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:21,824
A in terms of what I've heard

1926
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:22,592
Recently

1927
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:23,872
This is the most

1928
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:25,664
It's just outside in the room either

1929
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,200
Like cuz this

1930
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:27,968
Really

1931
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,528
There's still a bit of like

1932
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:31,552
Linguistic distance

1933
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:33,088
Little bit of like

1934
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,368
Ghetto code

1935
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,160
But sure but it's very

1936
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:40,512
Mad when you're talking about Sacha Baron Cohen speech at ATL event

1937
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:41,536
You say that

1938
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:43,072
Hitler speeches want this

1939
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:44,352
Steve-O

1940
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,632
Your

1941
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:47,680
I mean

1942
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:49,728
I can't look at that as

1943
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,800
Anything other than like are you trolling here

1944
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:55,104
If you're saying that seriously then

1945
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:56,384
You need to

1946
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,152
You need to read some

1947
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:03,040
I don't I don't want him to read those pages I don't want him to get any ideas

1948
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,320
On what to say next

1949
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:05,344
So

1950
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,880
It will leave with one last

1951
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:09,440
Alex gets another caller

1952
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:10,464
Little bit later and

1953
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:11,232
Michelle

1954
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,000
And

1955
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:13,024
He wants to give an a

1956
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,304
For sure about 4

1957
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,072
Sure

1958
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:15,840
And I

1959
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:16,608
Pink

1960
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:17,376
But this guy is

1961
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:19,168
Turbo Force

1962
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:24,544
Sounds very similar to Robert Barnes wanted to sell it

1963
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:36,576
Little bit about me I'm 245 lbs I work about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS

1964
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:39,136
Make a long story short

1965
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:40,416
A problem with

1966
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,976
I do have ADHD

1967
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:45,024
I was taking adderal

1968
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:49,376
Is energy-boosting properties

1969
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:52,192
Everyday

1970
01:23:58,592 --> 01:23:59,360
Turbo Force

1971
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:02,944
Really change my life

1972
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:07,808
So he's a he's a testimonial for Turbo forces hey mad this is

1973
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,112
So much better than abusing

1974
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:11,392
Adderal as if it were

1975
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:12,160
Speed

1976
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:19,584
River barge is talking about the licky legal stimulants that he was using in Call of Duty it's very similar

1977
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,632
Legal stimulants

1978
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:24,192
Really starting to think somebody should test with x

1979
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:25,984
Actually in turboforce right

1980
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:28,288
I like it better that this is just a thing that keeps

1981
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:32,640
Popping up with problems speed and expect

1982
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:38,784
I used to do Coke everyday and now I just snort turboforce because it's completely different

1983
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:43,904
Grateful when I go to the late-night party everyone wants to talk about ideas

1984
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:53,632
I'll take an 8-ball of heroin and we'll just go all-in have a good day

1985
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:54,912
Dammit

1986
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:55,936
So weird

1987
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:56,960
We're

1988
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:58,240
Not a good

1989
01:24:58,496 --> 01:24:59,008
Selfie

1990
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:02,592
So we come to the end of this and I feel

1991
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:04,896
Gross I don't feel good

1992
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:08,736
I worry about what the future holds for Alex

1993
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:12,832
He's teasing around these sorts of ideas it doesn't get better

1994
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:14,624
Doesn't get good from here

1995
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:16,928
Nope so I hope everyone

1996
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:20,512
