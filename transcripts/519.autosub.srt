1
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,944
Air Jordan

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,736
Knowledge party.com

3
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
Pray I have great respect for this knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,808
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
Fight.com

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Little bit about Alex

7
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,560
Joan

8
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,632
3rd and Jordan

9
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
What's up

10
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:15,008
My bright spot today Jordan is

11
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:21,920
You did get a new hoodie miskatonic University

12
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,200
That's a lot of crap

13
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,600
Takes me forever to buy clothes

14
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,648
Like I just never end up doing it

15
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,928
I bet the same clothes

16
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,696
Forever

17
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,488
And I've needed some new hoodies

18
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,512
You know it's winter

19
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,584
Basically wearing a sweater everyday

20
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,888
And so I've added some spice

21
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,168
To my life

22
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:47,520
This one I got also another one that miskatonic University

23
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,592
Antarctic expedition she wore a shoe

24
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:54,176
Of Madness reference

25
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,712
I got too much love

26
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,760
Crafted

27
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:04,160
You're golden dad decide on anything that I wanted to get that would be like I can handle

28
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,464
Some public and it's something that I like

29
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,792
Like I can wear this one would look twice at it but if it was like

30
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,632
Cthulhu or something

31
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,936
People would have to do a double-take and then they be like

32
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:22,336
Otherwise it looks like it's a college

33
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,104
Make that compromise

34
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,640
That's better than what I do with

35
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,968
With clothes what happens every six months I buy five different colors of the

36
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,248
The same shirt

37
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:32,064
That's not too bad but I think there's a lot of like

38
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,880
Decision paralysis that you get rid of when you do that

39
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:39,232
Yeah yeah yeah when you model your clothing choices on Calvin from

40
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,768
From Calvin and Hobbes I think it's

41
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,792
Solve the law

42
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,328
Problems

43
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,096
Before they begin

44
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,376
Yeah yeah

45
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:50,240
Because then you just like up grab the same thing this one's blue and the other ones

46
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
Feel it's a difference

47
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:59,200
Jordan how about you what you going to start this year they they just ended the gdq

48
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,272
21 they just ended Games Done Quick

49
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:05,344
It was a bunch of fantastic

50
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,392
Lot of good runs

51
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,208
And they raised over two million

52
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:13,280
Even in this kind of f****** year so

53
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,584
That's really really cool

54
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,352
It made me happy

55
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,888
That is that is a lot of fun

56
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,728
I'm still wishy-washy tiny bit about watching

57
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,008
Video games

58
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:29,152
I want to watch some of the people who put up like Mario maker videos

59
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,712
So hard

60
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,248
It's

61
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,808
Almost as levels are the people

62
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:42,208
That was one of the things this year like almost at it closed it but it was like one of the

63
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,792
Last four runs and they were playing this dude was playing the hardest

64
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:49,376
Like Mario Maker level that wasn't even Mario Maker it was

65
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,168
Hack music ISO hack

66
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:54,496
And the previous world record was like 35 minutes

67
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,520
And you didn't

68
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,336
18 Mile everybody's watching that just going like

69
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:04,736
Tappan man we just saw history

70
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,600
Part of my concern is that like

71
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,672
I think I might get to Intuit

72
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:16,512
People play video games too much

73
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:20,863
I can't do it I don't want to enter the territory last I disappear into it

74
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:25,983
Yeah it's one of those things where I've never like I've never been that good at platforming games

75
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,031
So they've always seemed like a struggle

76
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,567
Whenever I play them

77
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:34,943
And then whenever you see these guys playing it's actually a very kind of beautiful almost

78
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,735
Dancing kind of feel where it's like

79
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,551
Oh I get it if you just do all of the steps

80
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
Perfectly

81
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:47,231
Could you watch if you're if you're bad at dancing and then you watch somebody's good deal

82
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,303
For sure

83
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,631
It's not how it's supposed to be is the world

84
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
Fast food

85
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,215
F****** transition

86
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,239
You're great

87
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:04,895
It's a mess over here on Wednesday doing a little special middle of the week episode

88
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,455
Because we got to keep on top of things

89
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,735
You figure to be too much

90
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,271
If we wait until Friday

91
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,575
Things would pile up and they may be important

92
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,135
So we're going over January 10th and 11

93
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
Today

94
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,183
2021

95
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,767
I don't have anything to say about 21 yet

96
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,559
Nope we'll figure that out

97
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,607
I think

98
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,679
2021 I'm Dan and there will only be Lone Survivor

99
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:34,079
Snow pretty good today

100
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,383
This is no longer 20/20 okay

101
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:40,735
Now that's not good

102
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,783
But yeah

103
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,903
Episode interesting return

104
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,439
From somebody who's been out of pocket

105
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:52,767
For while all right there's somebody who we have not heard

106
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,047
Hide nor hair

107
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:58,143
Hide nor hair rose on Metro the expressionist

108
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:58,911

00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,495
What we'll see what happened here a hide or hair

Biscuits are a couple of cats

140
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,455
People who take care of them I guess we'd them

141
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,479

Let's start here on January 10th

162
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:29,087
Alex seems to be looking at the world

163
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,647
What people are saying I'm right about stuff

164
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,695
Aphmau

165
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,767
The internet really

166
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,351
Alex Jones was right

167
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,143
Is

168
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,471
Written on the walls

169
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,847
Festoon to people t-shirts

170
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,199
The Twitter and Facebook accounts

171
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
The million today

172
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
Honored

173
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
The fact that

174
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,647
Get all of this

175
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
Now we're getting

176
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,231
Only because I want

177
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,023
People didn't realize that we know

178
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,303
What's coming next

179
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,583
Probably nuking

180
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
King City

181
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:18,239
Experts be honored to have Jordan was right

182
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,079
Him directly next to for a good time call Clara

183
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,895
I think that would give me a lot of Honor

184
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:30,783
Yeah I know

185
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,231
What a prediction

186
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,279
I I think

187
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,839
I personally would never like

188
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:48,703
To be in a situation where I'm celebrating something that I said

189
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:55,103
Being memorialized in a way that I decide to call it fixed

190
00:10:55,359 --> 00:11:00,991
If you ever catch me Slippin and I use that term to be like my words are festive. Billboard

191
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,807
I'm not doing well

192
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,647
Things have gone bad

193
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,951
Screwing into the ground

194
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,071
Claimed on our previous

195
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,119
So that Alex has laid out the

196
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,679
The foundation for the antifa.

197
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:24,543
The storming of the capital I like I like getting people killed who have nothing

198
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,151
To do with it and it's your fault he's proved

199
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,479
Oh good good. Let me hear it

200
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,807
That's the globalist it maneuvered us to destruction

201
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,367
We flipped Trump in the area valiantly fought

202
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,671
Please keep the country sovereign

203
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,743
104

204
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
Apparently

205
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,679
2 out of a million demonstrators at

206
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:57,055
Whitehouse the elliptical the Washington Monument the illiterate

207
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,591
All the way down to the Capitol

208
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,151
Elliptical

209
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,199
Identifying

210
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,503
Showed up at active police

211
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
And then the police on the other side

212
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
Capital open

213
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,367
The General Public

214
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,159
That was very little violence

215
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,487
Very little except for a few people

216
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,351
Along with them

217
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,887
Some useful idiots

218
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,191
Video chat

219
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:24,959
With

220
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,639
The few violent events to then say

221
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,943
Capital was stormed

222
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,479
By terrorists

223
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,855
Quotes Capital has fallen to The Patriot

224
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:42,879
And quote

225
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:49,279
Narrative here and that is basically they

226
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,351
Antifa they started things I'll be provocateurs or

227
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
Are working with some other

228
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,775
The big tough guys that the skinny jean Folks at hired

229
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:04,895
Stuff to make us look bad Manda what's going to happen at the next

230
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,479
Well Alex is warning that there's going to be a lot more

231
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:12,319
He's basically at this point been like

232
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,599
But also I'm f******

233
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
In-N-Out

234
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,951
He was planning on going to the inauguration and now he's like

235
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,743
Hell no

236
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,047
PetSmart

237
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,583
Easy Street

238
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,607
Two-tone quite a bit

239
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:31,263
It's a doll icon setups in the future

240
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,847
Completely changed his tone the moment he got exactly what he wanted

241
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:38,175
And now realizes it's time to time to pick

242
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,783
There's a lot of other folks

243
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,831
Who are are coming out here

244
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,855
And

245
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
You know

246
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,903
Thera

247
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,975
Make it to my some insightful

248
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,255
Inciting claim

249
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,047
Alright

250
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,839
So you have all these left

251
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,375
The Congress

252
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,215
What's the moment

253
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
Ted lieu

254
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,799
Widespread civil unrest

255
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,335
We need to see

256
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,871
Some fires

257
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,919
So answers right to a 32nd

258
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:16,319
Clip of Ted lieu from 2018 where he's being interviewed by Chris Hayes on MSNBC and is disgusting

259
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:21,183
Of Robert Palmer

260
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:29,375
F*** you who do I call for fires and he doesn't actually call for anything he just says that if Trump fires Mueller

261
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,679
Call Larry would likely lead to civil unrest and protest

262
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,983
That's not a threat

263
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,311
The comment in stuff like this is recorded on Infowars

264
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:43,455
If some b******* this is The Logical result of what this person does their like see you're telling them to do it

265
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,503
God dammit guys your stew

266
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,575
So also Alex is founded antifa leader

267
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:52,927
He's going to pinpoint as the the villain

268
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
Of January

269
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,839
Who said we're going to go there and poses

270
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:00,863
Patriots

271
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
I'll show you who you is

272
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,687
He said it in d.c.

273
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,759
The day before the event in a speech to antifa

274
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,903
A day in advance

275
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:30,815
Then they drop

276
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,607
The charges on him because he

277
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,631
Did a good job

278
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,727
This supposed antifa leader Alex.

279
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:44,127
Antifa leader I don't know that means but he's he is somebody who's had some history involvement in

280
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,919
Antifascista social justice active

281
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:52,831
Sullivan was one of the people who was there and was recording the storming of the capital's supposedly as an independent journalist documenting history

282
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:58,207
PolitiFact reviewed is footage and there are some questions about her disconnected from the story he manage

283
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:58,975
H-2b

284
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,767
With him occasionally see me to expressing

285
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,071
Encouragement about what was going on around him

286
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,119
What is a far cry from the accusations

287
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,399
The people like Alex are making

288
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,935
As an independent journalist

289
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,519
Who agrees with all of what you guys are doing I would like you to

290
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
Continue

291
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,079
Storming the Capitol building

292
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:17,151
And somehow I'm the bad guy here what do you talk

293
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,431
The way it looks

294
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,247
Sullivan is a bit of a bad player in the game

295
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,903
He probably felt like he was doing an impartial piece of Journalism document take a Monumental moment but he didn't show

296
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,719
The poison discipline to actually pull that roll off

297
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,999
That's what it appears like

298
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,839
He said that some of his encouraging words were meant to help him blind in

299
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:42,239
Very well may be the case and pretend to be

300
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,591
I mean they will tear you limb from limb

301
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:50,175
They did have that kind of scrum vibe

302
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,455
To them from yeah

303
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,479
Whatever the case

304
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:58,111
It's nonsense to take whatever dubious Behavior selevan may have shown on January 6th

305
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,671
People Eater who is responsible for the storming of the capitol

306
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:04,255
That is what I would call A desperate attempt to scapegoat

307
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:10,143
I can't find confirmation that he's been arrested in relation to the Capitol storming but he is facing charges related

308
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,471
Do it earlier protests in Utah that is still going through the courts

309
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,031
As far as I can tell Alex is just making up

310
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,335
The part about him having charges and then being dropped

311
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,615
Related to this

312
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:24,223
He's doing that because of things like what Joel skousen said on our last episode

313
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,759
That is if the provocateur

314
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,295
Tours themselves get arrested

315
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,831
They'll be let off right

316
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,391
They're in on it with you

317
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:35,487
And that's just sort of building up that narrative but I I can't I can't

318
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:40,095
Into that still don't understand how they're getting around the fact that

319
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:40,863
Regardless

320
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,887
F*** it

321
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,423
Say antifa did

322
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,447
The whole thing

323
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:48,287
You guys to still realize that they only followed because it

324
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,567
What they want

325
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,103
And what you told them

326
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
Well

327
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:56,223
There's a couple of thoughts on this actually that come up over the course of this

328
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:56,991
Okay

329
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:01,343
Without spoiling anything hypnotism maybe info

330
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,719
You know I should have seen that one coming

331
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,767
Mass hypnosis that's what it was

332
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
Jets

333
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,815
So it turns out

334
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,375
Alex

335
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,727
Alex has

336
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,031
Trying to figure out a way to talk about it

337
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,847
I like come up with a pale but it's just a jelly bean

338
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,151
Nevermind

339
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,479
Alex is pretending hear that he's like proven everything

340
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
Everything

341
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:34,367
Is what does we got this manager and an unnamed

342
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:37,951
Fake militia that was going around there working with

343
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,719
Feds

344
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,047
We just finished right before the showing live today

345
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,607
False flag

346
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,167
A diva stage that was some other shadowy

347
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,007
Tomorrow

348
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,151
Comes out they can blame both

349
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,015
So he's got that this is this is how it goes

350
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,063
This is be the way that you

351
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:04,831
Explain

352
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,367
The fact that there were groups

353
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,135
That look

354
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,183
Almost exactly like

355
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,463
Your buddies

356
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
Yep

357
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:16,863
Yeah I mean you might as well just come out and say if we'd won

358
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,631
Happy that

359
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,911
The Patriots won and if

360
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,935
Since we lost

361
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,471
It was all antifa

362
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,543
Just say that

363
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,407
That was not us. Everybody doesn't like this

364
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:32,735
That's what we get it both ways come and going

365
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,527
Forward backward we get it

366
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,807
It's fine

367
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,903
Did the narrative here is being set and it's fairly well said I

368
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,183
Fake by Alex at this point

369
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:41,951
They like

370
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,975
It was

371
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,255
Was just these

372
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:49,119
Other people it's not

373
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,703
Not me not Trump's could pull some sort of

374
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,519
Visual and audio evidence of

375
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,847
Exactly the thing that I'm saying that I never did it solve the Deep state

376
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:04,223
Britax and rolls

377
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,783
Q is also deep state

378
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,575
How about Harrison Smith is he deep state

379
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,879
No but he wasn't actually even on air

380
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:14,207
Deepfake

381
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:20,863
That's a big deal whatever made that was good

382
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,935
Alex talked about that broadcast at all

383
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,471
Surprise egg

384
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,311
Deep State actors

385
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,591
In the form of

386
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,615
Q

387
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,895
Antifa

388
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,943
But there's another group there and that was the

389
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,711
The drop folks

390
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,783
Be surprised to find out what they were up to

391
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,599
This was meant to bring in

392
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,623
The point with the memo

393
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,439
Because

394
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,743
Football fans

395
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,167
Provocateurs trying to Riot trying to lead this

396
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,959
Trump supporters

397
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
Doesn't videos

398
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,263
We're kicking their ass

399
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,287
The cob

400
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,823
And try to break in the window

401
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,871
They got overwhelmed

402
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,663
So now the narrative

403
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,711
Is becoming the trumps people

404
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,783
Light off

405
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,575
Alright

406
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,623
Alright if you buy that b*******

407
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,647
Get the f*** out of my face

408
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:18,720
Forever I'm done speaking to anybody who's like

409
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,744
No that's what happen

410
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,328
Not only did Trump supporters not try and take

411
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,632
Over the whole f****** country

412
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:29,728
But they actually tried to stop the Takeover of the whole country

413
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,496
If you say that

414
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,056
To me I will never speak to you again

415
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:36,640
The constitution in America so much that they were willing to stand up

416
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,944
Fight against these malevolent

417
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,016
Communist invading forces like you

418
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,856
Anon people out and antifa

419
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,136
Protect the Capitol building

420
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,952
That they respect so much say it to my face

421
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,976
Say it to my face

422
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
Delta Force

423
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,704
All that we had lots of women were there

424
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:04,800
This was a fail

425
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
Volkswagen

426
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,616
Pipe bombs found outside with Mitsubishi

427
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,896
Hundreds dad

428
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,968
Cute art bleeding at all

429
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
2tarts

430
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,296
Hostages online

431
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,064
They didn't

432
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,112
Because the simulation broke

433
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,416
Down once actually got there in the real world

434
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,696
You didn't happen

435
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,976
A lot of the good Patriot

436
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,792
Optimal

437
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,096
And some Shadow Easton

438
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,888
Militia group

439
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,912
What we now know

440
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,936
So that's

441
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,472
That's quite a showdown

442
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,240
Yeah

443
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,776
Play The Showdown

444
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,312
Hellboy

445
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,640
People still doing that

446
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,968
I don't like that at all

447
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:49,856
It's kind of interesting that Alex seems to giving himself the green light to say that a lot

448
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,880
Yeah

449
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,696
A real

450
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,488
That he's like he's realized this

451
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,280
Is not profitable for me at all

452
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,304
Anymore

453
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,864
Great way to throw them under the bus

454
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,656
And you know like I can

455
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,960
I can maybe get some of the people back in

456
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,984
The same time

457
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,520
You know what

458
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,568
It's feels like to me it feels like

459
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,848
The relationship

460
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,128
Between Alex

461
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:12,896
And

462
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
Glenn Beck

463
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:20,320
In like 2009 but in reverse

464
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:23,648
Fox News

465
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:30,048
Being like I'm not Alex Jones

466
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,864
Not him

467
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,936
He's finally like free himself up to do that which is God's

468
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:40,800
And I think that actually works on some people like you saw flying

469
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,848
I can't believe Alex Jones denounced

470
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:46,688
Holy Cannoli 10 effective thing to have some other

471
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,040
And more extreme than you that you can point to be like

472
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,088
You know you hate that more

473
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:57,696
He's acting like the tide just came in and everything's moving up a level and it's

474
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,232
Unacceptable and I won't

475
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,280
Plucking allow it no

476
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,304
No no

477
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,632
After this storm

478
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,400
The capital

479
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,936
You know a lot of people heads

480
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,984
Some soul-searching

481
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,008
People ask

482
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,032
Difficult questions

483
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,176
And our conversation is going around about like what it would actually even mean and what it would take

484
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,224
Be together as a

485
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,528
The country again like unite and end

486
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,344
Alex is afraid of

487
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,744
About Truth and Reconciliation committee yeah I would say we're probably going to have to do something along the lines of the end of War

488
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,280
WWII combined with

489
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,048
D-BAT

490
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,584
Application

491
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,912
Something like a better version of that for all the white supremacy

492
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,520
I don't know if you know

493
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,288
Conciliation

494
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,688
F***** up if there is it real

495
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:54,016
If there were one hundred percent real one

496
00:24:54,272 --> 00:25:00,416
F****** decapitating bread and conciliation

497
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,976
Correct

498
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:07,072
How do I

499
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,632
You must come to communist reconciliation

500
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,656
MTV

501
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,936
And say you're bad

502
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,216
But once you do that

503
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,080
Following a tried-and-true communist takeover

504
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:21,152
I think that Alex is misreading a headline here

505
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:25,248
Brennan didn't say that there needed to be reconciliation

506
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,784
I found the quote he's talkin

507
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,648
I'll tell you that there can only be reconciliation with repentance

508
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:38,304
And I think the single most important thing that republicans in Congress who helped facilitate this widespread conspiracy theory that somehow the election was

509
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,168
And the most important thing that Donald Trump can do in those remaining 10 days is to stop those lies

510
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,728
A to persuade their followers and supporters

511
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:48,800
The president like Biden is a duly elected president of the United

512
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,920
That was said by Senator Chris Coons on Sunday's edition of Face the Nation

513
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,456
I think that Alex just

514
00:25:55,712 --> 00:26:00,832
Skimmed a headline that mentioned reconciliation and the host of Face the Nation whose name is

515
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,856
Margaret Brennan

516
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:08,768
I would bet that Alex saw the name Brennan and decided that it was John Brennan calling for communist style reconciliation

517
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,328
8 is

518
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,120
Infuriating to me that

519
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:16,448
That happened into that you're good enough to figure out

520
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,496
Exactly what happened I think that's

521
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:21,312
Frustrated what happened

522
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,712
Seems on brand 100% what happened

523
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:31,296
The host of Face the Nation are inside his mind

524
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,064
Terrifying

525
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,856
You're f****** Hannibal Lecter

526
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:38,464
Hannibal Lecter and he's the guy from Red Dragon or whatever

527
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,840
Cook though

528
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:50,240
At least I'm not good at it for frozen pizzas to be there I have no evidence that Hannibal is good

529
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:55,104
That's fair

530
00:26:55,616 --> 00:27:00,480
I mean you have to have some sort of town to cook a brain and eat it

531
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,248
To the person

532
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,856
Yeah I guess parrot with cat

533
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,160
Barns that comes in

534
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:14,048
Barnes drops by his entire appearance here on this Sunday episode this January 10th episode

535
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,840
Is that

536
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,888
Hey you suck

537
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,448
Is there to beat up on cue

538
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,008
And she describes it as

539
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,288
A psyop

540
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,056
Which I have some

541
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,080
Some questions about

542
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,104
This is the most

543
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,384
Dangerous times

544
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,664
In the history of archons

545
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,688
Constitutional

546
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,736
Faces

547
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,016
Did Franklin 18:6

548
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,808
Actually kind of

549
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,600
Did they want to impose

550
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,160
Spy a ramrod

551
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,256
That was heavily facilitated by

552
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,816
A psyop operation of qanon

553
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,352
Inagua

554
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,912
Infiltrators and instigators

555
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:56,032
The thing that I run into is a psyop

556
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,312
One of the things that really

557
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,080
Fuel.

558
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,616
Lately and unless

559
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,640
Like you're at least

560
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,712
Has been Donald Trump retweeting qanon account

561
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
Right

562
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,040
And Donald Trump himself giving tacit

563
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:11,136
Acknowledgement oven support write all of this because it

564
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:15,744
You know narcissistically feed his ego or whatever I have to ask if

565
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,048
Trump is running asiop on himself

566
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:22,144
Asiop on you Robert Barr

567
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,912
Obvious

568
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,704
Is the Trump is antifa

569
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,824
Oh s*** that's why Auntie that's who really f****** antifa.

570
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
At the Capitol building

571
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,688
If Aunt Eva inspired the attack

572
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,504
The only answer then

573
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,272
Is Trump

574
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,552
Is the black

575
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,576
Sure

576
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:44,928
You have those people there who were looking real mighty scary

577
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,208
You know

578
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:49,536
The capital we had the lookie-loo types of beer

579
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,096
These people who are maybe just there to take

580
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,120
Pictures of themselves

581
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:59,520
Sprite

582
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,872
They're terrifying in a different way

583
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,920
Yeah if you had the real

584
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,200
Militia

585
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,224
Framed looking

586
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:12,320
In order to explain this Alex has

587
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,112
Already said that this is some

588
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,416
Militia that's working with the feds

589
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,440
But now

590
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,256
We get to Pivot that over and like

591
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,536
That's what the Q people

592
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,816
Yeah right

593
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:23,840
Sure

594
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,632
That that explains everything

595
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:39,456
Didn't realize

596
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,760
We're going to go in now

597
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:45,856
Pelosi and grab the

598
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,672
And ensuring of all those experts all this was done for

599
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,952
Special Ops

600
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,232
Laptop

601
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,816
If you're online

602
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,096
Play the latest

603
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,376
What are the alphabet

604
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,704
But it tells you to go take over the White House or the capitol or whatever

605
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,240
You're being set up for

606
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,032
Just like Arlington Road

607
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,824
Go see Arlington Road

608
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:10,176
If you're talking about the people that pledge allegiance to Q being stupid

609
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:12,480
I would ask you what about General Flynn

610
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,016
And his family

611
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,296
Who posted a video of the

612
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,832
Themselves pledging Allegiance

613
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:23,232
Tequila saying where we go one we go all manipulating the Deep State into thinking

614
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,024
That the Deep state had manipulated

615
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,816
Believing with

616
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,584
The Deep state

617
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,376
Says

618
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,400
Bacon

619
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:36,544
Run this counter counter counter counter when you going on right now after the first

620
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,824
From

621
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,504
I'm so tired Dan I'm just so goddamn tired they also posted that video themselves budging allegiance to que onda

622
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,088
4th of July what exactly you think is

623
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,904
The difference between pledging allegiance to q and Pledge of Allegiance

624
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,208
Not much

625
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:54,976
Snow

626
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:59,328
Not much

627
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:05,728
Dissect that now but I agree patriotism gem go ask

628
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,032
So

629
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
Apparently

630
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,848
Drop

631
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,384
Apparently

632
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:19,808
I don't know if that's true. Other lawyer will and I don't care because they're

633
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:22,368
Ethical problems whether it's true or not

634
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:28,256
Like to be disbarred

635
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:34,656
Gear is Larry klayman free for this one you might be able to practice

636
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:42,080
I just love this we heard this before and I just wanted to because it happened again

637
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,360
Alex being like he works

638
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,896
He doesn't want me to tell you that

639
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,576
William Trudeau America

640
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,392
I make mistakes but I believe in humans

641
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,560
Vermont during this election fraud

642
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,120
At the highest level

643
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,424
We're going to put that out there

644
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,448
10 days op

645
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,984
Inauguration of B

646
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,616
You're not putting that out now you put that out a bunch already

647
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,920
Secret snow

648
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,688
Bulshit

649
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,736
Perimeter

650
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,808
Ethically not good

651
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,624
I don't know too many lawyers

652
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,416
Be like

653
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,208
Okay my client is the president of the United

654
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,744
Right I think

655
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,768
It's a good idea

656
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,584
For me to have a radio show with

657
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,888
That's good idea for me to Moonlight

658
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:44,288
Good.

659
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,312
It's iffy

660
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:49,920
I will say you know just looking at everything

661
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,456
Purely

662
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:53,504
Do you know take take morals take

663
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:57,344
Nearest everything out of that Chucky has him accurate points

664
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,624
That he makes

665
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,648
Tabac you in on which

666
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:02,464
A lot of people have been saying for a while

667
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,232
The first

668
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:06,048
He says he's not really one of those

669
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:09,632
He talks about how this is a brilliant psyop

670
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,400
Which

671
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,424
I8

672
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,960
I take issue with some of that

673
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,032
He has some other points that I think are are pretty good

674
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,568
Who is a

675
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:20,128
Brilliant disinformation campaign that is unique

676
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,408
If you look at other men

677
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,176
Boards

678
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:25,760
And posters that claim to be

679
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,576
Do not communicate

680
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,368
Do people who study

681
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:33,440
Disinformation campaigns very early on we're telling me

682
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,464
This was not true

683
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:39,072
Conspiracy theorist of people going down a rabbit hole and a random

684
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:39,840
Message board

685
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,376
This was showing signs of a c

686
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,144
Sophisticated

687
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:42,912
Disinformation

688
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,704
Psyops campaign

689
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,496
By somebody

690
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,288
With institutional influence and back

691
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:54,176
I do think there is a point to be made about how different this is than other

692
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,200
What things like

693
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,224
Sure like

694
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,016
Pizzagate got to assert

695
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:58,784
Point

696
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,832
And then it fizzled out

697
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,392
It's sort of metastasizing evolve into what they say

698
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,952
A bunch of other

699
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,720
Attempt

700
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:09,024
Doing something like this

701
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,888
Earlier conspiracy times

702
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,192
When you'd have people who would have these

703
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,240
Essentially like

704
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,544
Huge role playing

705
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,824
Things where they would do

706
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:28,992
No this is like an augmented reality participatory storytelling saying

707
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:34,368
It reminds me of Gravity Falls weirdly enough at the end of the cartoon

708
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,952
They had a little like statue

709
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,000
That was somewhere in the Pacific Northwest

710
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,792
That's where the show is set

711
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:45,376
And then a bunch of fans put together all of these Clues together

712
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:50,240
And wound out find wound up finding out that it was actually something that they had hidden in real life

713
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,288
My best little statue there and they found it

714
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:56,384
And it was a bunch of people all working together finding out all of these Clues to

715
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:59,200
Functionally the same thing is q

716
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:02,784
It's just this time there's nothing at the End of the Rainbow by Usher

717
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
Storming

718
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:04,832
Capitol building

719
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:08,928
There are some things like that are outside of the rounds of like political

720
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,464
Piercing propaganda

721
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,768
And then there are also versions that are

722
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,304
Conspiracy an internet message

723
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,888
Digiboard base things that could have turned into stuff like this

724
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,984
And made it into an augmented reality

725
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:26,336
I do I do think that that's fair I don't think it makes sense

726
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,872
Say that it's brilliant

727
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:28,896
Institutionally

728
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:33,248
He supported even argues that the main reason that it works is because

729
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,016
Kind of

730
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:34,784
Stupid

731
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,320
At the level of

732
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,600
The people participating

733
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:42,208
It's malleable and decentralized you can just

734
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,488
Everything can be anything

735
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,768
Which is why you don't

736
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,792
You don't want

737
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,560
Anybody Within

738
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,096
Institutional control anywhere near

739
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:48,864
Yeah

740
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,912
I think

741
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,960
What are you said that he had a good point

742
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,264
I think it was basically just remembering

743
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,288
This next clip

744
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,872
Talking about the element of it being like a game

745
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:04,480
And a lot of people have talked about that about how one of the things that makes it to Insidious

746
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,272
Is the way in which

747
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:09,344
There's like you're involved in this

748
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,440
Anyways that like their Gravity Falls thing was is actually a fun immersive

749
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,464
Experience

750
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,256
This is IA false

751
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,536
God carrot

752
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,840
If you wanted it on a on a pole

753
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,656
Some people catch Pokemon on the corner and some people

754
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:25,984
Find out that there's a secret conspiracy on the corner it's at

755
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,288
And barns

756
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,056
Is now talk

757
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,104
Talking about that

758
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:36,480
I'm about in warning about for a long time

759
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,016
And like Infowars

760
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,296
Perfectly happy

761
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,320
2

762
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:44,160
I guess ignore any of these warnings to the extent

763
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:48,000
But this was possibly profitable to see if we can exploit some of it

764
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,792
All just supporting Trump

765
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,560
So like

766
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,096
Hey let's Let It Be

767
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,376
But now

768
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,168
He's got to go under the bus

769
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,704
So I have got to be qanon

770
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,752
Let's say they were trying to

771
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,288
Something in the sky

772
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,568
That's what it was

773
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,360
Impart reality

774
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:06,688
A real house where something was hidden there were Clues

775
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,088
Pieces of wood Allpoint

776
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,368
You're part of the wall

777
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,392
And if you liked all that

778
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,952
I can't be a coincidence I must be something behind that wall

779
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,000
In fact it was purely coincidental

780
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,280
They were seeing patterns

781
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,304
It did not exist

782
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,864
Well what qanon brilliantly did

783
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,448
Was use the questioning technique without ever giving answers

784
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,752
Use vagueness and ambiguity

785
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,544
Appearing to get hospice

786
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,312
Pacific

787
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,336
Secrets

788
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:39,712
Really

789
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,248
Play over reality

790
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:44,832
Garage

791
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,368
Building

792
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:49,440
Found people if they told him it was a bridge

793
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,464
Building

794
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,792
Bought the building because suddenly there was a bridge

795
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,584
Overlay

796
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,608
To the Pokemon go

797
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,400
That's exactly

798
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:02,240
I know that they think that there's a substantial difference

799
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:05,568
Between what they do and what they're describing

800
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,616
And I don't think there is

801
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,176
I know that it actually there's a

802
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,992
There's a bridge in front of you and then you jump in the fall

803
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:18,624
Alex just tells people that headlines mean something he has never read the article

804
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,440
It's the same it's the same amount of space that

805
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:27,840
It's being demanded of he's the ocean of a vague about his predictions he gives you secrets that aren't really real

806
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:30,656
Yep.

807
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:35,264
Yep I used to like I used to have bigger tea

808
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:38,592
But now I just grind them every time we do this

809
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,784
So turns out

810
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,552
Alex

811
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,576
A couple of months

812
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,600
Back heads

813
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,368
Threatened

814
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,928
To reveal who Q it's cuz he knows all of it

815
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,744
He never did do that use all

816
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,512
Just a

817
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,536
Probably it

818
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,328
Attempt to get a tattoo

819
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,168
This conversation becomes even sillier

820
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,448
Knowing that he's

821
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:07,776
Pretended that he knows who he is and he can expose all of it

822
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:08,800
Because

823
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,824
Apparently

824
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,104
I don't know if you know this

825
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,152
Hugh

826
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,944
Try to enlist Robert Barr

827
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,224
Alright I hate everyone

828
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,040
And they targeted people who they thought would otherwise be

829
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,064
Potential Act

830
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,832
Good sources of

831
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,600
Support

832
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,880
For crowdsourcing

833
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,440
Support

834
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,208
Independent

835
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,024
Investigative journalism

836
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,960
Acculevel but above that were the Intel group ever with you

837
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:40,288
Because

838
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,824
Were you actually think you're fine

839
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,360
Fighting for freedom but you're working for them

840
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:44,896
Exactly

841
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:53,856
Okay so you are agreeing with

842
00:39:54,112 --> 00:40:00,256
Alex when he says

843
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,304
Are you talking about

844
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:06,144
Provide us the name you've already said you can throw them under the bus

845
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,216
Yeah exactly would you want it to

846
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,008
If you hate them so much

847
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,544
I f****** hate

848
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:17,152
Yeah they're terrible little bit of breaking news

849
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,688
In the middle of this broadcast

850
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,968
Breaking news

851
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:25,088
That's a police officer the Capitol Police who died by Suicide

852
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,392
Alex has decided to turn that into a

853
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,208
News

854
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:38,144
Police Department

855
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:43,776
The high-level suicide of the

856
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,552
Police officers death

857
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,320
2

858
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,624
A story where he is

859
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,696
Is said to have committed suicide but it might be a murder bee

860
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:04,000
Because he happens to be the cop

861
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:09,120
Who told the cops to stand down and allow antifa to attack the capital

862
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:13,984
So he's basically cast this guy in not in this role it's just

863
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,264
Disgusting

864
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,544
Can't imagine

865
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,568
Being

866
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,616
Like anywhere near someone who is

867
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:23,200
Affected by the Capitol Building like that without

868
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,736
Instantly

869
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,040
Being like does anybody have a template

870
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,320
For how to sue Alex

871
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:32,416
I haven't heard him say anything yet

872
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:35,232
Does anybody have like a Mad Libs

873
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:38,560
For the way Alex Jones is going to need to be sued

874
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:44,960
There should be like a a whole section on LegalZoom just hold the suing Alex for the

875
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:51,616
Yeah yeah yeah and Bill fill in the rest for you

876
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:54,431
Guys family I can't imagine what I would be

877
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,991
How pissed off I would be if I

878
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,271
You trying to

879
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,575
Wayzata someone I cared about

880
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:01,599
Do I just lost

881
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,647
Just please

882
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:13,887
Suspicious because he ordered a stand-down so f*** yourself

883
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,167
Who'll keep his f******

884
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:15,935
Name out of your mouth

885
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:19,263
I'm not even saying to do tonight

886
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,847
No so annoyed Barnes is still on and he thinks

887
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,383
That whole thing

888
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,431
Where everybody it was like taking the pledge

889
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,455
Like Flynn

890
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,503
It was all a setup

891
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,527
So they could get Atkins

892
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:33,087
Spira chry was right about that

893
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,879
It's a devil devil, covid-19

894
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,415
Where the

895
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,207
Go to take

896
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:41,279
Have they have them broadcast

897
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,559
Selves taking these out

898
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,095
Broadcast

899
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,119
Other people that they were take

900
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,727
Basically a future

901
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,591
And then try to motivate

902
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,359
Other ones

903
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,895
To become more and more violent

904
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,175
The goal was to feel

905
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,199
This election was

906
00:42:59,455 --> 00:42:59,967
Everything

907
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,271
Did this was the end of the

908
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,039
The world

909
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,063
So they had to take what

910
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,159
In frustration and fear

911
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,183
Were they would

912
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,119
Really one of them

913
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:17,887
To take action

914
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,447
How's that any different than Infowars coverage

915
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,495
Dni keep repeating

916
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:26,591
Inmyhead violence is not the answer because the moment he said

917
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:30,943
They wanted to make you feel like this election was the end of the world yeah

918
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:34,783
The only response that I can like I went red

919
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:37,855
There is flashing lights behind by Elijah's

920
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,391
No I ride you

921
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,695
Yeah but that's

922
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:45,791
People or run for the fucken devil and then

923
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:51,167
It's all civilization

924
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:59,871
No it's not it's not fair to treat audiences like this

925
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,663
Not the answer but sometimes it could

926
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,991
Part of the answer when it comes to Robert Barnes

927
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,807
I don't know I think just get get rid of that lice

928
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:14,463
You can't want to write moral off

929
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,255
That word specific

930
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,535
Just for the

931
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:20,351
Not infringing upon freedoms of speech whatsoever

932
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,119
If you

933
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:26,239
Say that before the election it's the end of the world if you lose it and then after the election you say

934
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,799
These people were trying to lie to you about that

935
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:35,199
You lose something you lose something afoot I hand I don't care I mean Barnes would just say like I didn't say that

936
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:38,527
Maybe that's true unfortunately you work

937
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,831
Look for news organization

938
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:46,207
News organization screamed it on air for

939
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,743
So I don't know

940
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:54,143
It's not even the pot calling the kettle black it is just both of them are the f****** Kettle in there just arguing with each other

941
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:56,703
Exactly

942
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:59,775
So Alex is now got confirmation

943
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:05,407
Who's passed away short hike ordered to stand down

944
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:07,711
And I don't know where you got the confirmation from

945
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:10,015
But based on the other news is reporting

946
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,039
I'm not positive

947
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,135
Gaston

948
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,951
No stuff we don't have to have sources

949
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:20,767
Most of time you and I are people asking us what's going on

950
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,351
Sources here

951
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,375
Magic torches are

952
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,679
We're smart people we live this Bob

953
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,959
You're smart I'm smart

954
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,311
I have

955
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,335
Confirmed

956
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:38,175
Capitol Police supervisor the one that ordered the stand down

957
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,991
Has committed suicide there's an internal Bulletin

958
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,367
Overrun governors

959
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,135
This is not

960
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,415
This is real

961
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:53,791
And there are more

962
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,327
Planet 24 hours

963
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,631
Looks like deep state

964
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,983
I think they're part of an insurrection

965
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,335
You actually bringing Marshall login to Saul

966
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,103
That's why

967
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,383
Detective shutting Trump up

968
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,431
Martial law

969
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,711
Will probably kill Trump

970
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:15,295
So Alex is reporting that there were four

971
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,831
Unspecified

972
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:19,903
Governor's Mansion that have been overrun in the governor's have been

973
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,183
Plead

974
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,719
Today is

975
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,743
The 12th recording

976
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,535
What day did you say that

977
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,559
Tents okay

978
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,351
How many Governor's Mansion

979
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,631
Alright so

980
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:35,007
You know what happened here I think I figured it out so this isn't

981
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,287
Like cute

982
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:42,431
Some kind of false reality

983
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:46,015
The president just got an internal Bulletin

984
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,295
I can't believe they kept that quiet

985
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:51,135
Because I haven't heard anything about these talking about is on the 6th

986
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,927
There were protests

987
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:55,999
Capitals and Governor's Mansion

988
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:58,303
And there were a couple of

989
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,839
Incidents where

990
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,887
Governor's felt

991
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:05,983
That's right yeah and I think that he's taking those bits of information that may be

992
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,287
He didn't know about until this point

993
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,079
And pretending that they're happening

994
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:13,919
In the immediate that's the only thing I can think of cuz otherwise

995
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:16,223
I would suggest if you're going to report this

996
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,783
For Governor's Mansion have been overrun

997
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,831
Deep responsibility to name the states

998
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,111
A little bit more

999
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,391
F****** information about it

1000
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,159
Yeah

1001
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:27,743
Yeah but it's not reality like qanon

1002
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,535
I was working with the president

1003
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,863
SeaWorld

1004
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,167
Not know why but the real world

1005
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:42,591
We're in the real world we're not the simulation

1006
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,479
To only worship the simulation

1007
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,783
Very sad

1008
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,855
Mansion

1009
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:54,879
A bunch of them

1010
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,695
They're using us to go into martial law

1011
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,743
They're not giving up with only

1012
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,047
10 days left of trump

1013
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,095
Because I want to repudiate

1014
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,375
Everything he did

1015
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,399
Before he leaves

1016
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,167
The story

1017
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:10,239
Does not evolve over there the course of the show it is dropped

1018
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,775
On Monday

1019
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:12,799
That makes sense

1020
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:20,735
So Alex is not jealous of q but I think a lot of people are saying that he's jealous of you people like

1021
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:26,879
Me I would also say that

1022
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,927
By the way

1023
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,999
Jonas Jealous

1024
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:34,815
Secure threat

1025
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,471
Co-op

1026
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,567
Don't believe

1027
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,943
So he could have co-opted them if you wanted to

1028
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:54,015
Sears in from a year ago talking to Joel skousen

1029
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:58,367
I was thinking I was thinking I'm just going to endorse it

1030
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:06,815
Because

1031
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,863
Sucking up so many good people

1032
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:13,215
Yes are you thinking about using Q like a puppet

1033
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:19,103
He did try that yes he did and it did not work no it did not

1034
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,895
Which led to him being

1035
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,431
More jealousy

1036
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:24,223
I'm very frustrated

1037
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:31,647
Gets down to the matter at hand he cuts through the b*******

1038
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,695
People who are out there

1039
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:37,535
Continue to crowdsource investigative independent

1040
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:40,095
Continue to do independent Grassroots journalism in the

1041
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,631
Seven separate from in divorce

1042
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,447
Continue to be proactive and productive

1043
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:46,239
Continue to support places like in for

1044
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,543
The model for independent information

1045
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,079
Any free press

1046
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:50,847
And Free Speech

1047
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,871
To stay alive

1048
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,151
That's what's really about

1049
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,967
It's about transitioning people back

1050
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,015
Yeah making them feel safe

1051
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,319
And not judged

1052
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,087
We're coming back

1053
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,623
Back to Infowars

1054
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,159
From Q

1055
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,183
Because

1056
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:05,951
Q

1057
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,719
I know if you know this

1058
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,023
Chinese operation

1059
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:09,791
Great

1060
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:10,559
Glad to be here

1061
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,583
Anybody part of Q

1062
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,375
You're part of a chai, operation

1063
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,655
Disowned Q

1064
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,679
In return to American

1065
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,215
That's right it's it's

1066
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,007
2.0

1067
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,591
And talks we have formal food

1068
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,151
2020 prices

1069
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:30,527
So we got real

1070
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:33,087
Broadside attack on

1071
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:35,135
Thank you I'm at Sunday episode

1072
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,927
And that's most of what it is

1073
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:40,767
It's pretty important for Alex to lay this all out

1074
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:45,631
Because he's got a disavow and get away from the stuff that happened at the Capitol

1075
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,935
People have got to take a fall for that

1076
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:51,519
Have people that are going to fall are going to be 84 already villains

1077
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,567
Qanon is now not just

1078
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,335
Some kind of a

1079
00:50:54,591 --> 00:51:00,735
Whatever it's not to the same Noah Ki

1080
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,271
Jealous of it anymore if they're bad

1081
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:05,087
And also apparently

1082
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:06,879
Some hired

1083
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:07,903
Militia

1084
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,439
Who's unspecified

1085
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:15,327
Can get away from that and now when we get to the 11

1086
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,351
Just Monday

1087
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,143
I really felt like

1088
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,935
Alex trying to

1089
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:20,703
Turn

1090
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,751
To the direction that he's going to

1091
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:23,519
To be going at

1092
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:26,591
I felt an amazing return to like

1093
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:27,615
This is Sophie

1094
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:32,479
Confirm elier this is like right before Obama got elected released

1095
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,247
Pretending

1096
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,807
Mirror days ago people didn't

1097
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,087
Storm the capitol

1098
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,135
Turns out like

1099
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:39,903
Yeah

1100
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,695
9 days left till the election

1101
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,487
And Tifa

1102
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,535
They're going to rule you

1103
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,583
9 days from now

1104
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,935
The globalist will be swearing-in

1105
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,727
They're installed

1106
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:54,751
Later

1107
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:55,519
Exactly

1108
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:02,943
Thanks kickoff

1109
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,479

20 minutes and he'll be sworn in

1111
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,879
The open communist Opera

And I fly from LA to New York

1113
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,511
Austin Texas

1114
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,327
Where's

1115
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:22,143
Shields and guns and weapons saying

1116
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:24,703
We own this country it is ours

1117
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,751
An extra coming to your house

1118
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:32,383
Because by day and by night

00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:35,199
The Clinton Global initiative on record

These are the graduate students and students

1121
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,831
Your rulers

1122
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:42,367
Most of them pedophiles

1123
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:47,743
So now we just kind of have a more extreme version of how he was trying to scare you about like

1124
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:50,303
Job Americorps

1125
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:55,423
Programs that Obama wanted to put

1126
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,471
Yeah it's just kind of the same

1127
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:59,007
Nothing it just feels like

1128
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,823
Did you just you just going to pretend that didn't happen

1129
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,407
I'm not going to talk to Republican about tax rates

1130
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,943
Cuz I don't care

1131
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:09,247
Cuz guess what is underneath that conversation

1132
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,527
I want to kill the left

1133
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:16,927
I don't give a fuk don't you dare talk to me about some program and its programs are done

1134
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:18,463
It's hard to engage

1135
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,279
Any argument

1136
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,119
It's hard to believe that they did it's really what

1137
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,143
Being discussed

1138
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:28,959
You want to kill me

1139
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:34,847
Now we need to deal with that and you have nothing like I don't understand why any Republican is allowed on

1140
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,639
TV to say anything other than

1141
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:39,455
We're sorry for wanting to kill you all the time

1142
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:42,271
Because I don't give a s*** what they have to say on laws

1143
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:45,087
I don't give a s*** what they have to say on

1144
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,183
Tattoos or voting or anything like that

1145
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:52,255
I think the issue is that the ones who do want to kill you

1146
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,023
Don't

1147
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:59,679
Feel bad about that stuff

1148
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:02,239
To talk about all Republicans only get to talk about

1149
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:03,775
Now they want to kill us

1150
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:04,799
Sarah.

1151
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:11,967
It's an interesting policy I don't think the video is going to take you up on this

1152
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,503
Speaking of media that

1153
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,527
It's failing Alex

1154
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,807
Texas failing himself

1155
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:16,831
And reality

1156
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,135
But the reason that he's able to

1157
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,927
I think try

1158
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:21,695
To pull off

1159
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,719
But moving back

1160
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,487
George Lake

1161
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,535
Just making you afraid of Joe Biden

1162
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:29,119
Is the keys just decided that

1163
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:31,679
Metal thing at the Capitol was antifa in q

1164
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,471
And like we tried to stop

1165
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,495
Where's the good guy

1166
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,543
Those are terrorists

1167
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:39,103
I want to be the place

1168
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,919
And they're the ones that went

1169
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:44,991
Stopwatch

1170
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,015
Trump supporters

1171
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:52,159
Say what

1172
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:53,951
All the sides

1173
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:57,791
How old is it is

1174
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,839
I tried to stop them didn't work out they were

1175
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:02,655
The ones who look like they were Trump supporters were just

1176
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,935
People in disguise

1177
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:07,519
It's no big deal we're still the heroes where the the oppressed

1178
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:10,079
Worthy agree Bremen Morgan

1179
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:12,639
Because they tried to make us look bad

1180
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:16,479
Yeah there's no moving forward until all of these people admit they lied

1181
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:17,503
That's it

1182
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:19,551
Best you like honestly

1183
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:21,087
There's no change to Alex

1184
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,879
Programming unless he like

1185
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:26,463
There's no change to those people listening to have unless Alex has to say

1186
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,487
He's a liar

1187
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:32,095
Laura Ingraham has to say she's a liar unless Lou Dobbs has to go on TV

1188
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:35,935
And save the world I lied to you because I want money

1189
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:38,751
Yeah but I don't think that even that would be that helpful

1190
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:42,847
Because maybe it would ruin their careers

1191
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,639
It's not going to solve anything but

1192
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:46,431
Nothing's going to change until they

1193
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:52,319
But I also don't think then we can start with others

1194
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:54,879
What's the first step

1195
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:58,463
Media figures have to have some sort of accountability for their b*******

1196
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:05,119
They're the ones I agree that there should be some accountability it maybe they wouldn't be able to work anymore if they

1197
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,399
I had to admit that they lied

1198
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,679
And that might be a

1199
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:11,263
I would just get replaced by somebody else who's Craven

1200
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:15,615
Eventually you have to admit your life

1201
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,383
Well

1202
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:22,271
UB40

1203
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:29,695
Going to enjoy your run enjoy it's going to be alright

1204
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:36,095
Gravy and tells people have an Insurrection what you got

1205
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:38,399
I'm sorry government and everybody

1206
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,167
We failed

1207
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,703
And allowed you here but

1208
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,727
This can't happen

1209
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:42,751
This can't

1210
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:49,663
Well I'm of the opinion that even if those media Figures were to come out and be like I lied cuz I was

1211
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:52,223
Make money or whatever

1212
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,783
It wouldn't matter that much cuz the audience would

1213
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,319
Ba disillusion Sage

1214
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:59,647
Just be like well I got to find someone knew this person told out or something

1215
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,439
And now it says the same complaint

1216
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,463
About the Q people

1217
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,839
Office

1218
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:08,607
Back and watch

1219
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:12,959
I know you folks are going to go away even once that happen

1220
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:14,495
Because you bought a new Ally

1221
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:17,055
Just like you said the Nigerian email scam

1222
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:17,823
1000

1223
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,919
5000

1224
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,735
I'll get a millionaire when I send

1225
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,783
Peekaboo the 5,000

1226
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:33,183
Appreciate everything you've got to the scammers

1227
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,719
You like your family for morning

1228
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,559
Move on from that

1229
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:41,375
Galaxy trick Brothers emails

1230
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,399
Wow

1231
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,423
He is right

1232
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:47,263
They will hate your family for a born-again I am aware

1233
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,543
That type of situation

1234
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:54,175
So I always enjoy it when Alex gets in reporter mode

1235
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:57,503
Many reports things were brought to his attention by his wife

1236
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,783
Tennis partner

1237
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:01,599
Perry hitting scoops

1238
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,927
Next clip we get some

1239
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:10,047
Second or third-hand information from somebody who works in security for Alex

1240
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,863
Heard something from his mother

1241
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,679
I know Alex is reporting it on air as news

1242
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,983
I talked to one of our

1243
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,031
Security guys that

1244
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:22,335
Bonded security armed security

1245
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,383
We have your mom

1246
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:26,175
Is one of the head nurses a nursing home

1247
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:34,623
They gave all the old people the shots and now a bunch of sick

1248
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,975
I just got the shop last week

1249
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:48,703
How many

1250
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:54,335
You're not talk about this until next week then cuz it said number could be zero

1251
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:58,687
Yeah oh no but then you won't spend the next week in fear of without number not being

1252
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:00,735
Yeah but it's so important

1253
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:03,295
Security guy talked to his mom and I heard this

1254
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:08,159
You scared of something that may or may not happen

1255
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:11,487
But I think I was probably only reporting

1256
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:14,559
That's because of the spinner this media diet

1257
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:16,863
Paul Institute website

1258
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,143
Is important

1259
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,519
And just began

1260
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,055
Institute

1261
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:29,919
Who's article is about a nursing home from New around New York called The Commons

1262
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:30,943
Saint Saint Anthony

1263
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,735
The most recent report from

1264
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:36,063
Cnycentral is a number of death stare at 32 cents

1265
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,087
December 21st

1266
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,415
Which is when an outbreak of covid-19 begin

1267
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:41,695
The outbreak

1268
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,975
Predates the first vax

1269
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:43,743
Donations

1270
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:49,375
Many residents and staff received the first dose of the vaccine on December 22nd and the second doses I weren't

1271
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,399
Be gone until January

1272
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:57,055
Interesting the actual line that Alex's might not actually be factually inaccurate but it's

1273
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:57,823
Still alive

1274
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:04,479
We may well be the case that the deaths began after the vaccinations started but the headline is being used by people like

1275
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,015
And like Ron Paul

1276
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:06,783
Suggested there's a

1277
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,319
Causal relationship there

1278
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:10,879
This story is not interesting to Alex

1279
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:14,719
Except as a means to convince his audience the vaccines are a deadly plan from the globalist

1280
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:18,815
So he wouldn't be covering the story unless the message was supposed to take permit

1281
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:21,119
Is that vaccines killed the people in the common

1282
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:23,167
And that's just not to

1283
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,727
Information is not

1284
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:27,519
They're to be reported

1285
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,287
Yeah

1286
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:31,359
But that's why you got to listen to your Security Guys mom

1287
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:32,895
Or maybe

1288
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:35,455
The security guy making stuff up about what his mom said who knows

1289
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:40,063
Spare for the possibility of

1290
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:41,855
Just not going to happen

1291
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:43,391
Nope

1292
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:45,951
I like to convince you even more of that

1293
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:49,535
I can't wait because I have got nothing but bad news on that front

1294
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,559
Because

1295
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,607
It's over for Humanity

1296
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:55,423
Thank you I will only be lone survivors

1297
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:57,727
I said it earlier

1298
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:00,543
Now that I got them over for that

1299
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:06,175
These people f*** all of these people Mike Adams Health Ranger

1300
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,199
Noted rapper

1301
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:10,527
Weirdo Ebola cure

1302
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:16,927
Sure that's true

1303
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:18,207
Cuz he had an approach

1304
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,487
To the pandemic

1305
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:26,143
After a while that was not good

1306
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:32,543
Go down to lot of people going to die if people keep saying the s*** that I used to say he joined up with Alex for quite a while in

1307
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,591
Doing covid denialism

1308
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:37,151
When's covid paranoia alternatively

1309
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,687
And

1310
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:43,039
Then they had a little bit of a disagreement and he was not seeing

1311
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:45,087
For quite a while

1312
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:46,111
Because now it

1313
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,903
It's time to just complain about Biden

1314
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,695
They're the two of them can do that just

1315
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:50,463
All day

1316
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:53,791
Tom

1317
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:56,607
Appreciate him coming on

1318
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,911
25 and Shane crazy agenda

1319
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,703
Joe Biden Kamala Harris will push

1320
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:04,799
The election

1321
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:08,383
Mike Franks were joining us what is your big takeaway about

1322
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,991
Boy come back next time

1323
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,271
I would I would have

1324
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:18,111
Expect if this is happening that the two of them should really get into him

1325
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:21,439
Discuss what their differences were and why he hasn't been on

1326
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,743
For so long but I guess

1327
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,279
We'll just pretend that didn't happen

1328
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,071
Let's pretend

1329
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,095
We didn't learn

1330
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,119
Who is right

1331
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:31,679
Because he had factually different

1332
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,519
It wasn't opinion opinion

1333
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,543
Because they were both make

1334
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,311
Making everything up

1335
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,079
That could be

1336
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,359
So

1337
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,895
Mike is thinking that maybe

1338
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:41,663
Trump

1339
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:43,199
Sure

1340
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,991
Maybe he doesn't want to be present

1341
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,039
Again not of America

1342
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,319
Maybe

1343
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:51,135
He wants to start a new country

1344
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,951
Narrow window of opportunity

1345
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:54,719
Does now but

1346
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:57,023
How is fraulino Trump may have

1347
01:02:57,535 --> 01:03:00,095
You may have thrown in the towel at this point and said you know what

1348
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:01,631
Swamp is too deep

1349
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,167
Drain

1350
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:07,775
You can't fix that in probably true

1351
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:10,079
To really fix America is to let

1352
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:11,103
The crop system in

1353
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,127
Quotev

1354
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,663
And Creator and then start

1355
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:15,455
A new system on the other side

1356
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:20,575
You may be thinking let's start a new Confederacy

1357
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:24,927
Kind of sounds like what he would be thinking right now you guys are

1358
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:26,463
Desperately hoping he's thinking

1359
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,487
Yeah

1360
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:31,583
I'm I'm kind of the I'm getting to the point where I'm like yeah

1361
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,631
You guys should

1362
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:35,935
Call of

1363
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:40,287
Don't know where

1364
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:46,687
There's uninhabitable places in Australia that have happened obuz alot of Republicans

1365
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:47,967
But you said uninhabitable

1366
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:54,367
I did mean uninhabitable and maybe they can terraform it we can send them to Mars and then

1367
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:56,159
Then we could move

1368
01:03:56,415 --> 01:04:02,559
I understand there's some of that elusive free market over there a lot of Manpower that were wasting that could be

1369
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:04,607
Beyond Mars leaving us alone

1370
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:05,631
So

1371
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,935
Mike is on

1372
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,495
He has a little bit of a Time window

1373
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:13,311
And that's because Trump is supposed to give a speech

1374
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:18,431
In the middle of when this episode is on it doesn't end up happening because it gets pushed back

1375
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,967
Ramen there's ask

1376
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:22,015
Speech for the next day

1377
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:23,295
Alamo

1378
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:25,855
Yeah it's not the Alamo Alamo Texas

1379
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:30,719
Sure it is all very confusing and it plays out over the course of this episode

1380
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:35,071
We did not have a city version of the f******

1381
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,607
Four Seasons

1382
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:42,239
It's not for sure because it's Alamo Texas is also like a Border Town there's a possibility

1383
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:46,591
That that still feeds into the messaging that I drop water slide

1384
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:49,151
The Border

1385
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:53,247
Time in public should begin and end with being racist towards

1386
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,527
Southern border

1387
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,295
That's great

1388
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,831
Also

1389
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,879
You would expect that he would want

1390
01:04:59,135 --> 01:04:59,647
To give a speech at

1391
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:00,415
Alamo

1392
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:01,951
Yes you would

1393
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:04,255
But just like you would want to give a speech at

1394
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,535
The Four Seasons Hotel

1395
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:06,303
Right

1396
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,071
Right

1397
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,607
It does seem like a pattern

1398
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,655
This speech

1399
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:12,447
Mike doesn't think it's going to be any

1400
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,215
Think big

1401
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:15,007
Trump speaking about

1402
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:22,943
Isis

1403
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:23,967
It's going to be

1404
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:24,991
Kind of wishy-washy

1405
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:27,039
Because you still got

1406
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:29,087
In a week or more

1407
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:32,415
In office and he

1408
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,231
Happened so I suspect

1409
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:37,279
She's not going to concede but he's also not good

1410
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,047
Can I come in

1411
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:40,607
Feel sad I'm sad to say but but we'll have to wait and see

1412
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:44,447
He doesn't need to concede and he's already accepted that he's lost

1413
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:45,471
So

1414
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,031
I

1415
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:50,591
Don't care what he does

1416
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:51,615
At all

1417
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:56,479
Mike doesn't want

1418
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:58,527
Be quiet it that's Mike Pompeo

1419
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:01,599
No he should absolutely be quieted

1420
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,439
Mike Pompeo to

1421
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:10,815
Cease a bunch of urls

1422
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:15,679
Define as long as the other Wi-Fi connection

1423
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,215
Vacancies

1424
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:19,519
Amazon know if I want that

1425
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,311
I do want to mention Alex's that

1426
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:23,103
A secretary of state

1427
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:23,871
Pompeo

1428
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:25,407
Has a move that he could make

1429
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,431
Right now

1430
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,479
Back against this big check

1431
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:31,295
Platforming of conservative

1432
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:32,831
Individual

1433
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,927
To seize the domain names

1434
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:39,231
Amazon.com google.com

1435
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,511
Book.com YouTube

1436
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,279
Twitter

1437
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:43,071
Seize the domain names

1438
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,095
And

1439
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:45,887
Charge those companies with

1440
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,703
As part of a foreign

1441
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:50,239
Cyber warfare attack

1442
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:52,543
On the United States of America

1443
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:58,687
Not go well I think I think that's a good idea I think people would respond positively towards that

1444
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:00,223
I think it would give everybody p

1445
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:02,783
Peace of mind

1446
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:06,879
Happy Government website

1447
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:09,951
As a hostile action I think that's good

1448
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:16,351
Is 9 days before April election is supposed to go out of office

1449
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,119
His date

1450
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,399
Department is attacking

1451
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:19,679
I'll be good

1452
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:23,007
Maybe awesome I'm liking everything Pompeo

1453
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,287
Right now it's really great

1454
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,823
I love the way he's trying to

1455
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,127
To convince people that it'd be a good idea for him to

1456
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,479
Micah Adams

1457
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:37,087
Might not have gotten the memo that I would save qanon now

1458
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:39,391
Because he's coming in with some kyusha

1459
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:43,231
He's got material that he could declassify wheat we know they have

1460
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:45,791
Sidney Powell routinely spoke about

1461
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:46,815
The information

1462
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:48,863
Details from

1463
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,911
305th military intelligence

1464
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:52,959
Wasn't

1465
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:54,239
That wasn't just fiction

1466
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:59,359
So Sidney Powell submitted information in an affidavit that was supposed to be provided by an anonymous source

1467
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:01,919
The chief codename spider with a y

1468
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:07,295
Unfortunately she did a bad job of redacting her document so she accidentally docster source

1469
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:09,855
Who's a consultant named Joshua Merritt

1470
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:12,159
He claimed to be in the military intelligence

1471
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:15,743
So working in the 300 fifth Battalion but that's all bulshit

1472
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:21,631
Merritt was never an intelligence analyst and didn't even make it through the appropriate training courses in the army

1473
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:25,471
When confronted about this statement and the fact that it's clearly not true

1474
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:31,871
He basically said that he hadn't really read the statement he signed before signing it which raises a whole lot of questions about who in Powell's Team bro

1475
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:36,479
Does that mean that you isn't that a

1476
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:37,503
Service

1477
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,807
Barn door or something

1478
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,831
Open contempt

1479
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:44,927
Put people in jail in on Lori's at the

1480
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:47,487
Does 305th Battalion nickname the Kraken

1481
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:52,863
Hydrated the server host in Germany than they've seized bunch of evidence of election fraud and prove his

1482
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:54,399
Like CIA was involved and s***

1483
01:08:54,911 --> 01:09:00,287
This naturally all traces back to a Facebook post by some random qanon follower making s*** up

1484
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:03,871
That's the story that Powell's affidavit was look

1485
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:04,639
Going to reinforce

1486
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:08,991
By way of assigning a story to a meant to be an autonomous person in Military Intelligence

1487
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:12,831
The story is s*** when you know that it's just coming from a Cuban on

1488
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:13,855
Facebook account

1489
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:16,927
If you can pretend that there's some real deep inside or named spider

1490
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:18,975
You can make more people like Mike Adams

1491
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:19,743
Buy it

1492
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:26,399
Anyway the point here is the people like Alex in like what whatever benefit they can derive from believing the same stuff that Q followers do

1493
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:30,495
And they want to use the same sources of information that you and Autumn people do

1494
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:32,799
But they want to pretend that they're somehow above it

1495
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:33,823
And it is pathetic

1496
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:36,895
Yeah the only people

1497
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:39,199
Tweeting like I can't believe Alex turned on cue

1498
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:42,271
Believe it

1499
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:48,159
But also what we should be doing is showing as much division between the two is possible

1500
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:51,743
While recognizing that both of them are complete Liars

1501
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:52,767
And full of s***

1502
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:56,095
Q people and info Warriors

1503
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,375
To fight on the street

1504
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:59,167
And they will almero

1505
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:01,471
The exact you don't have to do anything

1506
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:04,031
For them to end up at loggerheads

1507
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,823
No but it'd be fun to Fan the Flames a little

1508
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,639
It's interesting because it really

1509
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:10,687
We felt like there was an opportunity

1510
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:12,735
After the six

1511
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:14,271
Where they could

1512
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,831
Get past whatever differences they had

1513
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:19,135
But instead it

1514
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,927
Seems like there is now an Arab

1515
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:21,695
Bookaboo

1516
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,231
Different

1517
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:27,327
So you would think that until next week when they all decide that there is no

1518
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,607
Prince between em and adults

1519
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,911
Could end up

1520
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,959
Finding like common ground but

1521
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:36,799
I don't think Alex impure going to die going down that road

1522
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,335
Mike

1523
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:41,407
He's he's learned that to some hackers

1524
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,687
Some liberal hackers

1525
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:44,991
Sure have gotten all the data from

1526
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:48,831
From everybody who's ever done anything with parlor

1527
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:50,367
Be worried about that the I bet

1528
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:54,207
There is credible information coming out today that then left wing

1529
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:57,535
Blackhat cyber hackers have been able to hack through the

1530
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,303
Application

1531
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,071
System

1532
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:02,655
Ephesians light app downloading

1533
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:05,727
Enormous amounts of data

1534
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,263
Parler users

1535
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,543
Perhaps including the

1536
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:12,127
Another driver's licenses in metadata location

1537
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,919
If people had uploaded

1538
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:15,199
Story right now

1539
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:17,503
I've been getting up from multiple sources

1540
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:23,647
It's my understanding reading up on this that this is not accurate at all this is an exaggeration of what happened

1541
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:26,207
Yeah and it's just what people had posted

1542
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:28,255
On parlor people

1543
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:29,023
The Archives

1544
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:32,351
Not that you had access to all the peoples

1545
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:34,399
Driver's licenses

1546
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,167
Church

1547
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:38,495
I did try to sign up for a parlor account because I wanted

1548
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:40,031
To follow people like Alex

1549
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:42,079
Those kind of requirements

1550
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,871
Fox now

1551
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:45,919
Absolutely not no why would I

1552
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:51,295
SeaWorld Nazi why would you give somebody your driver's license

1553
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:56,671
Insane yeah it's like the same people who are all up in arms about like gun registration

1554
01:11:56,927 --> 01:12:00,511
See also the picture of my driver's license to get a place where I can

1555
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:02,047
Tweet by Wiggly

1556
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:07,423
Justin same I understand why there would be fearing concern about that but by understanding

1557
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:11,007
The point of recording this episode

1558
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:13,823
Is that that is a deep embellished

1559
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:15,103
And I think

1560
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:17,919
Resume that works really well for someone like Mike

1561
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:20,735
Is it allows them to talk about this kind of

1562
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:24,831
They are going to go door-to-door there are going to be death-squad

1563
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:29,695
Under a biden-harris Administration literally a carryout

1564
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:31,231
Genocide against conservatives

1565
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:31,999
Crossamerica

1566
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:37,887
So because they took all the information from parlor they got all the addresses of everybody now Biden

1567
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:40,447
I'm going to take antifa and they're going to go door-to-door

1568
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:42,239
Squatting

1569
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:46,591
Is bad

1570
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:47,871
What happened on the

1571
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,431
According to Alex

1572
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:51,967
And

1573
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:54,271
Antifa

1574
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:59,135
Well everything until that point was good though

1575
01:12:59,391 --> 01:12:59,903
Now

1576
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:00,927
If you don't want that

1577
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:03,999
I I would say

1578
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:07,839
You would not use inflammatory language towards your political opponent

1579
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:10,911
But if you did want that to happen

1580
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:15,775
You might say that your political opponents were planning on murdering you

1581
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:17,055
Haha

1582
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,335
You know

1583
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:23,711
I'm not saying that he's he's a medic I didn't say that he just said hey we should go storm the Capitol building

1584
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:25,503
But if I was

1585
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:28,063
Somebody who believe things like say that

1586
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:30,879
Biden and Kamala Harris will be sending death-squad

1587
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:33,183
To my house

1588
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:39,583
Maybe what I need to do is get a bunch of friends together you've arrived

1589
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:43,167
The thesis of my

1590
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:44,959
Neighbor

1591
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:48,031
It's only five

1592
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:49,567
I'm just a little tense

1593
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:51,103
I understand

1594
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:56,479
And it's weird because like you could hear a lot of the stuff that they're talking about and be like

1595
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:58,527
Do you not

1596
01:13:58,783 --> 01:13:59,295
Recognized

1597
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:00,063
What like

1598
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:02,111
What world were living in now

1599
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:04,927
This could have been on his show with Mike

1600
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:06,463
2010

1601
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:09,535
Absolutely and I've got a contact

1602
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:14,143
In Maryland

1603
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:14,911
Today

1604
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:20,799
They are setting up the FEMA operation there in in Maryland

1605
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:21,567
Specific

1606
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:27,455
Operation call and confirm

1607
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:29,759
Caring for gun confiscation

1608
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:33,855
Yep that they are setting it all up

1609
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:35,391
This this is

1610
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,159
We're back

1611
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:37,183
We're back to this

1612
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:40,255
We talked a bunch

1613
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,023
Over the years

1614
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:44,607
About taking them off the air and whether or not

1615
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:46,399
This needs to be taken off the air immediately

1616
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:52,799
Immediately it's because that is the exact kind of insight

1617
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,591
People towards the sort of behavior children

1618
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:57,151
That we saw last week

1619
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,175
Immediate

1620
01:14:58,431 --> 01:15:00,735
It's so intentional

1621
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,527
It's absolutely intense

1622
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:07,903
If you are very clearly setting the stage for another of the same thing that you're pretending you didn't f***

1623
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:09,439
Do you want in the first place

1624
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:10,719
Need to be off the air a media

1625
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:14,815
I mean let's go let's go back to the terrorist

1626
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:15,583
You know it

1627
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:19,679
It's not it's it doesn't work if you let everything go back to normal you've got a

1628
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:20,447
Return to the

1629
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:22,239
The temperature back up

1630
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:23,519
Yeah pretty quickly

1631
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:26,591
Yeah that's what we're seeing here we're seeing the exact same things

1632
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:28,383
But Alex always does

1633
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:30,175
Just as if as if

1634
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,711
That event didn't happen

1635
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:33,247
To Alec

1636
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:41,951
It wasn't the natural they're going to put us in

1637
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:46,559
Kabza Go door-to-door and Kill out the absolute absolutely am not at least

1638
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:47,327
Partially

1639
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:50,399
Responsible for the death of multiple people

1640
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:55,519
Selena Alex Jones about because together

1641
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:56,799
Cast of The Deep state

1642
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,103
He's

1643
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:00,895
Absolutely directly

1644
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:03,967
Partially responsible for the deaths of all of those

1645
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:04,735
People no no no

1646
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:11,135
Clear about this we don't want any violence

1647
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:16,255
It reiterated everybody here you know

1648
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,791
Never initiate violence

1649
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:23,167
We always have the right to self-defense to f*** you

1650
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,703
Is there a general

1651
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,799
They must be home

1652
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:32,383
I hope the Trump will announce shortly although I doubt it but I hope

1653
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:37,759
We are in a state of War we are now enemy occupied territory and the

1654
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:39,039
Every

1655
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:40,831
Every American citizen

1656
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:41,855
To defend the Republic

1657
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:45,439
I hope that's what he says but I don't think he will

1658
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:52,863
The generals that are running that are ours

1659
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,423
Defensive defense

1660
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:04,127
Inoculations are trying to push

1661
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:06,175
Martial law

1662
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:13,855
I'm not about to keep I'm not about offense but all defense is actually are all offenses really actually defense

1663
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:17,951
Violence offensively but all violence will be justified

1664
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:22,303
I am challenging the health Ranger to a fight

1665
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:27,167
No no no no stop stop

1666
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:29,215
I will not sponsor this right

1667
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:34,335
Believe that this is

1668
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:35,615
Is this like

1669
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:40,991
From a 2 years ago they recognized

1670
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:45,343
Look at it doesn't feel like they're living in a world where people

1671
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,111
Just

1672
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:48,927
Stormed the f****** Capitol building

1673
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:52,511
I mean you either have to

1674
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:54,303
To completely lie to yourself or your complete

1675
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:57,375
I think it's the ladder

1676
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,143
It's just

1677
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,935
Like that's just s***

1678
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:01,983
That you can't we can't have this

1679
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:04,799
They're they're doing it again that's outrageous

1680
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:08,127
I feel like I'm losing my mind yeah I know

1681
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:12,479
Mike down for this cuz you're going to feel like you're losing your out

1682
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:16,063
You're going to feel like you're losing your mind about tomorrow

1683
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:19,391
Yeah it is really happening in the anyway you can survive it because

1684
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:21,183
Cuz perhaps about 10% of the human

1685
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:21,951
Population

1686
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,487
We'll make it through is you have

1687
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:24,255
Have to be

1688
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:25,791
Entirely self-reliant

1689
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:27,071
Off the Grid

1690
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:27,839
As possible

1691
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:30,399
You need to be able to grow your own food and today

1692
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:31,423
Defend yourself

1693
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:33,215
And and then

1694
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:35,775
Survive the onslaught of the mass

1695
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:37,567
Illegal immigration that's coming

1696
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:40,383
The troops the Chinese troops are going to invade at some

1697
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:42,431
The government

1698
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:47,807
The Titans going to unleash against America

1699
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:50,879
Helpers that there visiting helpers that's right

1700
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:52,415
That's right

1701
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:55,999
Churches just like comments

1702
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,279
Try to burn down the churches

1703
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:59,583
Arrest the pastors who don't go along

1704
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:01,631
With the globalist agenda so

1705
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:03,679
If your pastor is

1706
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:05,471
Truly teaching the word of Christ

1707
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,263
He or she will be under attack

1708
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:08,287
If there

1709
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:11,103
They will be allowed

1710
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:11,871
2xist

1711
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:16,735
Churches underground farming everybody needs to understand now

1712
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:19,039
We're losing the country we're going under long-term

1713
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,575
Pablos occupation

1714
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:22,367
Republicans didn't know what hit him

1715
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:23,903
Gorilla

1716
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:31,327
Is going to be a very big thing smuggling seeds marijuana growing tomatoes growing pumpkins

1717
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,863
Growing squash growing

1718
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,655
Everything's going to be under the radar

1719
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,703
Including money

1720
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:38,495
By the way because the dollar will collapse

1721
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:41,311
Money will move to Alternative systems including

1722
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:47,199
They're coming to kill you

1723
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:54,111
Redbox

1724
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:57,439
I don't know how you could behave in this way after

1725
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:59,487
After an event like

1726
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:01,279
What we saw I just don't

1727
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:03,327
I don't know how you can

1728
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,351
Allow yourself

1729
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:05,119
To behave.

1730
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:11,263
I'm just reminding myself of something that the

1731
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:14,336
The great thinker Robert Barnes

1732
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,104
BoBoiBoy

1733
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,128
Which is that

1734
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:22,528
They made these people feel like that election was the end of the world most important

1735
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:26,880
Thing that ever happened since that's how they convinced remember when Q was talking about

1736
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:32,256
Smuggling covid-19 remember all of those things being very important

1737
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:35,584
Just a short. Of time ago it's almost

1738
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:36,864
Jarring

1739
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:40,704
Yeah I don't I mean I'd I just genuinely don't know how to

1740
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:43,264
I'm shaking

1741
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:46,336
Inconstant

1742
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:51,456
Motion something needs to happen I can't right now I'm listening to him speak

1743
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:52,224
I don't like

1744
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,528
How much is a flight to punch Robert Barnes and

1745
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:58,368
In the face punch Mike Adams

1746
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:00,160
Okay

1747
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,440
Put them in a line

1748
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:03,744
Alright alright alright

1749
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:06,304
Look I know that you're frustrated with Mike

1750
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,120
But I just he just told me

1751
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:10,912
But only 10%

1752
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:13,216
Weco he's right they should go underground

1753
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:14,496
Alright

1754
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:15,264
Dig

1755
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,800
A giant hole beneath

1756
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:18,848
Toyota Mall in there

1757
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,408
And then just closing

1758
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:27,808
Oh and then the people will

1759
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:31,648
The morlocks will rise once more

1760
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:34,720
You might be mad at Mike but this is the last time maybe

1761
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:37,024
The he'll ever be able to come on in for work

1762
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:39,072
Mike Adams you're dead-on we are not

1763
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:40,608
Exaggerating one

1764
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:41,632
Santelli

1765
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:42,656
Worse

1766
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,704
And you even said worse than I could describe

1767
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,984
I just won't lie to the public

1768
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,264
This is the Megaton

1769
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:49,312
This is the biggest all people better get

1770
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:51,872
Absolutely

1771
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:53,152
Could just say on a personal note

1772
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:57,760
Because for all we know this may be the last time I can ever even appear on your show who knows

1773
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:59,552
But on a personal note Alex

1774
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:02,880
In the world

1775
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:03,648
Can have

1776
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:05,696
Just an inkling of an understanding

1777
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:06,976
Personal sacrifice

1778
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:08,000
Price that you have made

1779
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:11,072
In order to continue to express your voice and

1780
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:12,608
For Humanity

1781
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,144
And Trump has made

1782
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,680
Other than the greatest soccer

1783
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,472
Debrox

1784
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:19,008
Remember you're pretty.

1785
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:20,800
I've had a sacrifice but no music no

1786
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:22,592
You have it I just want to thank you enough

1787
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:24,384
For holding the line

1788
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,408
And

1789
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:27,456
Speaking for Humanity

1790
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:32,832
He wants to thank Alex for speaking for Humanity have a Humanity at least

1791
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:34,880
My section of which is my person

1792
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:36,416
Alex doesn't speak for me

1793
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,000
Mass

1794
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:41,024
Also like

1795
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:41,792
Bekant

1796
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:48,192
You can't say stuff like we're not embellishing at all what you're talkin about death squads coming

1797
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:49,216
Conservative

1798
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:51,008
If Biden gets into office

1799
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:52,544
You're playing with fire

1800
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:53,824
This is this is

1801
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,848
Is not acceptable

1802
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:56,640
Now they're trying to do it but bigger the

1803
01:22:57,152 --> 01:23:03,296
Yes we're allowing this to happen

1804
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,320
Is insane because

1805
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:10,720
Getting people killed and Jordan they're laying down the preemptive justification by saying it like

1806
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:13,280
Vetiq and antifa they're planning

1807
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:17,376
How to do math why I was going to go to the inauguration on the 20th

1808
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:21,216
Nope but you're planning to do more and the same thing

1809
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:21,984
Now it's just

1810
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,776
Now they're there anyone people

1811
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:25,056
As they speak words

1812
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:26,592
People are dying

1813
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:27,360
To to them

1814
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:31,456
We have to deal with that the reality is that

1815
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:32,480
You know

1816
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:33,248
Mike Adams

1817
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:34,784
Maybe

1818
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:35,808
Tiny bit

1819
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,624
And if he does maybe they'll get some of things they wanted

1820
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:40,672
If we survive this

1821
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:44,000
We are the real media for America

1822
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:49,376
People's this out somehow that we don't yet know

1823
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:50,656
He

1824
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:51,680
He went down

1825
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:56,032
Surrounded

1826
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:58,592
His Spirit was good he did so much good

1827
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:01,920
He wasn't perfect

1828
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:05,504
Oh yeah and also I mean

1829
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,272
Very good

1830
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:08,576
Incredible internetda careforall

1831
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:10,880
The definitions of

1832
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:12,928
And

1833
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:19,584
Doesn't want to see America turned into a radioactive Wasteland

1834
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:25,984
Spell defiant

1835
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:29,824
Yeah man

1836
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:34,432
This is great Mike's like yeah I was Trump somehow it magically magic manager

1837
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:37,760
To get a second term will finally do the things we want him to do

1838
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:40,576
And then Alex you're not the only reason he's disappointed

1839
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,600
Disappointing

1840
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:42,368
Has he had

1841
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,648
If he was under threat

1842
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,440
They're going to Nuke cities

1843
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:48,256
Get the f*** out of here

1844
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:49,792
Grow up man

1845
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,072
If Trump hold public office

1846
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:53,888
Does again I'm storming the Capitol building by myself

1847
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:56,448
That's what I'm doing I don't want anybody else there

1848
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,728
Just me

1849
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:58,496
Against

1850
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:01,824
The government just banging your head against the wall

1851
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:02,848
I don't care

1852
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:05,152
So Trump needs to give an

1853
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:05,920
Broadcast

1854
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:07,712
According to Alex Shore

1855
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:10,016
And then we get into some secession talk

1856
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:10,784
I think that they want

1857
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:13,088
Good herbal office

1858
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:19,488
He's going to

1859
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:20,256
Power off

1860
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:24,096
You got you must mobilize

1861
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:26,912
You must have a constitutional convention whatever you got to have

1862
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:29,728
We just have to America

1863
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,264
He must just tell it like it is

1864
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:35,104
If for whatever reason

1865
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:36,640
He is unable to do that

1866
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:39,200
Then the American people need to make it known

1867
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:41,248
Biden and Harris and others

1868
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:42,272
That we the people

1869
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:46,368
To your charity to your rig elections to your

1870
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:48,672
False flag operation

1871
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:51,232
We do not consent in fact we withdraw

1872
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,536
Consent from you and we the people

1873
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:55,328
Will declare a new in the

1874
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:57,376
I believe all across this country

1875
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:59,168
We will set up a new

1876
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:04,544
But maybe starting by storming the Capitol building

1877
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,848
Fox I know it's a it's a

1878
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,152
Yeah

1879
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:11,200
Every like week

1880
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:14,784
The thing that's really difficult about this is that like we've heard

1881
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,832
Talk like this on Infowars of bun

1882
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:19,136
Over the years but never

1883
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:21,696
In the aftermath of something like

1884
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:23,488
What happened last week

1885
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,304
Like that should be a wake-up call

1886
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,328
4 people

1887
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:28,864
Particularly people like Alex

1888
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,656
Yeah that

1889
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,448
Chick can happen

1890
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:34,496
You need to be careful

1891
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:35,520
You can't talk like

1892
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:36,288
You can't

1893
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,312
You can't say

1894
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:39,104
That Trump needs to get

1895
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,920
Intuit like an emergency broadcast where he calls

1896
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:42,944
Biden ad

1897
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,992
Terrorista trinese agent

1898
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:48,576
And if not then we need to send a message that we're not going to

1899
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:54,464
Consent to be governed for think of any way to send a message better than

1900
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:57,024
Storming the Capitol building

1901
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:00,608
But I guess that wasn't good enough is what Mike Adams is say

1902
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,656
Right Michael there we go

1903
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:04,960
Mike is a real f*****-up dude

1904
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:06,752
Alex is really f***** up to

1905
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:10,848
I mean largely it's about selling food

1906
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:15,200
I'm not going to lie to you

1907
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:18,528
I've already started Lively

1908
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:20,576
As we speak

1909
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:26,208
Good all the solar panel

1910
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:28,768
What's your address

1911
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:29,792
Christ

1912
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:32,096
Why did the Staten 70 years of this

1913
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:33,888
Turn on the other

1914
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:41,312
Adorable Foods

1915
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:46,688
Yeah Alex keeps having very different stories about whether or not he has the

1916
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:47,712
This bunker setup

1917
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:48,992
I don't care

1918
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:52,576
More secession talk when you come back

1919
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:54,624
For brakes

1920
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,904
To do is he wants

1921
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:56,928
Texas

1922
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:57,696
Cuz they're cool

1923
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,488
You are you are

1924
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,304
24 social media companies

1925
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,888
To have like a million-dollar fine every time they censor somebody

1926
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,424
Don't put them out of business

1927
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:08,704
And also

1928
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,496
He wants Texas to make their own money

1929
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:12,800
A Texas could also pass

1930
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:19,200
New legislation or even via Governor executive order to say that any instance of censorship

1931
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:23,808
Will result in a $1000000

1932
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:24,832
Against big Tech

1933
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:27,392
And then Texas could use that

1934
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:30,720
It would practically be at least a trillion dollars

1935
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,280
To defy

1936
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:35,072
Deregulation

1937
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:36,352
Texas to launch its own

1938
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:39,424
Currency Texas has its own its own

1939
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,704
Gold

1940
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:42,240
That it can strike

1941
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:43,264
Start a few years ago

1942
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:48,640
Directions to launch its own currency so the people in any other state I'm just using taxes as an example

1943
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:52,992
E-commerce and transactions in an honest money sister

1944
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:54,272
Simone by the people

1945
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:55,040
Rather than the

1946
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:57,344
Fake fiat currency that Pineville use

1947
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,624
To hand out more bribes

1948
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,904
Kickbacks to governors

1949
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:08,096
Great idea let's have states make their own money ever had a situation in American history where differ

1950
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:08,864
Spring communities

1951
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,936
Printed their own money he gets very confusing pretty fast

1952
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:13,984
Did it work last time

1953
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:16,032
S*** I think we just didn't

1954
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:17,056
Try it Harden

1955
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:18,848
I think that's what they think

1956
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:20,384
About the Confederacy

1957
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,432
Really sounds like they just

1958
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:23,712
Another Confederate

1959
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,136
Kalita successful Breakaway

1960
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:33,696
Because of its energy at soil

1961
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:35,488
Consolation of State

1962
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,584
Arizona

1963
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:40,864
Call Rana tooth

1964
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:44,192
Oklahoma Louisiana Mississippi Tennessee

1965
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,520
Texas country concerts

1966
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:50,080
Absolutely there's there's a mechanism

1967
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:51,104
For doing that a text

1968
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:51,872
This could elect

1969
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:52,896
A new app

1970
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:58,016
President of the new United States together Louisiana Oklahoma Kansas and other states

1971
01:29:58,272 --> 01:29:59,296
I want to participate

1972
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:01,600
And then Texas could order its citizens to stop

1973
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:02,880
Paying federal income tax

1974
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:06,208
Access to Washington was done before we can do it right now

1975
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,024
This doesn't sound like a good plan

1976
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:09,792
So

1977
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:14,912
So if I understand correctly

1978
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:17,984
I'd love to hear your breakdown

1979
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:24,384
I don't want to hear you break

1980
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,176
Call breakdown later

1981
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:28,224
So Texas

1982
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:29,760
Is going to

1983
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,808
Declare a new

1984
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:34,880
And then

1985
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:39,232
So so the United States government is going to watch Texas.

1986
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:41,280
Declare itself a foreign power

1987
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:42,304
Yes

1988
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:46,144
And then they're going to be like well course

1989
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:49,472
You can have Louisiana in Florida that's really because you know they were

1990
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:53,312
With that Colorado dry around to join us

1991
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:54,848
And then

1992
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:57,152
They're going to get

1993
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:59,712
Territory and money from a

1994
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:05,344
Oh I meant I imagined trade relations would be really wonderful between the United States

1995
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:11,232
I feel like there's some issues that they might not be considering

1996
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:17,376
There's that point but I also think that there's a logistical issues

1997
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:19,680
Oh yeah they might not be considerate

1998
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:21,472
Blade

1999
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:27,104
No I don't know they're going to be able to sell their oil to foreign powers immediately there's no way that they couldn't

2000
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,664
Just immediately start exporting oil

2001
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:34,528
You know there's no kind of United States

2002
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:36,832
Block you from selling this oil

2003
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:39,392
Because it's our

2004
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:40,416
Problems

2005
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:46,304
But you know what they got the biggest issue taken care of already issue and that is who should be the new president

2006
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:54,240
Beetle Idaho and end in Wyoming and so on that are going to really lead I think

2007
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:56,800
The new Society out of

2008
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:58,336
The collapse of the old

2009
01:31:58,848 --> 01:31:59,360
Corrupt

2010
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:00,384
America swap

2011
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,664
The old Empire

2012
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,712
That's just being looted in its final hour

2013
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:04,736
Democrats

2014
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:08,576
When that happen

2015
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:11,392
The new America

2016
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:16,768
With a whole new honest money system for example and new laws

2017
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:18,560
For the people

2018
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:19,840
Are the people rather than

2019
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:26,240
Criminals that are in the Senate and the GOP and by the way I'm now part of the never GOP movement

2020
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:28,800
I will not vote for any member of the GOP

2021
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:31,616
Ever again unless their name is b*******

2022
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:33,920
Only Trump

2023
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:34,688
Bulshit

2024
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:35,456
Alright

2025
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:37,760
Yeah

2026
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:38,528
This is

2027
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:39,296
Bucked up

2028
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:41,600
You know what I was listening to this and I was

2029
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:45,184
Is Mike Adams more f***** up than I remember him being I guess

2030
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:51,584
Maybe it's just because I haven't heard him in a long time but you in awhile really f***** up

2031
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:57,984
That there would only be lone survivors in the past that makes total sense

2032
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,544
In order to help sell survival food

2033
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,848
Bend it like that makes total sense

2034
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:06,944
Secession in the end of the United States

2035
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:11,296
In the aftermath of people storming the Capitol building

2036
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:15,136
The part that doesn't make sense to me like this doesn't even work for wedding

2037
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:17,184
To do ears are as my vibe

2038
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,976
From all of them right now

2039
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:20,256
Which is that

2040
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:22,304
They are a bunch of whiny babies

2041
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:25,888
Who want to take their ball and go home after they saw that they lost

2042
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:28,960
Hi. Fortunately it's not their f******

2043
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:29,728
Ball

2044
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:33,824
Her home is shared

2045
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:36,128
No f****** live there so you have to

2046
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:38,944
To deal with it it's Madden

2047
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,480
My politics are not

2048
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:41,504
Divisive Dan

2049
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:43,296
You're trying to murder me

2050
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:46,880
So Michael leaves

2051
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:48,160
And Alex

2052
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:51,232
Complaining about foreign leaders

2053
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:52,000
But not the ones

2054
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:53,280
You think this time

2055
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:54,304
Take shots

2056
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:57,376
The Canada do your in the crosshairs

2057
01:33:57,888 --> 01:34:01,472
Global assist

2058
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:03,520
What the Chinese system

2059
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:04,544
We want dick

2060
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:05,312
Gator chef

2061
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:07,872
Taylor liberal there Gooding

2062
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:11,456
Oh Alex has hurt people's feelings easily band

2063
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:14,784
All the idiots

2064
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,064
Part of power you're not

2065
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,088
You're called useful

2066
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,648
Idiots in the words of VI Lenin

2067
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:21,696
Here's what Justin Trudeau had to say

2068
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:28,096
I actually have China

2069
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:31,936
Because there

2070
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:35,008
Basic dictatorship is allowing them

2071
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:37,824
Actually turn their economy around on a dime

2072
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:42,432
Let's hear that one more time. Off abruptly

2073
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:47,552
It's almost like they would probably be some sort of context to they're really cut off

2074
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:50,880
Commentary

2075
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:56,512
What is your favorite politician what's your favorite governor

2076
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,304
Oats, does China

2077
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:01,632
What's your favorite government they were on a date

2078
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:05,216
I want to say that these comments were made by Trudeau back in 20

2079
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,008
So it's a little older

2080
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:14,176
2nd although they're not great comments and they did cause quite a bit of embarrassment for him to actually say that

2081
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:15,200
China was his favorite

2082
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:16,736
Here's his full answer

2083
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:20,064
You know there's a level of admiration I actually have

2084
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,344
For China because their base

2085
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,136
Dictatorship is allowing them to act

2086
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:25,696
Can we turn their economy around on a dime and say

2087
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:27,232
We need to go green fast

2088
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:29,024
We need to start investing in solar

2089
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:35,680
I mean there is a flexibility that I know Stephen Harper must dream about having it a dictatorship that he can do everything

2090
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:36,448
He wanted

2091
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:37,728
That I find quite interest

2092
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:40,544
But if I were to reach out and say which which

2093
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,848
Kind of administration I most admire

2094
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:46,688
I think there's something to be said right here in Canada for the way our territories are run

2095
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:51,040
Nunavut Northwestern territories in the Yukon are done without political parties

2096
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:52,064
Around consent

2097
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:54,880
And are much more like a municipal government

2098
01:35:55,392 --> 01:36:01,536
And I think there's a lot to be said for people pulling together to try to solve issues rather than score points off each other and I think we need a little bit

2099
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:02,304
But more of that

2100
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,352
What's on news can now report that I

2101
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:05,120
Prefer China

2102
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:11,008
The end of literally said people are going to do what Alex is doing right now

2103
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:17,664
Cool cool coco call Outlets

2104
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:18,944
China guess what

2105
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:22,528
Are we are we are but prophecy

2106
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,088
Yep I don't know if anybody who stutters

2107
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:26,112
These government would

2108
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:29,440
Disagree with the idea that a centralized

2109
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:32,768
Monarca cool Power structure allows

2110
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:34,048
For quicker reaction

2111
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,352
Yeah I made it here saying it I don't have

2112
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:42,752
To get a bunch of people together in a boat if you're if you're saying it outside of it being a prescriptive thing like you should have that beat

2113
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:47,616
You're just studying it

2114
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:51,968
Instead of being like well we need to talk to our constituents and we need to have a boat

2115
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:54,016
And we need to write a bill and do all day

2116
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:59,392
Descriptively it's pretty hard to argue with but yeah it if you listen to the rest of that quote

2117
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:00,928
It's really clear

2118
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,232
The thing that he's bringing up

2119
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:04,512
Is is that

2120
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:07,584
Phenomenon how they can make their economy much

2121
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,864
Maury Co

2122
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:09,888
Friendly

2123
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:12,192
Because of that basic

2124
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:14,496
Dictatorship as he calls it

2125
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:20,640
The government that he actually says is what he admires is the territories in Canada

2126
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:23,968
Completely different message then what Alex wants to give across

2127
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:25,248
Because he's a liar

2128
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:26,784
Not even know

2129
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,344
Yeah I bet he doesn't even know what the rest of that quote is

2130
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,648
Doesn't give them care doesn't care why would

2131
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:36,000
He just listen to The Sun News Report my lights

2132
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:38,816
These people who was like

2133
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:39,840
Q there f***

2134
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:41,376
Looking stupid because you are

2135
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:43,936
They're talkin to Military Intelligence

2136
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:45,472
And that's what Alex

2137
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:47,776
He keeps running into p

2138
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:50,336
People at like events and they're like

2139
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:51,104
Like Zach

2140
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:53,408
I've literally been trali

2141
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:56,736
What kind of Trance

2142
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:58,016
It was overall

2143
01:37:58,272 --> 01:38:00,064
I was like a guy wear a t-shirt

2144
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,600
Outside to like you

2145
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:03,136
Now I'm cute

2146
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:04,928
I know you're bad

2147
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:10,816
With intelligence

2148
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:11,840
They're like

2149
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:13,632
Really that's funny cuz

2150
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,936
Intelligence

2151
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:18,496
Olive asked me what's coming next and so does he

2152
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:19,520
Those are good

2153
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:22,848
Music

2154
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:24,128

Making

2158
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:31,552
Fun of these people for thinking they're talking to Military Intelligence

2159
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:34,624
Patty immediately to start sauerkraut Howie's would want to talk to her

2160
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,928
I all I hear him say is just like

2161
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:38,464
I know I'm like

2162
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:40,000

Stupid I can weaponize this stuff you guys are following

2166
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:50,496
Of this b*******

2167
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:52,032
You should be giving me money

2168
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:53,056
I hate them

2169
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:55,872
So are you just fed up with these are these Q50

2170
01:38:56,384 --> 01:39:00,992
But it's really important to understand that the reason that he's behaving in the way he is towards them

2171
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:04,064
Mad about this this hold

2172
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:08,928
Yeah because he needs somebody to be the people who have the zip tie right he needs somebody

2173
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:10,464
Need to be the people who like

2174
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,488
Are scary

2175
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:16,608
Freddy's told his audience not really to be afraid of his EEG wearing antifa

2176
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:17,376
Fiocchi

2177
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:19,936
Argument

2178
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:20,704
Family

2179
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:24,288
So many people

2180
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:27,616
They believed all that delusional crap in it

2181
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:32,480
Control

2182
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:38,112
During the 20th

2183
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:42,976
Which denies us those

2184
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:44,000
Hillbilly

2185
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:45,024
A protest peacefully

2186
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:46,048
They're going to have

2187
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:47,072
Cute cards out there

2188
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:49,120
What does zip ties and their gun

2189
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:51,424
Believing they're about to overthrow the globalist

2190
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,264
Awesome magic Brooke

2191
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:56,800
Is the globalist

2192
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:58,592
26 is good

2193
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:06,016
And it's roped in so

2194
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:08,064
Many people there now delusional

2195
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,144
Next level

2196
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:27,776
Better

2197
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:30,080
Stab yourself a

2198
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:36,736
Absolutely.

2199
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:48,768
People take

2200
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,304
Kindness for weakness

2201
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:55,680
And I just can't believe I've always been so loyal essential oil person

2202
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:56,960
People to treat

2203
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:57,984
I treat them good

2204
01:40:58,752 --> 01:40:59,776
Experience

2205
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:05,664
I appreciate the

2206
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:08,736
Doctor appointment 47 years old

2207
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,928
Next

2208
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:19,488
What are we doing what are we doing I don't know

2209
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:20,512
I don't know

2210
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:22,560
I wouldn't expect

2211
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:25,376
The Alex would like I finally get it

2212
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:30,240
He's supposed to have known all this makes me want to start bark

2213
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:34,592
Like I almost just broke down and started going

2214
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:35,616
Yeah yeah

2215
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:38,688
It's so it's No Nonsense

2216
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:42,016
Those moments when he's just like

2217
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:43,808
I see everything in the dryer

2218
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:45,600
What next

2219
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:46,880
Level recently

2220
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:48,672
Journal

2221
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:49,696
Yeah yeah

2222
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:50,976
I mean

2223
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:53,792
It does go a long way towards

2224
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:57,120
Explaining how he tells himself he's not a serial

2225
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:58,656
Killer

2226
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:06,848
I've seen something new I'm not a serial killer responsibility for multiple killings

2227
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:08,384
Yeah yeah

2228
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:09,408
I don't know if

2229
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:11,712
Can talk himself out of that one

2230
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:13,760
These two people

2231
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:15,040
They were at the Capitol

2232
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:17,344
And they've trained themselves

2233
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,112
The think

2234
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:20,416
The Trump was going to send the special forces in

2235
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:22,464
Right as we saw antifa

2236
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:24,768
And they thought that they were the Special Forces

2237
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:26,304
This is the story now

2238
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:28,608
It was the two people

2239
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:30,400
Under antifas control

2240
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:32,192
The one in there like a group of morons

2241
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:37,568
There's the Special Forces

2242
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:39,104
Right on time

2243
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,384
This time

2244
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:42,944
Antifa

2245
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:44,992
What's special forces for Trump

2246
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:48,064
Behind

2247
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:49,600
Waving in the Masters

2248
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:50,624
Luckily

2249
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:51,904
By the blessing of God

2250
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:55,744
Did not go in with

2251
01:42:58,304 --> 01:42:59,072
But I saw that

2252
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:00,352
Make me sick

2253
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:01,632
Yeah it's so this is

2254
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:03,680
I guess how the narrative is going

2255
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:04,960
M22 land

2256
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:05,984
Is

2257
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:07,008
People

2258
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:09,568
Not that antifa were Special Forces

2259
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:14,176
I thought they were being directed by the Deep State also like what's going on here

2260
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:16,224
Yeah Dan

2261
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:16,992
What is going on

2262
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:19,552
I don't know

2263
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:23,904
It's everybody's fault but mine

2264
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:24,672
Smile

2265
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:31,072
Excuse me while me and my health Ranger friends try and make this happen again

2266
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:33,376
I told you there be hypnosis

2267
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:34,144
Some thought

2268
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:37,728
And says go to calls and wants to promise me hypnosis

2269
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:43,616
To talk to people who were there one Guy believes this address please

2270
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:50,016
Maybe not inside but at the rally guy who calls in

2271
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:52,320
Who believes that there was a guy on a megaphone

2272
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:54,368
Who is hypnotized

2273
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:57,696
Do you remember the media tower right there

2274
01:43:58,208 --> 01:43:58,720
Center

2275
01:43:58,976 --> 01:43:59,488
In the back

2276
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:00,512
Yes

2277
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:02,560
There was someone on that megaphone

2278
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:04,096
I know a little bit about

2279
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:05,632
Neuro-linguistic

2280
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:06,912
Programming NLP

2281
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,704
Whoever was on that Mac

2282
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,496
The phone with literally

2283
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:13,056
The power of suggestion

2284
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:14,848
Hitting all those trigger words

2285
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:16,384
Take it now people

2286
01:44:16,896 --> 01:44:17,920
It's now or never

2287
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:19,200
This is China

2288
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:20,480
This is our house

2289
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:23,808
Push forward hold the line they were saying

2290
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:30,464
Everything that would brow anyone and also Alex Jones

2291
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:33,792
I did not say that

2292
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:35,072
I'm here that but

2293
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:37,632
I can tell you what I felt the things that I did hear

2294
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:40,192
So this guy is saying that someone is using

2295
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:40,960
Programming

2296
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:43,520
To convince the crowd to act in ways that it would

2297
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:46,592
But I also think all the things that he saying

2298
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:48,384
Diversant are there exactly what

2299
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:50,688
They would be saying in a bullhorn

2300
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:51,712
Expensive

2301
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:53,760
You guys want this

2302
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:59,648
You're just mad because it happened before you could get enough people together to succeed

2303
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:00,672
Yeah

2304
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:05,536
Angry you're going to be mad when people start to take this seriously

2305
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:08,864
Yeah because real mad whenever you start to get it

2306
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:10,144
For a very long time

2307
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:11,936
Some people have not taken the issue

2308
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:13,216
All right wing

2309
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:16,032
Media and how it feeds into

2310
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:18,080
Extremism

2311
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:19,872
They've not taking that seriously at all

2312
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:20,640
Yeah

2313
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:21,408
Well made

2314
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:22,432
Why we have

2315
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:23,200
Any

2316
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:24,480
Relevance

2317
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:33,696
I think that there is an unfortunate

2318
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:34,976
For them

2319
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:36,000
Trend

2320
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:39,072
And that is where people may take this seriously now and then

2321
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:43,680
Yeah it'll be it'll be good though cuz imaginiff

2322
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:46,496
Somebody was like

2323
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:47,520
Hello

2324
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:51,872
On every TV show just sitting there being like

2325
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:53,664
Bulshit

2326
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:57,504
You know

2327
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,040
Yeah but it's

2328
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:05,440
That's that's why I think I speculated about this back in the day and I actually don't think it's a good idea but

2329
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:07,744
If Alex is going to do his show

2330
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,024
I have to be his co-host

2331
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:10,816
You have to

2332
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:14,656
His version of net neutrality

2333
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:18,752
So there's some other callers who talk about boring

2334
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:22,080
Stuff about being there at the rally I didn't find any of it to in

2335
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:25,152
Interesting but there's one other color that made me chuckle

2336
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:27,968
It's called magazine

2337
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:30,528
I need to start a magazine to where we can leave it at

2338
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:32,064
Walmart

2339
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:33,856
The freak

2340
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:35,904
Magazine store

2341
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:37,440
Watch all three sounds great

2342
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:39,232
Do you understand

2343
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:42,560
That had 1/1000000 response of a digital format

2344
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:54,592
Here's my solution

2345
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:56,896
Media

2346
01:46:58,176 --> 01:46:58,688
I love that

2347
01:46:58,944 --> 01:47:00,736
It's called cuz he's like you know we need magazine

2348
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:07,136
Look up Donna Magazine with a lot of money to make any anything all that no one gave us anything about the publishing business

2349
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:13,536
The digital stuff

2350
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:14,560
Lots more people

2351
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:16,352
The college response that is amazing

2352
01:47:16,864 --> 01:47:19,168
Digital stuff's not do anything either

2353
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:19,936
Which

2354
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:25,312
FairPoint

2355
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:34,016
We come to the end of this and we need to do Wednesday episode cuz there's a pretty

2356
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:34,784
F***** up

2357
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:36,832
Yeah at the same time it's like

2358
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:39,648
You know if we waited until Friday this would

2359
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:41,440
Pile-up

2360
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:43,232
What's going to happen tomorrow

2361
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:50,144
We're not a new show that the news backs up fast now

2362
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:50,912
Wii Sports

2363
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:53,728
We've already forgotten that Alex interviewed mycslink

2364
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:55,776
Yeah yeah who gives a f*** about that

2365
01:47:58,336 --> 01:47:59,104
So

2366
01:47:59,360 --> 01:47:59,872
Anyway

2367
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:02,688
We'll see what happens I'm sorry to do this to you

2368
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:06,016
Yeah works up in a tizzy

2369
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:09,088
Used to process all of this and then

2370
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,112
The show

2371
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:11,392
And you have to admit it

2372
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:12,160
You know and that's

2373
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:13,440
That's but I'm

2374
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:15,744
Shaking with rage and then I walk away

2375
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:16,512
Haha

2376
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:17,536
Into the Night

2377
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:23,424
Some would argue that your job is easier in that sense anymore.

2378
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:24,960
The stuff for a lot longer

2379
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:27,520
You're better able to emotionally process

2380
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:29,056
I'm a loose cannon

2381
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:32,128
Nobody should take my gun and badge right now

2382
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:35,456
12 couldn't you have neither a gun or a badge

2383
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:38,016
That is true that is a bonus

2384
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:44,416
I need to know it's not so much that I'm able to emotionally handle this much better it's that I steal all the candy that our listeners

2385
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:52,352
Uno campus

2386
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:54,656
Now you're the more valuable resource

2387
01:48:55,936 --> 01:49:02,080
Will be back on Friday Jordan but until then we let it we do it

2388
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:08,480
Mileage underscore fight not go to bed Jordan
