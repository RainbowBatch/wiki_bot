1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B I'm sick of imposing

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Alex

00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,816
Joe

00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,120
Jordan Jordan

00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,400

10
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,360
Post-holiday

11
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:26,016

Into

15
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:38,048
Being overwhelmed quite frankly by the support

16
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,120
People donating to the the Senate

17
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:45,216
It's a campaign

18
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,032
We did a terrible job of

19
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:51,616
Promoting defense

20
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:58,016
We forgot to mention it on our last episode because we recorded in advance to earlier

21
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:09,280
But yeah I was it was nice to be invited it was nice to be along for the ride on that

22
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:15,680

Experienced really like a ham State like a slice of ham and I really ever

28
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,768
All kinds of fun

29
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,584
I'm not good at cooking ham but it was very nice

30
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,120
Very very

31
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:51,776
Delightful is great great holiday but in order to tell you but my actual bright spot is.

32
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,056
Have to open up my car

33
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:59,456
Correspondent cage we didn't have a big Gathering or anything

34
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,736
Thanksgiving party

35
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,296
Two of us

36
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,232
Very beautiful

37
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:14,560
It was very very small

38
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:18,656
I'm going to go ahead and open up my correspondence cage over here Dan

39
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,472
And

40
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,240
New rap

41
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,264
Princess crown

42
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:28,896
Created a cover for my book a graphic design

43
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,712
That is not just a great cover in a great design

44
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,248
But like really perfect

45
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:41,184
It's really really cool I did design it looks fantastic. I really

46
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,000
It's okay it's awesome

47
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,792
Cyberbully happy for you and that

48
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,072
So that's a really awesome

49
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,096
Piece of work

50
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,144
Been created

51
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,960
I have some issues with your correspondent

52
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240
Its cage what about it

53
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,264
That's not a fan

54
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,408
This problem was to open the

55
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,456
I have another problem in that

56
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,504
You're naming someone a raptor princess

57
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,576
And you're not telling me in advance so I don't have the clicker

58
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,416
I can't just tell you to to play a Raptor

59
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:18,815
I feel like that's that's that's something that you have to also choose to do

60
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:25,215
We need to talk about

61
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,007
10 with v

62
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:33,663
Correspondence cage soundtrack

63
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:40,063
That's a good idea really want to annoy you really want to ask a late this arms race event

64
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,367
That is the way to go

65
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,391
That would be great

66
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,671
You have a great decision

67
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,815
Sure that is

68
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,863
It's tough to know how

69
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,655
Vowels are long or short

70
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:00,543
Well thank you end of this is a gift for George but I still thank you I think

71
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,079
It's pretty cool that exist Phantom

72
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:08,223
So over today

73
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,575
Lot of business to get into but before we get to do let's take a little

74
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:19,231
Pagan filth is Dustin

75
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,935
I'm a policy wonk

76
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,751
Dexter TW thank you so much

77
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,407
No last name the last initial

78
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,063
Simon experience

79
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:49,439
I'm a policy wonk Mister doodle I believe is what I reviewed yet

80
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:54,559
Libertarian

81
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,839
I'm a policy wonk

82
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:59,167
I hear you

83
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,751
A cat sleeve Journal

84
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
I'm a policy wonk

85
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,311
I dream about cats

86
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:10,687
Elevated level

87
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,223
At least middelfart

88
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,015
Thank you so much you are now a technocrat

89
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,831
Tough one here Donald Trump

90
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,167
Money off that heroin

91
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,775
Freakishly large

92
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:42,431
Middle farts in the

93
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:48,831
Situation for him to be like well the only way to take down the GOP people who are betrayed is to donate to knowledge

94
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,159
That'll do it I'll get them

95
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:56,767
So Jordan today I found myself in a little bit of an interesting Piccoli conundrum

96
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,071
Sure and that is that

97
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:05,471
Thanksgiving happened and Alex Wassabi studio for the end of the week xuan so terms of us

98
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,239
Coming back with

99
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,007
With something

100
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:13,407
From Alex's seems like it's going to be

101
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,271
I guess we could have baby for something out of like Alex's little

102
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:24,671
You know hey how you doing videos where are showing in front of a lake yelling about something or other

103
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:29,791
I just wasn't interested now is the time

104
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,815
We got to get wacky

105
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,607
It's wacky Monday

106
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,887
It's been awhile

107
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,423
What we thankfully have

108
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:42,079
They like think that Kerry Cassidy carryover a Project Camelot has given up on her pay wall format

109
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:46,431
No that's because enough people or if

110
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:52,831
I don't know what the deal is but these videos are all very available and I have not had to log into anything

111
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,415
Isaac Carree Mystery episodes

112
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:01,791
Possible they're never going to do an episode on me again I better make me

113
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
She missed

114
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:08,959
Cheapest drifting we've got anybody

115
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,519
Take a break from Alex Jones we like to look into

116
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,287
How the world

117
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,359
The Project Camelot which is a YouTube channel

118
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,407
Run by lady we call scary Cary

119
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,967
Who interviews face weirdo

120
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,271
Super-Soldiers people have been

121
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,319
People who

122
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:30,975
Psychics psychics

123
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:34,815
But not a ton well maybe

124
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,351
If someone told her that

125
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:42,751
Who might be a racist alien

126
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:46,591
Abaddon

127
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:52,991
Her main source of information herbig whistleblowers this guy

128
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:57,599
Who is playing at the time

129
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,623
With his

130
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,183
Sentient spaceship Minerva

131
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,743
And his friends in the Raptor beings

132
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,815
Right right right

133
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,095
We didn't make this up

134
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,911
Nope to learn

135
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:15,007
We've observed this in the wild

136
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,335
Unfortunately over the time that we have looked

137
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:24,735
At this is supposed to be just a pressure release valve course come to realize that Carrie is also very insecure.

138
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:29,599
Our dovetailing together are two shows kind of took a little bit of the charm away from it

139
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
Butts

140
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,927
Sometimes you still just need a hit

141
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:39,839
We're going to be looking at a video that was released on Project Camelot on November 12th

142
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,399
Does a little bit of an election Q&A

143
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:48,799
Case collection

144
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,687
Hi everyone I'm Kerry Cassidy from prod Camelot

145
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:58,015
Hi Carrie so very happy to be here today but my

146
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,063
Didn't show up

147
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,623
So I guess you have some,

148
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,903
Reflector other and we'll have to

149
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,439
The reschedule

150
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,719
There

151
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,511
Anyway

152
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,791
So

153
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,631
I just thought I'd do a Q&A if that's

154
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
Useful

155
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:19,007
Now I want to say that I do not think

156
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,055
Anything is bad about a gas cancel

157
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,175
No no I only left that introduction in because

158
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,455
It is the

159
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,735
Set up

160
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:35,135
For a punchline later we're yelling Bingo all the time

161
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,671
You can figure out where the

162
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,463
The payoff to that joke okay

163
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
Alright

164
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,303
Canceled actually her

165
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:48,959
Nope it's a Fight Club scenario is definitely something

166
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,007
No way this guest shoot of ever cancel

167
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,543
You'll see once it happens

168
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,615
If you and I would be nice

169
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,663
Like I said you got Q's

170
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,687
Carrie's got at work

171
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,991
But it turns out this is even more than just a

172
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,271
Sakura name

173
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,295
What you started

174
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,087
Down this road

175
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,927
There's alot going on I can say that

176
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,975
In general

177
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:17,887
I did have a apricot dream last night finally about the outcome

178
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,167
Safari

179
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
Interesting

180
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:25,055
Dream that I had so maybe I'll just share that and then

181
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,359
You can go ahead and ask questions about whatever

182
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,383
So

183
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,759
I hear a caller on the Alex Jones Show talk about their dreams not interested

184
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,319
Cary open up the shows

185
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,879
I had a precognitive dream finally

186
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,927
Bury My Heart

187
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,303
Several days after

188
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,095
About what's going to happen here

189
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,911
Yes she gets into that right at the

190
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,935
Beginning right after

191
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:56,287
The top and it turns out that the she's a good storyteller

192
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,055
The seam

193
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,383
Before it was going on before the dream

194
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,663
Contacts

195
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
Happy Foods

196
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,455
Maybe

197
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:09,087
That might be the truth behind the word sheet music

198
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:12,415
The audience to know for sure

199
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,999
My dream basically was

200
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
And I had a very

201
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
They're shooting

202
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,375
5G at me last night so

203
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,167
I know Trump doesn't have what

204
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,191
Control

205
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,727
Over scalar weapons

206
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,751
Is that are being used

207
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
And so forth

208
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,359
So I was up most of the night

209
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
On and off

210
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,175
And then finally fell asleep

211
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,527
Am so I mean look

212
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,831
She was 75 G shot at her

213
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,463
Taylor laser vehicle

214
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,767
Instead she was saying that you and I get

215
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,839
Five you were having 5G shot at you that

216
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,119
That's enough

217
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
Aperture

218
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,935
How did she know

219
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,727
Cuz she didn't say what the

220
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,031
Effects of having 5G

221
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,567
No apparently

222
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,895
Not being able to fall asleep his sign of 5G attack

223
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:09,503
Well I mean I've certainly been someone who struggle with insomnia it. To my life

224
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,135
It takes me a long time to fall asleep it's frustrating

225
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,927
It sucks I have rented be like

226
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:21,279
I lay down and two minutes later I'm out and I get mad at me

227
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:27,679
It'll take me an hour and a half at least usually you're just laying there to fall asleep it sucks but if

228
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,495
If I could imagine that I was under 5G scalar attack

229
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:37,151
They probably be more excited I feel like it would make it impossible to sleep

230
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,199
Jonah

231
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:43,807
Instead of going to bed at midnight and falling asleep at 2 you fall asleep at 6

232
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,111
And you're worried about 5G attacks the whole time

233
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,903
Yeah maybe I'm glad I don't

234
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:54,303
Take the window with my phone

235
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,399
Having trouble sleeping does your phone have that app 25g shooting at

236
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,191
Actually

237
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,727
Emerges from a

238
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,543
That's that's important

239
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,079
Your Dalek phone

240
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,127
So this is the setting of The Dream

241
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
All night

242
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,943
Clyde and then

243
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,991
She gets to sleep at around 6 in the morning

244
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,271
And here is part of

245
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,039
The dream

246
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,855
And then I had this dream in which

247
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,903
I saw the television

248
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,671
And

249
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,207
Trump had taken it over

250
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,743
And was

251
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
Showing

252
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
Actually

253
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,815
Individual

254
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
And indict

255
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,631
And individuals that had Acts

256
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,655
Actually been killed

257
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,215
As part of their indictment

258
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,287
And I I guess a Military Tribunal

259
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
Situation

260
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,359
And

261
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,895
And it was all being announced

262
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,175
To the entire public

263
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,247
And I was very happy because

264
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,783
These individuals are

265
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,807
We're very dark

266
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:48,831
I'm involved

267
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,671
Hurting children in

268
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,207
You know the chill

269
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,487
Children in underground bases

270
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,303
Adrenochrome and all of that

271
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,863
So that was the dream

272
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,143
It was

273
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,935
Like a little movie

274
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,959
Play the dream

275
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:10,591
If I Were A Dream

276
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:16,991
She's dreaming about stuff he's read on blog

277
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:20,831
Well I think that she's tapping into the zeitgeist

278
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:24,927
A lot of the online extreme right

279
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
Disease

280
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,719
Get traffic tan message

281
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
Switchboards in

282
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,047
You know even people like Alex and Gage and half

283
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,327
This idea of

284
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,863
Righteously

285
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,399
Taking over

286
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:38,239
And killing their enemies

287
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,799
Yeah you know I can get

288
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,847
I get bloodthirsty to a point

289
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:49,503
You know somebody was whatever nonsense somebody wrote in like the Atlantic or something where it's like

290
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,903
But we don't want to see Trump dragged from the White House again

291
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,743
People don't want to see Trump taking away from the White House he needs to concede like an adult

292
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,791
And part of me is just sitting there going like

293
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:08,191
No I would like to see him dragged out by his hair I would like to see him dragged through the streets that would be great that's a little bloodthirsty I guess

294
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
I don't think it will I don't think

295
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
Good idea ask

296
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:18,687
I think the consequences of it are so much worse than whatever catharsis would get out of it

297
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,503
Second level of thought I don't have

298
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,807
The end bloodthirst that's all I need

299
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:30,207
Let's imagine a scenario where the does takeover broadcast television and announces like he's killed

300
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,279
What happens next

301
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:40,959
What kind of world are we living again

302
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:48,127
Just so you guys know and almost everybody

303
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:48,895
Horse

304
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,711
Pale for me guys

305
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,759
The IQ panel for my blood

306
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,575
So carries talking real

307
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,367
Specifically about upper

308
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,415
Who is been killed

309
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,439
The mystery Ensure

310
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:04,767
I'm not sure I'm I'm looking I'm scanning the chat

311
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,791
Right now and I'm not

312
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,071
Sure what some of these

313
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:07,839
Questions

314
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,375
Refer to if your friend

315
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,423
The details

316
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,959
We're very visual

317
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:13,983
So like I said

318
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,519
Television on

319
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,311
I was seeing it

320
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
It was

321
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
Literally

322
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,431
The pit part that it was on was a

323
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,735
Particular person who had been

324
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
Killed

325
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,807
As part of the

326
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
The cycle

327
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
Assertive

328
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,695
I don't know whatever you want to call it

329
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,743
Indictments and certainly

330
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
Payback

331
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,327
For his crimes against humanity

332
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:45,727
She doesn't say who she never says who know she had a dream it was visual so she saw the

333
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,775
Conceivably

334
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:57,503
I would say that it's either got to be Soros or Bill Gates Right

335
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,343
Sister is in the dreams of all right leading people that's

336
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,719
Two power demon clown power

337
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,767
I don't think it's still there on Elm Street

338
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,047
I don't know man

339
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,071
I don't know

340
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,351
Maybe it's not human

341
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,375
And maybe it's a Raptor

342
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,655
Could be

343
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,679
Whoa

344
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,727
What if what if it's an alien

345
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,823
Holyshit Alienware it has to be nailing wearing human face

346
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:28,735
Now that's a good point

347
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,527
Dad

348
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,343
Alabama reptiles

349
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,927
It's f***** up if all the sudden we hear that Trump killed all of his enemies

350
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:41,279
What if the same time

351
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,607
And he killed aliens David Icke

352
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:49,215
Train is going on David Icke is now my Surgeon General

353
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,287
What's nobody else can handle these Raptor surgeries

354
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:58,431
Anyway this person that use talking about has been killed already in the dream

355
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,223
But you won't say who it is

356
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
It's really frustrating

357
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,527
It was interesting

358
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,063
Because it was literally about

359
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,087
The fact that they already

360
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
So

361
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,183
That seems

362
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,207
Quiet

363
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
Adventurous

364
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,279
To come forward in that way

365
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,119
In theory is

366
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,655
Have said that they have

367
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,679
Certain people

368
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,471
Or it has

369
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,495
Put out there

370
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,031
Now

371
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,567
Trumpet courses

372
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,359
Said this yet

373
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
So this

374
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,407
This was an official

375
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,175
Report

376
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:30,943
And

377
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,735
It was clearly

378
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,015
Commandeered

379
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,551
A television

380
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,831
Station or maybe

381
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
And took the internet

382
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,183
Nobody was an official report in Madrid

383
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:47,583
In the dream it was official

384
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,167
How scary is this

385
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,823
How much does this fit all of your nightmare versions of What the Democrats are tripe

386
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:04,223
All of the internet right controls at least one TV stations

387
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:10,623
Communication ability to communicate with your audience community

388
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
So happy

389
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,023
So this might have been a vision this dream it might have been a dream

390
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:19,839
He says

391
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,119
Are they say

392
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,423
Qanon

393
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,447
And so and so forth

394
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,983
The philosophy behind it is

395
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,263
They want to show

396
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:28,799
So

397
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,823
My last

398
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,127
Video I said okay fine show us

399
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,407
You know in other words

400
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,687
Don't talk about showing us

401
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,455
Show us

402
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:42,111
I get the sense that there is a possibility that which he's trying to say is that her dream was a vision that was great

403
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,671
Answered by Q

404
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:51,071
Expecting something along those lines to be a little bit late is a belief

405
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,911
I can give you.

406
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,983
How long can you wait

407
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:02,079
On the whole revision from cute well I mean

408
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,383
Obviously you can wait a long time for a vision for

409
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,919
But

410
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,199
Like okay

411
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,479
She said last week

412
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:15,391
Banana thing to say about cute considering chirp

413
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,208
How are you still waiting

414
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,608
I think the dreams she thinks the dream as a response to her saying show me what's going on oh my God we're all going to die

415
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,264
This sucks

416
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,568
Because okay. You don't have to yell bingo

417
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:38,176
Cuz the Bingo is going to be in this clip

418
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,200
I got you

419
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,016
Afterwards I'd like you to explain to me why

420
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:46,112
This is the punchline to the joke of the guests canceling

421
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,136
My

422
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:50,720
Guess who is supposed to be here she is actually

423
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,536
The Gate of gay woman and

424
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,304
She

425
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,584
Considers herself

426
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
If something of a time traveler

427
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,912
She

428
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,192
Is also involved

429
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,216
And researching

430
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:01,984
I guess

431
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,264
CV

432
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,288
Say the name

433
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,336
And

434
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,128
Her book is going to be about

435
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,408
So

436
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,200
Hopefully we can get her back

437
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,248
She was on my show

438
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,040
A few years ago

439
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,600
So why is it really f***** up at the

440
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:20,672
This guest Miss

441
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:23,232
If you are a time traveler

442
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
It seems like you would

443
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,072
At the very least be able to make plenty of things on time

444
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:30,400
You would never miss an appointment if you're a time traveler

445
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:33,728
Happy maybe you can't use time travel for this kind of mundanity

446
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:37,312
You know, she had to go to

447
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,104
Get her hair appointment

448
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,640
I would suggest

449
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:44,480
That if you're somebody who has power over time

450
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,528
Manipulate it

451
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,296
For what

452
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,344
To whatever extent you can

453
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:53,184
To the point where people save if you fancy yourself a time traveler

454
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,024
Isaac but time is something that's on your mind

455
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,048
I think

456
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:01,376
Punctuality is probably a priority for you even if

457
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:05,472
Your talents are imaginary

458
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,752
I think I take issue

459
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:11,360
With something here I think I Let It Go by the first time but

460
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:14,176
Can you fancy yourself a time traveler

461
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:20,576
You see it seems like you either are or not myself a man about town

462
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:29,280
I also never leave the apartment so

463
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:34,400
No I just got out of you are neither a man nor a time traveler

464
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,168
Yeah I see

465
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:38,496
I think that your instinct to let that go is good because

466
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,056
I don't know if you're ever going to get any further truth on it

467
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:41,824
I like

468
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,872
Now I will say

469
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,640
That

470
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:50,784
With this person who takes their time travel who has a book coming out about covid

471
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:56,928
That book should come out three years ago

472
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:03,328
Did you bring the book to warn us about the show a couple years ago

473
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:14,080
Yeah that would be a good one to go back and check if she was like 3 years I'm going to write a book about this s*** just so you know

474
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:17,664
Plies I have some questions will check in on that and see you

475
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,944
To do

476
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:25,856
Fun that is good reason to time travel

477
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,160
The classic thing is I gamble on them but like

478
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:31,488
If you could go watch some like amazing moments

479
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,512
From likes

480
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,536
Dispute

481
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,072
Catharsis of this crowd

482
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,376
Just freaking out kind of fun

483
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,168
Mannitol

484
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,984
Watch Jesse Owens run

485
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,776
Hitler's f****** face

486
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,824
This guest didn't show up

487
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,616
And they shut up

488
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,640
Cuz they're talking about you

489
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:51,200
But Carrie mentions another guest

490
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:51,968
Someone asks

491
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,808
Ask question about Robert David Steele who is of course

492
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,832
A real weirdo

493
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,160
Is a lot of irons in many fires

494
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,232
True he does not however fancy himself time

495
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,000
No

496
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:10,400
However he was the guy who was on Alex Jones Show and talked about how the globalist

497
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,960
Kidnapping children and taking them two faces in space

498
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,496
And enslaving them

499
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:18,592
And then Alex got mad that everybody thought you believed it because you are he said

500
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:24,992
Yeah I believe you you are correct 100%

501
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:28,064
Project Camelot

502
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,344
This clip is very

503
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,392
Confusing I'd like you to listen to this

504
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:35,232
I think we have a little bit more

505
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,256
To this story

506
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,536
About Robert Davis

507
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:40,352
Very interested in what's going on in his life

508
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,144
Now I understand it

509
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,192
Benjamin fulford has come

510
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,472
Forward

511
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:49,568
Saying that Robert David Steele should be there

512
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,360
Candidate

513
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,640
You know I actually have

514
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,408
Seen the post

515
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,200
Kind of outrageous

516
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,504
She is

517
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,784
This always

518
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,576
Working under the orders

519
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
The Triad

520
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,648
Videos

521
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,416
Going back

522
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,512
First of all the original video I did we

523
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,280
With him where he

524
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,304
States what happen

525
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,072
12 Emerald

526
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:11,840
Which he was threatened

527
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,632
And so on

528
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,656
And had to base

529
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,424
Sickly

530
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,240
I think if he wants to stay in

531
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,264
Japan and stay alive

532
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,592
ISO

533
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:25,152
Now he's coming out against Trump

534
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:25,920
Strangely

535
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:30,272
Apparently Robert David Steele has turned on Trump which I didn't know about

536
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:36,672
Mostly cuz I don't care

537
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,440
And

538
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,464
To stay alive yes

539
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,304
To do the bidding of the Triad

540
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,144
Struggling to really comprehend this so if I understand correctly

541
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,448
Let me read exactly what I wrote down

542
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,008
Works for the Triad in Japan

543
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,032
Now that's

544
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:56,640
Robert David Steele David Steele CIA agent

545
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:03,296
Is that was actually the CIA they got just what he says

546
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,112
Probably I don't know it look dude here's the thing

547
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,672
I've listened to a lot of Project Camelot

548
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:15,072
I don't know who the f*** the Triad our president

549
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,864
Cucuzza but now there's a Triad

550
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:23,776
It's got to be pretty well I hope it's at least a trio

551
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,312
Otherwise our in real

552
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:28,384
Yeah this is confusing I don't like this sort of late

553
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,456
Reveal of Japan

554
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,992
Outlook

555
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:39,392
Every time I've ever seen he's been in the same study just inside he always has by Skype

556
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:46,048
Very nice looking study foot look wonderful wood shelves and tons of books

557
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,632
Baby just got one of those backgrounds is like a Shinto Temple

558
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,936
And she's like oh well he obviously lives in Japan

559
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,216
Now I'll maybe

560
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,776
I don't know cuz I've also listen to Robert David

561
00:27:56,032 --> 00:28:01,408
Casteel's interview on like with Carrie

562
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,200
I don't remember the Triad

563
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,248
Coming up I don't remember Japan coming up

564
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,528
I remember any of this

565
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,344
I want to know who the Triad is

566
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,904
I want to know what they're doing with Robert

567
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,744
Think you can just toss that in there

568
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,048
Works

569
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,352
What's the Triad man in order to stay alive

570
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,400
The Illuminati

571
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,192
We know that

572
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:24,960
That there

573
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,544
Pretty involved in politics usually they like to Dabble

574
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,824
Yeah they're pushing back

575
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,848
About this election

576
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,152
Right now there's very

577
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,944
A great deal of

578
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:35,968
Evidence

579
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,248
Of Illuminati

580
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,272
Push back

581
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:44,416
I want to stop this really quick because one of the things that Carrie gets really upset about I really super upset

582
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,208
But not freaking out or anyting

583
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,864
She seems to be bummed out that people are not taking seriously the people who talk about

584
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,656
These allegations of wide

585
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:57,216
Spread fraud assure now

586
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,264
I would like to say that what

587
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,032
She does

588
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:00,800
In this clip

589
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:04,384
Is one of the reasons that no one takes these people seriously

590
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:08,992
Call this morning from someone one of my sources

591
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,528
Who said

592
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,552
Is that

593
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,600
I think it's Arizona.

594
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,648
The governor has come forward and said

595
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,440
Oh there's not enough

596
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,744
Boats to really cause a

597
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:20,768
Arica

598
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
And

599
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,584
So that Governor's Obby

600
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,864
We sleeping threatened

601
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:28,960
Obviously has gone on the side of the Illuminati even though

602
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,520
I think I have a

603
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,544
Arizona

604
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:35,872
Is the right person but I Arizona

605
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,640
Not sure

606
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,920
ISO

607
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:38,944
Dr. Eric

608
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,736
What I'm saying is that

609
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:44,576
Some governor and I heard it was a republican Governor I thought arras

610
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,368
Democrat

611
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,208
Anyone in the chat can

612
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:50,976
And let me know

613
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
Which it is

614
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:52,768
Do they have a gun

615
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,304
Cuz then I might

616
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,096
But this is what

617
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:56,864
Came out

618
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,632
This morning

619
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,960
Via source and it's out in the news

620
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:06,080
Details there. A lot a lot a lot of familiarity with

621
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:12,480
The topic I don't really know if it's a Republican or a Democrat or what they're talking about but I do know there's fraud

622
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:17,856
Like I I guess if you're mad that no one's taking that seriously I would suggest that you're not taking that

623
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:24,256
Seriously and that's why I asked to respond seriously to in Oman

624
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,816
Gets Arizona maybe somebody said something

625
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,096
Yeah the fuc

626
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:28,864
I'll do it

627
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:32,448
You can't care about recounts

628
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:38,336
Aliens that are real that is an issue for me to

629
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:41,408
Why do you care about electoral politics

630
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,224
Biden wins or Trump wins they're still

631
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,624
Extractor

632
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,440
Remaking them all day everyday what did I matter

633
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:55,488
Doesn't matter at all doesn't matter

634
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,536
Now that is true that is

635
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,816
Strange

636
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,632
These next two clips I think are really like

637
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,400
The balm

638
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,680
Little go on that

639
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:08,288
That to burn you're feeling this show is

640
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,872
Kind of nonsensical in the sense that it's somehow

641
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,896
Concerned with

642
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,944
Democratic politician

643
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,248
A tremendous amount of

644
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,808
Information and evidence out there the

645
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,832
The fighting is not all

646
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,392
One knows that

647
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,672
Watches my shows

648
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:30,048
That's just like all the other right-wing media outlets right

649
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,328
Just the same

650
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,656
Here is why Project Camelot is special

651
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:35,936
There's a

652
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:36,960
Tremendous amount of

653
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,288
Information and evidence out there the Biden is not

654
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,360
I was.

655
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,640
Is my show space

656
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,432
Case you don't know

657
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,760
There is reason to believe that he is a

658
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,528
Cyclone

659
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,064
Lyrica but I think

660
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,624
The clown he's also a walkie

661
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,952
The what

662
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:04,352
He's a walking that grow up man it's a walkie-talkie

663
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:07,680
Haircut

664
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:14,080
A gardener over here not knowing about what you want to come on man

665
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:20,480
I'd like you've been there know I did think it was a possibility but

666
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,248
Yes

667
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:27,648
We have a situation where you're talking about something very standard and right-wing is not all there

668
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,464
Explanation for it is why I'm single

669
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,768
He has he's a clone you and not only that

670
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,816
Walk-in

671
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:39,168
Come on man you're really embarrassing yourself

672
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,448
I'm willing to accept

673
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,496
You might be a Wocket

674
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:49,408
Well I can tell you that one of the things that might lead you to believe that he's a walk-in is

675
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,968
If he uses language weirdly

676
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,760
There's one particular

677
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,528
Clip

678
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,552
Actually

679
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,320
Quite funny

680
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,368
But also

681
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,392
Uncertain

682
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,416
Where he sang

683
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,208
I am going to

684
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,232
To be Joe Biden

685
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:04,768
That's what he says

686
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,792
And

687
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,840
He says quite a few others

688
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,376
Things that indicate to me

689
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,448
An alien who hasn't quite

690
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,240
Learn the English language

691
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,776
And so tense to put

692
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:19,616
Some words backwards or together that don't belong to go

693
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:23,968
But

694
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,504
My my instinct

695
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,040
Tends to say

696
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,832
This is kind of a man in Black

697
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,880
If you didn't know what Men in Black

698
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,160
We're supposed to be bodies

699
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,184
I know this going

700
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:33,952
Sound

701
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:38,816
What do you think these that have been dead and reanimate

702
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,096
And then

703
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,144
There's Bass

704
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,936
Physically a walk in and they get

705
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,496
They behave as if

706
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,264
They're alive

707
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:51,616
Apparently the dead body that an alien walks into

708
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:58,784
I mean I guess I can't really argue with any of it into a dead body

709
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:06,976
That is not what the movie Men in Black was about bettaway

710
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,536
Yeah

711
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,840
That's good!

712
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,632
The sound weird sometimes

713
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,192
I just Simone

714
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:22,336
Struggling struggling with their evidence

715
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,640
It said she ever hurt herself

716
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,432
Like you did she think that somebody

717
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,968
Could not possibly find

718
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:34,368
Misspoken it's because someone is shooting 5G at her

719
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:40,768
Spider attacks

720
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,536
Metronome that is like

721
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,840
Trump Miss speaks A Lot 24

722
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:48,960
This is where it comes to this where the rubber meets explains that I'm glad

723
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,752
Now I know that people used to

724
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,520
Criticize

725
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,288
Trump

726
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
Because Trump

727
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,152
Sort of uses language in a certain way but it

728
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,176
It's very unique

729
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:58,944
Him

730
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,480
And he's communicate

731
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,504
Show it

732
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,808
You have to have discernment and be able to

733
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,600
Totality of that word so much

734
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:12,000
Well do you hate it because it's the truth I hate it because they don't know what it means in the continue saying it over and over

735
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:16,352
And it's proof that there's an alien up in them

736
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,912
Corsage

737
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,800
Communicating and he's individualistic Ryan the only way to know the

738
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:28,896
Prince between the two is discernment my friend right now let me posit you this be real

739
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,920
Alright

740
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,200
Alien wise

741
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,224
Okay

742
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,528
Makes mistakes in the way that

743
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,064
We would consider Norm

744
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:41,952
Asian person who

745
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,768
Is talking in a very unique and individualistic way

746
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:48,608
Then that suggests that fighting is making mistakes in a way that is very common

747
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,424
Perhaps Perhaps

748
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:56,288
As if there's if that's your composure I'm in common for an alien who doesn't know in

749
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,568
What I would

750
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:02,688
Suggest though is that it is more likely the alien is somebody who is doing something different

751
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:06,272
From what we would consider to be relatively

752
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:09,344
Non-unique Behavior can I ask you a question sure

753
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,184
There's more than one alien right that you can walk in

754
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,488
Why would you choose one who doesn't know English

755
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,792
Like why would you ever choose

756
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,352
The alien for that assignment

757
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:26,752
Who is weird with the English got to cut its teeth on some assignment you know nobody starts out the most

758
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,288
Experience alien walk

759
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:30,848
We meet you to possess the f******

760
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:37,248
President of the United States

761
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:43,648
Make a lot of Publix

762
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:48,256
Know much English look at the Raptor being as a little bit iffy on verbs

763
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:54,912
Now I like that as a I think I like that isn't like relative place of earthlings in the universe

764
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,448
Is there like this is the guys

765
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:03,872
This is the guy starting out the new guy who's got to try and take over the president he's learning for a more

766
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,408
Fishing knot

767
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,200
At all not at all

768
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:10,016
This indicates to me either these aliens are

769
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:10,784
F****** in cop

770
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:16,416
They don't actually really want it there just f****** around Thursday to playful

771
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:22,816
That's not fair I mean I do know that English is one of those languages that's like notoriously difficult to learn

772
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:29,216
Later in life

773
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:35,616
Could this be something like that definitely be able to understand

774
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,968
I still say that if I'm an alien I'm not

775
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:44,064
Signing off on the walk-in who doesn't know English communicating

776
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,344
Probably job number one

777
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,392
For someone who's running for public office

778
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,928
I would say

779
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,000
Sorry you're a great walk Henry

780
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,424
Bad speaker lucky do a lot of good stuff we're going to keep you on here you're not

781
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,496
Man

782
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,032
I wonder

783
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,080
When did he become a walk-in

784
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:11,968
Going to walk in this entire time or recently become a

785
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,736
No idea

786
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,504
Alright

787
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,528
Etsy

788
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,064
I think maybe

789
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,856
That might be good for us

790
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,648
Because his previous policies

791
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,672
Not good

792
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:26,048
So now maybe he's an alien who's going to be a more Progressive politician I like it

793
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,096
Well

794
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:32,960
Is probably still in there

795
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:33,728
Recognize

796
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,776
Derek could still be

797
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,312
Joe Biden assault

798
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,128
Can still be in the body at the same time but they

799
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:40,896
The push to the

800
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,200
And they are not really able

801
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
Go to communicate

802
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,760
Variety

803
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,552
Is or they may actually be

804
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,576
Completely

805
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,624
Walled-off

806
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,160
And occupied else

807
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:52,928
I swear

808
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,464
Just trying to hang on to

809
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,256
Really being there

810
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:00,352
And this can happen with a lot of illnesses

811
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,888
People so it's not

812
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
Not that unusual

813
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:08,288
But what is unusual and what the Illuminati dark magicians must be

814
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,312
Laughing there

815
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,336
Their asses off

816
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,360
About

817
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:12,896
Is the fact

818
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,200
That the American people have actually voted for

819
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,272
So I know that hilarious

820
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,576
A sort of a slap in the face

821
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,856
Behind the scenes

822
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,904
Ministration who have

823
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,184
Plenty of magicians

824
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,072
You are going to see through these clothes and no

825
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,608
That's what they're doing

826
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:39,008
The slap-in-the-face for Trump's magician magician

827
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:43,104
So embarrassed that they lost to a walk-in

828
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,688
I see now I've got a whole new world that I would enjoy twice as much

829
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,992
Imagine if Rudy Giuliani was it

830
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,040
Exactly is incompetent in Marana

831
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:53,600
But could also fail at using Magic

832
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:58,976
That be great I love it

833
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:05,376
I love it much like the idea of Robert David Steele being in the employee of the Triad the walk-in is a new

834
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,144
Neutered

835
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,984
But I've not heard on other

836
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,032
Did this is really expanding

837
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:15,104
Can you reach that so using the power of love

838
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,176
They're really good

839
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:23,040
So recently election weird Steve pieczenik

840
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:28,416
Come on the Wardrobe with Owen Shroyer and talk about how the election was actually an elaborate set-up

841
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,696
Yep news blog

842
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:34,048
Chain technology and barcodes watermark

843
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,352
Then they immediately

844
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:37,888
30%

845
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,936
Didn't have that issue a retraction

846
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,984
Qanon

847
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,288
Carrie's into that

848
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,336
Obviously a lot more votes

849
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,872
Trump then went

850
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:48,640
For Biden

851
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,920
In truth

852
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,712
But

853
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:52,736
We it

854
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,504
It's a very good

855
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,040
This time at least

856
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:55,808
At the moment

857
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,832
To know exact

858
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,600
Play how many

859
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,648
You know for

860
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,232
So

861
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,256
I I think

862
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,280
Perhaps

863
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,048
The

864
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,328
The blockchain Estates

865
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:09,376
Is revealing some of this

866
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,680
But I'm actually

867
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,960
I'm sure

868
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,752
I'm curious

869
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,520
How the block

870
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,544
Watching with you

871
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,336
If it was used it was you

872
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,128
You know and

873
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,152
Thoughts

874
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:22,944
Sort of software

875
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:23,968
Yeah I'm curious

876
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:27,808
It's too but I also don't entertain any of these ideas

877
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,576
Cuz they're very

878
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,368
Stupid it's it's really unfortunate

879
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:33,952
To continue to hear well obviously this thing is true I'm curious

880
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:39,840
Sister how or why they did it but obviously there's massive amounts of fraud

881
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,632
But I don't

882
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:47,264
Cuz I just wanted play that clip just to illustrate that like out here's the connection with Steve

883
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,288
China King all that b*******

884
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,592
Should not send

885
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,384
Because I'm too excited

886
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,663
About this next Highway

887
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,711
This next clip oppa

00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,247
Opens up all sorts of

889
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,527
Nuvista operas

890
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,551
I had

891
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,343
How did whistleblower

892
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,367
That was revealing

893
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,415
What is an essence

894
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,695
The fight in the Pacific

895
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,463
With our

896
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,487
Navy

897
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,535
And these myrrh

898
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,303

00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,863
Thank you

900
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,399
Back in

901
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,191
Basically associated with

902
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,215
With movie underwater

903
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:18,751
I am

904
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,543
Sailors

905
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,335
So I had a whistleblower in this

906
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,615
Disregard an

907
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:27,967
I'd like that you were nodding aggressively through that

908
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,015
Totally the sailors

909
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,295
The Sailor

910
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:37,695
Associated with the kingdom of moves people

911
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:40,767
What are navy got mixed up at some point

912
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,375
Love it

913
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:51,775
Few more details on this massive do like trillion-dollar destroyers have

914
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:58,175
Issue with merpeople and Triton related back then

915
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:02,783
The holes are so reinforced trident

916
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,831
We've learned from the wooden Hulls

917
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:08,159
I just feel like these are issues we're like we need to

918
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:08,927
Saddle

919
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:10,719
Fundamental precept

920
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,511
Like we just need to like

921
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:19,167
I'm not going to believe you when you tell me that there was a battle with mu and be good merpeople at Harmony

922
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:23,263
Until you prove to me that merpeople

923
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,335
I can't go to the second

924
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,895
Sad because I'm not granted you the first one

925
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,967
People are taking his red

926
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:36,063
How many species continue to go undiscovered everyday

927
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,879
Raptors Mercantile dog

928
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,951
All the time you can buy

929
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:42,975
Merpeople

930
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,535
Big beetles in Vietnam

931
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,607
People are down there

932
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,631
Sure

933
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:53,215
So problem for the Illuminati and all them

934
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:05,503
Turns out they've tried a bunch but also if they do kill him it's mutually assured destruction so they

935
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:09,855
In

936
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,391
The chat is saying

937
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,695
She would have been killed Trump would have been

938
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,231
And killed by February if

939
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:15,999
If you want

940
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,559
Well

941
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:19,839
They've tried to

942
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:20,863
Kill him many

943
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,399
Palmetto

944
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,679
Important to realize that

945
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:25,983
It again is

946
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,775
Is it's kind of like a very

947
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,055
Stand

948
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,615
Be honest it's a lot like

949
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,383
You know the guy

950
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,663
Right showing

951
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:36,479
If you start feeling people on one side

952
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,503
By then the other side is

953
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,807
People on your side

954
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,343
And pretty soon they'll be no

955
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,111
Already left

956
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,391
So mute

957
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,159
Call Mutual

958
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:45,695
Destruction

959
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,487
And so this is not

960
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:48,767
And some people

961
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:49,791
The nuclear

962
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,559
Option

963
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,863
This is not really a notch

964
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:55,167
For the game being played

965
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,191
Today and

966
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,727
It doesn't mean they won't

967
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,263
Don't try doesn't mean

968
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,543
It couldn't have

969
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,079
I'm just saying that

970
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:02,847
I know they've

971
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:03,615
Try the number

972
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,383
X

973
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,407
I believe that

974
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:07,199
That Trump and team do have

975
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:08,991
And cool

976
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:09,759
Yai

977
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:16,159
To think that it should mean that they wouldn't try that they wouldn't try it

978
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:20,511
Direction and it's not the way the game is being played to or whatever that

979
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:26,399
It should not be a situation where they've tried and failed a bunch of time because they would know that if they succeeded they would

980
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:32,799
Destroy themselves in process but I mean you look at you look at Cold War history and I can actually see

981
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,847
See people deciding like

982
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,383
Well here's my problem with that

983
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:40,991
The Soviet Union existed

984
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,527
That is a good point

985
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,087
Stuff to get around that

986
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,647
So if he's got ET protection yes

987
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:51,743
Probably from Pleiadians by the way probably cuz there's a good ones

988
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:55,327
Well hold on I don't know if you know this

989
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,607
What they were actually

990
00:45:56,863 --> 00:46:03,007
You don't almost every time we've ever heard Carrie talk about alien races they're always uniform

991
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,543
They're always like

992
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:09,919
These ones are good because like they are all like

993
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:14,015
Resonating with something or what if there's some sort of like

994
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,575
There's a magical element to it's like you cannot

995
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:22,975
Be bad if you are whatever that is unspoken

996
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:29,631
It turns out that might not be the case Okay so please radians are actually evil Ono

997
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,655
I believe that

998
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,447
Trump and team do have

999
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:34,751
Of

1000
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,543
At least one race and I'm pretty sure it's

1001
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,567
Pleiadians

1002
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,359
But it's a certain division

1003
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,175
Because there are some dark

1004
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:45,759
And that was

1005
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,295
Proven by my interview

1006
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,319
With Eddie

1007
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:51,647
Eddie

1008
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,695
His name

1009
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,463
I'm drawing a blank on

1010
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:55,999
Hey

1011
00:46:56,255 --> 00:47:02,399
I love the idea

1012
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:06,751
The words that was proven by my interviews

1013
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:12,895
We can really good boy we can either decide from these interviews

1014
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:16,991
Eddie Paige is a raven crazy person

1015
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,015
The fact that he's an alien

1016
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:22,879
We can believe that some idioms must be evil

1017
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,207
Well there is that

1018
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,767
That's where is that interesting

1019
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,303
Decision-making tree

1020
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,071
Bike

1021
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:33,119
I can't not believe that he's a Pleiades

1022
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:39,007
Must mean that there are evil. That's a good point or you could just say

1023
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,823
Guys talkingshit he was talking s***

1024
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:45,919
Only because he wasn't evil play 80 and it doesn't have to be an either-or C

1025
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:46,687
Situation dance

1026
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:50,271
I got to say it's a liberating to not believe any of this

1027
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:52,063
It is nice it is nice

1028
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:56,415
I feel less trapped in making up my own bulshit on a daily and concentrate

1029
00:47:56,671 --> 00:48:00,767
It's very simple to explain what's going on

1030
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,839
Don't need to go further

1031
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,631
Mercury can speak freely

1032
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:09,727
All the s*** you want for CNN

1033
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,775
One of the reasons I can speak

1034
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,055
Speak so freely

1035
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,103
Here is that unconsidered

1036
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:16,639
Super friend

1037
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:19,455
If I was mainstream they probably

1038
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:22,015
Probably would have fired me or killed me

1039
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:23,551
A long time

1040
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,087
You know so

1041
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,623
It's when

1042
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,671
We're out on The Fringe that were allowed

1043
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,439
How to get away with

1044
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,719
Talking like this

1045
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,743
I saw though I am

1046
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,023
Under attack

1047
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,815
And sometimes

1048
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:36,607
It's very awesome

1049
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,167
To strike

1050
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:47,103
Call Aetna Point she can speak freely because

1051
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,919
Is her boss

1052
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,455
You know do one can

1053
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,479
Can stop her from

1054
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:56,831
But yeah if you had an employer you wouldn't fired long ago

1055
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,415
Cuz you don't do good

1056
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:05,279
Yeah sure we would have been fired long ago not this early because

1057
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:09,375
You know terrible work with because why would anyone pay us to do this

1058
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:10,911
It's inaccurate

1059
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:13,471
There is a freedom that comes with

1060
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:19,871
It's like not being attached to some kind of a big entity or or something

1061
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:21,919
Inherently like

1062
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:24,479
Integrity

1063
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,759
Bearing about it

1064
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,039
Strategist

1065
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:31,391
Killed if you work for CNA had fired

1066
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,415
You talkin about

1067
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:35,231
F****** Murphy people battles

1068
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:41,631
Interesting thing to hear on our Navy took out three or four people and broke a tree

1069
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,703
Oh god dammit

1070
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:46,751
Tradies Rogan

1071
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:52,639
I like her version of the house we always live in the the enemies both

1072
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:57,247
Ultra powered and Incredibly impossible to it can't win in what you know

1073
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,783
Super Why

1074
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,319
Purse feels more like

1075
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,855
A game though because she's like

1076
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:05,183
I'm allowed to do all this stuff cuz I'm On The Fringe

1077
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,975
They're still attacking me though

1078
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:12,607
So it's like a legitimate same thing for her is like why would you

1079
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,631
Do an attack

1080
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:14,911
Unless you

1081
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:20,287
Kind of mean it to fail over and over and over again if you want do you want to inconvenience

1082
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:26,687
The people like her where a truth-teller is but you don't want to make Martyrs of them I'm connected

1083
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:31,807
Combining her and Alex's police about this the way they rationalize

1084
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,343
Like hey I've existed

1085
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,135
For a long time and no one seems to

1086
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:35,903
Sicario

1087
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:38,463
Kind of like yeah if you went

1088
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:41,279
If you act too hard against me it would prove me right

1089
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:45,887
Or that kind of but if you didn't go against me at all I would

1090
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,167
Be too powerful

1091
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:49,215
I would okay

1092
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:50,751
Alright so it's sabotage

1093
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,287
That's what they're more in

1094
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:55,615
Disconnecting know I can see you have figured it out.

1095
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:57,407
She's going to

1096
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:03,551
Series on the same page is Steven terms of the like water marks on Fallas Sherlock change the whole thing

1097
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:07,903
Seems to be on another sort of similar to a pin that is really thinking

1098
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,719
Melania

1099
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:11,999
Thoughts about

1100
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,023
Melania

1101
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,351
Well

1102
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,399
I think Melania is

1103
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,447
Let me just say that

1104
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,215
Captain Mark

1105
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,775
Says he believes Melania is it

1106
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,311
With Annie.

1107
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,615
And that she is a canoe it

1108
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,383
Conduit

1109
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,407
For Trump

1110
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:30,431
To get

1111
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:31,711
The download

1112
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:32,735
And

1113
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,319
And I think that's a very pie

1114
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:38,623
Yeah

1115
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,647
I got that

1116
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,671
San Marco

1117
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:42,975
She's not fully

1118
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,023
And that's also

1119
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:50,911
I think it was an interesting wave at people like hairy or trying to

1120
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,191
Rationalize

1121
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:58,591
Say at the sense that Melania doesn't seem to be doing anyting interested at all in this.

1122
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:03,199
Trying to have this like alright Trump

1123
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:05,247
Is a superhuman battling against

1124
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,551
The forces of Darkness

1125
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:11,903
Demonica child abusers who live under the Getty museum or whatever the

1126
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,207
The f*** Indian like you have this heroic

1127
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:16,255
Figure and then his wife is somebody who just

1128
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,535
Seems to not give a s***

1129
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,815
Buy anything

1130
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:23,167
In order to make that make sense you have to create this elaborate backstory was I guess

1131
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,727
Don't talk that much in public doesn't get involved with too much

1132
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:28,031
A conduit for the

1133
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,567
Spell Trump with his secret

1134
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,103
Protection sure sure

1135
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,639
So do the aliens

1136
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:34,175
Get like upgrade

1137
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,455
Okay

1138
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:38,271
The aliens upgrade Trump with a new wife

1139
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:40,063
And that's why he's had so many

1140
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:45,183
Yeah I mean I guess I guess that's one way you could get around way you do it yeah

1141
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:48,511
Trump with the help of his conduit wife

1142
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,327
He's doing

1143
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:54,143
Can't stress this enough

1144
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,447
There's big adrenochrome

1145
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,215
Out there

1146
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:59,263
Okay you know how those big Pharma

1147
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,055
Bigeloil

1148
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,591
There's also a big

1149
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:06,175
Adrenochrome manufacturing Industries publicly traded

1150
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:08,223
On the black market

1151
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:09,503
Secret market

1152
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:13,599
Yes Market

1153
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,647
And this is so crucial

1154
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:16,927
And that's the same thing

1155
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,463
Adrenochrome

1156
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,231
And that whole

1157
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,023
Manufacturing

1158
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,047
Production line

1159
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,071
Find that involves

1160
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,095
You know

1161
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,375
Taking a baby

1162
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,679
You know from their parents

1163
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:28,703
Whatever

1164
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,471
Or even

1165
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:30,495
Invade Iraq

1166
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:32,543
Creating test tube baby

1167
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,335
As product

1168
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,359
And then

1169
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,639
Adrenochrome

1170
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:37,919
Rend

1171
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:40,223
This is a very diabolic

1172
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,247
Process

1173
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,295
There's nothing they have

1174
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,063
Control over

1175
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,343
Disregard

1176
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,623
Now they may be at

1177
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:47,903
Get

1178
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,951
And that has to involve

1179
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,231
A battle

1180
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,767
And you can

1181
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,047
Nicely

1182
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,839
So that means

1183
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:56,607
A war

1184
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:57,631
That means

1185
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,911
The one with

1186
00:53:59,167 --> 00:53:59,679
The biggest gun

1187
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,447
When

1188
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:01,471
You know the best

1189
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,239
Technology

1190
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,543
And so on

1191
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,311
So

1192
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,079
This is what

1193
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:06,847
We're dealing with

1194
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,383
And what she's dealing with

1195
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,151
That's what

1196
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:09,919
Dealing with

1197
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:16,319
He's dealing with a manufacturing industry and I'll trying to make this to babies to scare and then drink it

1198
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:21,439
I got to be honest all too often I don't really think about what he has

1199
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:28,095
Empathize a little bit more question though

1200
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,423
So we can clone people

1201
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,447
Right

1202
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:34,239
Okay so

1203
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:37,311
That means we can basically manufacturer

1204
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,103
Bodies

1205
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:43,711
Right-wing that suggest we could also manufacture just

1206
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,479
The blood

1207
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:47,295
And we can also synthesize adrenochrome

1208
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,319
So

1209
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:53,183
I don't understand it so I guess it has to be some like dark ritual thing that they're talking about

1210
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:55,231
The game The Intergalactic strength

1211
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:55,999
I guess

1212
00:54:56,255 --> 00:55:02,399
But in this cosmology it seems like you could just really easily manufacture Underworld movies

1213
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:05,471
We ever talk about movies whenever we're talking about Carrie Carter

1214
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:09,567
You can make your own talking blood and you move on everybody gets a good job yeah

1215
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,335
Yeah

1216
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,663
You know it's interesting that they do

1217
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:16,735
Ever go down that road of of thought

1218
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:19,295
It's to their detriment

1219
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:22,367
Because it's a big gaping hole in tire

1220
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,135
But

1221
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,439
What I think is interesting about the way that Carrie is

1222
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:30,303
Expressing this in presenting it is like this is not going to end without a war

1223
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,351
So if

1224
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,631
Award

1225
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,655
Doesn't happen

1226
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,191
Internally

1227
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:36,959
Sure

1228
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:42,079
Then that is evidence that this adrenochrome manufacturing is going all up and rougher

1229
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:45,407
There must be a giant conflagration

1230
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,431
Where else

1231
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:48,991
There is no change in the status quo

1232
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:53,343
That's f***** up what if we got Congress to regulate the industry

1233
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:04,607
What is an electoral politics why isn't she campaigning for enough Senators income

1234
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,375
Congressperson

1235
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:08,703
To write a law regulating the use of adrenochrome

1236
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:10,495
You broke my brain

1237
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:14,335
I don't know why she's not trying to go to Civic route

1238
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:21,247
I'm just saying if we got a participatory Republic I think she should start there instead of

1239
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:25,343
The secret war that might be a good first step

1240
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:29,951
At this point carries kind of running out of energy in like out of

1241
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,487
You know petering out a little

1242
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,023
Sticks couple Quest

1243
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:34,303
Distance from the chat

1244
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,119
I don't think that she actually reads the questions themselves

1245
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:39,679
But response to them first one is about

1246
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:40,703
The queen

1247
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:43,263
Find out if there's anything else

1248
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:53,503
Okay so somebody thing

1249
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:55,807
Did the queen was

1250
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:56,575
Beheaded

1251
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:58,111
And we don't have the regular

1252
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,671
Whatever

1253
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,743
Is a lot of this is

1254
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:04,511
Picture in my

1255
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,559
These people

1256
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:07,839
Put out the stuff

1257
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:08,863
That doesn't mean

1258
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:11,167
Everyone knows the queens of walk-in

1259
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,959
Call man

1260
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:16,287
Dum Dums think that the queen is a clone that's not true

1261
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:19,871
Joe Biden's the Clone duh

1262
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,663
So strange

1263
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:23,455
To try and figure out like what

1264
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,479
The difference between

1265
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:26,015
Conjecture and conjecture

1266
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:28,319
Sure. What completely different don't

1267
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:34,463
It was proven in the interviews with Eddie Paige dance on play demons are evil

1268
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:37,535
That's all you need to know

1269
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,071
The call about whether or not Trump

1270
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,351
Is an otaku

1271
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,887
Oh that's good question

1272
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,703
Anunnaki

1273
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:45,471
No

1274
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,263
The mountain.

1275
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,311
Is not

1276
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,615
Azaria

1277
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:54,175
General Patton

1278
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:56,735
She is

1279
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:57,503
Commission

1280
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,551
Is

1281
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,087
Alien

1282
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:06,975
Incarnation of a general

1283
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:11,839
General the D General Patton that we are speaking of

1284
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:12,863
Okay

1285
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:13,887
When did he die

1286
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:14,655
Actually

1287
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,959
I did look this up he died

1288
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:23,615
Just before Trump was really who maybe he is I think that's why I assumed that's why they

1289
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:30,015
Otherwise they would feel real stupid

1290
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:31,295
Buick 6-8 months off

1291
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:39,743
Cartoon 64 60-month spiritually Lounge Lounge

1292
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:44,351
Yeah you know you're right

1293
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,887
I got you

1294
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:48,703
At this point Carrie discusses

1295
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:50,239
Israel and

1296
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:52,799
Her feelings.

1297
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:58,431
I'm going to say I don't respect her enough to even even

1298
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,711
Like a joke

1299
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:00,735
About

1300
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:04,575
Terrible's is stupider ideas

1301
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:09,183
Get into more interesting territory

1302
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,999
Alex Jones believes

1303
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:13,791
But there is a virus

1304
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:16,351
Covid-19 is

1305
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:21,215
But it's also a hoax even though he has David Icke on who says that it's not real at all

1306
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:26,335
That's another version of this

1307
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:29,151
Put also seems to believe in medical science

1308
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,735
I guess Terry doesn't believe virus

1309
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,271
Okay

1310
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:36,319
My understanding of viruses

1311
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,623
And I credit.

1312
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,647
Actor Robert Young

1313
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:41,951
Teach me about this

1314
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:42,975
Is that

1315
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:45,279
Actually they've never isolated

1316
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,047
A real vibe

1317
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,583
Viruses

1318
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,351
Azar

1319
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,399
Are not what you think

1320
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:51,679
And that there

1321
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,959
Simply poison

1322
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,007
Ourselves

1323
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,287
When were

1324
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,311
When my face

1325
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:58,591
A poison

1326
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,383
An inner environment

1327
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:01,663
Through food we

1328
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:12,671
8 how you think she might be right A lot of the times I worry that my humors and eicher's are out of balance with each other and that

1329
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:14,719
Going to happen and then you'll just start

1330
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:21,375
Influencing a lot of people thought stuff like that but like you Murs

1331
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:23,679
View

1332
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,215
People thought about like

1333
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,263
Jerbs

1334
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,031
Yeah

1335
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,567
But they were wrong

1336
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:30,847
The viruses are

1337
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:31,615
The part of what

1338
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:32,639
Germs

1339
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:33,919
And germ Theory

1340
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:34,943
Burial

01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:36,991
Please activate

1342
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,015
Sure

1343
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,039
And then that

1344
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:39,807
Information

1345
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,087
Was actually

1346
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,367
As usual

1347
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:43,903
Wrong

1348
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,439
And doctor

1349
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,463
I've been several

1350
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:47,999
Dr. Robert Young

1351
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,023
About all of this

1352
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:50,559
Gone my way

1353
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:51,839
Website search under his

1354
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:53,631
And find those inner

1355
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,167
Play recommend them

1356
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:56,703
If you want to find out

1357
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,727
History

1358
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,263
And why germ Theory

1359
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,823
At is no longer believe

1360
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:02,591
By the most

1361
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,639
Intelligent advance

1362
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,919
Doctors

1363
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,455
So that's

1364
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:08,991
Important

1365
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:13,855
You got to do a little better than Robert Young as your reference

1366
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:18,975
Not we talked about him on another Project Camelot episode has the guy who like went to jail

1367
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,815
You talk someone into

1368
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,863
Not to getting treatment

1369
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:25,631
For cancer

1370
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:28,959
And like getting likes his like holistic approach

1371
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:30,495
And then they got

1372
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:33,823
Stage 4 incurable progression

1373
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:34,847
I got sued for like

1374
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:36,127
Millions of dollars

1375
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:38,175
Isn't that like malpractice

1376
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:39,711
Have a license

1377
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,479
Enter.

1378
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,039
Cuvee most

1379
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:49,439
Advanced hippest coolest Doctor Who's telling you all about how germ theory is wrong

1380
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,207
For doctors

1381
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:52,767
Cuz this is silly

1382
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:54,559
I'll agree I like her collar

1383
01:01:54,815 --> 01:02:00,959
It's very old-fashioned compared to obviously things Creator Insider

1384
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:03,775
Your cells and then they explode out whenever it's poison that's

1385
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:07,871
That's brand-new researched and nobody is ever thought hit that

1386
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:11,967
Maybe spontaneous generation of poisons could explode through your body

1387
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:16,575
That's a new one to look dude

1388
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:18,623
It's all a plot by

1389
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,903
The aliens

1390
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:22,463
Maybe

1391
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:24,255
So you think

1392
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,023
Germs

1393
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:27,583
Viruses that everything is contagious

1394
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,351
It's not

1395
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,375
But you know what are

1396
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:31,679
Bad dreams memes

1397
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,703
What is contagious

1398
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,263
And can be

1399
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,543
Taken in through osmosis

1400
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,615
And in essence

1401
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:40,895
Through mean

1402
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,943
Is the mental

1403
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:45,759
Thank you Cat

1404
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,295
Because you are

1405
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,319
Become

1406
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,623
Eating my mind

1407
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:53,439
40 become persuaded

1408
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,463
Influence

1409
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:55,487
Mental

1410
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,071
So that means that when you

1411
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,351
Are in a household

1412
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:01,887
What is it called

1413
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:03,167
You can easily

1414
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:03,935
Catch

1415
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,215
Through what

1416
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,239
Empathy

1417
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,287
And so

1418
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:09,567
This is

1419
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,359
It's all in the way you feel

1420
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:13,919
That's first

1421
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:14,687
First and foremost

1422
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:23,903
Now interesting late this would be really easy or I mean there would be a way to scientifically Tryon

1423
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,439
And I get to the bottom

1424
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:27,231
To construct something

1425
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:31,583
Knowing that someone you care about deeply is sick causes you to get sick

1426
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:35,679
And I don't think that studies have borne that out

1427
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:40,799
Oh yeah yeah yeah when you're in a house with someone who has a contagious

1428
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,871
Yeah you get it because you

1429
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:48,991
That would be indistinguishable from getting it because of germs

1430
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:53,855
Attitude very easily if say you were

1431
01:03:54,111 --> 01:04:00,255
Long distance away from subject like that's what I'm saying very deeply but I don't know of any transmission of diseases

1432
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,535
Is long distance

1433
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:05,375
There's no morphic transmission of disease scary can

1434
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,143
Established

1435
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:08,703
There's no point me to some literature on it

1436
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:09,727
I'd be interested

1437
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:12,287
But I've had a doctor with your name on it

1438
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:14,335
Robert Young

1439
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:20,991
Not going to listen to him oh boy I got one last thing to say here she's talking to a lot of people all around the world

1440
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:22,783
And they're all interested in the select

1441
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:25,599
People all over the world

1442
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:26,879
You know Anaconda

1443
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,695
I travel so much

1444
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,231
In the past

1445
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,791
Traveling lately

1446
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,607
And I

1447
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:39,423
They are also a small

1448
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,447
Realize that

1449
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:43,007
In a certain sense this is all about

1450
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:44,287
Who is going to run

1451
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,311
Planet Earth

1452
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,103
At least on the humans

1453
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:53,759
So

1454
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:54,527
Oki

1455
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,063
Think I am

1456
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:57,343
I am

1457
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:59,135
So they've done for now

1458
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:00,159
Epic 2

1459
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:02,463
I don't know I think that it's such a gross

1460
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:06,559
Perspective 3 like whoever wins this election is who's going to run the planet

1461
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:13,727
Just because I mean first of all it's so america-centric so disrespectful to the other countries of the world

1462
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,007
What's second

1463
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,031
Like I don't

1464
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,055
Sit like a horse

1465
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,359
What everything to

1466
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,895
Turn out that Biden

1467
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,175
Becomes president

1468
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:28,831
I don't want him running the world know very strange that these people people like carry people like Alex

1469
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:31,647
They do want Trump running the world

1470
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:32,671
100%

1471
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:34,719
Defeat

1472
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:41,119
It's just so weird like why would you want that even if you like this guy I liked Obama

1473
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:45,727
Is President obviously had some problems in a lot of policies and decisions

1474
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:48,287
But even as much as I supported

1475
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:54,687
Hermes the president of United States that never would want him to be the head of the world

1476
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:55,711
No

1477
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:58,015
It's it's very silly it's childish

1478
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:58,783
Yeah

1479
01:05:59,039 --> 01:05:59,551
I don't

1480
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:02,623
Get how they can drive those two things

1481
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:03,903
Together without just

1482
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:05,695
Openly saying like

1483
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:09,535
I want the end of all participatory governance

1484
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:11,327
.

1485
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:14,143
I mean if you have you can't vote

1486
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:16,447
For aliens like if you believe that that

1487
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,471
The real world

1488
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,263
What's going on behind the scenes

1489
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:24,895
What does it really matter if you give up the pretense of democracynow.org

1490
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:26,175
Sure

1491
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:31,551
Yeah you can feel good about casting a vote but that persons working for a lizard

1492
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:32,831
So doesn't matter

1493
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:35,903
Really

1494
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:40,255
Like the thing that's interesting to me about how they always go about this

1495
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,023
This is that

1496
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:42,815
At no point in time is it like

1497
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:45,119
Let's get enough people together

1498
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,399
Because they know that they

1499
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,423
Actually get paid

1500
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:50,751
Anythink

1501
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:54,591
Let's get a movement together there just like it has it all has to be in secret

1502
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:57,663
Because if I try to get a bunch of people to know it they

1503
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:58,687
Realize that I'm going to

1504
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:05,087
Option option is someone else build something and then co-opted

1505
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:05,855
Yeah

1506
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:07,391
Yep but look

1507
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,415
I just think like

1508
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:11,231
You know I start to feel like

1509
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,535
Spit really bad

1510
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:14,559
For these people

1511
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:16,607
Like this is this is sad

1512
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,423
Like if you're somebody who's like

1513
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:23,519
I'm all about the ins-and-outs of secret programs

1514
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,567
And I'm all about the like

1515
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:32,223
All these aliens have been visiting us forever and my friend is definitely not a murderer talks to Raptors in prison

1516
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:34,783
He tells me all about these Great Space Adventures

1517
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:36,319
Spaceships

1518
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:37,599
You should not give a

1519
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:39,135
S*** about a president

1520
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:40,671
Degrading

1521
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,695
For you too

1522
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,975
Okay so

1523
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:44,511
Business

1524
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:46,815
Revealing anything about space

1525
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,863
He's not you so I can approve you right

1526
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,655
Do you know that

1527
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,959
I think one of the hugest thing

1528
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:54,495
That's been an issue for them

1529
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:57,823
With Trump being president

1530
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:03,711
Because we've heard this joke so many times or I at least I have this the the joke so many times like

1531
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:08,319
When Obama was President I didn't have to care about politics that's why I liked him

1532
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,087
Cuz I could

1533
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:13,439
Could walk do my day and think that there's a reasonable person who's try

1534
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,719
You know

1535
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:16,255
Kind of think with Trump

1536
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:18,815
Everyone has been paying attention

1537
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:20,607
All the time

1538
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:27,007
Yeah so all of that secret stuff all the stuff that's going on behind the scenes has to be so secret now

1539
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:28,799
Either

1540
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,847
You believe it to the point where you

1541
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:35,199
Completely lost any sense of reality right you just have to go like now this

1542
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:37,247
This is just too.

1543
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:44,415
I just think you know what the history books are written

1544
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:47,743
No no right about Project Camelot

1545
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:49,535
It's just

1546
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:52,095
It's just you should do

1547
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,375
Everyone who

1548
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:55,935
Made a decision to sign up with this is like

1549
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:58,495
It did they made a bad move

1550
01:08:58,751 --> 01:08:59,263
Yeah

1551
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:01,823
Strategically they made a bad move for their grip

1552
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:06,175
It seemed like it was going to be really good in the shorter but it's just not going to pay off

1553
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:07,199
There's going

1554
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:10,783
To be too much that you're going to have to answer for later and explain away like

1555
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:11,551
How do you get a

1556
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:14,879
Explain Melania being a space conduit in 5 years

1557
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,671
Like what

1558
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:19,487
She still has space conduit why are they let her go

1559
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:23,327
Okay sure whatever

1560
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,351
Space spider

1561
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:28,447
Okay and then you're like Biden is he still a walk-in

1562
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:30,239
Yeah that's a good question

1563
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:33,311
Well I think that's probably why it's so

1564
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:35,359
They're also very desperate

1565
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,639
For Trump to remain in office

1566
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:37,407
Forever

1567
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:38,175
Because

1568
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:42,527
As long as he's in office forever you can make up all kinds of bulshit but after a while

1569
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:44,319
You know everybody starts

1570
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:46,879
Looking at reality again like a man

1571
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,671
S*** that's crazy

1572
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:51,231
Why did people believe that he was going to

1573
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,535
How many hundred Biden is just gone

1574
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:55,583
We just don't even talk about that s***

1575
01:09:55,839 --> 01:10:01,471
I'm sure some people still alive

1576
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,239
Again

1577
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:04,799
I don't know the alien angle on that is

1578
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:07,103
It's interesting

1579
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,895
I feel like

1580
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:13,503
There there was a part of me that while I was listening to this episode as like

1581
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,551
Where what is this have to do with space

1582
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:17,087
And then it did come in

1583
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:20,159
I was like oh that's

1584
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:26,303
It's pretty funny people battles of merpeople battles walk-ins

1585
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:29,887
And how did Robert David Steele's working for the Triad

1586
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:30,655
But yeah

1587
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:32,703
It's kind of I feel like a she's in a rut

1588
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,983
2 yeah

1589
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:35,263
How

1590
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:38,847
Can't believe they're there

1591
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:42,175
This committed to not admitting that they got caught

1592
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,479
Rothschild

1593
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:46,271
Because you know I made like that

1594
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,807
The 22 people that we talked about

1595
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:48,831
Maybe

1596
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:50,623
Alex

1597
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:51,647
Are both psychic

1598
01:10:55,231 --> 01:11:01,375
Can't get caught have built themselves up so much that to admit even the slightest bit of

1599
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:02,143
Got Hoodwinked

1600
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,679
Co-op is a real Hitta

1601
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:10,079
To the branch they're both psychics would be validated if they were on the wrong path for 4 years at the same

1602
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:15,199
Apologize

1603
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:22,367
