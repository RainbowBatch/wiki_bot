00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:07,680
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:09,984
Everybody

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,056
To sit around drink

4
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:14,848
Have conversation

5
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,616
Things about

6
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:16,640
The one and only

7
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,664
The man the myth

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,792
The Christ is that I know tons about Alex Jones Infowars in particular

9
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,656
No not at all appropriate

10
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,424
About alley

11
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,472
You know enough to live

12
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,056
Somehow your immunized

13
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,104
Items

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,432
You have the appropriate amount of Alex Jones knowledge

15
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:56,832
Navigate your daily life without him bogging you down same time being aware that he exists

16
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,112
Scared of what

17
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:02,720
But I do not

18
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,000
As opposed to Be Giants

19
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,024
Cross you walk away

20
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:08,352
He's like the invisible guy that I

21
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:11,936
Invisible guy I'm screaming out on the street

22
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:15,264
If I was a crazy person

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,056
Yeah

24
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:21,920
There's no one there

25
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:25,504
Whether I'm here or not I think what the listeners

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,296
That I just walk in

27
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,600
You finish your model ugly start to

28
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,024
Then I leave

29
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,888
If it's having a conversation

30
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,216
Pre-recorded my Google

31
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:51,616
Today we are drinking conundrum wine out of California appropriate

32
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,432
And we're in a conundrum

33
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,224
Last week

34
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,760
Alex Jones

35
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,296
Alex Jones last week

36
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600
Did a lot of nonsense

37
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,880
And I don't want to talk about

38
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,512
Almost the entire week of course

39
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,072
Muslims spread butter

40
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:15,680
That's the way we do it proportional amount of time

41
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:20,032
Doing interviews with dr. group about his supplement

42
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,824
Love Doctor Gruber how important

43
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,848
Stop

44
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:29,760
It's kinda boring whatever but then the rest of the time was drumming up nuclear war against North Korea

45
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,856
I mean

46
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,928
He was hiding behind this weird Shield of

47
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:40,512
I don't want this to happen but this is what's going to happen

48
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,328
Then they do any of those perverse family

49
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,608
Cease where it goes through the

50
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:49,216
Not to the extent is that one that we played a couple episodes back where I was like

51
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,264
5 minutes

52
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,664
Nuclear war

53
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,112
Mostly what he did all week

54
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,416
Until of course Thursday

55
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,952
When Trump launched

56
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:14,048
59 tomahawk missiles at Syrian Air Base

57
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,352
He was so president

58
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,400
Still president

59
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,936
When do you say that

60
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,728
Play mysterious way

61
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,752
I will

62
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,312
I will frost at the mouth

63
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:31,712
I am I'm afraid I am going if Brian Williams

64
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:36,832
I would be afraid that I would bite his throat you just start barking lot over then

65
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,600
Yeah

66
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:42,976
How do you say it's presidential

67
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,400
Desktop goose

68
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:57,056
That's another product or really selling everything

69
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,872
Bathtub with Ameri Fatman

70
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,920
But it's a ghost

71
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,200
So

72
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,784
I don't want to talk about Alex Jones

73
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,112
But I don't want to cover his perspective on Trump's attack

74
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,136
In Syria

75
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:16,256
Because it's kind of boring and very predictable. Really all that entertaining

76
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,047
Like we could break down

77
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:23,167
A lot of lies

78
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:27,263
In this instance they're all completely undisprovable

79
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,079
It's not really all that like

80
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,407
When we talk about the dentist Montgomery CIA

81
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:38,015
Whistleblower thing to recover couple episodes

82
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:43,135
We can go through I can research stuff and we can figure out okay this is what's going on bababababa

83
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,927
Fret in the case of his

84
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:50,047
His narrative about Syria it's also speculative and based on

85
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,839
You know like

86
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:55,423
What was going on here is

87
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,471
As a sort of way of

88
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:04,127
Signaling to the Chinese leader who was here the cops was here

89
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,431
Or he does want to go with name

90
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,927
It's more fun to call him a chicom leaders over.

91
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,511
Is signal to him that he's

92
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:24,863
You know you strong and help with the negotiation

93
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,679
The man whose further argument is that

94
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,959
You know

95
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,495
This is probably

96
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,055
Trump and Putin got together and talked

97
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,079
And they were saying

98
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
Hey

99
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:38,175
Why don't I do this symbolic attack on Syria

100
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
Weather

101
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,991
And the owl tell you ahead of time

102
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:46,111
You know what you know you we won't end up killing anybody or anything like that

103
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,647
And now

104
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,695
We're not mad attack though

105
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
Yeah they killed

106
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,303
I thought there was no death toll for the airport air hammer

107
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,399
Oh are not always in the military

108
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:04,287
Disagree strongly disagree coming back

109
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,615
Good thing I'm way out of shape

110
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:15,039
And I might go back to grad school English teacher when I was in high school told me that because he was

111
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,063
Colour-blind he wasn't

112
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,343
Frontline's on

113
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:23,487
Okay congratulations my grandpa was a conscientious objector

114
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,559
Ended up working at like Yellowstone

115
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:31,423
I always

116
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,959
That you can be a conscientious

117
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,775
Yeah that meant

118
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:42,175
In like a literal sense like you got driving hold up a sign like

119
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,039
You know that kind of thing is a Mennonite

120
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,831
And yet a religious

121
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,391
Obligation not to be involved in any

122
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,927
Play Roar

123
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,719
Take notes

124
00:06:54,975 --> 00:07:01,119
Apply to me to somehow

125
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
Because

126
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,959
It's not like you just get totally off the hook

127
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,591
Through working at a national park

128
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:17,503
And that was

129
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:24,671
Unfortunately you're going away so national parks that won't be an option

130
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,487
Conscientious objector

131
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,303
That's possible

132
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,839
Over

133
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,119
Over that River

134
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,679
You know how you can build walls over

135
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,287
Thank God

136
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,967
His prospective is Trump and Putin got together and have this conversation

137
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,807
Because far back about this fake Russian

138
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,343
Connection

139
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,463
And then we can have conversations

140
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,303
But then also

141
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,095
Hacked into it is

142
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,375
Is it like

143
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
Alright

144
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,031
And they're having a plan to get people to stop talking about the Russian connection

145
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:18,175
Do you understand

146
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
Is your

147
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,247
Just building a rush

148
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,527
Can connection

149
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,319
No rush

150
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,087
Connection

151
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,391
Besides the one that you just built

152
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:31,231
You used in order to

153
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,511
To create a fake

154
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,303
Attack in Syria

155
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,607
Like legal thing

156
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:41,727
Very very constitutional Constitution

157
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:45,055
Know you know what you know where where we know where we're at

158
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,847
The Constitution has no meat

159
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:53,247
Maybe you should

160
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:59,903
I really hate the idea that Alex

161
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,439
Recipes

162
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,463
False flag

163
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,743
It's really boring

164
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:07,583
To cover every time he says

165
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,375
Boston bombing

166
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,935
After Sandy Hook

167
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,983
Everything is

168
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,519
Colorado shooter

169
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:20,383
Movie theaters everything

170
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,711
False flag

171
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,759
Muslim he still doesn't recognize that

172
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,831
I just don't know what 11

173
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,415
False flag

174
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,999
Assassination of John F Kennedy

175
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,279
The

176
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,047
Nixon

177
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,631
Just his exact is birth

178
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:49,055
We will cover this down the road possibly as things develop but as it is now that's just a boring there

179
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,591
Narrative and I don't have any time or pay

180
00:09:54,687 --> 00:10:00,831
Very not prone to that I have to protect you from yourself

181
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,623
I have to know where the line is

182
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,911
I like it more that way kind of

183
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
Incredibly important point

184
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,079
And that is

185
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,383
But everyone else needs

186
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,919
To stop covering Alex

187
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,575
This is the payback

188
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,855
Is that what you say

189
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,159
No I just want to illustrate

190
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
And and

191
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,231
And discuss over the course of this episode

192
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,535
The thesis that I've made a couple times

193
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,863
Yes and I think we need to flesh out more because Alex

194
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,703
Whenever

195
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,983
Deal with Alex Jones

196
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,007
Phone history

197
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,799
And when you take him out of time

198
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
What you were doing

199
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
Is playing into his hands

200
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,199
And if you want to pretend that you're against him

201
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,759
And you like if you want

202
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
Opposed

203
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,855
And you play that game

204
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:07,903
You're failing

205
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,183
You just like definition

206
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
I agree

207
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,231
And it's really bothersome

208
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,767
Yeah yeah

209
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,071
It's also bothersome that we don't get more cry

210
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:21,471
Sparta

211
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:25,055
My motivation comes from

212
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,847
Because normally I have

213
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,919
Spoiler alert

214
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
But

215
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,783
The truth is

216
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,319
They has an agenda

217
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,879
They are part of the democratic party basically

218
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,463
Soros funding them in it

219
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,487
Evil that stuff

220
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,535
Bumpus Bumpus

221
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:49,119
They are wing of the Democratic Party

222
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,143
You know

223
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,959
Their mission statement is to expose

224
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,007
Document right-wing pundit

225
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,543
Do they have

226
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,639
O'Reilly they have Hannity they have Alex Jones

227
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,711
Other website documents weird

228
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,783
Isis

229
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,319
It's not great that's fine

230
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,879
I think that what you have described

231
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,415
What they do is

232
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
Is perfect

233
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,975
They feed the outrage

234
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,535
Where you post this video

235
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,119
Think he's a joke

236
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,143
Anime forget

237
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,959
And then you wait awhile and maybe you said something else

238
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,983
The scandalous

239
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,079
This is a failure of a game

240
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,359
Now

241
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,919
Just to remind everyone

242
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,943
Last week

243
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,991
Media Matters put out

244
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
Equip

245
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,319
From Alex Jones is broadcast

246
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,599
Of March 30th

247
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,879
That we discussed

248
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
We just

249
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:48,767
Maybe too long

250
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,559
It was the episode where Alex Jones

251
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,119
Was on-air drunk for 2 hours

252
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,679
I found him in his hand

253
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,519
He's making drinking sounds on the mic when the cameras away from him

254
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:03,103
He's talking about the four ways to learn at the end of it

255
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,127
Keith Buckley

256
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,711
Did they cover all of that today like

257
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:15,647
Do maybe a two-hour-long expose

258
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,207
Context everything it's just this

259
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,535
And just to remind everyone in case you haven't listened to that episode

260
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,559
Here is the

261
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,839
The clip that they cover

262
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:28,191
I can't get enough of hearing this is the one this is our favorite

263
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,239
This is what is covered by Media Matters

264
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:36,639
I am ready I am now let me tell I'm not against gay people

265
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,943
Okay I love the gray fox

266
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,991
But ship looks like the ark

267
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
Kite

268
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,551
Archetype old c*********

269
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:47,135
With those little deer in the headlight eyes and all his stuff

270
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:53,535
And there's something about this thing around bossing everybody around

271
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,327
I want to tell Congressman Schiff

272
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,863
And all the rest of them

273
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:03,263
Hey listen a****** quit saying Rodger and I never use cussing in 22 years with the gloves are on

274
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,591
Problem

275
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,503
You get my face without I'll beat your goddamn ass you son-of-a-b****

276
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,039
You piece of s***

277
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,087
You f******

278
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,367
Listen f*** head

279
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,719
Get that through your goddamn f****** head

280
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,511
Stop pushing your s***

281
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:30,911
You're the people that f*** this country over

282
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:37,311
Son of a b**** your hands guide

283
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:46,527
Media Matters

284
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:52,927
Here's their heads

285
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:58,815
Trump threatens to beat representative Adam Schiff God damn ass

286
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,351
An anti-gay tirade

287
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,655
That's not fair

288
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:08,287
An anti-gay tirade

289
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:12,639
Keep touches on some homophobic

290
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:18,527
That's not the thrust of what's going on if he was calling him an ass

291
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:22,111
If he was throughout it he's going back to

292
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:26,719
The part where he looks like an archetypal c*********

293
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
That part is

294
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,511
He's just dumb

295
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,047
Yeah it is homophobic

296
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,607
Is not

297
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,399
So this evening

298
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,167
Doing it

299
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:39,519
Because ship is gay ancillary to his

300
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,567
Is true anger now it is

301
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,431
Insinuations of gayness as an attack

302
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,271
Absolutely

303
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,855
Media Matters

304
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,623
That's not

305
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
Using Alex and Kant

306
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,719
So that's

307
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,767
Sure does

308
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,887
Now if you just play that clip it's like machine

309
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:13,311
Situation out of context really talk about that

310
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:19,711
Because it was the beginning of where things got the real singer

311
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,015
He's drunk is s*** on this episode

312
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:27,647
And within 15 minutes of this he's talking about selling his car rambling about

313
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,695
I'm going to live in a rich neighborhood

314
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,999
Although the headline

315
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,535
Drunken lunatic

316
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,583
Needs to get rid of his car

317
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,471
That's actually a way better

318
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:45,055
Why did Media Matters why don't you talk to us

319
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,871
Media Matters How many reasons

320
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,919
Just to give you some context

321
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,711
Before that Media Matters

322
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:55,295
The published an article

323
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,879
The Jewish press reporting on his Jewish Mafia

324
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,207
Which is that's more reasonable

325
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,255
He did do that certainly

326
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:08,095
200 likes on Facebook

327
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
No

328
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:15,775
The thing with the anti-gay parade 7.9

329
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:21,407
You kind of get a sense of why they do the things that they do

330
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:24,735
Alex Jones claims Trump calls him and is happy with his performance

331
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,527
104 likes on

332
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
On Facebook

333
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,063
Accurate

334
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
You just

335
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,695
You have to go for the most salacious click Beatty headlines

336
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,487
Alakazam

337
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,303
And it's not fair if you're covering this clipped

338
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,351
To take it out of the context of the bigger picture

339
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,143
How to make the same

340
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,679
I'm making the other art

341
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,495
We have the same idea

342
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,799
Taking Alex Jones out of context is wrong

343
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:49,823
Galaxy

344
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,359
Because the contacts defense

345
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
I think it's

346
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,431
It's because the context makes him worse

347
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,247
He's on Air 2 hours drunk

348
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,783
Screaming this s***

349
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,343
Sing a bunch of hateful bigotry

350
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,135
Mildly bigoted

351
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:07,231
Certainly we we live on a spectrum

352
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:13,119
Here we are inoculated against because it's so much worse

353
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,167
Yeah

354
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,495
Well I mean

355
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,543
Here's why

356
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,079
Instead of the other

357
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,639
Because

358
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,687
That is a delightful loot

359
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,527
Yeah you could go and get his worst bigotry

360
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:38,207
I mean you picked it we both picked it out immediately

361
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,279
So that involved

362
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,095
Brock I'm not really against David Brock

363
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,631
It's fine but I don't like

364
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,703
The idea that this is salacious

365
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,519
This is clickbait e bulshit

366
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,127
Is to watch right-wing bigot

367
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,919
And document what they're doing

368
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:01,247
Hey we're doing a better job than you Media Matters

369
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,271
And listen

370
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,063
Here's the main point

371
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,879
When you play that game

372
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:10,207
You open up a window that Alex can attack you with

373
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:14,303
Whenever you do these things you take him out of context

374
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,375
Like the Stephen Colbert thing with Stephen Colbert

375
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,935
Alex can point out you did edit that

376
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,727
You ended my audio

377
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,567
Whenever they did that on Fox news with Megyn Kelly

378
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:32,735
That he was saying that Hillary Clinton is personally responsible for the rape and murder of children

379
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,271
He sure did

380
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,343
Take him out of contact and when you do that

381
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
Alex

382
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,927
It's like you can block a punch and come back

383
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,719
Yeah so now today

384
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,791
The heat Canseco

385
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,559
Correctly

386
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,863
That you took him out of con

387
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,935
Automatically for any of her

388
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
His listeners

389
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,471
That takes

390
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,031
Totally

391
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,567
As long as he gets to say so

392
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,103
Thing that is true in

393
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,407
You look over there at

394
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
Sleight of hand

395
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:06,527
No we're not perfect jobs were not awesome journalists or anything like that

396
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,087
But I am hundred percent believe

397
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,903
Even close to a journalist

398
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:17,023
Neuter my over here just like this

399
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:22,143
I went to the best

400
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,447
Bike

401
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:29,311
I went to the best journalism School in the country but

402
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,847
Any journalism classes

403
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:36,479
You got it

404
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,527
Today's episode

405
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:42,623
What we're going to be talking about is Alex Jones put out a video

406
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:46,463
In response to Media Matters putting out a response

407
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,535
Which kind of it

408
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:56,959
If

409
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,751
Alex were to here

410
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,543
Please just listen Alex

411
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,639
But if you were if you was to listen to that episode of Gomery

412
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,919
There's no response

413
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,247
No we didn't take him out of context not at all

414
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,831
You purely researched it to the point where there's really no

415
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:19,232
Disproving there's nothing that's delicious

416
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,448
Thousands of people are.

417
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,824
We don't enter the bear trap

418
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,872
There are these out of context

419
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,896
Clips it's just

420
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,920
It's a dangerous game

421
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:38,944
And

422
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:39,968
It's the most

423
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,528
It if I were out

424
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,576
If I were as crazy as him

425
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,856
What

426
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
Suggest

427
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,160
Is that possibly

428
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,440
Media Matters

429
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:53,024
Is not so interested in actually exposing with Alex Jones

430
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,072
As they are in engaging in a bag

431
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:55,840
Fourth dance

432
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,192
Remind me of

433
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,616
Text clip where you at

434
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,944
Al Sharpton and Ann Coulter go on TV

435
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,248
Hey b**** at each other and yada yada yada

436
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,808
Then I go into the green robe and a Jets their best

437
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,368
Yeah like they're playing the game

438
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,672
They're playing one side

439
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,440
The other side

440
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,464
Jaws rating

441
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,792
Clix

442
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,584
Attention

443
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,352
Kitchen drawers money

444
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:33,472
And that's the choice is Omarosa

445
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,288
I don't think

446
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,360
But be that as it may

447
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,152
I'm pissed off

448
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,224
Someone who could be an ally

449
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,248
And Media Matters

450
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,528
I pissed off at them

451
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,856
I'm vaguely pissed off also it like the AV club

452
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,160
Not super pissed off at them

453
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,720
Cuz I get what they're doing is entertainment glass

454
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:58,816
But mostly Supercuts of Alex Jones kind of does the exact same thing

455
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,352
The Media Matters posting out of

456
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,192
Posting

457
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,216
Like

458
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:13,920
Just you let him off the hook here's my

459
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,504
Alright leave Alex to us

460
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:29,280
Patreon Soros

461
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:36,960
The weirdest day of all the sudden just a few hundred thousand show up in your Patron open

462
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,032
U-Store-It

463
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,688
George

464
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:55,392
I also like to thank everybody who has donated a tree on and everyone who has not

465
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,160
Stopped

466
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,720
5 since we switched over from freezing point

467
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,744
That means a lot

468
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,768
I thank you very much

469
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:06,400
We could definitely expand what we do and I would like to do that

470
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,264
Oh man you did not

471
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,312
A good hours

472
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:17,152
If we had the money

473
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:27,904
I don't want him in my house Twitter

474
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,024
I made the great observation that he looks like a young boy from Rio Coco paintings

475
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,584
It's a really good observation

476
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,888
Just looks like he's crying all the time

477
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,032
This episode that Alex put out let's deal with that Paul Joseph Watson

478
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,056
Something really quick

479
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,104
So on the night of the attack

480
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,408
In Syria on Thursday night

481
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,688
Posted

482
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,712
Hey I guess

483
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,272
Trump is not a tool of Putin

484
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,296
He is just

485
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,064
A

486
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,832
MW

487
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:57,856
What was it

488
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,392
Neocon

489
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:05,280
Yeah I am officially off the Trump train

490
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:09,888
Word for work two hours later or so I don't know the exact time frame

491
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,704
Screenshot of his follower count

492
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,312
Hey like this is the first time ever I've lost followers lost like 1,000 followers

493
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,640
Couple hours later after that

494
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,176
I'm I'm off

495
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:28,576
Trump as it relates to Syria I have not turned on Trump as the media have lied and said

496
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,440
Fake news my own Twitter account

497
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,208
Tech news

498
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:37,536
What's f*****-up about it is like

499
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,560
Or probably bought

500
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,144
He lost a thousand baht

501
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,216
Probably

502
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,752
Paul Joseph Watson

503
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,032
Is a is a fuckboy

504
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,592
Yeah

505
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:57,504
Not today

506
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,296
Output at this response

507
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:02,880
To Media Matters putting out a clip of him saying I'm going to

508
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,648
Kick your ass

509
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:06,464
We goddamn Senator ship

510
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,488
Commitment

511
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,024
Fill your hand

512
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,792
Tell your

513
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,328
Still my favorite

514
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:17,728
I've been using it multiple times this week comes back up it's in play

515
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,544
Delighted by it now

516
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:26,688
The only person broadcasting on this clip he's not the only person who says feel your hand

517
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:27,968
Wait what

518
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,528
Excited for that

519
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,088
I've never heard that phrase before my entire life

520
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:33,856
I feel like

521
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,136
Gmail

522
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:39,488
He didn't and we're going to find out where it comes from on today's

523
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:42,048
Episode of knowledge fight

524
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,096
So

525
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,472
I have cut out almost nothing from this 10 minutes

526
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,008
Thing I just put it into segments

527
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,288
That's for us to

528
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,056
To digest

529
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,920
Specifically not taken out anything that has to do with contacts

530
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,968
Everything is at

531
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,016
There'll be a couple times you might have to

532
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784
Pause

533
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,808
Fuel nearby

534
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,856
Here's the introduction and heavy begin

535
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:12,512
Last year we witnessed the Democratic party foreign government thousands of newspapers

536
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:18,912
100 celebrities

537
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:25,312
Are the ones politically influenced

538
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:31,712
Particularly ridiculous

539
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:50,912
Embarrassment to this country makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point

540
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:57,312
Bojo is wound up where he has 12 I'd like to punch him in the face

541
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:22,912
Gennaro

542
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:27,520
Punch the president in the nose

543
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,312
We heard from

544
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:37,760
We've already talked about that

545
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,064
Opening montage

546
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,832
The his evidence

547
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,856
The people want

548
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,624
To kill Trump

549
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,160
And the Liberals are super

550
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,208
I we did talk about that

551
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,512
Like right after the election there was a teacher

552
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,304
Squirting us work

553
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,864
Or fake gun

554
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,632
Hilarious

555
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,400
Mentally on

556
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,192
Yeah but it also

557
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:56,960
Empty classroom

558
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,264
Who knows who she was

559
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,128
The video went viral

560
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,664
In quotes because

561
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,624
I don't disagree with

562
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,928
I think we all get one

563
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:25,376
I think the people burned Obama in effigy I think that Ted Nugent told him to suck

564
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,936
Machine gun

565
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:35,360
I actually looked up Liberals are actually looked up death threats against President Obama

566
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,640
And there's just like

567
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,456
Three pages full of actual plot

568
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,224
To kill him

569
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,552
It's insane the number of assassination attempt

570
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,880
That were thwarted in early stages but never got any press

571
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:47,904
Insane

572
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,720
Assassination

573
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:56,352
Episode

574
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,888
Be crazy

575
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,168
That is assertive

576
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,472
Absurd then the Madonna thing

577
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,264
He cuts off her quote

578
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,312
The part of the

579
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,664
Is guess I'm angry yes I'm outraged

580
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,480
Yes I've thought a lot about blowing up the White House

581
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:15,040
But I know that this won't change anything

582
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,088
We cannot fall into despair

583
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,112
Yeah

584
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,904
Really changes the quote

585
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,000
Yeah from

586
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,048
Threat to a

587
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,328
Why is

588
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,656
Switzer why saying

589
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,680
You don't

590
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,984
You don't fight fire with fire you fighting

591
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:38,848
And then the other one the other one is a CEO

592
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,664
I lost the page that I had up

593
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,480
Start up

594
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:50,624
Who tweeted those things about getting a sniper rifle at Secret Service

595
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,952
I was forced out of his company

596
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,840
Best basketball

597
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:02,400
You can't threaten the president like that

598
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,192
You can threaten anyone like that

599
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,728
Even if

600
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,496
If you're an egg

601
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:11,104
I guess out under what I believe the law

602
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:17,504
I don't think you can do that sort of thing believe in that it's still around

603
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,576
He's forced out of his company that he started which is a huge cops

604
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,624
Even if you didn't even see.

605
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,392
Jail time

606
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,976
I'm here come out later and he was super drunk

607
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,352
Alright there was a drunk dude

608
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,400
Running his goddamn mouth

609
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:40,288
Yeah well that's a problem with Twitter I've gotten drunk and in my apartment alone I have shouted very loud thing

610
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:43,616
Things to do on Thursday

611
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:50,272
For 12 hours to go through

612
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,040
Through every

613
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,832
Possible news

614
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
Network

615
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,392
F*** themselves

616
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,160
Because

617
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,232
Immediately after those bombs were sent out they had

618
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:05,120
Architect Botox

619
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,168
General

620
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:10,240
Praising how this is the most presidential Trump

621
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,544
Look at these gorgeous missiles

622
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,872
If

623
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,408
Deserves

624
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,736
Today and I retweeted it out them

625
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:25,600
Ashamed of f****** CNBC that I am

626
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,880
Of Alex Jones

627
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,976
Hours of the propaganda

628
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,000
Convey

629
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,536
Inferiority

630
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:41,472
Unless we're running up to Iraq war number 2

631
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,496
To the days of

632
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,520
MacNeil Lehrer

633
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:50,432
I just swallowed I forgot

634
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,200
Lehrer's

635
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:57,856
As I was saying McNeil

636
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,904
Go back to f****** boring-ass journalist

637
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,720
Yes we need to go back to 9

638
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,768
Just you know what you know what the most

639
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:10,144
Crowd-pleasing part of the MacNeil Lehrer hour

640
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:18,336
That weird little theme song they had that's it that's it

641
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,992
We won't

642
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:29,344
That bag that cat are drowned in the middle of the Falcon Lake

643
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,904
So Alex already

644
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,696
Setting this up his wide

645
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,464
About

646
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:38,304
But I just disagreed that means any

647
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,352
I don't care with Robert marijuana

648
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,656
No I don't care either

649
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:45,216
Mickey Rourke

650
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:48,544
Is Mickey Rourke said he wanted

651
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,480
Time alone with Trump with a baseball bat

652
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:01,344
I'm calling the big puss you don't know what Mickey Rourke is into anymore

653
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,904
He's really into sounding

654
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,512
Extra

655
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:17,472
That's a little bit more extreme but

656
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,896
It's even more indicative that

657
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,664
He is

658
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,688
Once again pic

659
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,992
On actors because

660
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,272
He does not know that

661
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,832
In reality so

662
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:33,856
Why not

663
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:40,256
Should have been arrested but it's not really an issue is someone running his mouth drunk on

664
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,024
Twitter

665
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,912
Threaten to beat up

666
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:52,544
Oregon Nation about that

667
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,640
There are a lot of

668
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,408
People on the right

669
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,552
3 years ago in real life

670
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:04,576
Obama

671
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,600
And then a thing that they

672
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,160
That is the exact

673
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,440
Possible

674
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,232
Alex has more

675
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,768
Alex has more threats

676
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:16,352
Most newspapers from the LA Times

677
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:19,680
Someone killed from

678
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,728
I want to kill Trump

679
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,008
Incredible

680
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:29,920
Literal definition of incredible

681
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,736
It's incredible

682
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:41,696
The New York Times and LA Times I can't find any

683
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,976
Sentences with their writers calling

684
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,280
Assassination

685
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,584
Trouble

686
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:52,192
Along the lines of this assassination is taking a long time

687
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:59,360
Richard costabile

688
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,384
Plans of her

689
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,176
Oh her again

690
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,712
It wasn't her planning it like

691
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,992
Like

692
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:11,904
I'm waiting I'm waiting for a shipment from Acme

693
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:15,488
Cuz we're going to have to have to Roadrunner this thing

694
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,776
And I think you got it

695
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:30,592
That's my theory on that because I can't find

696
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:34,176
LA or New York Times writers who is

697
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,808
Yeah

698
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,344
He couldn't point out London

699
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,112
Adana map

700
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,464
I'm not sure I could I can but I'm not entirely sure where London is

701
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,256
Nor whales are

702
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:52,864
How do you know where whales is not London cuz I remember it's real south

703
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,168
Whales at the bottom

704
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,704
Other UK

705
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,496
You looking at me weird

706
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,776
Am I wrong

707
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,592
Oh yeah

708
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,616
Well

709
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,688
What time is it

710
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:10,272
The south is the south is England I almost said London

711
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,624
So no

712
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,720
No happening right now

713
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:25,120
What is going on here. Wales

714
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,680
I understand English

715
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,960
Scotland Wales

716
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:32,288
And then Ireland is over there

717
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,592
Okay

718
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,872
God

719
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:41,504
I really thought that whales of the south of Italy

720
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,648
I don't think so cuz I have you were just there

721
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,720
I was just there the same sensitive like

722
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,840
I'm pretty sure I'm right

723
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,888
I really don't think that Wells is north

724
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,168
Scotland that part to me

725
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:04,032
Who's great pod by the way

726
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:11,200
I'll look it up as we listen to next is Alex Jones

727
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:17,088
Proponents of non-violence

728
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:20,160
Mahatma Gandhi Martin Luther King

729
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,696
That's true

730
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,720
Everyone knows

731
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,352
Now let's take a little walk down memory lane about some of the things that Alex has said

732
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,168
He put multiple people in Tacoma

733
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:34,240
Alex Jones this is your life

734
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:39,104
Call me right now or no that's there

735
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:44,480
Disgusting

736
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,832
He constantly tells stories about violence

737
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,624
He constantly threatens

738
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:55,488
Also

739
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,024
What is the only way to

740
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,048
To solve problems

741
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,400
Like a violent chat like that

742
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,936
It's all about Macho

743
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,520
Get rid of all your fancy pants smartness

744
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,312
You engineered

745
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,592
Telling me how to throw bomb

746
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,176
Utah some over the sea

747
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,504
Also speaking

748
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,320
Whatever that last clip I was

749
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,392
Wales isn't the South

750
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,208
About

751
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:29,792
Southeast

752
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:33,120
To even finer points I would have been wrong but

753
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,400
Is it

754
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:38,240
So now we all know where London

755
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,264
And Alex

756
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,104
Which I appreciate

757
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:44,896
And I disagree with

758
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,992
Cigarette

759
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:49,760
Play God day

760
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:52,064
I don't know if Alex could

761
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,112
He would sleep on a pile of naked

762
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:57,952
I also don't think that Alex would do well in a hunger

763
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,144
Drink Man

764
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,960
Wild Turkey

765
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:13,568
Anyway here's this next one this is Alex

766
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,336
Lying

767
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
For the fill your hand

768
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:21,760
Okay we learn the truth

769
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,400
U.s. attorney's another's

770
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,168
Vivian

771
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,032
It's true that they did wait a week

772
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,592
Or so

773
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,736
Except for we had recorded it over the weekend released on Monday cuz the f****** podcast

774
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,320
Yeah wait cuz we're not

775
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,624
Over the weekend

776
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:05,024
He did that on Thursday

777
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:11,168
That is f***** up that if they were

778
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:14,496
Yeah you do you know what they say about outrage

779
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:20,128
He posted that on Thursday the 30th of March

780
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,456
And Media Matters posted their s*** on the 4th of April

781
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:25,248
Next week

782
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,040
Yes.nm saying lag time

783
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:30,880
I don't know why they didn't know about this

784
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,184
Puppies

785
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:38,048
No obviously they have some employee who's just watching Alex Jones all the time

786
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,584
No they have to

787
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:45,728
You're literally the only person who just watches

788
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,264
No I don't think they got it

789
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,800
Okay

790
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:49,568
Here's what happened

791
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,360
They don't have anybody paint

792
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:54,431
Monday

793
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:00,575
Converted

794
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,855
There are people

795
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:04,159
Posting up clips of him whenever he does

796
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,719
I'm sure somebody got it shared it

797
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,023
Sky like a meme

798
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,047
Adventure

799
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,119
This is why we're never going to make it

800
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:16,447
You can't we have to pretend it was us

801
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:21,823
If we were Alex we would be certain

802
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,919
True

803
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,967
We have very high-level source

804
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:31,039
99%

805
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:38,975
7th grade if we only had one source but it was yours or Jesus told us

806
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,559
So I don't believe at all

807
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,327
Best Buy

808
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,607
The department

809
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,655
Attorney generals or anything like that

810
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:51,519
What the truth is is these articles are speculating about whether or not it is a crime

811
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,055
To say you're going to beat up

812
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:53,823
A satyr

813
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,663
Bullshittin of itself to

814
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,759
No in that expletive-laced rant

815
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,551
I'm going to

816
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,319
Kick your ass

817
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,367
He just said those are fighting words

818
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,927
And if you want to say to my face

819
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,231
That I was an agent of Russia

820
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:14,047
Kick your ass context of a

821
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:18,143
Yeah it's not like he's threatening to go to

822
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:24,287
Call me or I will kick your ass

823
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:29,151
With a hypothetical framework

824
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,687
But he's working it

825
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,967
And I don't want

826
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:35,295
Dependa

827
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,831
It's not that b*******

828
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:41,439
Well it's like if Mickey Rourke said he wanted

829
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:49,375
I think you might have accidentally hit the nail on the head of the

830
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,935
Entire point over this episode

831
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:55,263
Alex

832
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:03,199
Eggs for it that recognition himself

833
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:05,759
But that's the entire that's the entire system

834
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:06,527
That's all

835
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,647
Hey cattle

836
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,695
Honey pot

837
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:14,719
Your black

838
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,303
Fuk away

839
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:24,447
Where can I do a podcast

840
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,495
I'm very frustrated with that

841
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:30,335
Let's learn about this turn of phrase

842
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,343
I also talked about

843
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,135
People that are saying I'm a Russian agent

844
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:51,327
John Wayne in True Grit

845
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,895
Yeah it was John Wayne

846
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:08,479
That makes it even cooler

847
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,783
It's pretty cool you know it's great

848
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:13,599
I feel very good about myself that I immediately

849
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,903
Without prior Conte

850
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:23,839
Jacqueline is so cool he can travel to me through Alex Jones

851
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,119
John Wayne

852
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:32,287
Although it's a little bit it's not

853
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:38,687
Like we were talking about video

854
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,087
Definitely more aggressive

855
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,415
Yeah but it's also in the context of that kind of

856
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:51,487
A gentleman

857
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:55,071
I am going to go after you

858
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:55,839
It's a hey

859
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,887
Let's turn this into a duel

860
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:03,775
Mariemont Elementary

861
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:09,151
Codenames

862
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:12,479
I still don't think that

863
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,503
Like

864
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,039
Literally

865
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,855
Threatening violence or anything like that

866
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:22,975
And this is what we keep coming back to like free speech doesn't cover threats of violence

867
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:23,999
Slander and libel

868
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:26,047
Yeah

869
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:28,351
He's still well within his rights

870
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,399
Yeah we would have discussed if he wasn't

871
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,191
When we first covered this clip

872
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:35,775
You should be arrested for this

873
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,335
Fairway Auto

874
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:42,431
I don't know, this is something we agree with Alex about it just happens to be

875
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,223
We're on the same side for different

876
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:47,551
Yeah we are on the

877
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,855
We are always unlikely

878
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,391
Yeah

879
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:53,695
Azan to lie a little bit more

880
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,511
Mickey Rourke has come out

881
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:00,095
For killing the president

882
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:04,191
Thousands and thousands of prominent people

883
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,383
Number them

884
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,711
Mickey Rourke

885
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:22,111
You want to kill him cuz they want to be alone in a hotel room with a baseball bat

886
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,647
Appellate

887
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:27,231
It's again we're coming down to this

888
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:29,023
It's not illegal it's unwise

889
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,559
You should have said something like that

890
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,839
He lived a hard life

891
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:33,119
He's lucky he still famous

892
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:40,031
You've been a drug addict I'm not shiting on have a

893
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:42,591
Likes I still text

894
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,127
His character the wrestler

895
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,687
If that's okay

896
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:50,271
That's I mean that's fair

897
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:52,319
Prominent people calling for Trump

898
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:53,599
Assassination

899
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:54,623
Is absurd

900
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,647
That's that's

901
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,439
Crazy

902
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:02,559
That's exactly my point I found an article about that 1,200 people

903
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,863
Threatened to assassinate him on Twitter

904
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,655
But who are they

905
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,935
Who cares

906
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:10,495
Who f****** cares

907
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,543
What dumbasses say on Twitter

908
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,335
Actually drunk.

909
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,103
Toilet

910
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,639
He just tried to get

911
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:17,919
A certain account

912
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:22,015
Yeah that they remembered their is

913
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:25,855
The government

914
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:26,623
Lystra

915
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:34,559
You know what I'm saying like I don't think it's right even if you are on Twitter to say you're going to kill the president or you want to

916
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:40,703
But I also don't think it's fair to make an argument that tons of people want to kill the president

917
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,495
Tons of prominent people

918
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:47,871
Based on 1,200 people on Twitter considering how many people are on Twitter

919
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,895
Shockingly low.

920
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:52,991
Well you should

921
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,015
I mean

922
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:56,831
I would assume that they were smart enough to

923
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,647
Get a burger

924
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:04,511
An anonymous

925
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,399
Let's

926
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:12,191
Recipe for trouble

927
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:17,055
So this next this next clip is where we really get towed

928
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:19,615
That was real dumb of them

929
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:24,479
Wrapping up to this next clip is where Alex

930
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,015
Emperors

931
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,319
Severe bulshit

932
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,087
Territory

933
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,671
To the point where we might have to talk about this next clip for about half

934
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,487
It's such b*******

935
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,791
Literal bulshit

936
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,327
Okay so here you go

937
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,167
Weather

938
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:46,751
Performance

939
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:50,591
As I do

940
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:05,183
Trump and Russia

941
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:11,583
Define littoral rights

942
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:17,983
We're going to destroy you with the truth

943
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:24,383
Information Warfare

944
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:37,695
Oh no we've got Snakes on a Plane

945
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,559
So

946
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:43,583
F******

947
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:44,607
Stupid

948
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,655
Giraffes are art

949
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:50,495
Never get enough surprise

950
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:53,055
How do you spell

951
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:54,591
Fixes Ranter

952
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:57,407
Imagine someone he's against

953
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:58,687
On the left

954
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:03,039
Who was like I don't know if it's real Lickin angry against Trump

955
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:06,623
AllMusic Marc Maron whiskey

956
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:12,255
Imagine one of those types

957
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:16,351
He would never stop making fun of them calling them fairies

958
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:23,007
Get off that s*** you ass off

959
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:25,823
Disney the videos

960
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:32,479
Disease breast milk

961
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:37,343
In these clips this is not

962
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,111
Tumi

963
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,671
Performance

964
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,975
Performance art is measured

965
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:43,743
Generally

966
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:47,327
So we can make contain rage and anger and those are two things

967
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,375
His tools but they're always

968
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,143
Free

969
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:50,911
Design

970
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:53,215
In order to elicit a certain reaction

971
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:57,311
Performance

972
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,407
And most of the time as we've documented over the last four months or so

973
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:04,479
Whenever he's going off

974
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:07,039
The point spread in the middle

975
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,575
Especially when he's

976
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:12,671
Yeah it's the idea is to learn her all whiskey

977
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:14,719
And one of them is

978
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,327
The only way to learn

979
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,631
Don't let me ask you this question

980
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:24,959
That's just that I love it so much

981
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,239
Dueling Alex Jones

982
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:41,343
My point is

983
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:47,487
It's such a dangerously stupid cop out to say that what you're doing is performance art

984
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:50,047
Because once you open that can of worms

985
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,607
Now I am open to attack

986
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,887
Everything you're doing

987
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:54,911
Performance art

988
00:52:55,167 --> 00:53:01,311
So every serious traveler make

989
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,103
You just at home

990
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,127
For now

991
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:10,783
You don't really have any legitimacy every time you bring up a source you could just be using that as a

992
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:11,551
Fake prop

993
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:17,951
Every single thing you say is now no longer credible as it was before

994
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,815
This is a stage

995
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:28,447
You can't take any of it seriously

996
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,775
Circle circle Merritt

997
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:38,175
I wonder you know like that you reveal truly the boy

998
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:41,503
Racist raid from

999
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:46,623
This is something that I used to have lots of conversations about an abandoned

1000
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,391
Lately

1001
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,927
And last year's eve

1002
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:49,695
No longer

1003
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,743
Necessarily but

1004
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:59,679
Coulter actually performing

1005
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:02,495
Yeah and what they're doing is like

1006
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,263
Essentially

1007
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,567
The weird parody

1008
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:06,847
The right

1009
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:15,295
Woman goes into the same argument

1010
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,343
Whenever you bring up The Boondocks

1011
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,623
About

1012
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:23,231
There is that idea within it the ideal I don't really believe the things

1013
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:23,999
I'm saying

1014
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,119
Tubidy

1015
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,143
Truth of that

1016
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,167
Two stomachs

1017
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:33,471
Fred Williams doesn't believe

1018
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:37,311
No he's a mean for you

1019
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,615
Pretty man who reads the news

1020
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:43,711
He's not a journalist but doesn't have thoughts or feelings

1021
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:46,527
The Vessel for whatever

1022
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,575
Enough

1023
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:49,855
Susan Rice

1024
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,671
Problems

1025
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,951
Cuz she does have some

1026
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:55,487
History

1027
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:58,303
Yeah there is there are some red flags on her

1028
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,863
Completely ignored

1029
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:05,727
Clearly nonsense let me lay it out for you

1030
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,007
Aquarium

1031
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,311
Wanted

1032
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:13,919
Pretty things and they had people

1033
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:15,199
U.s. citizen

1034
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,479
Engaged

1035
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,503
Some really shady

1036
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:21,087
And she requested that those names be released

1037
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:23,135
To her

1038
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:27,743
Of the intelligence Community unmask them at her request

1039
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,303
Okay

1040
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,863
There's no leaking that was going on

1041
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,655
She was also the Nationals

1042
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,423
Security advisor

1043
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,471
She had every right

1044
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,495
To do that

1045
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:43,359
It's crazy

1046
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:49,759
African-American woman so that's a nice Target for

1047
00:55:56,415 --> 00:56:01,023
Leslie in positions of authority attacking your white male

1048
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,815
White nationalist allies

1049
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:05,119
It's insane

1050
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,399
Entire story there

1051
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,959
But really close to the entire

1052
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:14,847
Tyrone and vagina

1053
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:19,455
For the medicine desperation play

1054
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:22,527
S*** let's make a mountain out of a molehill because

1055
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:25,599
Our guys

1056
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:30,975
Yeah but I read at you know I sent this to you earlier I found out that my dad Ray

1057
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:34,303
Stickley Infowars

1058
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:35,839
Right

1059
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,119
It's the same

1060
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,399
The same basic narrative

1061
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,679
Diet Infowars

1062
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:40,959
Couched in

1063
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,775
What's Showman

1064
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:45,311
Gunship

1065
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,615
Like the whole the whole Susan Rice

1066
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,407
They didn't you know

1067
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:51,199
They don't go as far as

1068
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,479
To say she was a spy

1069
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:55,551
They pushed the the same narrative

1070
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:58,367
This means that they were watching

1071
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:00,159
That there aren't they are

1072
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,695
In open Rebellion

1073
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:02,719
The whole thing

1074
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:04,767
Nobody

1075
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,559
Nobody believes in reality

1076
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:12,191
To be fair

1077
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:14,751
It's just holy different versions of it

1078
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:20,383
Live in the reality of the left

1079
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:24,479
If I have to choose

1080
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:29,087
Even if you are on that side every time

1081
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:32,415
Absolutely every single time

1082
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,695
Cuz that right side

1083
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:37,023
Dicey

1084
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,583
Yeah

1085
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,423
Ark performance

1086
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:48,799
Not fact

1087
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,127
Your analysis

1088
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:53,919
Not strong

1089
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:55,967
You can't

1090
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:57,503
Read

1091
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,039
Hi

1092
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,831
And you now

1093

Shatner

1094
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,207
It's happening

1095
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:08,511
So this next clip

1096
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,279
Alex is gay

1097
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:11,839
Got to bring this all back to dim global

1098
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:15,423
Really talked about the global

1099
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:20,287
We are always

1100
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:22,079
It directly pointed at

1101
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,615
We've been

1102
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,199
Globalist

1103
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:29,759
Search

1104
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,023
Attacking

1105
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:41,791
Specifically

1106
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:45,119
Play Hilary the episode

1107
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:47,679

Jeep cars

1109
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:56,895
So that's that's a whole nother

1110
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:57,919

Media Matters

1113
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:18,655
He's basically pushing all this

1114
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:23,775
Google all the worlds

1115
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:28,383
We have hundreds of radio affiliates

1116
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:33,503
So I mean

1117
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:34,783
Fair

1118
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:42,207
Legitimate that would be kind of

1119
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:54,495
Like slice him or anything like that

1120
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,543
Keep said each one of those words

1121
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:00,127
Multiple different things that they cut out and put

Tape of John Kerry legitimately was involved

1126
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,975

Media Matters just play the selected portion out of car

1128
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,375
If you look at their site

1129
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:24,447
If you look at with the articles that Media Matters has put out

He's monetize through YouTube

1138
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:44,415
And the insinuation is that he shouldn't be

1139
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,743
He doesn't have ads on YouTube

1140
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,631
No no no no no

1141
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:56,703
As far as I can talk whenever I've watched

1142
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,983
Couple of eclipse video

1143
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,007
Pre rolls

1144
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:05,663
Itsmerkey territory and I got to say I disagree with Media Matters on this one too

1145
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:06,687
I don't

1146
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:09,759
Alex Jones

1147
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:11,807
All of the the races

1148
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:14,111
Hateful YouTube thing

1149
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:18,719
Things like it

1150
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,999
I would say that

1151
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,791
If you are selling ads

1152
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:22,559
Heads on

1153
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:23,583
Races

1154
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:26,399
Then you are directly profiting off racism

1155
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,167
Them yourself

1156
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:29,471
Yea though I I don't

1157
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,263
I don't disagree with her

1158
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:33,055
Big enough company

1159
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:36,639
A lot of times very stuffed it slips under your radar

1160
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:40,223
And then at the same time

1161
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:45,599
To focus in on Alex

1162
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:47,647
Keep doing it

1163
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,415
Horrible

1164
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:49,951
But it's not

1165
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,231
As far as

1166
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,791
Outside of

1167
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:56,607
I think that Miss speaking about

1168
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:57,887
Tweeting at

1169
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:59,423
Chris Cuomo about his kids

1170
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:05,567
Outside of that was Miss speaking for the most part I don't think

1171
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:06,335
He mad

1172
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,615
Let's go after these kids

1173
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:09,151
I don't think you meant that

1174
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:12,479
But beyond that in the time that

1175
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:18,367
It's up in the air but other than that in the entire time that we've done this show he hasn't breached

1176
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,135
Free speech

1177
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:22,463
He hasn't he's just that things that are incredibly to stay

1178
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:24,255
Yeah

1179
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:30,655
If Google were to decide that we don't want to be a part of this well within their

1180
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:36,287
Media Matters to say hey YouTube check this out

1181
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,847
That's okay too

1182
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,151
It's not how I would go about it

1183
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:41,919
But I

1184
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:46,271
No you wouldn't have a podcast

1185
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:50,623
But the thing is if you do that if you are Media Matters and you do that

1186
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:55,487
It opens up the gate for Alex to be like you want to censor me through money

1187
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:57,023
You want to take me

1188
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:59,583
And make me economically unviable

1189
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,351
Attack

1190
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:06,751
Something to be said for a slippery slope kind of situation we're now if you put pressure

1191
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:07,519
Google

1192
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,287
From Angie

1193
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,847
They have a president

1194
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,895
Getting rid of certain types of

1195
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:14,943
Objectionable speech

1196
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,479
So then you have a

1197
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:18,783
Corporation with a

1198
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,551
Insignificant

1199
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:21,343
Control over who gets to say what

1200
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,111
Where am I

1201
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:25,695
Yeah

1202
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,999
I would argue that there is some

1203
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,535
There is something to

1204
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,559
To be said for there

1205
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:34,911
Position I don't disagree with them there

1206
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,959
I wouldn't say that they were doing

1207
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:37,983
The Rock

1208
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,775
But I would say that they are setting

1209
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,591
Further

1210
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:43,871
Get out further

1211
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,151
Control over media

1212
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:47,455
It opens

1213
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:51,551
Unfortunate box

1214
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,111
VIP by Mint

1215
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,135
To doing these sorts

1216
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,671
And I'm not

1217
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,463
Super comfortable with that

1218
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,231
But

1219
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:00,767
And if Steven

1220
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:02,303
Even more

1221
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,071
Terrible

1222
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,375
This is the one thing that

1223
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:07,935
Really drives me saying about all of these

1224
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:09,471
Dugood Crusade

1225
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:11,775
Isn't there always

1226
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,567
Who are not the

1227
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,103
No

1228
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,127
Is

1229
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:21,503
Dumb little things

1230
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:25,599
The f****** lady playing

1231
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:27,647
And flu and lost her job because of a dump

1232
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,951
Capital Lighting

1233
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:31,743
Now she is just

1234
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:32,511
A f******

1235
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,815
Another ghost

1236
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:37,119
Right

1237
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,399
Because the Internet

1238
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:39,423
Point of view

1239
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:42,495
Touch her like Star around eye

1240
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,775
And then her whole life

1241
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:49,151
Wholesale I can you can come from it from either side the right

1242
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:50,431
Can f****** your license

1243
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:51,711
Totally

1244
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:57,599
That's not the problem you're really against

1245
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:59,135
You're distracting yourself with a

1246
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,927
Tiny little victory

1247
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,463
In quotes

1248
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:04,767
You're not

1249
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:07,071
Uniting to get the actual problem

1250
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:09,887
Totally agree with you

1251
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:15,519
Nobody nobody wants to fight the war

1252
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:18,335
I want the battle of the war

1253
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,175
Skirmish

1254
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,711
Malachite

1255
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:28,063
Don't do the info you just did you just did

1256
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,343
I know

1257
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:32,415
I told you we have to start mimicking some of that

1258
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:36,511
Also I want this you are looking back

1259
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,047
That's really

1260
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,863
Who is this in this situation

1261
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,679
It's pro wrestler Abyss

1262
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:46,751
No

1263
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:50,591
One point I want to make is that there's no we hate Alex

1264
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,127
More than

1265
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:52,895
I'm certain

1266
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,223
We have documented

1267
01:05:56,479 --> 01:06:00,063
Things that they covered it all their way worse than anything

1268
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:00,831
He is

1269
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:01,855
Atrocious

1270
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:04,671
Something that is merely

1271
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:05,695
Horrendous

1272
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:07,743
Now I want to flip this also

1273
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,279
We have been more

1274
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:11,071
Fair to him than they have ever been

1275
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:17,983
They would never post something like that episode where half of it was up talking about either

1276
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,775
Episode

1277
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,591
I'm coming to Alex's defense slightly

1278
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:25,919
Ever since that I don't think that these articles that say

1279
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:28,223
Are speculating they should be arrested

1280
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:29,247
Have any validity

1281
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:33,343
Zombie Madison

1282
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:36,927
We're being so much more fair to him and hate him more

1283
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:38,207
Memes

1284
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,231
I think

1285
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,767
That we're impartial

1286
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:44,095
Edwards dealing with the reality

1287
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:46,911
Yeah I understand your point is f****** well-taken

1288
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,191
But Alex isn't

1289
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:50,495
No problem he is a problem

1290
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,263
But he is

1291
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,543
Do what we talked about

1292
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:54,335
So we just focus on that

1293
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:56,639
Now at the end of this clip

1294
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:58,943
You saying that he has hundreds

1295
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,479
What does Rino

1296
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,551
He lies about that a ton

1297
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:05,855
And claimed we have a bunch of secret affiliates

1298
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,903
Millions of unique click

1299
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:11,487
I went to

1300
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,279
Because I wanted to check in on me

1301
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:15,071
Yeah we haven't done that since

1302
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,351
What does

1303
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:21,983
Grown-ups things were were drunk

1304
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:26,847
NTB fairy does appear that the traffic to his website has gone up a little bit

1305
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,151
He's in about the maid

1306
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:30,431
300000

1307
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:32,479
Viewers the day on his website

1308
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:34,271
Right which is

1309
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:36,319
If you're going by the week

1310
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,623
That is millions

1311
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,647
That is

1312
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,207
Free

1313
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,487
300000

1314
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,279
A day 7 days a week

1315
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,303
21

1316
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,071
2.1

1317
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:48,351
So that is

1318
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,631
Both of them

1319
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:53,727
Strictest definition of what he saying

1320
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:55,007
Yes it is

1321
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:59,871
45 million but it's also not because I'm counting unique

1322
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:01,663
Viewers and they go by day

1323
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:05,759
The lot of those 300,000 are going everyday

1324
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:08,319
But that would not turn on

1325
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:12,671
It's not 2.1 million people that could be 600,000 people

1326
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:15,743
You just keep going back to the site everyday

1327
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:17,023
Does he say

1328
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:21,887
The only

1329
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:24,447
The only day that he really had a huge Spike

1330
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:26,751
20th

1331
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,031
He ended up with

1332
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:28,799
800

1333
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:30,079
T4000

1334
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:34,431
Unique views, testified in from the app

1335
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,223
So

1336
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:40,575
In front of the intelligence

1337
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:43,903
I wound up on bright

1338
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:52,607
To the go back in there be like oh my God crazy

1339
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:54,911
Yeah

1340
01:08:55,423 --> 01:09:01,567
Yeah it's still right around that rains there a couple 25% most likely is of the bot variety

1341
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:03,359
It's impossible to tell

1342
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:05,663
Can't they don't have a way to

1343
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,223
Fat ferret that out

1344
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:12,063
80% male in the audience

1345
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:14,879
Where we have

1346
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:21,279
Your 43% is over the age of 45

1347
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,047
5

1348
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,863
Which is slightly younger than

1349
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:25,631
Fox news's audience

1350
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:28,191
I'm sorry 53% is over the age

1351
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:28,959
G45

1352
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:31,007
75% of the audience

1353
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:32,031
2 / 35

1354
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:33,823
6% is

1355
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:35,615
18 or younger 6

1356
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,383
4 * 18

1357
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:37,407
24

1358
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,967
85% Caucasian

1359
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:44,319
Words

1360
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:46,111
That's a huge number

1361
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,135
Who could have

1362
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,927
That is not on

1363
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:52,511
That's not irrelevant

1364
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:54,559
Imagine that

1365
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:56,095
3% African-American

1366
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,119
20% Asian

1367
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,703
Nothing over 10

1368
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,471
Percent except

1369
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,239
For Caucasian

1370
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:04,287
85%

1371
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:10,431
55% or 53% of them over 45 82% male

1372
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:13,247
What time are you getting up his f****** audien

1373
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:15,551
Albino

1374
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:18,879
Maybe what if it's Brother Ali

1375
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:20,927
Brother Ali

1376
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:22,719
Also

1377
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:25,535
Then I'm not sitting on people who make under the map but

1378
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,583
40% of his audience makes of Euro.

1379
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:28,351
50k a year

1380
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:37,055
Lowest bracket

1381
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:39,871
Lowest income bracket

1382
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:44,991
Feel like

1383
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:51,647
80% of the world probably has much less relevant than the 85%

1384
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:55,231
Most relevant 85%

1385
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:55,999
NBA

1386
01:10:56,255 --> 01:11:00,863
Michael's white male 35 and older because

1387
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:02,911
Did they do update these statistics

1388
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:03,935
XM Satellite

1389
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:09,311
His number is I believe that I can't remember exactly but I think the last time we checked in

1390
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:11,103
It was not even

1391
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,127
Bad

1392
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,919
Not terms of race breakdown

1393
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:16,735
I just like that I think it might be losing minority

1394
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:17,503
Which

1395
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:19,039
Totally makes sense

1396
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:25,439
Get the 45 million people watch your stuff every week it just can't be true based on the numbers that I've seen on you

1397
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:27,999
About 300,000

1398
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:31,583
Unique views to your website a day based on

1399
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:35,423
You have to be adding up every single video that you post

1400
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:38,751
And pretending you don't understand that a lot of people watch all of

1401
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:41,567
If you want to do that you're cheating

1402
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:46,687
I mean whatever play the game baby please

1403
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:49,247
Agree

1404
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:55,647
Yeah I know I like

1405
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:59,487
If you want to make the argument that who are you to talk your numbers or s***

1406
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:01,279
Fair enough

1407
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:02,303
We don't

1408
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:09,215
We just also admit that you're stuck to Alex

1409
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:10,751
What about h

1410
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:12,799
So this next clip is more about the globe

1411
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:25,855
Publications of the elite

1412
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:30,975
Department

1413
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:47,359
I mean

1414
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:49,407
There's no way he couldn't have seen that

1415
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,175
Coming either

1416
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:55,039
Like the moment he got that outrage

1417
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:57,087
The next day

1418
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:57,855
Somebody was like

1419
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:59,391
Here's what's going to happen

1420
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:05,791
They're going to pick up that clip or one of them put it out there at everybody

1421
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:07,583
The next

1422
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:08,351
Angle

1423
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:10,911
And so on forever and ever and ever in perfect

1424
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:14,751
Here is what I believe is the level of premeditation to this

1425
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,799
Annoyed

1426
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:19,615
Be about

1427
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:20,639
Cuz he was drunk

1428
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:22,687
Yes and he was Furious

1429
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:23,967
If you just started

1430
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,527
And eventually

1431
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:28,319
So tired

1432
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:29,343
So tired

1433
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:32,159
So interested in teaching the baby there's only one way to learn

1434
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:38,559
After the show probably someone did have that talk with him

1435
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,887
Is brother-in-law Buckley

1436
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:43,679
Probably came over and was like

1437
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:44,447
Hey man

1438
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,215
Now listen up

1439
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:47,519
What's going to happen

1440
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:48,543
Just get lazy

1441
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:53,663
Okay it's definitely easier 48b to C2.

1442
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,431
And then

1443
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:55,199
It's checkers

1444
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:59,551
We're covering this clip that Alex put out

1445
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:02,367
And I mean the f****** b******* part about it is

1446
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,647
The most recent

1447
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:10,047
Peace matters put out is Alex Violet Adam Schiff remarks were just

1448
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:11,583
Tongue-in-cheek and are performing

1449
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,375
So they're going back on it

1450
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:15,679
And he's going to say yes

1451
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:17,983
Cuz that's what they are no response

1452
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:20,799
Impotent

1453
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:23,871
I'm rubber you're glue

1454
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:25,663
Exactly

1455
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:26,687
Everybody's

1456
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:32,063
But more to the point of this

1457
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,087
I mean like

1458
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:34,367
The articles

1459
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:38,207
That he's talking about your glue

1460
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,231
What bounces off

1461
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:42,303
Peter rubber

1462
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,071
John rain

1463
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:47,167
Edit that out

1464
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:50,495
John Wayne

1465
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:53,055
Miserably

1466
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,431
He says that

1467
01:14:58,687 --> 01:14:59,711
Uno

1468
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:00,735
Comprehension

1469
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,063
Globalist

1470
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:07,647
They're saying all these things

1471
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:10,975
Just learn to read out

1472
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:16,095
They're both just the things they're not

1473
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:18,911
Like across the street at each other

1474
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:20,703
But pointed in the opposite direction

1475
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:24,287
Are actually engaging with the other one

1476
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:25,311
In any kind

1477
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:26,079
Meaningful way

1478
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:28,639
I've actually I've actually done a bit of research

1479
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:30,175
Listen to this

1480
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,271
I'm riding

1481
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:38,879
About Alex Jones claims that he was a boy

1482
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:39,647
And was doing

1483
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:46,559
I also have reading at the age of 60

1484
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:49,375
Interesting is that you like most evil

1485
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:51,423
Able to read Around the age of 6

1486
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:54,495
About when you start to read

1487
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:56,287
Picture books then and you started

1488
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,567
Maybe get into

1489
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:59,615
The chapters like maybe

1490
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:01,407
6 is the bottom range

1491
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:05,759
Elementary books

1492
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:08,319
They'll be in the library with a silver medals on the

1493
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:10,367
Yeah sure you're get like

1494
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:11,647
Shel

1495
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,183
Around that

1496
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:18,815
There are Advanced readers were able to read like

1497
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:23,423
Newbery Award winners

1498
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,959
Write like a hatchet

1499
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:26,495
Or something like that

1500
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:34,687
I remember

1501
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:41,087
Behind two ferns or Bridge to Terabithia

1502
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:43,647
No that's what I would Hand by six-year-old

1503
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:44,927
Just be like this is what f***

1504
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:45,695
Can life is like

1505
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:49,791
Now I think this is the reason that I breathe

1506
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,095
Is because

1507
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:53,375
He brought up his own literacy

1508
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:55,935
And we've shown repeatedly

1509
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,727
Of the articles that he discusses

1510
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:01,055
So I did some research into

1511
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,591
The idea of

1512
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:05,151
What age literacy

1513
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:07,711
Usually

1514
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,735
I bought

1515
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:11,039
Child psychology

1516
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:14,367
The ability to think abstractly

1517
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:17,183
Doesn't usually develop until about the age of app

1518
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:19,743
11 is kind of on the downside of

1519
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:20,767
Interested

1520
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:26,911
If you don't know the ability to think abstractly is basically understanding symbolism and metaphor

1521
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:28,703
The idea of dealing with tech

1522
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:31,263
Using critical thinking

1523
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:32,543
Understanding argue

1524
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:33,823
Imitation

1525
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:36,383
Usually art around until you're about in like 5th grade

1526
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:38,687
Point

1527
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:40,479
Most of education is

1528
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:43,039
Nurturing what's there

1529
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:44,831
I'm being really

1530
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:47,135
Simple but like we're building a base

1531
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:47,903
Yeah

1532
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:51,999
The idea that I was like I was reading all these high-end things

1533
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,279
When I was

1534
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:54,559
Probably was but it wasn't

1535
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:56,351
Understanding either that or

1536
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:03,263
Probably all

1537
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:05,823
Many Geniuses have dropped

1538
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:08,127
Community College

1539
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:11,199
Big Lots to begin with

1540
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:12,479
Also

1541
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:17,855
I want to get into it I looked into the dropout rate of Austin Area Community College

1542
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:18,879
You should have dropped

1543
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:20,927
I got it back on that

1544
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:23,999
It looks like a terrible program

1545
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:27,327
Here's my theory

1546
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:29,887
Hold some water

1547
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:33,471
Alex started reading really complicated things when he was young

1548
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:35,263
Maybe even the age of 60

1549
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:36,031
Bucky reports

1550
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:37,823
But he didn't understand him

1551
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:39,359
But because he is

1552
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:40,639
Stubborn

1553
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:43,455
Cuz he's bull-headed cuz he's the Texan

1554
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:45,503
These are things

1555
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:47,295
When he was that young

1556
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,831
Thought he was understanding

1557
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:52,159
So then he never bothered to actually

1558
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:52,927
Learn how to

1559
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:53,951
Bingo

1560
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:55,743
That's what your theory is that

1561
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:59,583
He never felt the need

1562
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:02,399
To take the real step into critical thinking

1563
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:06,751
He never actually went through with screams about the rights of

1564
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:09,823
Message all the time he never went through

1565
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:10,591
Abstract

1566
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:12,895
Thought he only thinks concretely

1567
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,967
Okay he is lying

1568
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:21,087
Whoodle whatever the vet one

1569
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:24,159
How to say let's just talk

1570
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:25,439
Occam's razor that's right

1571
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:28,767
My schema

1572
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:33,375
My schema my world my argument that

1573
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:34,399
Wood

1574
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,167
Blaine

1575
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:38,495
His inability to use literacy correctly

1576
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,263
Wood

1577
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:42,591
Bye

1578
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:44,895
Him reading all this intellectual s*** when he was sick

1579
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:51,295
I'm thinking you understood it when I will engage with you on your own conspiracy theory

1580
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:57,183
It's not though

1581
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:02,047
Do we have any corroboration from any other human being on the planet

1582
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:06,143
Nobody nobody

1583
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:09,727
Therapist all they have to go on is your word

1584
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,007
Yeah

1585
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:13,055
Afterwards

1586
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:13,824
What's the weather

1587
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:15,360
Please help me

1588
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:16,896
Fill your hand

1589
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,432
I think

1590
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:20,224
If we are dealing with our

1591
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:23,552
It's all we really have to go on

1592
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:27,904
We have to take him at his word

1593
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:30,976
By what we know about

1594
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:35,584
Troubleshoot when he was young

1595
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,864
Younger and didn't understand

1596
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,424
Matches up with

1597
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:43,776
Conspiracy theory

1598
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:50,944
Except again counter Siri and I will I will give you a little bit more

1599
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:51,968
Directly on this one

1600
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:52,992
Perhaps

1601
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:54,784
I'm not well

1602
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:58,624
Never developed those critical thinking skills

1603
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:02,720
Necessarily start reading

1604
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,768
Maybe he read them

1605
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:07,840
But he never actually developed the ability to have

1606
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:11,936
I strongly disagree with this

1607
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,984
He did read

1608
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:16,032
That book none dare call it again

1609
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,080
Conspiracy that changed his life

1610
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:18,848
When he was 12

1611
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:20,384
Right

1612
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,688
So that had to have happen

1613
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:24,736
That's a fixed point

1614
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:28,320
In our Doctor Who universe

1615
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:33,952
Maybe we could get in the Tardis and go back in

1616
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:40,352
So much better freezing point

1617
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:43,936
Would know how to use a time machine properly

1618
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:44,960
It would be the two

1619
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:48,288
Yeah absolutely no killing Hitler

1620
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,312
No thank you no

1621
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:52,384
No stop installing chairman Mount nothing

1622
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,664
What we would do

1623
01:21:54,176 --> 01:22:00,320
Is we will remove one book from the Austin Public Library

1624
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:09,280
No one last job no retirement nothing like that my argument because I have read none

1625
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:10,048
Conspiracy

1626
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:12,096
Is that Alex Reds there

1627
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:14,656
At a point when he could not have been taken

1628
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,448
Right

1629
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:21,056
That didn't develop by the time he was 12

1630
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:23,104
So all this stuff

1631
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:27,200
If he's read all these history books and all these military history books

1632
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:30,016
Even before that cuz he started when he was sick

1633
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:33,088
Treating them with the same

1634
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:35,136
Undeveloped brain that he read

1635
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:37,184
Percy when he was 12

1636
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,464
The one

1637
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:42,048
Yeah he's tried to sell it on Eric Appel time

1638
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,912
No he does not like this is the greatest buckets

1639
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:50,496
The best primer in the New World Order

1640
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:52,544
In the same way that

1641
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,592
Like WWII veterans with

1642
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:55,872
Crab like

1643
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:00,480
Definitely

1644
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:02,272
Prized possession

1645
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,296
And Alex Jones

1646
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,320
Signed copy of

1647
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:07,904
I would put that on my wall

1648
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:10,464
Right next to what I assume is

1649
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,256
His torso

1650
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:15,328
Pictures of Big Barrel

1651
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:17,632
I do have a copy of it and I think

1652
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:19,424
Pretty soon we should do an episode about it

1653
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,240
I mean why not

1654
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:23,264
With a serious

1655
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,312
Things to do

1656
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:28,128
Let's do the

1657
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:29,152
Conspiracy episode

1658
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:35,552
Let's do a Protocols of the Elders of Zion episode War develops

1659
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:42,976
Anyway before we're on Pirate Radio

1660
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:44,000
We've got a little bit

1661
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:45,792
Down-the-rabbit-hole here

1662
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:48,608
But Alex Jones gear

1663
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:50,912
To get into

1664
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,216
Has he ever gone down there

1665
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:56,544
Red Wings

1666
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,312
Willows

1667
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:58,848
Okay I guess he hasn't read

1668
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,920
Mr. Toad's Wild Ride

1669
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:07,808
Mr. Toad's Wild Ride Disneyland

1670
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:10,368
Traumatize me of the boy

1671
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:13,696
Anyway we can all agree didn't read The Velveteen Rabbit

1672
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:15,488
He also didn't read

1673
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:22,656
I can't imagine that he actually read anything about World War based on his actions

1674
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:27,520
Cuz if you read books about WWII you're going to run into the Sugar Bowl

1675
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:29,568
And how you're going to run into that cat

1676
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:33,664
And Alex is doing exactly what gerbils

1677
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:40,832
I am a

1678
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:43,904
He didn't have any comprehension of what he was reading

1679
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:44,672
And reading

1680
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:45,952
Took the wrong lesson away from it

1681
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:57,984
Was by his bedside

1682
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:00,800
Gets a little bit more into his idea that is reims or art pieces

1683
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:02,080
So enjoy that

1684
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:04,896
Merle Haggard

1685
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:06,944
You're welcome

1686
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:12,320
Information

1687
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:17,440
Communism

1688
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:22,048
Literally mean

1689
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:25,376
4 is nonviolent

1690
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:27,680
Comz2 often

1691
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:28,448
Defense

1692
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:29,728
Everyone knows that

1693
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,008
Everyone understands that

1694
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:33,568
And we see The Incredibles

1695
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:47,136
Offensive finals

1696
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:52,000
I am disgusted by the left

1697
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:57,120
Vancouver

1698
01:25:57,376 --> 01:26:03,520
Shopmate of the New Black Panther Party marching around talk about the only good pic of the

1699
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:04,288
The dead pig in

1700
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:10,944
Cops keep killing black people

1701
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:13,760
More importantly

1702
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,088
This idea that he has

1703
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:18,368
Felt like

1704
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:20,160
Violence is a metaphor

1705
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:21,440
I'm into it

1706
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:23,488
Because I like rat

1707
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,512
I like hip hop

1708
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:25,280
Okay

1709
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:28,352
Xo1 whenever I hear

1710
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:30,144
Rappers talk about

1711
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:31,936
Metaphorical violin

1712
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:34,240
Generally what they're talkin about is

1713
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:36,032
Verbal Supremacy

1714
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:39,872
Yeah they're talking about I'm better at rapping do I'm going to Burke you on the mic

1715
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,408
Leave these artifacts

1716
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:44,736
Sure

1717
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:48,320
Actually

1718
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:49,344
Go out there with guns

1719
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:54,720
I mean but metaphorically they wouldn't

1720
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:00,352
It is time to get the

1721
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:11,616
Spell therapist

1722
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:15,200
Jojo

1723
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,736
Come on now

1724
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:23,136
I don't know why that's Mike's response to Yule Legend

1725
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:24,160
I'm on now

1726
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:26,464
I think it's my favorite Hangout

1727
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,632
More to the point like I get that

1728
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:35,424
I get violence metaphors

1729
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,448
4 things that aren't vial

1730
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:37,984
That's not what you're doing

1731
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:39,776
They're literally

1732
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,848
You really can't you can't

1733
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:47,456
Mine's how he could believe that

1734
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:48,992
Is not about offense

1735
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:50,272
Anthony is all about

1736
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:52,576
He is always

1737
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:53,600
React

1738
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:55,392
Because you're paranoid

1739
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:56,416
He is always

1740
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,720
To an attack whether or not

1741
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:00,768
So of course

1742
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:02,304
Every

1743
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:05,632
Is

1744
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:06,400
Didn't retaliate

1745
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:08,448
When he wants

1746
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:12,800
What's the talk about like I only appreciate violence as defense.

1747
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:14,080
To refer you to ever

1748
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:14,848
Thing you said about Noir

1749
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:17,408
Literally

1750
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:18,432
Shreksophone

1751
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,272
Yes

1752
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:28,160
90% of people are going to die

1753
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:29,952
They screwed us over there

1754
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:30,976
Turned

1755
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:32,768
Next clip

1756
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:34,560
Is observative

1757
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:37,888
He gets a little bit more into the violent metaphors

1758
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:43,264
After their Jihad

1759
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:45,824
Plus calling frivolity is Donald Trump

1760
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:46,848
Supporters

1761
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:48,640
Beating them up

1762
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:54,784
I am now committing crimes

1763
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:59,904
Talking about I want to kick your butt or whatever when clearly I'm talking about

1764
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,184
The information

1765
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,464
Unbelievable

1766
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:03,232
Unbelievable

1767
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:05,024
It is

1768
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:09,888
So if you want to diagram that you saying these people have been

1769
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,424
Ipang

1770
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:15,520
I'm trying to overthrow Trump server murder

1771
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:17,056
I also they've been

1772
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:18,080
I'm picking fights

1773
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:20,640
Trump supporters

1774
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:22,688
Alright then

1775
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:23,968
They're wrong

1776
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:25,504
4

1777
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,784
Then I was trying to

1778
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:29,088
Say that I committed a crime

1779
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:31,392
I did on

1780
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:33,696
Now here's itsfunneh

1781
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:40,352
Dangerous Waters

1782
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:41,376
No

1783
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:44,960
That statement is totally cool

1784
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:48,032
You twist

1785
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:49,824
You know why

1786
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:52,896
Cuz everything is a lie

1787
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,200
It doesn't matter

1788
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,528
The argument that he's trying to make is just

1789
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:03,648
What is premises and Ally

1790
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:15,168
The only time you get in trouble with logic as when you have premises

1791
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,960
That is where you get into

1792
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:18,752
Trouble with logic

1793
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:20,800
That means that your inference is wrong

1794
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:23,616
That means that you claiming that

1795
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:25,920
Your promises leader

1796
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:30,528
And they lead to a true conclusion

1797
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:31,808
That's okay

1798
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:35,136
Unit 2.

1799
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:37,184
Folsom Prison

1800
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,208
It all doesn't matter

1801
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:38,976
Gotcha

1802
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:40,000
So

1803
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:43,328
And this in your summation

1804
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:45,632
What you just said doesn't matter

1805
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:52,032
It's super wrong but it doesn't matter

1806
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:54,592
You're not making an

1807
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,408
Congratulations

1808
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,688
You have said

1809
01:30:58,944 --> 01:30:59,456
Nothing

1810
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:04,320
I'll say this

1811
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:06,368
Even if we want to come

1812
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:09,440
I've said no

1813
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:10,464
Even

1814
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:12,000
Even if you want to Grant

1815
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,280
But it's possible that his

1816
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:14,048
Conclusion

1817
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:16,096
The people radeline for saying

1818
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:17,632
You should be arrested or

1819
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:20,704
If you want to grant that is a true statement

1820
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:24,544
The premises were false

1821
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:26,336
All bulshit

1822
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:31,968
It's so delicious it's someone who has the ability to

1823
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:32,992
Think critically

1824
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:34,528
Engaged

1825
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:35,552
With

1826
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:38,112
The arguments of a lunatic

1827
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:40,928
It's so fun that part that clip was so fun

1828
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:45,280
Alex has more evidence that Trump is being threatened

1829
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:56,032
24-hour Save-A-Lot

1830
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:57,568
Bow Wow

1831
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:03,456
Basically says go up murder the president shoot him in the head

1832
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:11,648
Nothing's done

1833
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:29,568
Coffered ceiling

1834
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,360
So that again

1835
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:35,712
Monster this is all within this 10-minute clip he's just repeating everything

1836
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:38,528
All those same examples nothing there's nothing

1837
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:41,344
Tons of people on Twitter

1838
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,672

01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:07,712
Into my head

01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:11,040
That would be great episode 4

1848
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:13,600
Snoop Dogg put out

Cartoon vines

Trope

1853
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,912
People have been on Twitter calling for the Deaf

1854
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:29,728
There is that

1855
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:32,032

Baba baba

1858
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:40,992
Trump tweeted at Snoop Dogg about like his failing career and like

1859
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:41,760
What world

1860
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:44,064
I don't know I don't know

1861
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:46,368
The words

01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:48,160
Trump tweeted at Snoop Dogg

1863
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:49,952
And I realized

1864
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:50,720
You meant

1865
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:53,280
Resident of the United States

1866
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:54,048
Trump

Tweeted at Snoop Dogg

1868
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:57,376

1870
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:00,704
So dark

1871
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:01,984
Ebro Darden

1872
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:05,824
How do I get to moment bases

1873
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:07,616
In this world thinking that

1874
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:08,640
Things Are

1875
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:09,920
Normal

You talk about my uncle like that

1882
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:32,960
He's not literally cuz uncle.

1883
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:36,800
Listener for Alex Jones listeners

1884
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:43,456
Connection between the two is that when Lil Bow Wow with Lil Bow Wow is Jermaine Dupri

1885
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:50,880
And Snoop Dogg gave his name

1886
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:53,184
I saw the two of them had a connection

1887
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:54,720
Throughout

1888
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:57,280
In his twenties now he's

1889
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:59,584
Treated

1890
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:02,656
We'll see what you think when we pimp your wife

1891
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:08,032
That's pretty funny

1892
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:10,336
It's still pretty

1893
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:15,200
Right but I'm still on board

1894
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:22,112
Posters the other side is absolutely

1895
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:24,160
Sure

1896
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:27,744
For all of my thought

1897
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,536
I'm going to err on the side of Bow Wow

1898
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:30,560
1 guys

1899
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:32,864
I think car washes should be universe

1900
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:37,472
Alright we're going to pimp your wife and make her work for us

1901
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:38,496
Like

1902
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:40,032
That's not

1903
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:41,568
Really

1904
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:44,384
That is

1905
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:48,992
It's just some aggressive imagery unless

1906
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,064
Intuit witch

1907
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:54,112
We don't know for sure

1908
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:56,928
We're not insinuate

1909
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:00,768
Which suggests

1910
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:02,048
She was bought at 1

1911
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:05,120
Well the most important point I think even taking medicine

1912
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:07,680
Entire time

1913
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:08,960
Talk about his violin

1914
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:11,776
How everything is a metaphor for the

1915
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:18,432
Without Really engaging and recognizing this is ideal I'm going to pimp your wife

1916
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:21,248
Is definitely misogynistic and I don't

1917
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:25,856
I don't enjoy that I don't think it's right their implications

1918
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:26,880
Infopass

1919
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:30,720
What it is is

1920
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:32,512
Braggadocio

1921
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:35,328
It is within the world of Hip Hop

1922
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:36,352
Like it is

1923
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:43,264
There are feminist implications that we should recognize and be like that

1924
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,800
You to give him the benefit

1925
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:46,336
Benefit of the doubt

1926
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:47,360
Comes to his threat

1927
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:48,640
And he refused

1928
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:50,688
Anyone else even though

1929
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:51,456
Slightest

1930
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:53,248
Especially black people

1931
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:54,528
Especially black

1932
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:58,624
It's that it's

1933
01:36:58,880 --> 01:36:59,904
Utter insanity

1934
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:01,952
I really don't like how long

1935
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:02,720
We've been going on about

1936
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,024
Cameo out of there

1937
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:07,584
Gloves

1938
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:08,608
Bow Wow

1939
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:11,680
Next clip

1940
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:13,216
It gets back to his performance art

1941
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:23,712
I let myself a satirical things Wild Things whatever

1942
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:44,192
You're the people calling for violence you're the people pushing all this crap

1943
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:53,664
Marshall radio show

1944
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:09,792
False flag

1945
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:11,584
Well

1946
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:12,352
I mean

1947
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:14,144
Don't

1948
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:15,680
Higher leaf

1949
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:16,448
Disagree with

1950
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:17,216
Stomach

1951
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:18,496
She said

1952
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:23,616
If you talk about people in Congress they're super unpopular

1953
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:28,224
I mean the fact he was doing it he wasn't doing it on his radio show

1954
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:31,040
He was doing it on a late-night ride

1955
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:40,256
Sing right now you are

1956
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:52,032
Doing everything I can to avoid their busy being unstatic

1957
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:54,080
But the idea

1958
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:58,176
One of the most effective things you can do in terms

1959
01:38:58,432 --> 01:39:01,504
Getting people to think you're doing something when you're not

1960
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,552
Is pretending you have a big anime

1961
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,856
Like you pretending

1962
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:06,880
Is massive Force out

1963
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:07,648
How to get me

1964
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:10,208
Idea that anyone really is trying

1965
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:11,744
Get the FCC to shot him

1966
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:12,512
Absurd

1967
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:13,792
It's absolutely

1968
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:15,840
It's not really happening I don't even

1969
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:16,608
Take me to Mathers

1970
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:22,496
Having that

1971
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:24,288
No government

1972
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:25,312
GolfNow

1973
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:31,712
Like Google is bad enough if you want them to do something about it

1974
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:38,368
That is not you don't want to get you don't want to open that door.

1975
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:39,648
Yes would definitely not be

1976
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:41,952
Everyone knows that

1977
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:43,232
Everyone f****** nose

1978
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:44,256
Not everyone

1979
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:47,840
But everyone who would petition the FCC knows that

1980
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:50,656
Next clip

1981
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:52,960
Does backflip

1982
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:54,240
What's next clip Jordan

1983
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:56,288
Is the end

1984
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:58,336
Elizabeth summation that Alex makes

1985
01:39:58,848 --> 01:39:59,616
And

1986
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:00,640
I want to be very

1987
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:01,408
Clear about this

1988
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:03,456
I don't think he's made a point

1989
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:06,784
When we get to the end of this play out

1990
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:07,808
This is how we

1991
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:08,576
The clip

1992
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:10,112
And with a real

1993
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:11,648
Slam dunk of a bird

1994
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:14,208
But I really don't think he's made a point by the

1995
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,888
Because I know what I said

1996
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:25,472
I know the intent of what I said and I know that the people

1997
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:27,264
They're pushing for me to be arrested

1998
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:31,360
Calling for the president

1999
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:44,672
Democrats are calling for it

2000
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:46,976
I do have to be careful though

2001
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:51,072
About what I said contact

2002
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:53,120
I mean

2003
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:02,080
I don't really got hurt this country

2004
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:09,760
It almost sounds like someone threatened to sue him again

2005
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:12,320
Because

2006
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:13,344
He's very much

2007
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:14,880
Quick retraction

2008
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:22,816
I know that he's bad for this country but I don't

2009
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:26,144
That kind of goes against his character is he

2010
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:27,680
Yeah his kids

2011
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:29,472
What's his wife

2012
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:36,896
I did I did see an article about family

2013
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:38,944
I don't know

2014
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:44,576
But listen

2015
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:46,112
You grieve meet at the point

2016
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:49,952
If he thinks that someone is an enemy of the country is bad for the country

2017
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:53,536
Advocating violence

2018
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:58,656
Face on his own premises

2019
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:00,192
Yeah well

2020
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:00,960
I mean

2021
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:03,008
When if you if you

2022
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:07,616
Take all of his previous statements together we're in if you are an enemy

2023
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:09,664
If you are

2024
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:10,944
An actor

2025
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:13,504
Advocating violence

2026
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:14,272
Overthrow

2027
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:15,296
In the past

2028
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:19,392
You said the only way that we can buy using around

2029
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:25,280
So if he is to say that now.

2030
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:26,560
No I never ad

2031
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:32,704
Violence

2032
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:35,008
Particular in

2033
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:42,176
God damn he is full of b******* in that regard

2034
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:43,456
I mean it

2035
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:45,760
It smells like

2036
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:46,528
A letter might have

2037
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:47,808
Central much like

2038
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:49,344
The pizzagate

2039
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:50,368
I mean I see

2040
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:51,392
The Rock

2041
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:52,672
Is Coco

2042
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:53,952
You smell it

2043
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:56,000
I think this isn't quite.

2044
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:04,192
Yes I do online

2045
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:06,240
You should ask yourselves

2046
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:16,992
For 6 years

2047
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:18,016
Federal Prison

2048
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:20,064
Good luck with that

2049
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:32,864
I didn't cut that at all I didn't I didn't edit it he immediately dropped a commercial

2050
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:33,888
And after he was like

2051
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:37,728
I hope you guys are fine with that you Hypocrites and then did a wink

2052
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:42,336
Probiotic

2053
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:43,616
Commercial

2054
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:46,688
What where do you get six years exactly

2055
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:48,736
Really weird drop

2056
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:51,808
I don't know I don't know is there like some sort of

2057
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:58,720
Likes

2058
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:00,000
Will put you away

2059
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:00,768
No I don't know

2060
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:02,048
I think you probably was

2061
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:06,144
I'm not sure I don't know what that's about

2062
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:10,496
So point is that is unfortunately an effective video

2063
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:11,520
Like

2064
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:14,336
We had some problems with there's a lot of bulshit within it

2065
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:18,944
Some of the points he's making our founded

2066
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:25,088
I would say on any given

2067
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:26,368
Episode where at

2068
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:29,184
99%.

2069
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:32,512
10 minutes we're at more like 60/40

2070
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:36,096
I would say 70-30 maybe I think your model generator

2071
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:42,496
Very idea

2072
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:43,520
The f****** miracle

2073
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:45,824
And it feels like it to us too

2074
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:48,640
Yeah is the reason is because he does have a diesel

2075
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:50,944
Leg to stand on when these people

2076
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:52,992
Take his words out of context and attack

2077
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:54,784
Is that is

2078
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:56,064
The most

2079
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:58,368
Destructive thing you can do if you're against him

2080
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:00,672
So I beg of you

2081
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:01,696
Stop

2082
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:03,488
Your your point

2083
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:06,048
We all hate

2084
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:07,584
Dear Media Matters

2085
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:10,144
Emulator

2086
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:14,752
You have a much better platform payout

2087
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:15,520
People

2088
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:17,312
Mainly off

2089
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:19,616
We will be thrown to the Wayside

2090
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:21,664
Aldi's Corporate America

2091
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:22,688
Want to do

2092
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:29,088
No they could just pay off on a week ago she ate something

2093
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:30,880
Negotiators they could probably pay us

2094
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:41,632
Knowledge B affiliated

2095
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:43,936
Very similar to Alex Jones

2096
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:46,752
You know I bet that's the Best Buy

2097
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:49,568
My sort of self-serving point that I want to make

2098
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:51,360
Please stop please stop

2099
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:52,128
You're harming this

2100
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:53,920
It's it's a bad way to go

2101
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:56,480
The other argument

2102
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:58,272
Be made there though

2103
01:45:58,528 --> 01:45:59,040
Is

2104
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:00,576
His audience

2105
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:02,112
Dumb dumb

2106
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:05,440
They're like a little little little lollipop

2107
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:06,976
So

2108
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:09,792
I mean he is a joke

2109
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,840
Like that's true

2110
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:14,912
The worrisome part of it

2111
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:16,704
Now

2112
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,240
As compared to

2113
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:19,008
Yellow

2114
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:20,288
A year ago

2115
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:21,056
We were also

2116
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:22,848
And life so innocent

2117
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:24,896
So beautiful

2118
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:27,200
Black man was in the White House

2119
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:28,992
Great we were bombing

2120
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:30,528
Most countries

2121
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:31,808
But not all of them

2122
01:46:32,064 --> 01:46:33,856
Play most of the same once again bear

2123
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:37,696
But but now that Alex Jones is

2124
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,536
Personal contact

2125
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:42,560
With the white

2126
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:43,328
He's got

2127
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:45,120
Multiple members of the

2128
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:49,728
Well it's shrinking by the day

2129
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:51,008
But that is

2130
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:51,776
Is kind of

2131
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:53,056
Now

2132
01:46:53,312 --> 01:46:53,824
You should not

2133
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:55,616
Because if you

2134
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:56,896
Seriously

2135
01:46:57,408 --> 01:46:57,920
Your attack

2136
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:00,992
Germs

2137
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:03,040
Wines

2138
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:04,832
Kirkland down through

2139
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:08,672
If you if you look at what Alex Jones

2140
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:10,720
A lot of

2141
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:12,768
A watered-down

2142
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:14,304
Shows up

2143
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:18,656
Yep like that

2144
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:21,984
Take some of that anger and bigotry out of it

2145
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:23,264
It is often

2146
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:27,616
Yeah very similar of what bulshit they

2147
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:28,896
How many times

2148
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:31,200
Has Sean Spicer come out in

2149
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:31,968
Instead like

2150
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:34,784
Well what used to be true that

2151
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:38,112
The witches are used to be lies then

2152
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:39,392
It's magic

2153
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:44,512
It's a John rain situation.

2154
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:45,792
I have

2155
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:47,840
A tremendous amount of fear that

2156
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:48,864
I mean we're in for

2157
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:49,888
Either

2158
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:52,192
Six months of trump or 8 years

2159
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:54,752
Either way

2160
01:47:57,056 --> 01:47:58,848
You really need to start engaging

2161
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:00,384
What

2162
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:01,920
Crazy people are saying

2163
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:02,944
Cousin

2164
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:06,272
The crazy is now the fox

2165
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:09,856
Call Susan Rice story

2166
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:11,136
That's nothing

2167
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:13,696
It was broke by Mike's

2168
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:16,000
Yeah Mike cernovich broke that

2169
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:21,376
He is a complete lunatic

2170
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:22,656
Monster ass hoe

2171
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:24,448
Yep we could do

2172
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:26,240
Also about him

2173
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:27,264
We won't

2174
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:31,616
Valparaiso

2175
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:33,152
To please the same level as

2176
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:34,432
Pjw

2177
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:37,504
You

2178
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:38,528
Weirdo

2179
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:39,296
It dick

2180
01:48:39,552 --> 01:48:40,064
But like

2181
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:41,856
He broke that store

2182
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:43,648
Trump started talking

2183
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:46,720
Trump tweeted that he deserves

2184
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:48,000
Prize for that

2185
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:51,584
It didn't say it that's right you said

2186
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:54,656
4

2187
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:55,424
Made up

2188
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:56,704
Nonsensical

2189
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:57,472
And now it's

2190
01:48:57,728 --> 01:48:58,240
Fun

2191
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:00,288
And it's not the president

2192
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:03,104
It would be hilarious if that man was not the

2193
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:08,992
Of trump

2194
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:14,624
Don't go to Syria

2195
01:49:15,136 --> 01:49:16,160
When Trump wasn't

2196
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:16,928
The president

2197
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:18,976
And now he

2198
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:20,512
He's doing all of those things which

2199
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:21,536
It's far less

2200
01:49:22,048 --> 01:49:22,560
For Less

2201
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:24,608
All of these lunatics

2202
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:26,144
The Alex Jones

2203
01:49:26,912 --> 01:49:27,680
Mike cernovich

2204
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:28,704
Savages

2205
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:30,496
All of them

2206
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:32,032
You need to f****** pay

2207
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:32,800
10 to mm

2208
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:34,080
They are

2209
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:35,872
Way too influential

2210
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:41,760
Machines to sort of

2211
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:43,552
Kicking your outrage

2212
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:46,880
Machine that you think is somehow going to stop them

2213
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:48,928
Is not your only helping them

2214
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:50,720
We can

2215
01:49:51,488 --> 01:49:53,024
Not necessarily stop them

2216
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:57,120
But I think that we are like an ant part of the outrage

2217
01:49:57,376 --> 01:50:03,520
No I did not say we're not part of the back-and-forth of

2218
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:06,592
Is the most important day and then everyday we move onto the next

2219
01:50:06,848 --> 01:50:09,408
Because we've been doing this podcast

2220
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:11,968
On the same thing

2221
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:14,784
3 months and antibiotic

2222
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:16,064
Is more than what we are

2223
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:16,832
Is like

2224
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:19,648
We can cut through the b*******

2225
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:22,208
We can give credit where credit's due

2226
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:24,256
But episode

2227
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:27,072
All of it is under the roof

2228
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:28,352
Set this guy

2229
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:30,144
Is a joke in a propaganda

2230
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:32,448
But it doesn't mean

2231
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:34,752
Cut and then

2232
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:40,128
Now we're selling the antibiotic

2233
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:44,992
We also sell biotics

2234
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:49,856
You should go into either one of ours Apartments

2235
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:51,648
I'm not entirely sure

2236
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:56,768
I'm not entirely sure how to give this a summation and give this like a piece of statement here at the end

2237
01:50:57,024 --> 01:50:59,072
If I understand

2238
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:01,120
Active

2239
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:03,680
You haven't tried to make

2240
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:04,960
I think the point

2241
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:05,984
I've got

2242
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:08,544
The wave

2243
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:10,080
Handle

2244
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:12,640
Only provide

2245
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:13,664
Ammunition

2246
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:14,944
They'll be shot back

2247
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:21,856
Magneto

2248
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:23,136
Like that's what it is

2249
01:51:24,672 --> 01:51:26,464
Is just using your own

2250
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:28,000
4 seconds

2251
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:30,304
We are

2252
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:31,840
Using no Force

2253
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:35,936
Where's the drunk monks

2254
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:42,592
Were using that drunken Style

2255
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:44,384
But I really think that if you go back and

2256
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:45,408
Dora episodes

2257
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:46,688
Really busted a lot of

2258
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:47,968
Carneros pretty hard

2259
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:54,880
I'm like

2260
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:57,952
I'm at the end of this episode and the

2261
01:51:58,976 --> 01:52:02,304
The feelings that I have is like I opened this up with saying that I'm

2262
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:03,072
I'm mad

2263
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:04,352
The Media Matters

2264
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:08,192
Damn I'm frustrated I'm super frustrated by

2265
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:12,544
People dealing with something in the completely wrong way

2266
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:15,872
Never did I think that we're dealing with it in the right way we might be

2267
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:17,664
Remind

2268
01:52:18,432 --> 01:52:19,968
We might be just as dumb

2269
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:22,784
I think I was watching with a lot of my problems

2270
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:23,808
By smoking weed

2271
01:52:24,832 --> 01:52:25,856
And that seems like the right way

2272
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,160
To meet my drink wine

2273
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:38,912

2274
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:39,680
So far

2275
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:41,472
I feel like you are saying that

2276
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:45,056
Alex Jones is shooting out these bullets they're shooting them

2277
01:52:45,824 --> 01:52:46,848
And all you're doing is fighting

2278
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:47,616
Fire with fire

2279
01:52:47,872 --> 01:52:49,920
