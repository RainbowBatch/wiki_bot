1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge B

3
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
MoneyGram

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,808
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:02,208
Fight.com

6
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:06,304
Alex Jones

7
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:09,888
What's up

8
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:17,312
Give us to discuss all right

9
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,080
I

10
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,896
I was a fan of the tick

11
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:25,760
Growing up

12
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:31,904
I love it later mouse come on man

13
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,184
Loved it

14
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,072
Not everything about it was just

15
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,240
I have always been a little bit hesitant to give other interpretations of the

16
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,264
The tick a chance

17
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,128
Yeah I tried to watching the the newer one

18
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:58,528
Which one the Patrick Warburton no Peter serafinowicz

19
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,112
Outstanding

20
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:02,880
I have a few

21
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,904
Episodes

22
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,184
Exactly

23
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,232
What I would have wanted

24
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,048
From a live-action version of The Tick

25
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,328
Spectacular

26
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,144
There's so many little subtle things

27
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:18,240
I would never have guessed

28
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,264
The characters

29
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:23,104
Griffin Newman

30
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:27,456
Please think the First episodes are really hinging around him and like

31
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:32,320
Disorder backstory of him as as a superhero

32
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,648
Exactly the way to tell the story that's really good

33
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,184
I am so pumped

34
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,952
I'm

35
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,744
Bump that I think

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,072
Canceled

37
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:48,960
Sucks that there's a limited amount of that but I'm I'm excited to have something to watch

38
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,984
That I really enjoy

39
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,312
Yeah that was that was one of my favorite they like I'll never forget

40
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,080
Deflatermouse

41
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:59,968
Just because I saw the cartoon when I was like 8 or something so young and it was it was like

42
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,760
20 years later that I was like

43
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:05,344
Oh that's a reference to a f****** Opera

44
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,672
What kind of egg rolls are we like

45
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,744
What a great pun

46
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:15,328
What was the mad bomber who bombs at midnight upon

47
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,400
Do you like the mad bomber bombs at midnight

48
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,504
Do the weather's nice out and we only live a couple miles away from each other so I've started walking to to do the show

49
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,904
It's about a 40-minute walk with the perfect length of time to start going back through old albums and actually live

50
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,304
Listen to the full thing oh yeah the ninja Tunes label here recently okay

51
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,888
Lemon Jelly 64 through 95

52
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,704
And the final track on that is called go

53
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,752
And it is so good

54
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,640
Because they use William Shatner's sample there and so it's just

55
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,176
Like they finally do something

56
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,992
I'm good with William Shatner it's been so long

57
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,040
They finally did something

58
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:11,392
Good with William Shatner around 20 years ago

59
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:17,280
Is raw

60
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,327
Really not or not

61
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,887
Books about it but

62
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,447
Yeah yeah

63
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,775
Good

64
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,079
That's as good as I have

65
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:34,175
Hey look we're going to put this on a date we're going to lower the lights a little bit and

66
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,991
You should listen to anime couples

67
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,527
Marty Stuart

68
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,391
Yes sir I'm glad you're enjoying this album

69
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,183
Today we have an album

70
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,463
To discuss

71
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,815
I look at those as album

72
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,375
Okay yeah alright he's prolific

73
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,471
We're going over May 20

74
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,519
21st 2003

75
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,823
No

76
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,359
I'll go back to the past

77
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,663
This is because we have

78
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,199
A little bit of a

79
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,479
Cliffhanger

80
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,551
On the last episode Alex is complaining a whole bunch about the Matrix

81
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:16,927
Are you saying he was going to go see it and you're satisfied

82
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:21,279
To give some sort of closure to this guy was in The Matrix

83
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,559
By this point

84
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,863
We're going to get one of those rare

85
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,911
Gentleman movie reviews

86
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:32,543
We're going to get a gem of a movie review I found

87
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
Get through this

88
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,639
Hello

89
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:40,479
What's out there

90
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:46,111
Lego from

91
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:52,767
I'm a policy wonk wren

92
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,791
What's your name

93
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,351
I'm a policy wonk

94
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,983
First middle-aged mice

95
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,519
Technocrat

96
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,591
And Perry from Norway thinking about you and I would like

97
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,391
Money off that heroin

98
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
So good

99
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,999
Is freakishly large

100
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,559
Midol

101
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:32,959
And unfortunately rest in peace middle-aged apology

102
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,007
Father doubt so to speak is going to be fun

103
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,543
If you will

104
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,871
Giving someone life is giving someone death

105
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
You can say that

106
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:56,767
Ben got in touch with us and dad on the 17th coming up this week

107
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,839
Thursday would be Thursday

108
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,399
Also

109
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,679
It's Matt's

110
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,727
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy birthday

111
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,311
32

112
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,871
Universe and everything

113
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,431
No it's 42

114
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,199
Right

115
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
Isn't it

116
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:19,295
12 in 32 first

117
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,087
Okay

118
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,903
Thought you were f****** with me

119
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
Vets

120
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:25,951
The universe

121
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,231
This is trying to answer

122
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,511
Is what is 6 * 7

123
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559
If anybody got

124
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,887
The question in the answer right at the same time the universe would be destroyed

125
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,191
And be replaced by something even weird

126
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
Okay

127
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:41,311
Happy birthday Alex

128
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:42,847
Kind wishes for

129
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,639
Born

130
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,943
Is the condition that leads to death

131
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,783
You said life is a disease that ends in death

132
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:55,135
Jordan today where Alex

133
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,743
21st this is a rare instance where I decided like

134
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,047
I have not watched

135
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,327
Steve's movies in

136
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,935
Forever I might need to refresh my memory

137
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,727
Actually watched

138
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007
The Matrix Reloaded

139
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,799
Has a

140
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:18,687
It's a sort of refresher course cuz I was like what is he talkin about it comes to movie reviews

141
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,735
Dan's going to look into it

142
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:24,319
And research things and take down your opinion well I was curious

143
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,879
I was curious I remember enjoying

144
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,903
The movie

145
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:33,023
I have a lot of things I'm going to read some of my my notes

146
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,071
Just sort of raw

147
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:42,239
Go over some my thoughts are you doing a live tweeting and I basically did on a notebook

148
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,775
Book page

149
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,967
I enjoyed it

150
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:03,487
I'm sick of these long like explanations of the plot and the history of the movie or the shots Angela

151
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,535
What that means for interpretation now

152
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:11,423
Alright really picked up after the highway scene

153
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,471
The beginning

154
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,775
Ticket but

155
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,687
No everybody wants to watch the dancing scene for at least another 6 minutes use

156
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:29,087
But I don't begrudge that too much it wasn't it wasn't insurmountable in terms of enjoying the movie

157
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,391
Like I said

158
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
So does that

159
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
Alex

160
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,487
Last night I went and saw

161
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:40,607
Shrimp

162
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:51,359
From Illuminati origin

163
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:00,063
It is a deeply Illuminati s***

164
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,599
But when Alex said

165
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,415
I'm going to give you about a 5-minute review Dan just went

166
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:09,791
Shook his head no

167
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,863
All of that was robbed

168
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,703
Alex had seen the

169
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
The first major

170
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,007
First movie

171
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,799
Illuminati s***

172
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,079
I don't know

173
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,151
Yes

174
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,455
Definitely Illuminati s***

175
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,039
You like that the concerns have been put to bed put them to bed

176
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,087
What the concerns to bet

177
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,647
Because the answer is yes which is somehow less

178
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
Concerning

179
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
Well I mean it's a

180
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,231
It's no longer an open question

181
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,023
Now you know that this is just evil

182
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,351
I mean I suppose certainty is a comfort in Subway's ripe

183
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,423
So I guess at this point I would say that

184
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,007
If you're convinced that this movie has Illuminati Origins

185
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,543
Maybe you shouldn't

186
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,335
Do that old redtail thing

187
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,639
Like we shouldn't take that metaphor

188
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,991
So so what you're saying is

189
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,039
Perhaps these stupid thoughts

190
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:07,647
Are b******* that they're feeling in the moment and then later on they'll be like

191
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,951
A truly great movie and let's use the metaphor

192
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,255
Get the sense of that

193
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,071
Shouldn't see this movie

194
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,607
Humans

195
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,911
But if you're going to see it

196
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,935
Eaz whatever

197
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,727
Just don't show it to kid

198
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,567
And

199
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,591
If you want

200
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,175
New World Order

201
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,223
Battery

202
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
Barry

203
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,295
Very dark

204
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,695
About Matrix Reloaded

205
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,791
Culver's

206
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,119
He does go over a little bit of it

207
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,655
I will save it

208
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,423
From

209
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,727
Like I listen to Alex's review first

210
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,543
Got confused and then I watch the movie like

211
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,151
What is Allah he doesn't cover

212
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,247
You. Have a very good sense of the movie

213
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,039
It's a big movie

214
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
Me too much in it

215
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,831
But

216
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
He starts off

217
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,183
His conversation about the Matrix

218
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,975
Expire talking about the first movie

219
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,535
Don't know if I agree with his

220
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,727
Overall

221
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
No problem

222
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:44,927
I take issue with that mean like maybe there is some new aging is to it certainly

223
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:50,303
Believe in yourself and you can change the parameters of reality

224
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:56,703
That's most everybody in that movie who also believed in themselves right next to Mio

225
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,495
We murdered within the first 45 minutes

226
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,079
Yeah Neo didn't have the ability to change things

227
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:07,967
Because he believed in himself because he was created in Born inside the Matrix

228
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,599
You're trying to say that we're all the chosen one

229
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:19,487
But that's not what them if you're going to bring that to the film that's on you

230
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:23,839
Coming in for fucksake sand one movie later after this one

231
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:29,727
Neo is literally in a christ-like position to show you this making the sacrifice

232
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,775
Spoilers

233
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,079
To get to that

234
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,807
I can't wait

235
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,623
Yeah I think his interpretation of

236
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,671
The first movie is a little bit slot

237
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,231
Based on everything about the

238
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,767
Yes the End of Watch

239
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,327
But he know he watched this this

240
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,607
The first film

241
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,399
Like I said he was confused

242
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,727
This Illuminati

243
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:05,055
Because you don't know if it's Illuminati or not

244
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,967
Maybe the wachowskis are putting out some things that is heroic sure anti-illuminati

245
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
Or maybe

246
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,015
What's illuminati

247
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,975
New age

248
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,559
But overall

249
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,863
Not sure if

250
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
What

251
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,623
So I was pretty excited to hear about like

252
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,671
Why

253
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
Pure C

254
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,231
What seal the deal

255
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,535
What was it about this film that was like

256
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,119
God not dead to rights this is physical ability need to know

257
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:07,519
Did you just watch the credits in the executive producers were the Illuminati

258
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:13,151
I was not prepared for

259
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,455
How this review would get going

260
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:19,807
Okay I was like okay he's going to misinterpret something or

261
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,343
I couldn't have

262
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:25,183
Possibly imagine that this was the start of it

263
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,463
Outrageous

264
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,399
And there is a

265
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,199
Behind

266
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,527
With

267
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,671
Talking about

268
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:04,607
Alex is mad about a Powerade commercial

269
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,655
It I was I was I was out

270
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,935
When he said

271
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,239
Before we even get to the movie we got to deal with the

272
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,519
The trailers

273
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:17,919
No no no I don't even know why would the Illuminati trailer this isn't even 2 trailer

274
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:25,343
I thought he was misinterpreting a commercial for Men in Black 2 or something like Rip Torn

275
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,111
Hi Dad.

276
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,695
It's not it's not we'll get into it but he's really mad about

277
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,959
Power

278
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,007
Great your

279
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031
Power

280
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,871
Do as you are ordered

281
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,271
It's not it's a commercial

282
00:16:54,783 --> 00:17:00,927
If you watch it like now if you

283
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,375
So this wasn't an authority figure in the commercial it was one of the agent

284
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
From the movie

285
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,447
Subliminal flickering lights

286
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:17,567
The commercial was just setting the interrogate interrogation room where they took Neo in the first movie

287
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:22,431
Tell me the stuff that Alex is saying is from the commercial but some is also his own embellishment but

288
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,063
Obviously just a way to like sell Powerade using the character from the movie

289
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,903
I spent a lot of time thinking about it and honestly this is the only way you could

290
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,695
Could do a commercial like this with a

291
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,463
Italian

292
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,231
To The Matrix

293
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,535
But if you use any of the main characters

294
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,303
It's going to really

295
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,863
Team goofy ass s*** all.

296
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,887
The engine would be great

297
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,935
They're perfect for this because

298
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,751
They don't have a personality except for agent Smith

299
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,799
Essentially this blank slate

300
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:52,895
One of them selling Powerade doesn't negatively affect your impression of the agents because

301
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
The cat

302
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,199
They aren't individual right

303
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,759
That said

304
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,063
I wouldn't watch this commercial

305
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,111
Canon problem with a commercial

306
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:08,255
Play a little clip hear from that commercial and then we'll discuss the other issue

307
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:14,655
Consider this

308
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:21,055
Somebody heat pure precious life giving me energy

309
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:27,455
Fortunate you are collective puny little Minds couldn't figure out a way to harness this energy put it to good use

310
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:33,855
Somehow but that's beside the point

311
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:40,255
Energy your body needs to be replenished so

312
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,047
Powerade

313
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:48,447
Quotas to meet that's obviously supposed to be like deadpan comedy the problem is that this agent

314
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,751
Trying to sell Powerade to people who are inside the maitre

315
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:57,663
Activities inside the Matrix shouldn't affect the amount of energy that gets produced by the person's physical body outside of the paper

316
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,967
People's actual bodies are in

317
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,015
Pots they have no need for power

318
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:06,623
There's some stuff going into a to believe that they are suspended in

319
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:13,023
Google of some sort them out. Couldn't rube if so

320
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,327
This commercials underselling

321
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,447
Given what we know about the machines in the movies

322
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,727
Is physical activity

323
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,567
Booty in the Matrix translated to greater energy production in the real world

324
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:30,431
Then everyone in the Matrix would be suspiciously into exercising

325
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:36,831
Billion batteries any could boost the productivity by 30% of their avatar The Matrix works out

326
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,159
That's an amount of energy production that would not be ignored by

327
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:46,047
Generally they are well known for

328
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:52,959
How do you think is on the table but it's like the idea that there's somebody somewhere

329
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
Man

330
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,775
Nobody is using these gym membership

331
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,103
This is unreal

332
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,127
Anyway

333
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,431
Bottom line here is that

334
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,711
Commercial just got a dub

335
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,503
It's got to be so fun

336
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,551
Powerade commercial the play before the movie

337
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:11,391
Top part of the film and it's not meant to shame people for being dumb

338
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,719
Diversion of ergot

339
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,511
It's like sorry guys

340
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:21,119
Nobody's working out so you can't turn your AC on this this week

341
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:27,263
Yeah I like I like those that Alex is sitting there in the theater watching this Powerade commercial and he's like

342
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,847
I am personally insulted by this character

343
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:37,503
I have been shamed by this power

344
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,111
Wow you just can't

345
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,415
Find a single moment not

346
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,439
To be mad about

347
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:51,839
Yeah mad about a Powerade commercial what what why even bother with the movie you're already done yeah what's it like

348
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,983
How do you take in any media

349
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,799
If you're shamed by a Powerade

350
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,847
So the actual movie start

351
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,151
Here's where Alex is at

352
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,271
Man launches in to

353
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:13,343
World of the Matrix that is the real

354
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,647
Call Laurel

355
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,720
The underground

356
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,560
Zarion

357
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
Get it

358
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
And

359
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,632
You

360
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,312
The

361
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:41,248
Haha

362
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,320
Okay

363
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,672
World or the maker

364
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,768
Both of these are

365
00:21:55,328 --> 00:22:00,192
If there's one thing that I took away from the message of the Matrix movies be even before I went re-watched it

366
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
It's kind of the Opera

367
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:06,848
Opposite of perception

368
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,640
Funny movie is it something's that

369
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,944
Feel like reality might not be

370
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,248
But there is a definite reality

371
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,528
Which is worth fighting for

372
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:20,928
If perception was truly reality that I wouldn't matter if Neo ever perceived The Matrix to be the actual world or Andalusia

373
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,000
If you accept the Matrix has reality than it would at

374
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:24,768
Actually be that

375
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,328
The movies do actually deal with this quiet

376
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,096
Eloquently

377
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,912
Perception can shape reality to an extent

378
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:37,568
Like if you're in the Matrix and you want that to be a reality it's possible to live your entire life in that state and not run into any

379
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,104
Joey pants

380
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:46,016
His character in Cars movie he wants to be reinserted into the Matrix and not be aware of the fight against the robots because it's more come

381
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:46,784
Walkable to him

382
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,344
And it's implied but that's something that can be done

383
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,624
He's subjective

384
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,648
Experience and perception

385
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,952
You can create is subjective reality

386
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,000
But that isn't real

387
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,560
The movie is very clear there's an entirely different

388
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,840
Actual realities exist

389
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,400
Regardless of your subjective beliefs about reality

390
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,472
Nothing you do in The Matrix effects that fact

391
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,264
As the what is reality

392
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,664
Robots have turned humans into batteries

393
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,016
Doesn't show you the desert of the real real

394
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:22,368
Not the desert of the we perceive this to be dark

395
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:29,024
Really interesting to me that this is this is where Alex is that because he's getting caught up in a pretty Elementary philosophical question

396
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:32,096
Perception and reality that movie actually

397
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,632
Cuz One Step Beyond

398
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,960
In terms of the even just the starting point is path

399
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,288
That's what we're really dealing with here

400
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,360
It's like when you're when you're watching

401
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,896
Explaining the movie to my grandma

402
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,432
Do you know of just like

403
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:52,576
Things that aren't really part of the movie but she's going to like it a lot more than if you tell her like there's a car chase

404
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:00,000
So Trinity jumps on a motorcycle Alpha

405
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:00,768
Okay

406
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,048
Wearing black spandex Italy

407
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,328
Looks great

408
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,376
Zion takes issue with

409
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,936
Like weird things

410
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,264
Specifically about like naming conventions

411
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,824
But when I went back and I watched

412
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,616
Take issue with everything

413
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:20,480
Everything has a f****** name that means of the reference to every

414
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:24,064
Another one

415
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,792
Overtone

416
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,352
With

417
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,120
Leader

418
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,824
Absolutely not

419
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,664
Call the Merovingian

420
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,136
Illuminati

421
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,184
With the Merovingian

422
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,208
He's not a good guy

423
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,232
Nope

424
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,048
We are we all recognize that he

425
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:10,144
That's why he's got Batman yeah

426
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,544
High-end villain he's accusing tagonist of this planet

427
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,640
Side quest

428
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,944
Yeah I guess it's

429
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,248
Zion and we are vengeance

430
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,040
You take some picture with those portable like

431
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,064
Nebuchadnezzar

432
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,088
Is the name of their ship

433
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,624
Yeah yeah

434
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,672
Trinity

435
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,952
No don't worry about it

436
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:34,976
No

437
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:38,816
Morpheus absolutely no reference there then

438
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:41,120
It's it's interesting The Selective

439
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,728
Was outraged or selective like pointing this out as well

440
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,008
Mean something without

441
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,312
Without incorporating all of the things

442
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,872
It just fits

443
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,920
Pikachu I mean

444
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,480
If you name something Zion in a

445
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,784
Piece of popular culture someone's going to be

446
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,648
Scooby Alex in 2003

447
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:07,488
Yes that's going to happen but if you're mad about that you can't

448
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:12,864
You can't let that get in the way of being mad about all the other religious references in the movie no

449
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,424
That's the problem here he needs to be a more holistic

450
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,448
Decatur

451
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,472
The movie

452
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,008
It's evil

453
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,312
I mean really the bottom line

454
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,232
Oh my God

455
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,536
F****** Illuminati or back at it

456
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,304
Why is it

457
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,424
The first thing that you bring the fact that it's mind-twisting at evil

458
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,960
Urges

459
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,264
Very weird to me

460
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,544
Very strange

461
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,848
Even for Alex that's weird

462
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,872
Yeah

463
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,920
There's homosexual and lesbians

464
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:04,320
Seeing yeah yeah 2003 was was different though he like

465
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,136
For gay people were even allowed to

466
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:13,536
Mary so I think there was a lot more open and vicious

467
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:16,608
I mean now there's so much open and vicious hatred

468
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,656
The world sucks

469
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,448
Yep

470
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:24,032
So this is all just trying to make

471
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:24,800
Implants

472
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,568
Fashionable

473
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,104
Body Mod

474
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,384
Yeah yeah

475
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,200
It's in the back your head living in the future now

476
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:34,272
That's been bored out we all have jacks

477
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,296
In the back of her head

478
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,432
The video games

479
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:11,904
There was

480
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,264
All over your body

481
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,800
Like Okay so

482
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,336
Matrix was popular

483
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,664
Alex is trying to make this argument

484
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,736
To condition you to get jacks on the back of your head to plug into

485
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,272
The computers or something sure

486
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,296
But like

487
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:44,160
If your argument is just that that's popular and there's like spin-off properties like

488
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,952
What are the Ninja Turtles

489
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,720
Oh yeah

490
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,744
They were

491
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,512
Huge

492
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,304
What about that

493
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,352
What were the what were the globalists

494
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,888
String to Main Line

495
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,704
That really trying to turn us all into people who will

496
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:03,104
Going to Google that I had and this I remember specifically I had a Raffaele

497
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,688
Action figure and what you do is you would push Rafael's

498
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,456
Head down

499
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,736
And it would

500
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,272
Attached to a spring and then you

501
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,320
And the head

502
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:17,440
Like he was head-butting you up right that I learned that the Illuminati want me to head butt

503
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,208
The s*** out of

504
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,768
Wait a second

505
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,792
Raphael

506
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:28,192
Was a Ninja Turtle true what weapon does neo grab when he's fighting the mirror vinje in the goons in

507
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:28,960
That staircase

508
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:33,056
Was it was it size

509
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:39,712
Oh wow Neo is Rafael this is blowing the whole thing wide open for me

510
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:44,576
Ninja Turtles were preparing us for the Matrix comparing us to take

511
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,624
Jackson baccalaureate

512
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,512
What's another point of pride in the movie though how many people were born naturally who didn't have

513
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,304
The Jackson were like

514
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,400
I'm pretty sure that that was I believe so

515
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:05,056
I'm also the scene that I was just talking about like with the machines are good or whatever it's just that scene or the

516
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,872
Who takes Neo down to the engineering level

517
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:10,688
Zion and he's like well

518
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,712
You know

519
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:12,992
Cheat suck

520
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,016
But also

521
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:14,784
We got to use it

522
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:21,184
Yeah we wouldn't be able to breathe without here so it's like a win some lose some situations

523
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,000
Is a little heavy-handed

524
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,792
The dialogue play

525
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,352
Whatever I guess if I would want to take that

526
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,120
As

527
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:35,008
Oh that's right whatever the old guy pulls them standing on the ledge with all the

528
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:39,616
It's behind them and no one can see them or whatever the middle-of-the-night Via wakes up

529
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,176
Thing I loved about that scene is like this

530
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:45,248
F****** apartment complex if you want to call it that easy

531
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,784
Gigantic

532
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:53,184
That counselor or whatever had to been waiting forever on the off-chance that need

533
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,768
So you could walk up and be like

534
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,560
Do you need some cocaine do you want to hang out

535
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,096
I would love to

536
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,376
That's either we just behave like

537
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:06,240
He doesn't even have like a cellphone to like play a game

538
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,800
B16a twiddling his thumbs

539
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,968
You got the new futuristic version of Angry Birds and he's just throwing plushies off of off the

540
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,784
Should I hope Neal has a bad dream and wakes up

541
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,744
How to make this look like I'm randomly pass

542
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:30,816
He's hiding around

543
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,632
The corner.

544
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,400
So

545
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:38,752
You know the big set-piece at the end of the movie is Neo meet

546
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,776
What's with the architect

547
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,568
Who created all of

548
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,104
The previous matrix's

549
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,688
Write to Neo that he is a

550
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,480
Aberration

551
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,272
Yeah bakerix

552
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:56,672
He's supposed to go to the source and that everything will reboot reset all over again it was built into the code etcetera

553
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,976
Etcetera little bit

554
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,072
Employed

555
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,608
Obi-Wan Kenobi

556
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,888
No

557
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,704
Te bote

558
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,792
There

559
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,632
That's correct

560
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,240
Surprised he understood

561
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,392
But with an allergy

562
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,656
God

563
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:14,496
That clip was fascinating to me because he's kind of getting it

564
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,056
But he also doesn't seem to understand that it's a

565
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:17,824
Piece of fiction

566
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,152
No he doesn't get that the characters

567
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:24,736
In The Matrix that like Neo runs into are supposed to be Pro

568
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,040
He doesn't get like the ID

569
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,672
No no

570
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:36,256
Explicitly say things that are like oh that's what you are

571
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:42,400
You're all like a guy who fights Neo before he goes to talk to the oracle

572
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,168
Is like

573
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,752
He's basically like a password screen

574
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:52,128
Totally whatever they go through all those doors like it's the back door in a program I think talk about this

575
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,664
Pretty explicit

576
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,248
Constantly you're like wait

577
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:03,648
When is he going to fight Microsoft Word Greek god

578
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:08,512
Going to show up

579
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,560
Would you like some help with that

580
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:17,216
God yeah I don't understand I don't understand how you can like it half of it I guess and not

581
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,752
The the the bigger picture

582
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,800
Yeah the Oracle herself

583
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:27,200
Itself is a program and not a person or an actual Oracle at Delphi

584
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,296
So I have now my note

585
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,088
Probably charge reload

586
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:36,672
You remember the movie right that your handwriting

587
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,952
Is much larger than mine

588
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,000
That was just sort of looks like a

589
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:43,072
Scribble

590
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,376
Haphazardly take note

591
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:49,472
To hear I'm just going to read the notes as they appear on the page

592
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:53,312
Michael from Lost! True

593
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,616
I forgot that Michael for lost

594
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:05,600
Really great I love that guy. He's really good and roll 2

595
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,136
I don't want him to get hurt

596
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:13,536
This is just a little note what are the fun things about the Matrix is how important NADA Neo characters are

597
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:17,888
What route you know what is it is like he's the chosen one and all this

598
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:21,984
None of it would be possible like what he's doing if it weren't for other things

599
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,800
Like Morpheus is doing

600
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,104
Is doing like everyone else has like

601
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,152
Parts that they need to play

602
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,432
In order for

603
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,968
Him to be able to live up

604
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:38,368
To his one that totally whatever

605
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:44,512
What characters are from a diverse set of backgrounds with a bunch of different possibilities within my next note

606
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,328
Willie Jones jr.

607
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:52,960
Videos of the night also forgot the Rogers juniors in that onesie

608
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:57,312
Oh man one of the one of the great albums one of the greatest rap album

609
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,104
Around 1 the album

610
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,640
Roy Jones jr.

611
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,944
Weird who won the kid knocked out

612
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,760
Who won the fight Roy Jones who won

613
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,832
Oh yes

614
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,856
Weird yep

615
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,624
Okay

616
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,672
There's that scene

617
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,464
The stupid note

618
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,744
There's a skeeter

619
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:22,400
Agent Smith turns another person into an agent Smith actor

620
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,424
2 kiss

621
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,192
Totally

622
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,288
Felt like they were going to

623
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,568
Alright

624
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,176
What would you do if you met you Dad

625
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,736
I probably would have died.

626
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,808
XO probably try and beat myself up

627
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,392
So I thought that it was a little bit tacky that the Beast

628
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,416
Between Morpheus in

629
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,720
The commander was about niobe was about a woman

630
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:53,120
Easy especially when we're dealing with

631
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:59,008
The good character choice because despite the fact that we're dealing with such an end-of-the-world level threat

632
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:03,616
People are still going to have those dumb little personal

633
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:07,712
You know I'm saying I get that it's a little bit convenient little simple

634
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,784
I f****** love Harry lennix

635
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:15,392
22 plays the commander he is great he is really really good

636
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,208
Man f****** hard-ass for

637
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,768
No reason half the time but also

638
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,048
This is my next.

639
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,096
He's not wrong to doubt Morpheus

640
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:27,936
Out-of-pocket

641
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:32,544
He's ignoring the chain-of-command understand

642
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,568
Yeah

643
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:36,896
The other the other thing too that I was thinking about is like

644
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,176
You know you

645
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,712
You forget

646
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:43,296
I guess if you haven't seen these movies in awhile you kind of forget that everybody

647
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,344
She hates Neo

648
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,624
Morpheus basically

649
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,416
They're not the heroes

650
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,208
Was to the powers that

651
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,816
In the human world of Zion like they are not

652
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:55,840
Like

653
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,608
They are out

654
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,888
But you said they're out of pocket

655
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,912
Totally

656
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,192
You forget that

657
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,728
It's there their they're

658
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:04,544
Basically populist leaders Alex should love it

659
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,176
Yeah to a certain to a certain interpretation to you can view that as like

660
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,224
It is a positive thing bed

661
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,760
These people will

662
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:17,600
Just completely ignore orders and completely ignore the

663
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:22,464
The current power structure in order to fight what they believe is is true and correct

664
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,512
But also what if they were wrong

665
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:26,816
They just killed all of humanity

666
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,840
So there's that

667
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,120
Yeah you know

668
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:32,448
Next note I love Hakeem died on sex

669
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,752
I do love a cave

670
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,800
I just didn't

671
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,336
Care for the aesthetic of

672
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:44,736
Tell you about the cave we when I watch that movie with my best friend and his dad

673
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,040
I can't remember how old we were at the

674
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,832
The time but it wasn't like

675
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,368
Cool for us to go

676
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,392
Because

677
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,672
My parents heard

678
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,952
That there was a tit

679
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:59,584
In the dancing my friend

680
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:05,984
Oh I didn't you have spotted it unless somebody told you way in advance as if there's a lot of people on earth

681
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,312
That was enough for my family to be like

682
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,592
There might be at it

683
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:15,200
Not being able to see that leads me to my next note is that is this cave is way too big

684
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:21,088
There are their moment app.

685
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,136
Tribal beats and The Rave

686
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,672
Tubac the acoustics

687
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:29,280
We're great in that cave big

688
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:32,096
Next note Fishburne

689
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:35,168
Not good I don't think he was carrying his wife

690
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:41,568
First movie he did so much he was allowed

691
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,592
Just kind of be in the back

692
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,664
You know I was just not

693
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,944
That I was not that into him

694
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:50,016
Is Neo a virgin

695
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:55,904
Look when he and Trinity or hook it was sure his first time I mean in the real world that has

696
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,696
I would think so

697
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,464
That's interesting

698
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,000
What's not very

699
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,792
But a little bit interested

700
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:07,168
What kind of what kind of Dick Powell's could you have if you've only done it in the imaginary world

701
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,960
I don't know I mean maybe

702
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:12,800
Hey if you coming in The Matrix you coming real life is that true

703
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,360
I think so if you die in The Matrix then yeah

704
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,408
Everybody Google is gross

705
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,200
Next

706
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:22,016
Keanu is not enough of a blank slate

707
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,064
Like when you were sitting there talking

708
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,112
To the the oracle

709
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,160
He's supposed to be

710
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,184
Like a black fly

711
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,208
That's

712
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,232
Kind of

713
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,000
Do you have

714
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:35,840
You is too much agency before the role that he's in

715
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,120
I think I'm okay

716
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,400
All right I might be wrong

717
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:44,288
But I would need to watch the movie again and then we could really get into it

718
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,080
I got a little bit bored

719
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:48,640
There's cuz it dry a little bit

720
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,688
This note is

721
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,712
This movie is

722
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:58,112
Just a video game everything is affect request constantly over and over again

723
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,904
Yeah yeah you have to

724
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,184
To go get

725
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,512
Key-maker the key-maker takes you to a door

726
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,560
You know it's over going over again like

727
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:11,168
You have to go to a and then once you get there also know you got to go to be

728
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,984
It's getting a little bit clunky but

729
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,008
Like I said

730
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,032
Get to the

731
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,056
Like

732
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,080
Highway chase

733
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:18,848
Gcn

734
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,384
Things pick up bismuth

735
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,968
This business picks up a little bit of like

736
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,760
They're just going around doing a

737
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:30,368
Statquest a little bit more

738
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,136
It was

739
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,160
A drag

740
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:36,512
Later on borderline a heist film in that way of like

741
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,304
A problem arises we have to

742
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,096
To go somewhere and get the

743
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:43,168
Like a like Ocean's 11 we got to go get the

744
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:48,288
EMP from some other place cuz I was broke or whatever it is

745
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,056
Like that kind of thing

746
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,872
Hugo weaving is a monster

747
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,687
He's killing it

748
00:41:54,943 --> 00:42:01,087
He's good he is good good act and he's good at

749
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:06,719
And I have a different interpretation of the elrond but that's fine

750
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,255
Crushing

751
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,791
Also I didn't

752
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:12,607
Really have as much of a memory

753
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,679
Of who the bad guy is

754
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:18,495
Like obviously in the first movie the bad guy is

755
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,263
The Matrix

756
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,031
It's

757
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:24,639
I kind of thought that was true in the second movie to and then agent Smith

758
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,919
Becomes the villain in the third

759
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:29,503
I didn't realize that it was really clear

760
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,271
Early

761
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:33,343
In the second movie

762
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:38,207
The machines are no longer really like their independence

763
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:38,975
Maybe

764
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,999
Hassle

765
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,303
I have clearly agents

766
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,839
It's a virus

767
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,607
Yeah

768
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:46,911
Also

769
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,959
This is this is just a little bit of a nip pic thing

770
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,007
Neo stops bullets

771
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,079
You know why is he ever punched

772
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:55,871
Sometimes

773
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,663
He has telekinesis

774
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:00,735
I don't understand why nobody threw up

775
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:07,135
Bottle of Powerade at him that he can also start with Drake

776
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:10,719
Well he's stopping power 80 could scold Alex's

777
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,255
It will give you power

778
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:15,327
I hope to see Gan fight scenes look amazing

779
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,887
Being made in 2003

780
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,423
They hold up

781
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:23,775
I'd sometimes like a little bit of it's a little bit cartoon you can tell its digital but like

782
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,055
Considering that this is

783
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,359
18 years old

784
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:32,479
There was a point in the agent Smith fight where you so clearly see it Go from

785
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,527
People trying to actually

786
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:37,855
Do choreography to

787
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,879
I like

788
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:44,767
Complete CGI stuff for you like okay well this might be a little bit on The Uncanny Valley but

789
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,047
But it's not like

790
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:50,399
It wasn't so much that it took me out of the experience of watching

791
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:56,543
Expense digital or whatever but it's not distracting

792
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,615
Everyone is right

793
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:05,247
All of the humans are right

794
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:07,551
Reality is complicated

795
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:12,159
Everwood disagrees everyone is right

796
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,511
I thought that was a little bit weird

797
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,815
I do I like that

798
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:23,167
I like that a lot I like that everybody's right but everybody is also

799
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:29,311
Disagreeing about maybe they have a cross-purposes kind of being elected Maybe

800
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,103
Do you have the same goal

801
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,639
And the way that you think

802
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,431
We're going to get to that goal is

803
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,199
Correct

804
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:38,527
Right but it might be sort of contradictory

805
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,551
Next note

806
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,927
Two exclamation points on this one correction

807
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:47,743
3

808
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:50,559
Cornel West

809
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:56,959
I forgot Cornell what does forgot that he plays one of the members of the Tribunal

810
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:01,055
Get the f*** out of here

811
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:01,823
Speaker.

812
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,175
It is

813
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:12,831
Although probably the first time I saw it I had no idea who Cornel West was why would I go why would I be a

814
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:15,903
12 year old that's like a huge Cornell whiskey

815
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:22,303
It's possible that you just had no idea but it's it's outrageous he's one of the people who's on the board or whatever

816
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:28,703
Whatever they're talking about sending two more captains to help out with an epic another

817
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:33,311
And then there's the old lady and then it's Cornel West

818
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:37,663
There's a couple other people but yeah those are the three that I have speaking roles

819
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:40,735
So this is from the Merovingian seen him cry

820
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:45,087
I forgot that that woman orgasm from eating the cake that he sent her

821
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:45,855
That's true

822
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,415
Becky

823
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,207
That was really weird

824
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,487
Because

825
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:55,071
Is because the only thing that you can think of while that's going on

826
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,119
Is somebody right next to her going

827
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,167
I'll have with cheese have

828
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,703
Nothing like that's literally WhatsApp

829
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,263
The Matrix

830
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,823
Code goes in between her legs and then there's an

831
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,103
Explosion has like this

832
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,127
I would have

833
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,663
I would have taken another path

834
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:14,783
Totally not in line with the rest

835
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,415
Genitals give you an orgasm

836
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,231
Bright

837
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:24,255
Okay alright

838
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,375
Monica Bellucci

839
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,167
Thought this was really funny

840
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:34,239
This computer program really wants to get kid

841
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:39,103
I don't know why I'm like that

842
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:42,431
I thought I was watching them go in and out of doors

843
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,991
It made me think of The Adjustment Bureau

844
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:47,551
I have nothing else to add to that I just thought of you

845
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:48,575
Bureau

846
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,879
They were the hats

847
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,695
I'd like to the twins

848
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,999
I'd like to the twins

849
00:46:56,511 --> 00:47:02,655
The dreadlocks albino twins this is aggressive I don't know why you're pointing at me because I remember not liking them the first

850
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:06,495
First time I saw the movie has a little bit

851
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,263
Or whatever

852
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,823
Their powers are really well.

853
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:10,591
Defined

854
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,871
And well done in the movie

855
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:15,455
They can choose when to have physical form accentuate

856
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:17,759
So they can be in danger

857
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:20,063
From a knife or a gun or whatever

858
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,927
Breakaway is they go in and out of cars

859
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:29,535
If you're the only thing I didn't like is that like they apparently dian-anic

860
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,303
Explosion

861
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:34,143
They could have just gone off Memorial

862
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:35,935
Also

863
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,215
Miosha just a toilet

864
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:39,775
Trinity that you saw her death

865
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:41,311
If not Matrix

866
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,103
Really cut down on time

867
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,919
It certainly would have been more

868
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
I don't know if

869
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,527
They have what's presented as a good relation

870
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,343
They seem to really care about each other

871
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,391
It does not make sense that he wouldn't

872
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:57,439
Trust her with that kind of information

873
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,231
Bear in a post

874
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:01,535
Apocalypto

875
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,815
Hellscape world

876
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:05,631
Let's be on the level with each other

877
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,399
Yeah

878
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:11,007
Honesty is the best policy whenever everything is collapsing

879
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,311
Three exclamation points again

880
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,151
Suburbia clear Stakes

881
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:25,855
Everything is very clearly like a flashback to the Joey pants situation

882
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,415
Wait are there more sticky

883
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:31,487
I think that the stakes were a lot clearer than

884
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,023
I expected them to be

885
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,559
A lot of sense

886
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,351
Amanda the last thing

887
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,399
It was

888
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,423
From the architect

889
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:44,287
He says that you can go to the source

890
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:48,383
And then you choose people to repopulate Scion like we've done the last five times

891
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,151
Sure

892
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,199
Who was the last one

893
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:53,759
Who did that and create a desire

894
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,039
Who was the

895
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,087
I don't know

896
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:03,743
I know oh okay you're you're telling me I mean was it the exact same meal was and it can't be the same Bo

897
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:08,863
Because later on we find out who made a different choice is it the same deal who's learned from his previous

898
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:11,167
I don't know but it's a pattern code

899
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,191
It's it's

900
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:14,751
Whoever the last

901
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,287
I'11

902
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,847
Is not a good Cara

903
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:21,151
Yeah I mean that's

904
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,943
That is that kind of like

905
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,735
Really dangerous choice

906
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,039
Theoretically

907
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,319
He could

908
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:30,879
Just wind up wiping out the human race entirely

909
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,927
If that new and I don't know why were

910
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,719
Using a gender

911
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:37,279
Pronoun for this could be anybody

912
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,047
But

913
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:38,815
Spay

914
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:42,399
He's bit of the person is faced with the choice of like

915
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:47,775
Is everybody going to die or am I going to reboot this perhaps infinitely but

916
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,823
If I reboot it at least we got another go

917
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,103
Ralph so

918
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:54,687
There's that moral quandary there

919
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:57,503
I hated the architect because

920
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,039
Freudian

921
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:02,879
No Obi-Wan Kenobi

922
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:08,511
No yeah I mean you can't replace big words for actually

923
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,279
Making sense

924
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,863
So there's a lot of that where I'm like

925
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:17,983
You're just using that word because you know people are going to look up the definition

926
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,287
Enough sense

927
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,823
They're like

928
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,359
Did it serve

929
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:29,759
Actually you get it but from a fine granular kind of

930
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:32,319
Septum Crossing out $5 words left and right

931
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:38,719
Yeah yeah that might be a good note but also I did enjoy how like you know that obviously the movie is building towards like

932
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,487
The climax

933
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:45,887
Like somebody is going to maybe be like action-oriented

934
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:46,655
That is fun

935
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,471
There's some subversion

936
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,239
Inappropriate

937
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:53,311
Anyway my review overall not bad

938
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:58,175
No I don't like movies that much but I enjoyed at least

939
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,199
Half of it

940
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:01,503
Like I think it was really slow start

941
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,551
Yeah like when they're in Zion

942
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:04,319
And

943
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,087
All that

944
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,879
It's it was tough.

945
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:09,183
Yeah I was like I'm going to turn this off

946
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,975
Like 15 minutes and I was like

947
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,767
I can't sit here and watch this

948
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:15,583
Push through and I enjoyed it once it got cooking

949
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,631
Yeah I recall there being a lot of

950
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,423
Vitriol towards Reloaded

951
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,983
And and then even more towards

952
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,519
Revolution

953
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:29,919
I think that also might be because we were coming off the back of

954
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:33,503
The Phantom Menace and attack of the Clones at the same time so everybody

955
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:34,783
Furious at every

956
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,063
And I think

957
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,087
What is the first Matrix

958
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:37,855
Almost

959
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,903
And impossible challenge

960
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,671
To follow up

961
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,439
Talk like

962
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,975
I think that was that was something

963
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:45,023
Caught on so huge

964
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:45,791
And

965
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:46,815
Blue Mind

966
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,375
Like I don't even know what you would

967
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:50,911
Do if you like

968
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:53,471
We're trying to make another one

969
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:57,311
Especially with a massive budget

970
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:00,383
That you're expected to show in the film

971
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:03,199
You know like the original Matrix was so well

972
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:05,247
Written and so tight

973
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,039
Because of those

974
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,319
You know

975
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,855
Challenges

976
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:10,623
Actually not of course

977
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,391
It's because of them

978
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,927
Yeah but that

979
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:17,023
That kind of we got to figure out a way to do this that's cheap is

980
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,815
A lot of times they really

981
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,863
Interesting and

982
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,399
Fanta created

983
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:26,751
Necessity is the mother of invention

984
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,799
William the architect

985
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:34,687
So Alex gets to talking about how like in 25 years

986
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:43,135
That's true Machines man

987
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:50,559
What are warning you of the Takeover

988
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,207
Global

989
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:20,255
Government control

990
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:22,047
See that's kind of fun

991
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,071
Because Alex

992
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,863
Could take that clip

993
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:25,887
Look at Facebook

994
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:29,215
I was right

995
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:32,543
He's talking about the Matrix and talking about that being with you

996
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:37,407
In your in your house that you're plugged into or whatever like

997
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:39,455
It's not it's not a metaphorical

998
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:42,015
Oh my God social media is going to take off

999
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:44,063
No and there were people already at the

1000
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,087
The time going like

1001
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:49,951
Social media might not be a good idea to have it take off and they were people who had studied

1002
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:50,719
Real life

1003
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,743
Technology

1004
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:54,303
In real life Trend swords that they weren't like

1005
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:58,399
It's going to be exactly like the Matrix dog eyes

1006
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,423
The movies evil

1007
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:04,799
That's all this is there like this whole movie Everything Is

1008
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,079
Preparing you

1009
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,359
Jordan

1010
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:09,151
Go into the Matrix

1011
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,711
Pairing you

1012
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:14,527
Your journey into the real Matrix

1013
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,439
The elite

1014
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,791
And you were going to be

1015
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,623
Word

1016
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:55,487
Wired article in case you did not listen to our last episode was about a research

1017
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:58,047
Proposal the DARPA had for Bergen called life log

1018
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,327
I was didn't end up having

1019
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,095
We're not in

1020
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,119
We're not

1021
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:07,263
Or are we no exhaust

1022
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:10,591
I feel exhausted by those sorts of question

1023
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:13,663
Hungry like 1 maybe we are what is real

1024
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:16,223
Fun Alex fine

1025
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:16,991
The painful

1026
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:18,783
To watch movie

1027
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:19,807
Like the mate

1028
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:20,831
Who's painful

1029
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:21,855
But

1030
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,415
Supervisor coffee

1031
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,423
Larry

1032
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:42,591
Pairing

1033
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:50,783
My money buddy

1034
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:54,111
I just

1035
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:58,463
I am just blown away by that statement out of a human

1036
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,231
After what he's

1037
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:03,071
Yeah I mean like these things are the Illuminati yelled at in 42 hours

1038
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,863
And part of that was a Powerade commercial

1039
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:11,263
What's the Powerade commercial on the original DVD or do you have to get the director's cut

1040
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:16,639
Theaters invited on YouTube by Tommy

1041
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,407
Gripping

1042
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,199
Appositive

1043
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:22,783
The review word right

1044
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,551
Remind

1045
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:26,111
Control mean it's hard to keep people entertained

1046
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,903
For 2 hours

1047
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:30,207
There were

1048
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,839
Who's there really good then

1049
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:43,263
When you're conscious

1050
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:02,207
Curiosity killed the cat

1051
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:09,631
It was about but I'm going to buy a boat

1052
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:11,935
Experience

1053
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,471
I don't know if you

1054
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:15,263
Could do a better commercial

1055
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:18,591
For the Matrix movie to Alex's audience than

1056
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:20,639
Yeah like that is catnip

1057
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:24,223
To the theater to like

1058
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,247
Like

1059
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,271
Oh my God

1060
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:29,855
I was able to resist the mind control

1061
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,903
No it's like one of those

1062
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:35,487
It's like one of those marketing strategies where they try and piss off

1063
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:40,863
Christian's because then they know real people will watch it and be like I get it you know this is fun

1064
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,911
I'm doing this to make

1065
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:46,495
Whiny old church ladies angry at me

1066
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,031
So this makes what Pisgah

1067
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:48,799
Confuse me

1068
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,831
Lunar eclipse

1069
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:02,879
Really offense

1070
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,839
No

1071
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:28,479
So

1072
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:34,367
I guess according to Alex like which doctors are Illuminati

1073
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:37,951
Man

1074
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,487
I will tell you this right now

1075
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:43,839
I think the thing that scares him more than the Matrix Reloaded

1076
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:46,143
More than Oblivion

1077
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:48,191
That's weekend at Bernie

1078
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:50,239
Me too cuz if you recall

1079
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:57,407
I think we all know what happened to Bernie in that situation or the clip he was brought back to life

1080
00:58:57,919 --> 00:59:01,503
And ambulatory by what we

1081
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:02,527
We would have called it

1082
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,551
The time of Woodstock

1083
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:07,647
Yeah I know that I've heard these sorts of ideas from Alex

1084
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,927
Come from like

1085
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:09,695
Weird

1086
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:11,999
Colonial era literature

1087
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:15,071
About the like a horrible to picture

1088
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:17,119
Shenzhen

1089
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:21,727
I know that I've heard these thoughts but I didn't know that

1090
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:23,263
His idea of like shaman

1091
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,799
Being part of a guild

1092
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,615
An ancestral gilled shark

1093
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:30,687
I didn't know that part of it which I think is really funny

1094
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,967
I think it's hilarious

1095
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:33,247
To imagine that he think

1096
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:38,879
That all of these these shamans are whatever they were somehow Linked UP

1097
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,719
The best hotspot

1098
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:45,023
I just that's what the scam was

1099
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,047
What a

1100
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:46,815
F******

1101
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:48,607
Ignorance and racist

1102
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,143
Thing to think

1103
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,167
Without

1104
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:53,983
Blurting anything about it at all

1105
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:55,263
The question weather like

1106
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,287
He got this

1107
00:59:56,543 --> 01:00:00,383
From some other very misguided Source or if you wrote it himself

1108
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,175
And I'm not sure

1109
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:03,967
So

1110
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,759
You like Alex

1111
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,551
Is kind of

1112
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:09,343
As it relates to the Matrix

1113
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:12,159
Really caught up and it being a little gay

1114
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,583
Diversion

1115
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:27,263
Overall

1116
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,663
Illuminati term

1117
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:45,183
Brings up way more than once

1118
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:47,487
But there is like there are things

1119
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:50,047
Is that are homosexual in nature

1120
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,095
That's a real sticking point for him

1121
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:56,447
So what he saying is that the Elites in the middle of a crumbling Empire

1122
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,215
Will

1123
01:00:57,471 --> 01:01:00,799
Do their best to distract you with superstition

1124
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:04,639
And gladiatorial combats

1125
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:05,663
Extort

1126
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,687
ISO

1127
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:08,223
That is why Alex

1128
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:09,503
Is

1129
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:12,319
Giving us the Christian point of view of a movie

1130
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:14,879
It makes sense

1131
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,927
Turn off so I thought

1132
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:17,951
Man

1133
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:18,975
What fun

1134
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:21,279
We got a movie review Alex's

1135
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,815
Off-base on a lot of stuff

1136
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,863
Do for the rest of the show

1137
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,399
Yeah I feel like there's

1138
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:28,447
There's really nowhere else to go after you

1139
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:32,031
There's no game to the reload is one place to go

1140
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:35,871
I'll expect a call and this guy is he's a disabled person

1141
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:37,663
He wants to know what the global

1142
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,687
Worcester going to do with him

1143
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:40,991
Golden

1144
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:41,759
Mark

1145
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:42,783
And

1146
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:44,575
Haywire

1147
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:47,135
I was blessed I was cut out with a rock

1148
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,463
Aziz murati

1149
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:53,791
Pretty much all my life

1150
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,815
Can hardly read

1151
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,607
Anna

1152
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:58,655
Browser real bad wreck

1153
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:01,471
I had to go on cold days

1154
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:04,287
Spell DMS my neck and Mom sign up

1155
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:08,383
Disabled

1156
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:15,551
Nu-Way Whitney

1157
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:18,111
They are going to

1158
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:25,279
And you will live in a small one-room

1159
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:29,631
Cameras everywhere

1160
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,383
Curb weight

1161
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:45,247
What the fuk was that

1162
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:49,087
That is so f****** cruel that dude is

1163
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:52,927
Clearly struggling in the whole super f***** up

1164
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,463
He's really just

1165
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:56,255
Man

1166
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,535
And then Alex just

1167
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,327
Without a f******

1168
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:03,167
Thought just makes up some b******* about this guy's going to be torture

1169
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:09,055
The death in a small apartment under watch of the SWAT teams

1170
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:10,847
Luda hydrator

1171
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:13,151
Is that what that guy was calling and looking

1172
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,943
I don't think it's

1173
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:18,527
Maybe he couldn't possibly have been looking for

1174
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:19,807
No

1175
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:23,135
No maybe he was looking for something

1176
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,415
To justify his

1177
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:26,719
His belief and Alex

1178
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:29,023
This is where the whores that they're going to inflict

1179
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:31,839
Upon someone dystopian future

1180
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:33,375
Yes that I must fight

1181
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:39,007
And this caller actually does you know I guess he does get what he was looking for and he hopes that he can Fight 2

1182
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:39,775
To the death

1183
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:41,311
Against these people who would

1184
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,335
Seek to dehydrate

1185
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:43,615
Where are you

1186
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,151
God gives me today

1187
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:54,623
Still got two boys 124

1188
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:04,863
What

1189
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:12,287
I mean honor thy father and mother of course commandment more important than all

1190
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,823
Sure

1191
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:14,847
Also no

1192
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:15,615
Also no

1193
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:16,639
Huge no

1194
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:20,223
That seemed that seemed a little bit out of place for what I know of Alex

1195
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:22,527
Got to take care of yours are going to hell

1196
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:28,415
Very strange man what is strange man to react like this to

1197
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:32,255
Guys clearly babe I feel like these are into

1198
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:35,071
Interesting glimpses into things that you know he would say or

1199
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:35,839
Support

1200
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:37,631
Really necessarily come up if it weren't

1201
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:40,959
There's a lot more callers

1202
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:42,495
In the past also

1203
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:48,895
Yeah I do like finding out hit more and more little tiny details of his a weird cosmology like well obviously if

1204
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:51,967
If you don't stay with your parents and take care of them until their death

1205
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:54,015
You go to hell.

1206
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:56,319
Bat signal

1207
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:01,183
Must be must be

1208
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,999
He's been he's big into re-litigate in the Civil War

1209
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:06,303
Here's a couple boy

1210
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,399
Soldiers from the Union

1211
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:15,263
Lincoln ended up with AJ

1212
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,055
I mean

1213
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:21,407
Translator on a president

1214
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,943
Lincoln was like

1215
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:33,183
Appreciate the call

1216
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:33,951
I got to go

1217
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:40,351
Lincoln shows up on a episode where he hates homosexual

1218
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:42,399
Reality so much

1219
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:43,935
So we can

1220
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:48,031
Break me comes back and gets another call and this guy is just watched

1221
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:49,823
TV show about Hitler

1222
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:52,127
And

1223
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,407
You want to make some comparisons

1224
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:55,455
The George Bush

1225
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:01,087
The phrasing that Hitler used

1226
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:02,879
Bag

1227
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:03,903
After the Reich

1228
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:06,207
UPS.

1229
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,999
Enabling Act

1230
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:09,791
Gave him

1231
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,959
I didn't but I certainly hope

1232
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:17,727
Somebody does

1233
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,519
You would love it

1234
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,079
Geisinger

1235
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,103
Brazing

1236
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,639
If Hitler used

1237
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:28,735
And arguing for the enabling Act is the same as the phrasing the George Bush

1238
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:29,759
Is using

1239
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:34,367
He didn't take this he has no idea Alex hasn't seen that it's just a conversation.

1240
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,903
You catch that thing on TV

1241
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,439
Wild

1242
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,975
Whatever

1243
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:42,559
I have a theory that I've been working on for a long time waiting is that

1244
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:44,863
Part of why we are where we are now

1245
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:46,143
Is

1246
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,679
So many people

1247
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:51,263
I have been so obsessed with watching documentaries about

1248
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:54,335
Hitler and the rise of the Nazis

1249
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,359
That

1250
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:58,687
Over time it's turned into a sort of admiration

1251
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,991
For a lot of people

1252
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:04,831
Which is why we see all of these conversations and comparisons

1253
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:05,599
Hitler

1254
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,623
From the far-right

1255
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:08,159
About everybody else

1256
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,439
Despite them

1257
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:10,975
Adopting those

1258
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:15,327
Tactics almost whole cloth you know what I'm saying I think I sit there like it was a

1259
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:17,375
I think you can learn the wrong last

1260
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:23,775
Alexandra's Colorado talking about Hitler and his speech

1261
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,055
That has mirroring

1262
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,335
George W bush

1263
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:30,175
They get into a little bit of a hey

1264
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,711
Let's recast

1265
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:33,247
The Bush Administration

1266
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,527
What was there to do

1267
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:36,063
Their analog

1268
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:40,159
In the Hiller Hitler Administration

1269
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,303
Don Estridge

1270
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,095
Homeland 30

1271
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,119
Patriot Act

1272
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:53,983
American hangman

1273
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:05,759
Well I just got a behind-the-scenes

1274
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:20,607
Belew drugs

1275
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:25,983
Nebraska

1276
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:31,615
John Ashcroft was the attorney general for Bush This is not analogous to Himmler who is the right

1277
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:35,455
If your SS if you want to be overly generous

1278
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,735
You could say that he was

1279
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:38,015
Metaphorically the

1280
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:38,783
Head of the joint

1281
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:39,807
Chiefs baby

1282
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,831
Something like that

1283
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:42,111
Colin Powell

1284
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:44,927
Tom Ridge is the Secretary of Homeland Security

1285
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:48,255
Hermann Goering was the head of the luftwaffe and then he wasn't

1286
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:50,559
Control the reichstag sewing

1287
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:51,839
Speaker of the house or maybe

1288
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:58,239
Vice presidents into the president of the Senate

1289
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:02,335
Fairly Rumsfeld is gerbils which is f****** nuts

1290
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,383
Karl Rove is garbled

1291
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:10,527
Yeah anyone who knows how to book a fantasy Nazi team knows that it's a disgrace that Alex's Macomb throw

1292
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:13,599
It's grown out of

1293
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:17,951
No there's only Grove and girdles like it's those two

1294
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:21,023
Very very simple so gabbles

1295
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:24,351
He had some ideas about the big lie

1296
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:28,191
That is so much like how

1297
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,215
Devils

1298
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:34,079
Get my ideas about the big lie right enough live people will believe it

1299
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,103
Big lie

1300
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,151
Harder it is for people to get it whatever

1301
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,687
The big lie

1302
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:40,479
What Joseph

1303
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:42,015
Was Hitler's minister

1304
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:45,343
Make it big

1305
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:01,727
I don't know I seem to remember from

1306
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:04,799
Play I quoted it

1307
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:05,823
That may well be wrong

1308
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:17,599
So some people think I was taken out of

1309
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:24,255
Is there anything more American than two old white guys talking about Nazis but they haven't bothered

1310
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,279
To read

1311
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:28,863
Gerbils took the concept of the big lie actually from another

1312
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:29,631
Source

1313
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:31,423
From mine comp

1314
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,447
Hitler's book

1315
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:38,335
The passage in question had to do with Hitler blaming everything that went wrong on the Jews

1316
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:41,407
The Jews that committed a big lie about what did God down

1317
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:47,807
What Alex says Victor Bose points out that their enemies use a big lie when he's failing to point out of the actual contact with a quote

1318
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,599
Is Nazi propaganda against

1319
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:50,367
What's Jews

1320
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:52,927
The big lie what was the LIE

1321
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:54,719
About Jews being the proper

1322
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:56,255
That was the Big Lot

1323
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:58,303
Yeah the big light wasn't

1324
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:02,399
The Jews lying about their involvement the big light was telling people that it

1325
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:05,471
Great job putting the history of the contact

1326
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:07,263
Extra

1327
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:11,103
The great this is the guy said that Hitler and Stalin

1328
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,127
Complete badass

1329
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,151
Cheese bread

1330
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:15,711
So many books about WWII

1331
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,479
Millions

1332
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:19,295
So Alex gets another call this is my

1333
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:20,575
Kind of cat

1334
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,855
He wants to know

1335
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,647
A very specific question

1336
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:26,207
From Alex

1337
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:27,231
And that is

1338
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:29,279
What Bible do you read man

1339
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:30,815
And this is a loaded question

1340
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:33,119
Because this means something to this call

1341
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,143
Obviously he think

1342
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,167
Max B some

1343
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:36,703
Versions of the Bible

1344
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:37,983
Are not a cure

1345
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:41,055
Yeah it seems like a like a newer version

1346
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:47,711
The King James of the NIV or whatever it is you like books that are added

1347
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:50,783
BECU somebody who's into some non canonical book

1348
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:52,063
Books maybe who knows

1349
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:54,111
I love this kind of question cuz

1350
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:56,927
Very specific and there's a specific answer that

1351
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:57,695
That you should go

1352
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:03,327
If you're religious person you should have an opinion

1353
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:06,655
Even if that opinion is I think a lot of different translations

1354
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:09,471
You are okay you should have an answer

1355
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:12,287
Outwits

1356
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:14,079
Let's talk

1357
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:17,151
Jordan

1358
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:19,711
First-timer

1359
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,039
Nothing

1360
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,623
I just want to know

1361
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,391
What Bible

1362
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,927
Church

1363
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,559
Work with the government

1364
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:50,943
No no no Alex doesn't go to church does he goes to text Mars

1365
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,735
Noted anti-semite

1366
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:54,271
Yeah yeah yeah

1367
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:59,391
I don't answer leave him believe that I think I was just grasping at straws and I was the only thing that could come into his mind of like

1368
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:01,951
This is a crazy right wing

1369
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:02,719
Extremist

1370
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:04,255
Church I can

1371
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:06,559
Signal to

1372
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:10,911
Yeah then the caller is just like he wants an answer of like King James

1373
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:11,935
All the way baby

1374
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:18,079
And Alex instead of like I only go to insane semites Church

1375
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,615
I don't go to church

1376
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:23,199
Where you worship the government couldn't be more of an import

1377
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:29,343
Question either because the simple fact is if you want to believe the Bible you also have to believe that it was

1378
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:31,135
Divinely-inspired

1379
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,927
So if there's a difference

1380
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:35,743
It's between two different versions of the Bible

1381
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:37,023
That would suggest that

1382
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:39,071
People got involved somewhere along the line

1383
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:41,887
At least in one of the versions

1384
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:43,423
If there is a discrepancy

1385
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:47,007
So other Scholars into Jesus should be enough for our

1386
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:54,431
Call Ryan Lewis

1387
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:05,951
Just leaving the old time religion

1388
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:08,511
The Lord Jesus

1389
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:09,535
You know when going out

1390
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:10,815
Personal Soul winning in

1391
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:27,967
What

1392
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:35,135
So apparently

1393
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:37,183
Alex's prerequisite

1394
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,207
For church

1395
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:39,487
To actually be a church

1396
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:43,071
Is they have to have his political inclination

1397
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:45,631
And preached about the New World Order

1398
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:46,911
It's not enough

1399
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:52,543
No they are aggressively and confrontational e into saving Souls 4D

1400
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,591
That's weird

1401
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:56,383
That's pretty weird

1402
01:14:56,639 --> 01:15:02,271
Yeah you know if there's anything I've always thought about religion it said it should be in politics

1403
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,039
Non-Stop

1404
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,319
Yep

1405
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:09,695
Another caller and this guy is kind of into Hitler I believe

1406
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:12,511
The New Yorker on the here go ahead

1407
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,375
Oh no

1408
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:21,471
Hughes

1409
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:24,031
Navigating

1410
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:30,943
Well duh

1411
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:35,551
The devil

1412
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:41,439
So I guess you saying that the Jews are

1413
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:42,207
The devil

1414
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:43,487
So

1415
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,791
Wait so the Antichrist

1416
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:48,095
Toll said that Hitler

1417
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:50,655
No the Antichrist doesn't reveal the aunt

1418
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:52,191
Christ plan

1419
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:55,775
Good thing to reveal the Antichrist plant

1420
01:15:56,031 --> 01:16:02,175
Hitler talked about how the Jews were to blame for everything in World War 1

1421
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:06,783
Like pointing the finger at nationalist leaders that is

1422
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:09,087
Hitler revealing the Antichrist

1423
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:10,623
Plans which was

1424
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:11,903
I mean if you look at it

1425
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,207
Is very clearly saying that the Jews are

1426
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,999
Basically what he

1427
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:18,815
Yes that's why I'm

1428
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:19,583
Concerned

1429
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:21,119
Right

1430
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:23,423
It's an issue

1431
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:27,007
There is a problem especially after you know

1432
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:28,799
Alex's said that he goes

1433
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:30,591
Text Mars's Church

1434
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:33,151
Yikes like this is just this is deeply a smell

1435
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:35,199
Yeah but everything that's going on here

1436
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:35,967
Yeah

1437
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:36,735
I don't

1438
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:40,063
You could just get away with a lot of s***

1439
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:42,879
Oh yes how man and then it gets even worse

1440
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,159
Speakers

1441
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,439
A name gets dropped

1442
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:46,975
And Alex

1443
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:49,791
Although he should be denouncing this person

1444
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:50,815
Will not

1445
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:54,143
I forgot his name to eat from

1446
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:54,911
WhatsApp

1447
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,215
The name David

1448
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:05,407
He was saying you know it's a new world order and is not much that we can do about it cuz you know it's in the Bible

1449
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:11,295
Thinking of anything less than the Bible in

1450
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:22,303
Exactly

1451
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:27,167
The world

1452
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:46,623
So David J Smith is doing the same thing that all of these evil churches are they open

1453
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:47,903
Paid off to do it

1454
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:49,183
He's saying there's no use

1455
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:52,767
I'm fighting the new world order or whatever

1456
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:53,791
What he's doing it for

1457
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:58,143
If you don't recall David J Smith is

1458
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:04,543
The creature whose Super8 to British is realism much a white-eyed

1459
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:06,335
Proponent

1460
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:08,127
Are the true Jews are white

1461
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,175
So now we have

1462
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:13,503
Two examples within like 10 minutes of Alex's show

1463
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:14,783
To very

1464
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:15,551
Anti-Semitic

1465
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,319
The preachers

1466
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:19,135
That Alex is a fan of

1467
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:20,415
Speak ill of

1468
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,231
That's bad man

1469
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:26,303
That's that's really bad

1470
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:28,863
Yeah yeah and especially because

1471
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:29,887
One of the things that we

1472
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:33,727
Thought for so long as they went under the radar with his anti-semitism

1473
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:35,775
By just renaming it globalism

1474
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:39,103
That he's just openly anti-semitic here it's kind of

1475
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:39,871
Mind-boggling

1476
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:41,407
Like

1477
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:42,175
Does he

1478
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:43,711
Hyatt Lake

1479
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:45,247
Isaac

1480
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:49,599
He probably doesn't experience all of this stuff is being as anti-semitic as address

1481
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:57,279
So let's let's take a load off let's get a little bit lighter this been in

1482
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:59,839
Put some heavy stuff with these calls

1483
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:04,959
This is just a good fun it's one of the things that I think is is

1484
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:06,239
Is Google

1485
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,263
What are the Delights

1486
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:08,287
I'm going back to the

1487
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:10,079
The past

1488
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:10,847
Theme

1489
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:13,407
Keeps going on throughout the show

1490
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:14,943
And that is the people

1491
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,991
From the Republic of Texas

1492
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,271
Keep calling

1493
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:19,295
A warning

1494
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,063
To like

1495
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:21,855
Get Alex's take on things

1496
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:24,415
Sovereign citizens

1497
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:25,951
Alex Beyond bored cuz he wants

1498
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:27,743
What's the seceded what have you

1499
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:30,047
But he hates these people

1500
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:36,447
Appreciate

1501
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:42,079
Not Dewayne but why

1502
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:47,455
And checking to see if you have gotten my letter

1503
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,015
And I think you'll recognize it

1504
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:50,783
Because it had the two

1505
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:52,319
Flag on the envelope

1506
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:58,975
Fax number from you not over-the-air

1507
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:00,511
My fax

1508
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,559
Well sir I don't know

1509
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:06,143
You know I barely have time to read

1510
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:07,679
I understand

1511
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:09,215
What's on your mind

1512
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,775
Received a letter

1513
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:13,055
From the

1514
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,336
Republican National

1515
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,104
Committee

1516
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:16,896
Only mine

1517
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:20,992
I answered your question error and then

1518
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,528
What are my opinions

1519
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:23,552
Yes

1520
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:24,832
What are your opinions

1521
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:26,880
Well my opinions are

1522
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:27,648
Set

1523
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:29,952
The only way we're going to beat this Subs

1524
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:31,744
Start small

1525
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:35,072
Start the process for success

1526
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:38,400
And then

1527
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:49,920
Republic of Texas people

1528
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:51,456
Not a big tent

1529
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:55,552
M414 president

1530
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:58,112
Yes I got your letter.

1531
01:20:58,368 --> 01:21:02,208
That is the best yeah I got your letter

1532
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,232
Malaysian of

1533
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:07,072
But I got your letter familiarity of like I know exactly who I'm talking

1534
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,864
Yep this is happening

1535
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,656
This is going to happen

1536
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:17,056
The president of Texas call again I have to I have to let you talk a little bit because I know so many of

1537
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:19,104
My listeners are you

1538
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,896
There isn't really

1539
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:21,920
All that much

1540
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:23,200
Arab

1541
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:23,968
Between us

1542
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:30,368
There's not there's not a real substantiv difference between what we believe I just hate you I just hate you

1543
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:32,160
Because you won't shut up about it

1544
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:33,696
I want to talk

1545
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:35,488
About the Matrix Reloaded

1546
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:37,536
Yeah

1547
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:40,352
And take aggressively antisymmetric calls

1548
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:42,144
And now I have to be like

1549
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,448
Do the government to lie

1550
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,984
Rap-up

1551
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,520
Alex's is taken

1552
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:49,824
Some calls he has it he has a guest

1553
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,616
Who talks to for a bit and

1554
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:52,384
The 3rd hour

1555
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:55,712
Who's someone who ran a

1556
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:57,504
Iea Union

1557
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,576
In New Mexico

1558
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:03,136
Because I had a war

1559
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:04,672
Yeah and

1560
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:08,512
Something that takes probably

1561
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:09,280
Bi-Lo

1562
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:15,936
Canal point out or whatever else would do that in the present-day but also I don't know

1563
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:23,360
I'm really that interested in this because like obviously it personally I agree they shouldn't have been evicted

1564
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:24,896
But I understand

1565
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:26,432
Having a demonstration

1566
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,968
Could have been a breach of their league

1567
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:32,320
So I understand and I don't understand why Alex would be against

1568
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,600
The landlord's

1569
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:35,136
Write 2

1570
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:40,000
Evict someone for Happy Valley

1571
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:42,048
I don't talk for a bit

1572
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:48,192
One way I am like you know part of protest is that there are going to be concert

1573
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:50,752
You can't protest in think that

1574
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:53,824
It's not a protest if no one is going to fight back

1575
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,360
You know that's just

1576
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:56,128
Advice

1577
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,664
Much like

1578
01:22:58,432 --> 01:22:59,968
But you like The Matrix 2

1579
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:01,248
Need to be state

1580
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:02,528
Absolutely

1581
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,808
And then on the other hand

1582
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:04,576
F*** you

1583
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:07,136
Evicting that fair enough

1584
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:28,128
Microban

1585
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:31,968
Do you know how strong he is

1586
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:36,576
He kept you kept your mind control he's going to buy the movie Jessie

1587
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:37,856
Test himself against

1588
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:38,880
Mind control

1589
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,416
ORD and it's good practice

1590
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:46,816
Ordan perhaps all of the mind-control that he was concerned about is not the Mind Control they were thinking about maybe they were mine

1591
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:47,584
And controlling him

1592
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:53,984
Into buying the DVD he also has a fridge full of power and it doesn't know why

1593
01:23:54,240 --> 01:24:00,384
Is chugging Powerade in buying tricks don't work on me

1594
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:06,784
Only way to get rid of powerades to drink at all that's what's going to happen I'm going to drink the whole business dry

1595
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,576
Our rate is a finite resource

1596
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:10,880
Eventually I'll get to the end of it

1597
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:16,000
Run out of power and I'll give them all my money

1598
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:17,536
So I guess

1599
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:18,560
In terms of this

1600
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:22,144
Obviously you needed to get

1601
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,704
To the point where you actually sees the movie

1602
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:27,264
Preparation for an episode list

1603
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,032
Concluded me watching

1604
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:30,336
The movie so you know that's a nice little

1605
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,872
Derivation from the norm

1606
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:33,920
Will be back

1607
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:36,992
Next episode where Alex will not be reviewing

1608
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:38,528
The Matrix hopefully hopefully

1609
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:44,928
Website

1610
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:45,952
