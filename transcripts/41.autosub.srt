Conversation

7
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:27,136

Your apology walk now longtime listener I believe

Might have been onboard

24
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,976
I believe it.

25
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:39,328
On the team policy

26
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,376
Today is that we are drinking

27
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:47,776
Liberty school wine I'm glad you brought that up which is

28
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:52,896
On purpose very intentional I bought that bottle of wine for today

29
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,944
Liberty loving Alex Jones

There is actually speaking at Liberty University

It's a double at the double wide

33
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:13,632

Poetry I don't like poetry

37
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,408

38
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,944
Friday

39
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:30,784
He got into the studio and I think he's started defense

40
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:37,952
Couple minutes to get into super defensive mode

41
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,744
Here's how we chose to start out on Friday

42
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:45,120

Cuz of the Johnnie Walker

00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,096
In the way that Matt sent

50
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,400
Also

51
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,728
Throughout the course of this episode we're going to find it Alex Jones didn't know Reese

52
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,824
You might have been up till 3 reading Breitbart article

53
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,848
He didn't know Reese

54
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
Search at all

55
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,640

I'm just like yeah I know it's amazing

58
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,624
Amazing how good Trump is

59
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,440
Election fraud

60
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,256
Illegals to vote in Mass

61
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:51,168
Pants coming out and said many Christians hundreds of thousands a year been killed nobody

62
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:59,360
You are still coming

63
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,664
U.s. finished goods

64
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,576
Merced we are in the bathroom time

65
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,160
Broadcast

66
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:18,815
I watch the 7/2 minute by Keith Urban

67
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,375
I want you to very very careful.

68
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,799
You didn't you didn't do that

69
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:35,199
Job Corps job stories

70
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,271
Ostensibly wants to get too in depth

71
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,575
Look

72
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,111
None of them

73
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
Christians are

74
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:49,023
We're going to get into this thing goes along making the argument

75
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,047
The Christians of the most

76
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,583
Persecuted group in the world

77
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,607
I am that

78
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:59,263
Penske Moutain said that hundreds of thousands are killed a year is that true

79
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,055
I don't care if that's that it or not

80
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,847
100-percent not true

81
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
And

82
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:07,199
The premise that no one would have said it a year ago isn't true

83
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,271
Because there's like WorldNetDaily article for the past

84
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:16,671
5 years old horribly on source of Obama eventually got

85
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:22,047
Christians being persecuted all across the world

86
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,863
Christian

87
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:31,263
I looked into it a little bit actually found a pretty interesting article because he goes on to

88
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,799
I can't remember if it's the

89
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,615
In this clip or a little bit later

90
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,407
I think I think it's

91
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
But

92
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,015
So you eat talks about how the UN

93
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,295
Admit

94
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,111
The Christians are the most persecuted group in the world

95
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:50,719
I found on um. Org really interesting article

96
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,743
2011

97
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,279
The talks about the first

98
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
Persecution

99
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:54,815
Christians

100
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,375
And I think that's the only thing that could be going on

101
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,655
Making that claim

102
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,471
And here all read the headline to you

103
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,775
So much credit for imagining that

104
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
He has red

105
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:10,943
Okay well then

106
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,735
Persecuted religious group in the world

107
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,783
Holy See tells um

108
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,183
That's a very different thing the end of the headline changes it if you read the first three

109
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,231
Three-quarters of it it backs him up

110
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,255
But

111
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:30,655
This guy from the world says organisation that would benefit off of

112
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
Christians being the most

113
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:32,959
Security in the world

114
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,495
Yeah yeah

115
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,775
Archbishop Dominique

116
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,591
The secretary for relations

117
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,383
States of the Holy See

118
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
I spoke at the UN

119
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,759
He went on to say that

120
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:49,343
The particular influence of a specific religion in a nation

121
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,903
Belongings

122
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,183
Should be discriminated against

123
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,487
In social life or even worth it

124
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:02,655
I like where you going so far I assume that means an all-inclusive thing

125
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,215
Where every religion should be protected in the

126
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,239
Exact same way as

127
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,591
Yeah that is the making

128
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,639
But

129
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,943
I don't like the butt that you

130
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:21,599
He also threw down this comment on the financial crisis going on in the world

131
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,367
World Stevens

132
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
To this day

133
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,415
The Archbishop stress

134
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:28,255
The economy cannot only function by market self-regulation

135
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,047
And even less in accordance with

136
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
What agreement

137
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,839
Limited too

138
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,887
Interest of the most powerful

139
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,703
Quote it needs an ethical basis in order to

140
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,495
The function for Humanity you said

141
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,055
Calling any other non ethical basis

142
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
Ingenuous or cynical

143
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,871
And always fatal

144
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,663
So

145
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,479
Absolutely correct he's almost as correct as Lionel

146
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,623
The only article that he could possibly be about the UN

147
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,671
Christianity being super persecuted

148
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,231
If you actually read the article goes on to

149
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:05,631
Say that Christians are persecuted but should not persecute there's also

150
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:11,519
Very important things to say at the same time that article

151
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,823
You got persecution in my economics

152
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,847
Right right

153
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:21,247
So then he goes also make me think of that like every religion always pulls that like

154
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,015
Persecuted

155
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,551
I am less interested in

156
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,599
How many people are getting persecuted

157
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,903
Finding that persecution rate

158
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,719
Sure Christians are person

159
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,767
Security Board

160
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,815
You don't get to

161
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,583
You don't get to

162
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
Don't you know

163
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,167
If it's the other way then everybody

164
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:42,495
It's an equilibrium we want all

165
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,031
Retro 10 persecute

166
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,335
The same time

167
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
You know

168
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,127
F*** you

169
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,991
So the other thing that you got into there was that like Steel

170
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,295
Steel Productions on the rise

171
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:56,831
Hanabi

172
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,367
Is true

173
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,167
Amorites

174
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,703
Trump's beneficence

175
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,847
Nothing to do with rope it's just like a nature of their high demand for steel consistently we need it

176
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,431
Literally everything everything

177
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,223
Has been going on for the past

178
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,247
20 years at army

179
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:30,623
All of the goods

180
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
Then finished good

181
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,975
Basically I think trying to insinuate the

182
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:39,327
What Trump tweeted out the other day about how China's going to start letting us elfing

183
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,143
What's the time again

184
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,287
I'd started to become finalized last year

185
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:56,223
The presidents have done for a long line

186
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,551
Always been enough

187
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,599
Blame the previous

188
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,391
Administration and then

189
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,231
Ministration scapegoating and Glory Hunter

190
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,655
Constant headaches

191
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,703
Absolutely nothing

192
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
But riding

193
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,007
Executive orders that will make

194
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
Everyone's life worse

195
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:26,687
And get halted in court

196
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,343
Ever ever

197
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
Blind

198
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:41,023
Why don't allowed to live wherever the f*** she wants

199
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,839
Millions and millions of dollars

200
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,399
Security detail

201
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:52,543
Why does she have no one gives a f*** about everyone knows this let's move on.

202
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:58,431
Get rid of her security

203
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
Think about this

204
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,991
If she gets kidnapped

205
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,015
Or threatened

206
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,551
Trump

207
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,367
Like nobody would care

208
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,927
I know I wouldn't care this is a good bit

209
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,231
But in truth I don't think that's a good idea

210
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:18,143
Well actually

211
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,679
50/50 disagree with you

212
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,239
Yeah

213
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,799
Get hurt someone could Target her and that's not fair

214
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,335
Every first lady gets

215
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,615
Security details

216
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,895
It would be wrong tonight

217
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,431
That's not like you

218
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,711
Alright

219
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,855
Security details and none of them

220
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,135
Most of them aren't monster

221
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:45,791
She might be great anyway.

222
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,423
Atlanta

223
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,447
What he really wants

224
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
Talk about

225
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,239
Keith

226
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,519
Bucking Oberman

227
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,847
Put out a video where you sort of says

228
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,639
All of the

229
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,711
Intelligence agencies around the world they were in a crisis

230
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,015
The time has come

231
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,319
There we need everything to come out in the open

232
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
Because

233
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,367
Eventually

234
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,647
You won't be able to

235
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,671
Write this

236
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:16,767
This is going to be

237
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,327
I'm not here to

238
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,607
Keith Olbermann

239
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,775
But at the same time you really opened yourself up to attack when you say

240
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,799
Hey foreign

241
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,823
Agencies

242
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:36,479
Spill the beans on our president

243
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,551
A goddamn president

244
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:44,159
You open yourself up to that exact argument and that's why I would never defend that

245
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,719
Well that's that's

246
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,743
The interesting thing

247
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,279
I do think about this

248
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
What if

249
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,631
You tweeted directly to the president

250
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,655
High hopes

251
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,191
Some Second Amendment people

252
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
Take care of you

253
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,031
Right you can imply that was a very direct

254
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,311
Sure but

255
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,847
If you go to court for

256
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,127
Can't you just be like

257
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
He said it

258
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,199
I'm quoting him exactly

259
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,503
So if you want to prosecute

260
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,527
He's on the pot

261
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:20,511
That's Mark Dice claymation right now

262
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:25,119
I'm telling you this is going to be alright

263
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
Here we go

264
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,679
I know body language

265
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,471
Twice

266
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,031
Last night this morning

267
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,359
Government is completely mentally ill

268
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,455
Is mentally ill

269
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,023
The dog off the leash

270
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,815
Widow Berman

271
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,399
He is completely out of control

272
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:03,263
Calling for to overthrow Trump

273
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,895
This is textbook

274
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,711
Sedition espionage

275
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,855
What is the president

276
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:23,487
I got some eclipse of professors today

277
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,279
Yesterday

278
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:29,631
Kill white people

279
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:37,567
And this is the climate changer

280
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,639
Not Libertarians not Christians

281
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,919
Not conservative

282
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,711
He doesn't have the eclipse

283
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:50,111
He doesn't get to those stories about that probably just grab some of the clips that I

284
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,023
Or he's at least

285
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:57,791
Okay with

286
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,191
Clips they could find would be on that border

287
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,727
I'm talking about

288
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,519
Buena Vista perience of

289
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,287
African American

290
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,311
This country

291
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
The idea that

292
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,871
Some light that has minimal

293
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
Compared to what

294
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,527
He's he's making this argument

295
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
That

296
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,319
F******

297
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,903
Obermann is committing treason and espionage

298
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,183
Dick most spies go on

299
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
G2

300
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:31,583
But after a minute long videos that seems like bad spy work

301
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,263
Navigation

302
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,543
Would let him on GQ

303
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,823
Snub gentleman

304
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
He should be drawn and quartered

305
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,063
Trying to figure out how to make that pain work

306
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,647
Conservatives and Libertarians aren't the ones

307
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,671
You should be afraid of

308
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,511
To differ

309
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:05,631
Journalist

310
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,911
Project Veritas

311
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:10,751
Truck wash

312
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,055
Hill doesn't real mad cuz

313
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,127
Trump is not going to uncover any voter fraud

314
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:16,895
There really is a

315
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,711
Insubstantial anyway

316
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,295
That James O'Keefe

317
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,831
Project Veritas

318
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,111
To come out and said

319
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,183
I was just I just wrote

320
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,743
Journalist yet

321
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,511
Which is like

322
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,935
The guy who

323
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,727
Doing like what seven years

324
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,007
No he's not in prison

325
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,543
Oh one of those guys is

326
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:53,759
Out it is

327
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,039
Out-and-out fraud

328
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,575
He is

329
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,367
Journalistic

330
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,975
Debauchery

331
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,023
We live in a world where I keep my

332
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,559
Be invited into that

333
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,095
It was incredibly scary

334
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,655
Voting rights

335
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,935
But absolutely is

336
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,383
Always about making sure the people who don't vote

337
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,711
For you

338
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:27,039
Put on

339
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,831
The on the ball

340
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,623
Department

341
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,207
The Census Bureau

342
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:40,607
The national Center

343
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,959
Like what you say is you resign

344
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,519
Quotes sign in

345
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:52,383
Protest I don't know enough of the details to say so I would want to speculate

346
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,943
The guy who's in charge of implementing

347
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,991
We're looking into these voter fraud issues

348
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,295
Has been sued over

349
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,831
Voter rights issues

350
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,927
4 * 4

351
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,975
Yep we're going to get some real good

352
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
Stuff out of this

353
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,815
I think we're going to get to the bottom of what's wrong with her voting sis

354
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,607
System we're going to fix it all absolutely

355
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:20,799
Remember

356
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,103
Yeah

357
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:29,503
Saturday schools windows

358
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,039
I don't look

359
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,879
Sour Jones introduced some of his narratives here

360
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,415
Mostly

361
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,463
But he's super mad to Keith Olbermann

362
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,535
That is important to remember for later

363
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,583
It's not just like

364
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,607
He has been

365
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:51,007
Stories he wants to talk about notes over prepared for the show

366
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,847
When he's over prepared

367
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,671
Suburb

368
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,231
I went into shops

369
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,511
A Starbucks

370
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,839
The pool supply place

371
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:22,239
Seven people to Starbucks three young Muslim girls with hoods over their heads

372
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,567
That's cool.

373
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:45,535
That are not tolerant that are the most oppressive

374
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,559
Call wife

375
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:50,143
People on earth

376
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,191
You bet I'm freaked out

377
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,359
Call wifey

378
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,687
Three daughters

379
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,711
Three daughters

380
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,503
$3

381
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,319
And I was like well

382
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:14,719
You're freaked out

383
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:19,583
Muslim women drinking coffee at a Starbucks

384
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:23,167
I don't know order pool supplies

385
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:29,823
Can't buy one of those noodles

386
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:36,479
I do like this could be a new stereotype of these Muslims

387
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,295
Muslims

388
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,623
You can't walk outside with them swimming

389
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,975
All that phone aside like

390
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,535
When you talk about islamophobia

391
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,071
Fear of Muslim

392
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:57,727
He's literally expressing that there's no other way around doing anything

393
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,287
Tolerance

394
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,895
Fairy tale

395
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,663
You like

396
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,687
You just said you wanted to

397
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:12,831
He is incredibly intolerant

398
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,111
Saudi Arabia

399
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:21,280
Definitely argue that his argument about

400
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,608
This is an incompatible group of people

401
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,728
Cool punch supply shop

402
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:37,152
Compatible three Muslim women are sitting around in a Starbucks drinking coffee

403
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,688
What will you do

404
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:43,552
Be more compatible unless they're open their own pinata

405
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:49,440
Exactly next door cat shelter under attack by the trendy's

406
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:53,792
I like the idea that the Detroit school is holding a Muslim girls only

407
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,072
Problem where you like wait

408
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,400
Sorry girls

409
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,984
Look into that plywood

410
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,384
I'm certain it's not true this is one of these things were sometimes Alex's lies you just like

411
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:17,600
There's too much going on in this episode of Too Many important things I had to research

412
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,392
Got left by the wayside cuz it's b*******

413
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:22,720
Research that did not

414
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,536
Dummy daughter Zagat

415
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,072
$8

416
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,888
No daughters

417
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:33,216
In this next clip Alex Jones

418
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,496
We're going to get through like

419
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:38,080
Probably six more Clips or so and then the episode Texas

420
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:38,848
Turn

421
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,640
That I

422
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,456
I'm going to give you a spoiler alert on

423
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,528
I think Alex Jones is mad that he is not the Press

424
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,808
Secretary

425
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,928
I can't okay

426
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
Look

427
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,840
Democracy that's background

428
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:04,448
He blasted

429
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:09,312
There's no way he would punch somebody in the Preston

430
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:13,920
Trendys in Folsom Collectibles and stuff like that

431
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:16,480
Alone on your show

432
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,040
You're only talking to people who have the same

433
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:24,416
Dumbass globalist mentality that you do or Eddie Bravo is your guest

434
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,512
But when you have to sit down

435
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,304
And have the scrutiny of the ink

436
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,096
Meticulous

437
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,888
Intelligent press

438
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,168
He would be

439
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,472
F*** they would tear him apart

440
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,008
Let's not give them

441
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:45,920
And also

442
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:49,760
What the Press pool is

443
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,784
Considering there

444
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,624
Being soundly defeated by the likes of

445
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,160
Huckabee

446
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,976
Sorrento's

447
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,352
What were the other one key

448
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,144
Keep spices it's an amazing

449
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,704
Next clip

450
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,568
See if there's an interesting things it starting

451
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,872
To come into the mainstream

452
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:19,712
I understand they talked about it before starting to understand

453
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,760
The idea of

454
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,808
Russian active measures

455
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,904
There are propaganda tools the Russians

456
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,208
These narratives

457
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,256
That are pushed out on

458
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,024
Sputnik

459
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,840
Nrt in particular both those Networks

460
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,888
Are state-run state-owned

461
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,728
All of the

462
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,800
Yes and they push out narratives

463
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,616
The idea that there are certain

464
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,384
Outlets

465
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,664
In the United States

466
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,200
Mirrors

467
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,504
What people are most

468
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,272
We concerned about

469
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,088
When people talk about fake news

470
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,368
Is that that's what they're talking

471
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,184
Someone who has been on

472
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,488
Infowars in the recent past

473
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,792
Former CIA agent

474
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,192
Discredited CIA

475
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
Let ever been on

476
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,520
Possibly

477
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,800
He is

478
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,824
Incredibly guilty

479
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,640
Appearing on

480
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,920
I meant taking talking

481
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
Point

482
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,456
That are

483
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
Jermaine

484
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,016
It originated on those Networks

485
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,832
And us

486
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,672
He have done so on Alex

487
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:36,768
The show gchq

488
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
British

489
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,584
Intelligence agency

490
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,864
Was spying on Trump

491
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,912
On behalf

492
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,680
Of Obama

493
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,216
Rat is a Russian

494
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:45,984
Did measure Naruto

495
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,264
Really

496
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:52,896
To spread these lies or buy by the Russian

497
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,688
Propaganda machine

498
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,968
You just like on board

499
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:59,808
He's being paid in his much but he's always been not beholden to

500
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,112
The truth but he's being in as much as

501
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,160
He is paid to appear on this network

502
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,696
Andy's band

503
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,720
From America

504
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,304
Right he is being paid

505
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,096
But why would you bring

506
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,144
Unless you were

507
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,912
Well if you

508
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,984
Consistently going on these shows then I assume part of his

509
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:19,776
None

510
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,824
Verbal contract

511
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
Is

512
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,616
Spread it everywhere

513
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:27,200
I'm not sure I have no evidence

514
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,040
Agent or anything like that

515
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,064
Documentation

516
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,344
Pastor

517
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,904
Let's go you might just believe dumb s***

518
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,672
That's

519
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,768
By this Russian propaganda

520
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,048
And brings it over to Alex

521
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,096
The reason I wanted to lay this out and

522
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,632
Explain it is in this neck

523
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,656
Alex

524
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,448
Is just straight-up repeating Russian profit

525
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,032
Really he's just laying out Russian propaganda

526
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,360
Really hard to accept

527
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:59,456
Well it's something that you realize he has been doing a lot of

528
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,760
He has no I know I know

529
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:05,088
The idea that you are.

530
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,112
You are so

531
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
Desperate

532
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,648
Nea

533
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,416
Information

534
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,440
Supports

535
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,208
You're both

536
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,000
That you will accept

537
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,024
Propaganda

538
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,584
Boggles my mind

539
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,984
Well I mean if you believe that Russia is one of the only countries that's not still in the grips of the globalist

540
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,264
It kind of makes sense

541
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,544
What does

542
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,944
Whatever their propaganda is as maybe the real truth as opposed to the fake news media here

543
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,552
I can see that was well if you if you believe that all Us Media is

544
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,832
Fake news propagate

545
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,392
Panda

546
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,416
Take me to propagate

547
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,584
Going right now

548
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,912
Admits that the Russian probe

549
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:57,312
What part of

550
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,712
He's been spot-on and staying present

551
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:10,368
If crazy Don Ford's come out he was being spied on

552
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,512
Hypnotic

553
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:30,848
With the Russians

554
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:34,944
Sports them

555
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,480
That's not true

556
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:43,136
It is hard to lose in the icebox

557
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,400
So the parts that are really important

558
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,240
That

559
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,336
I'm almost all of those points are just

560
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,384
Like regurgitated Russian

561
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,688
Yeah

562
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,832
Is Japan a word of the day

563
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:17,440
The idea that Russian probe

564
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:21,024
Stuff is just yet just because the Democrats lost in the

565
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,304
Sour grapes

566
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,120
The the idea

567
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,704
Trump was wiretapped

568
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,544
He was the idea that Susan Rice is responsible for leaks

569
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,848
Talking was the idea that call me

570
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,152
President was crazy he didn't

571
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,944
Say that

572
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,736
He was crazy

573
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:45,344
Well maybe even Beyond necessarily

574
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,624
Like a rushing record

575
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,904
Asian buffet

576
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,696
Comey was disgusted

577
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,232
Or nauseated

578
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,256
Could you help Trump

579
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:55,072
Is it horrible misrepresentation of his comments

580
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,632
What he was talking about was that he felt nauseous

581
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,912
He had had in a

582
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:02,496
Effect on the election because he is an a political figure

583
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,520
Supposed to be

584
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:07,360
What the office is apolitical and his axe

585
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,384
Cause

586
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,432
Nauseated

587
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,456
Not that you had help

588
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,992
Bulshit

589
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,272
Alex is being

590
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:20,672
But the rest of that stuff is just as effective measures

591
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,464
That's going

592
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,232
Going through the

593
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,768
Conservative propaganda me

594
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,536
Machine right now

595
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,816
Is the idea that

596
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,608
To fire him

597
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:29,888
Because

598
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,680
He should be subservient

599
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,984
Which is like

600
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,752
Saying it

601
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:37,312
Find for me to not be

602
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,336
Any laws what's

603
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,872
Course

604
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:42,944
That is the number one issue right now with a

605
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,712
The firing of

606
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,992
James Comey is that

607
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:45,760
If

608
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,296
That is like he's

609
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:50,112
And he said it like even Alex Jones like

610
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,160
He was being honest

611
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:56,512
About committing a crime investigation

612
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,816
Yeah exactly

613
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,632
If I was I would want to go

614
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,080
Should be independent FBI should be independent

615
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,104
It's like all of these

616
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,896
Things are again

617
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:17,504
Checks and balances that no longer exist like as long as there is a GOP

618
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,784
Controlled Congress

619
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,832
Absolutely willing to UPS

620
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,136
Every single

621
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,160
Possible Avenue

622
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,720
There is no check

623
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,256
Our system is

624
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,280
Broke

625
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,584
Create

626
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:35,680
The Safeguard of Freedom Alex

627
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,240
Liberty Liberty school but

628
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:44,896
Beyond that and we're going to get back to this cuz one of the big things that he started talking about there and it comes back up over and

629
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,272
And the path

630
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,136
That's just reducto

631
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,184
Good thinking it's both can be true at the

632
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,560
Of course they wanted him fired

633
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:03,584
In the past

634
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,120
Actually they didn't want

635
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:08,192
Every single example that he brings up

636
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,984
Is Democrat

637
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,544
Or Bernie Sanders

638
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,128
Becky probably should resign

639
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,432
They aren't

640
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:24,832
Not even if you even pretty f***** up

641
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,368
It would still be f***** up

642
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,136
Hillary fire

643
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,208
Because if they fired him

644
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:33,792
Then it looks like a complete like exactly

645
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,352
It's like retaliatory and that's not what you

646
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:39,936
You want from your president

647
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,704
Assistant

648
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,472
Flout

649
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:47,872
Spindles

650
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:50,176
Very very bizarre metaphor

651
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,480
Assure the point of

652
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,504
I think it's on

653
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,320
Bizarre metaphor

654
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,160
Either

655
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,440
Flip flop

656
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,976
Giving different stories

657
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,448
Bag of cash in Free bottles of whiskey

658
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:18,336
Liquor store

659
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,832
Not doing very good job

660
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,352
Idiotic

661
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,680
Why don't you investigate

662
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,800
Why don't you look at how they're involved with the Russian uranium deal

663
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,384
He just won't get off at

664
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,688
He's not looked into it's all he's got

665
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,576
Literally the Russians

666
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,112
Are laughing at us

667
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:06,208
On national TV

668
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,488
Is he fired

669
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,448
Locking us out wrong with the wife

670
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,008
It was if I was in his shoes

671
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,800
It's f****** hilarious

672
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:25,920
A constitutional crisis

673
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:29,504
Yeah that makes it even more scary is that clip

674
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:40,512
They don't care if we know they did

675
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,096
Do you think that because

676
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,144
If it does come out

677
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,936
That they tampered in our election

678
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,472
This severely

679
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,776
We have to f******

680
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,056
Kill all of them

681
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,640
That's an act of War

682
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,408
Which

683
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,456
Which is why I assume

684
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,480
The investigation

685
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,248
Ocean is take

686
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,016
Taking so long

687
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:02,784
Yeah because

688
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
Cosby evidence

689
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,088
Found

690
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:05,856
Because they need

691
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,392
Provide the evidence

692
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,416
In such a way

693
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,720
That we can acknowledge this

694
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,256
Corrected

695
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:16,352
And still maintain the Cold War instead of the

696
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,216
To be the only reason at all of this stuff

697
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:27,104
Is delayed because if you would there's no there's no other explanation because of any of it touches Trump

698
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,384
It's War

699
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,176
If you can if the

700
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,528
But you're probably right that's why it's taking so long it's because

701
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:38,880
Just was like manafort just Rodger Stone

702
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,952
Those investigations would not be that difficult to

703
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,488
You get to be like all right

704
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:49,888
This is f***** up your now a Sitting Duck president

705
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,448
Mustard is foreign agent Sandy more than enough

706
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,472
To be like

707
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,520
You probably committed a crime

708
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,312
Investigate it

709
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:01,920
It took us two seconds to find a crime because you needed it at that

710
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:04,992
Yeah PayPal

711
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:11,136
Like that's how they like you

712
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,608
Super specific simile of the guy being like

713
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:27,008
Liquor store you got whiskey

714
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,056
Something

715
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,408
Turnover liquor store

716
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:39,808
What did well I mean I just posted this the other day to the

717
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:43,648
The knowledge fight.com growing biography of Alex

718
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:46,208
Actually got kicked out of school for a year

719
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:50,560
Really

720
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,840
The ranch

721
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,888
Because he was fighting too much

722
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,704
So go check that out

723
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,152
The year on the ranch

724
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,528
Swan

725
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,232
Because

726
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:23,328
Tell me is Jeffrey directors Oliver

727
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,608
They're disgusting

728
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,888
Empower

729
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,904
Years of Democrats

730
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,696
And push with the goblins as well

731
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,232
Sure why not

732
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,848
That's what we call at the recall equivocation

733
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,896
Pets

734
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,224
Let's just call it

735
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:12,992
But you thought

736
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,904
What part of Russia now what

737
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,440
Cares yet

738
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:26,816
Exactly exactly it's that's

739
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,584
Superfudge

740
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,888
And then beyond

741
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,424
He's legitimately

742
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,192
Expressing

743
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,984
A desire

744
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,264
2

745
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,056
Unilaterally

746
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,336
Clean house

747
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:41,664
Which would be a culling of people who disagree with you

748
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,200
Which is a COO

749
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:49,344
No that's when you have a government clear separation

750
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,648
What you want

751
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:58,304
Is a single ideology in control of every single one of those acting in lockstep

752
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:05,472
You want you want Jordan disagreement how you get things done

753
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:12,896
Do you remember why this country was started to make more King exactly

754
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,456
First draft of the Constitution was

755
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:21,344
Realized recently

756
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,208
The actual idea of globalist being in charge of everything that Alex

757
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,488
Cells in order to

758
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,024
Do pictures b*******

759
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,072
That is literally a false flag

760
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,656
You know where the term comes from

761
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,680
No

762
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,984
Is a nautical term

763
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,800
Where you put up your enemies flag

764
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,080
On your ship

765
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,640
So people would think your enemy was approaching

766
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,688
Yourself

767
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,224
MC2.

768
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,504
Enemy was there

769
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:51,808
Sympathy

770
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,344
Or create

771
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,112
Did condition

772
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:54,880
That you're looking

773
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:59,488
The idea that he will think about it

774
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,792
The idea that he says

775
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:05,888
That a New York Federal Reserve Board member is suing him

776
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:06,912
When that guy is

777
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,960
Not a member of the New York Federal Reserve

778
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,752
Right that is a false flag

779
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,568
You putting that flag on hamdullah Kaya's

780
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,128
And that's not true

781
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:23,040
That is a really good point he's doing that to create sympathy in the people who already or like I ain't

782
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:23,808
Reserved

783
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,368
Yes using false flag sort of

784
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,648
Ideology

785
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:40,448
Operator is a false flag it's literally putting a

786
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,520
Even saying that all Democrats are

787
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:46,336
Russian agents as well or whatever

788
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:53,760
Just go into doing exactly

789
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,040
The opposite of what

790
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,064
He says

791
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:01,184
In this episode over islamophobia

792
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,704
Sarah Huckabee Sanders

793
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,592
Wow

794
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,128
What the

795
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,968
Home

796
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,296
We'll cuz he's an idiot

797
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:34,464
You like he thinks he's complimenting her by saying at the end she's really sharp

798
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,000
Compliment but you literally

799
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:36,768
Started

800
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,560
The first thing you said about her

801
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,328
Wow

802
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,608
That's f***

803
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:48,032
That is the patriarchy in a nutshell like that

804
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,080
Yourself she's at she's a woman

805
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:53,151
Did you know that and it's it's mindless and flipping

806
00:41:54,175 --> 00:42:00,319
Throne chairs

807
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:06,719
And if you told him you would get mad at you and think that you're a p**** snowflake

808
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:08,511
In his mind

809
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,791
He was giving her

810
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,559
The Hyatt

811
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,351
If she was

812
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:18,751
And you're not even

813
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:22,591
Gorillaz

814
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,871
Is metaphor

815
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:28,223
He played a video of her on the show again

816
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:28,991
Listening

817
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,831
Yeah yeah

818
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,111
That officer

819
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,671
She related to Mike Huckabee

820
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,719
Hoboy

821
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,487
I don't know

822
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:43,583
She's actually the love child of Mike Huckabee in Bernie Sanders

823
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:49,727
I should have said Colonel Sanders I'll never forgive myself

824
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,775
Much better

825
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,311
Stroke conference

826
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,847
Situation

827
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,383
This is where we begin

828
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:59,455
The Alex wants to be in the Press Corps narrative or they

829
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,479
Via the Press

830
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,503
Secretary

831
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:04,319
Here is the beginning of his analysis

832
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,343
The press conference

833
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,415
Let's go ahead now

834
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,743
Sarah

835
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,655
Was fired this is from yesterday here it is

836
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:25,311
I asked you directly yesterday if the president already decided to fire James Comey when he met

837
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:31,711
With the attorney general attorney general

838
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:38,111
President of the United States said directly to the president

839
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:44,511
Remove the FBI director that directly it was all him

840
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:50,911
MP3 Channel

841
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,847
Call the consensus

842
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,415
Consensus

843
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:18,047
A consensus that the mainstream media are liars how consensus that their elitist

844
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,679
A consensus that your hat

845
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,335
A consensus that you're a cat

846
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,383
A consensus that you're a brat

847
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:37,247
A consensus the time or breath

848
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,295
It's a consensus that it's green

849
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:42,367
It's a consensus that it is

850
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:46,719
I was wondering how long I could keep going I was trying to find someone

851
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:51,839
You always got to go children's book

852
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,887
I know that's

853
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,423
For fun

854
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:58,495
The idea of him playing this clip

855
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,775
Is really too

856
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:02,847
The name of the article that

857
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:03,615
About

858
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,663
Sarah Huckabee Sanders

859
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:09,247
Kobe's daughter

860
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,271
Better

861
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:13,855
I play in the base

862
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:21,023
But be that if you don't know that that's not

863
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,815
Izzy's to demonstrate the cheese grater

864
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:28,959
Yeah but that's supposed to be a Ford we can even get to her response he's got to cut it off and he's got to respond

865
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:31,775
Reprimanded

866
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,335
Cuz she's not attractive

867
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:40,223
Is he at all understanding what this journalist question

868
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,759
The guy has asked

869
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,367
Alex

870
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,159
He's asking her

871
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:52,767
Why is there a discrepancy between what was said

872
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:53,791
Before

873
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:59,935
Presidents presidents that have multiple in

874
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,727
Census of people within the White House

875
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,287
Saying that it was all because

876
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:08,127
Right Deputy attorney-general is why is that the case

877
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:12,479
Right there under stand

878
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,503
Like this

879
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,271
Absolutely.

880
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,831
Well

881
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:22,207
Wellwood he's trying to what he's trying to do is get out

882
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,487
What Alex

883
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,279
They say that

884
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,559
Because they both

885
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,607
What

886
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,631
Wanted to do

887
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:35,007
It doesn't matter when Trump said or the light

888
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,543
Question though is

889
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,847
Why is it that everyone

890
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:39,615
Pointed

891
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,663
All the blame towards this guy

892
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:43,967
Said it was

893
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,039
The color that goes to

894
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,063
Existence

895
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:54,975
Kind of the question if you really wanted to still it down to like normal languages

896
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,255
What's going on

897
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,303
It's not

898
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,607
Why are you so bad at

899
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:03,167
Bread

900
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,471
How to do what state was his fault

901
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:11,871
Or why couldn't keep his goddamn mouth shut like why isn't someone advising him to just

902
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,943
Actually probably it's because the deputy Attorney General

903
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,711
Christine said he was going

904
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,087
Recommend

905
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,647
The idea

906
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:31,327
I think we all understand what's really going on

907
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,679
Sessions recused

908
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,215
F*** we going to do

909
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:41,311
Susan already

910
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,079
Is

911
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,127
Heavy scare quotes

912
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:48,735
He also I've been reading up on it

913
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,527
Turn the hopper by writing that letter

914
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:54,367
Really a memo about

915
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,391
The person who was

916
00:47:55,647 --> 00:48:00,255
Conducting the Russia investigation means which is from

917
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:01,791
God

918
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,583
What are you putting yourself in jeopardy

919
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,351
What age

920
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,631
Rheem

921
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:07,679
Actually being

922
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,519
Attorney general is not allowed to

923
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,287
To practice law

924
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,407
Before The Supreme Court

925
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:22,783
Call

926
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:27,647
She's not answering her calls

927
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:31,743
So it goes on and will eventually have Trump

928
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:32,767
Only offer

929
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:39,423
Represent

930
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:46,335
Great writing a certified letter that you have nothing to do with Russia great

931
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:49,407
Doesn't get more boneface than this

932
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,943
It is all

933
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:53,759
Or

934
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:58,367
Or its next level trailer

935
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,415
Electricity red light

936
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,207
All right we have nothing to do with Russia

937
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:06,303
It would really drive people crazy if we use one of them offer

938
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:12,191
I don't think that would be hilarious

939
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,215
How are they sold

940
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:13,983
F******

941
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,007
Obviously

942
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:18,335
And we still because we know

943
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,103
Lewis congressman

944
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:23,455
A joke

945
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,991
Most of the elect

946
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,271
The go on in the

947
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:32,415
In there

948
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,951
Just putting their balls in our face

949
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,487
But anyway

950
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,767
Beavis clip goes on

951
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,047
The press conference

952
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,095
2

953
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:43,679
I don't think that Huckabee Sanders comes in

954
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:46,751
Ibis next quepe

955
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,919
Cuz you'll be wrong

956
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,975
Two atoms

957
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,351
Try to twist

958
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:14,399
Something you try to misrepresent

959
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:19,007
Warrior games

960
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:24,639
Opposite of a lawyer

961
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,919
So it like

962
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:30,783
What are you trying to do there is trying to say is just trying to

963
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:35,135
Trap

964
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,927
What's going on

965
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:39,231
What's going on here

966
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:44,863
We would like to be able to report this accurately but there is an inconsistency

967
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,143
We're trying to get to the bottom of it

968
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,935
Edina lawyer game

969
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,215
Lawyer games

970
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,311
Parcheesi

971
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:57,407
Seems like a high-class game right

972
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,943
Catan or abridged

973
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,479
Resource manager

974
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:05,087
That

975
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:05,855
Is

976
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,159
Very much a prisoner's dilemma

977
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,463
Like if I was gay

978
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,999
Investigating them like a

979
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:12,767
Straight up cop

980
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,047
Rights you have

981
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,327
Three different

982
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,119
Possible purpose

983
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:23,007
Different interrogation

984
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:25,567
But that's kind of the issue is there

985
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,847
Competing motivations

986
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,639
Like Paul Ryan

987
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:29,663
Just one

988
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:30,687
What is f******

989
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:34,783
Like he's willing to end America just so we can get rich

990
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,087
He wants to end Medicare

991
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,623
Okay that's that's his main goal

992
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,559
Right Trump

993
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:49,119
Just wants Trump to be richer and morphine

994
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:51,679
Just want to try

995
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:54,495
To be the Trump knighted states of America

996
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,799
Do you have

997
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:59,103
All of the other players

998
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,895
All of them just like

999
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:03,199
Trying to maintain some

1000
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:03,967
Semblance

1001
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,295
The massive wealth

1002
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,599
You know if

1003
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,647
The stuff that was in that. CA

1004
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:14,207
That came out the dirty.

1005
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:16,767
If some of the stuff that was in there is true

1006
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,559
People like Paul manafort

1007
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,351
People like Carter page

1008
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,887
Rodger Stone

1009
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:23,167
Stood to gain

1010
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,703
Billions of dollars

1011
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:27,263
From that tempers

1012
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,567
Yeah it's like really in dollar deal

1013
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:33,407
Holyshit may have like 20% of it or something like that

1014
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,711
Yeah it wasn't

1015
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:41,343
18% stake in the trillions of dollars

1016
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:49,791
The embargoes on oil in Russia

1017
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,583
Expensive

1018
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,887
Oilfield but they're not using because

1019
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,959
Sao opening that up with Santa make

1020
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:57,983
People like red

1021
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:58,751
Rex Tillerson

1022
00:52:59,263 --> 00:52:59,775
I am

1023
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,567
Conspirators

1024
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,847
Tons of money

1025
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,871
So there

1026
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,663
That makes sense of the motivation

1027
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:08,991
Very simple you have all three of these different

1028
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,527
Party

1029
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:11,807
Giving completely

1030
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:12,575
Stories

1031
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,599
NordicTrack

1032
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:16,415
Power-hungry

1033
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:18,719
Hungry lust for money

1034
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,303
Best game

1035
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,583
He's trying them to

1036
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,351
Turn on each other

1037
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,911
And that's the prisoner's dilemma

1038
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:29,215
There is the only way they all win

1039
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,751
Is there a state

1040
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,775
All temp

1041
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:37,407
True none of them can do that and we're seeing an inability to tell the same story

1042
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:38,943
Leeds

1043
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,991
Meltdown in like not even

1044
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,015
Similar story

1045
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:44,831
Like legit

1046
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:45,855
Yeah

1047
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:51,487
Do not be still going on television

1048
00:53:56,863 --> 00:54:03,007
Trump's birthday

1049
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:07,103
So this next week we finally get to Huckabee Sanders coming in

1050
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,639
And giving her

1051
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,663
Response to this question

1052
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:12,479
Let's go back to her response

1053
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:19,391
Fire James Comey we're so many people giving answers to just more correct

1054
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:25,791
To report

1055
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:32,191
Let you finish and read off every single one of those statements

1056
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:44,991
Simple I hadn't had a chance to have the conversation directly with the president

1057
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:52,159
I went off of the information that I had

1058
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:57,535
I answered your question I sent had the conversation with him right before I walked on today

1059
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,071
At this point

1060
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:00,863
Good

1061
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:02,911
It is not

1062
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:05,727
We were misled I personally

1063
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:06,751
Was ignorant

1064
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:10,335
Because I just

1065
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:13,919
Spicer

1066
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:19,551
The death she's doing a great job as the press secretary

1067
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,575
Is already

1068
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,367
She's not

1069
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,951
She's not said anything embarrassing like spider

1070
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:27,487
I agree

1071
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:29,535
Angry and run away like

1072
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,167
He turned it into a quest

1073
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,447
About her

1074
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:38,239
Right question

1075
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,007
That he asked

1076
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,287
Perfect

1077
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,567
Because

1078
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:46,431
There's that minor little bit of taking responsibility for something that isn't really that bad

1079
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:48,223
It deflects from the fact that the quest

1080
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:57,695
That's a really good

1081
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,999
But I respect the hell out of here answer at

1082
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:06,399
And he waited up very clearly

1083
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:12,543
I've been thinking about it for months which I did say yesterday and have said many times since

1084
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:28,927
And then later he just had so much weird things like

1085
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:32,767
Weird

1086
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,583
And that he also

1087
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:45,311
About

1088
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:51,711
And then you think we're so stupid I don't have a memory

1089
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:01,951
There's no collusion

1090
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:14,495
Foreign minister and the ambassador to the United States from Russia

1091
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:28,831
No one's saying the trumpet

1092
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:29,855
Helping them

1093
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:32,415
They they were just saying this is a dangerous situation

1094
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,511
In the Oval Office

1095
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:42,655
From a hostile State game

1096
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:45,471
Even in his defense

1097
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:46,495
She was like yeah

1098
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:49,311
He set up meetings that legally wasn't allowed to do

1099
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:51,103
No hit his argument

1100
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,175
Kind of

1101
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,455
Dicey

1102
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:01,855
But his argument is that Mike Flynn whenever he was talkin to like kislyak

1103
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,159
I was just saying

1104
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:05,439
Cement 4S

1105
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:10,559
Calling multiple times

1106
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,607
We're still on for 5

1107
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,375
Friday

1108
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:18,239
Obama put sanctions

1109
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:22,079
Poynette to call a couple times be like

1110
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,871
Don't worry about it

1111
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:30,271
I'm definitely not revealing foreign policy

1112
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:35,391
I have not yet registered don't worry don't worry

1113
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:37,951
We are so secretive

1114
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,231
He might as well have had a

1115
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:41,791
Next to his

1116
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,559
Talk

1117
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:43,839
I've soaked rain

1118
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,935
But all of that all that s*** is

1119
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:48,703
First of all

1120
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:49,727
He interrupts her

1121
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,007
Roots

1122
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:54,591
I'm being petty

1123
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:59,967
But I couldn't let the clip play out next week give her answer because he had to jump in with his aunt

1124
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:01,503
I wish

1125
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:02,527
I mean it's just

1126
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:03,807
Of course he wants to be in the

1127
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,623
What's being there so bad yelling at these journalist

1128
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:07,903
It's Tricky

1129
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:10,207
Hungry for the game

1130
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:16,607
He wants to yell at them himself no one would ever let him there

1131
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,959
I just didn't pick up on it right there but yeah

1132
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:23,263
He wants to be there

1133
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:28,383
Because he would answer them so much more harshly

1134
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:29,663
Unattractive

1135
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:31,711
Woman ever, I would defend

1136
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,759
So much better than you

1137
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,575
Pathetic

1138
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:39,647
Building is old

1139
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,671
Exactly the narrative

1140
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:41,695
He wants to

1141
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:45,023
Right

1142
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:49,375
Around who know facts

1143
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,215
Because you couldn't

1144
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:56,287
You couldn't yell at people about how

1145
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,823
The Washington Post

1146
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,103
New York time

1147
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,639
They reported

1148
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,175
The Trump was wiretapped

1149
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:03,711
They reported that Trump

1150
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:05,759
Trump with wire tie

1151
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,855
Tower Associates

1152
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:11,647
Of his might have been wired

1153
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:13,439
Right

1154
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,743
Another body of the article felt it out

1155
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:17,791
Yeah so

1156
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,583
Everyone would just be like

1157
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:22,143
Referencing headlines

1158
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,679
Yeah

1159
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,447
Physic

1160
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:26,495
You don't read anything

1161
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,031
You don't know

1162
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,055
Eminence why you couldn't have

1163
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,847
A job now

1164
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,383
Because our dreams

1165
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,943
Sobe still great

1166
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:39,039
So is it next clip we get even further inside that Alex wants to

1167
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,343
Like this just so clear

1168
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:49,791
Yesterday and have said many times since Wednesday was the final straw

1169
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:07,967
You were

1170
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,575
Interview

1171
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:18,975
He laid out the truth

1172
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:30,495
The president

1173
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:50,719
Little man

1174
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:52,767
Contradicting statements

1175
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:58,143
And people that were maybe in the dark about the Democrats was free too few of them

1176
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:16,319
Nothing for the American people it's coming

1177
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:23,999
Just goes on for a while that's that's what I'm talking about when I said it or answer doesn't stay good because

1178
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:26,559
Like you said she's not answering

1179
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:29,887
She's doing a really good job of removing the target

1180
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:32,959
Basically

1181
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:33,727
She's crushing

1182
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,775
Look over here look up

1183
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:38,079
Prepared

1184
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:40,895
She came with all of those f****** Democrat quotes

1185
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,431
Like she's on it

1186
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:46,271
Yeah for sure showed up with

1187
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,295
Like

1188
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:49,343
Manila folders and just filled with

1189
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:55,743
Black paper

1190
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:56,767
Competency

1191
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:00,095
I would love to be able to be there myself as a journalist

1192
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:02,143
To be like give a rebuttal like

1193
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:03,423
Not a hold on

1194
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,191
Those

1195
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,263
Are old

1196
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,543
By and large

1197
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:13,919
Their months old

1198
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:16,223
In this context but

1199
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:19,295
At the same time

1200
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:23,135
She's being a press secretary

1201
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:26,207
Because you asked questions like hey

1202
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:30,815
Is this true and they're like well this is true

1203
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,375
Hillary

1204
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:34,911
You answer that

1205
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:38,495
Hillary conversation

1206
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:44,639
That hurt my throat

1207
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:50,783
So Alex comes back after she gets done with her

1208
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,831
And here is his summation

1209
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,647
Wow she's good better than Spicer

1210
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:56,927
Yep

1211
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,231
Agreed

1212
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:04,095
The brown daughter

1213
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:05,631
The fox

1214
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:10,751
Wow that's insane

1215
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,287
What

1216
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,567
Yeah what

1217
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:19,967
God damn he's a pile of s***

1218
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:24,063
With comments about how she's not hot enough

1219
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:27,391
Put this very smart girls braids

1220
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:31,231
Insomnia

1221
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:32,767
Imagine

1222
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:34,047
If you took Alex's

1223
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:39,935
And put it into the brain case of a f****** dog a brace

1224
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:43,007
The bridge

1225
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:52,991
It wasn't a great movie I wish they'd chosen an Asian woman but what are you going to do gets done with this this break

1226
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,319
I am

1227
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:58,879
We now enter what will be the

1228
01:04:59,135 --> 01:04:59,647
This episode

1229
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:01,695
She comes back from break

1230
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:04,255
Start breaking down

1231
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:05,791
This Keith Olbermann

1232
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,631
I'm glad we got off of his

1233
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,399
Rampit

1234
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,167
Misogyny

1235
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:14,239
No left dumb

1236
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:16,031
Park

1237
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,823
He skips break

1238
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:20,639
And does 35 minutes straight

1239
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:22,431
On a seven-minute clip

1240
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,455
From Keith Olbermann

1241
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:26,527
Wow he's our level of

1242
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:32,415
But she's watching a little bit of information

1243
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:34,719
Contacts

1244
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,743
Any insight

1245
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:36,767
Right just mad

1246
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,303
He's just screaming

1247
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,351
Trip out all of it

1248
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:42,143
Hates keto bourbon

1249
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,423
With

1250
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:46,751
Well I would say that is

1251
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:48,287
Is that is like like

1252
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:51,103
Overman is definitely that

1253
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:54,175
That's similar style of alpha male yelling

1254
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:57,759
Trendy's light

1255
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,831
It's kind of like Alex Jones

1256
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,623
Is some sort of

1257
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:03,391
Outkast

1258
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:05,183
Epimedium High School

1259
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:09,279
Keith Olbermann is the cool quarterback

1260
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:10,815
Is exactly what it is

1261
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:14,143
But at the same time

1262
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,679
The f****** lineman he doesn't get it

1263
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:20,543
Calculator

1264
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:22,591
You can't move like a quarterback

1265
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:26,175
Also like it's not even really fair that assessment

1266
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:28,735
Might because like Jake Tapper is maybe the quarterback

1267
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:29,759
There's something like that

1268
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:36,159
If you want to go mainstream media but if you want to go mainstream

1269
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:41,535
I don't I don't watch it

1270
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:47,167
Is a highly rated show on the number one

1271
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:47,935
Cable news

1272
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,983
Anspach

1273
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:54,591
No wonder I think he accurate

1274
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:56,895
Alex Jones is an outcast

1275
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,943
And there's a cooler Outkast

1276
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:02,527
Still on The Fringe

1277
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:06,111
That is not a good day at work

1278
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:11,743
They put a lot of in-depth interview

1279
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:13,279
Recently

1280
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:15,839
Teen Vogue has been doing

1281
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:20,447
Absolutely

1282
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,775
We're entering the

1283
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,335
Totally

1284
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,103
But

1285
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:33,503
You can't take aim at Keith Olbermann is being like a news Golden Boy when he's on Gentlemen's Quarterly

1286
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:37,599
The fashion magazine photoshoot

1287
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,879
So it's all good

1288
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:42,207
Displacing

1289
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:44,255
Mostly Isaac

1290
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:46,559
We're going to explore throughout this

1291
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:51,935
Maybe too thorough investigation of Alex's investigation

1292
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:55,775
I like how we're going to do

1293
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:57,311
Alex

1294
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,079
Self

1295
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:01,919
Okay he's yelling

1296
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:02,943
Nokia

1297
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:06,271
Alex is mad

1298
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,295
Keith

1299
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:08,575
4

1300
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,599
Embodying

1301
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:10,367
Things

1302
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,391
Becky Fields Easley

1303
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:14,463
Or things that you self-conscious

1304
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:15,487
But he does

1305
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:19,327
Like I said up top

1306
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:21,375
No cuz he does have a fun fact

1307
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:27,775
I'm not defending Keith Olbermann I think he has his issue

1308
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:30,335
I think he's a way better journalist

1309
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:32,127
And a better prison

1310
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:32,895
Phenolic

1311
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,943
In terms of being a professional

1312
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:38,783
Haha

1313
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:46,975
This guy is also off the chain

1314
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:48,255
Lunacy

1315
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,839
I'm not children

1316
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:53,887
I'm not a boy

1317
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:58,239
I'm not defending Keith Olbermann I am only in so much

1318
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:00,543
As I side with him over Alex

1319
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:03,103
Traduction here

1320
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:07,199
All capital letters

1321
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:10,527
This is just all projector

1322
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:17,951
Ladies and gentlemen I don't know where to begin remember a few months ago and

1323
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:26,143
Remember he said that

1324
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:36,895
Video last night

1325
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:43,039
Look at his eyes

1326
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:45,343
He looks like he's completely mentally ill

1327
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:47,391
Completely scared

1328
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:51,999
Year old young boy who's afraid that

1329
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:55,071
Killing

1330
01:09:55,327 --> 01:10:01,471
Sounds like someone we know

1331
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:05,567
Shraddha Kapoor

1332
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:13,759
Delivering

1333
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:27,583
He's crazy

1334
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:29,631
He's bad the whole world in danger

1335
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:31,679
I don't know where I've heard things like that before

1336
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,983
Could you think of anybody

1337
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:35,519
Who is said something

1338
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,287
Things similar to that

1339
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,311
That prompted the Clown

1340
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,383
Good point

1341
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:46,271
One of his

1342
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,295
Was the person who

1343
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,831
Who's trying to kill exactly

1344
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:51,391
Also

1345
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,159
I like

1346
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,463
He is mentally ill

1347
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:56,767
You see it in his eyes he looks

1348
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:59,839
Scared he looks like a five-year-old boy

1349
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,167
Kicked off of

1350
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:07,263
His mother's lap and told you don't love no more

1351
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:11,359
Liquor store with

1352
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:17,759
Two bottles of liquor store

1353
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:18,527
His

1354
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:20,319
Propensity for

1355
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:21,599
Picking

1356
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:22,367
Like

1357
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:23,903
Parents

1358
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:25,183
Totally

1359
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:26,719
It's always got to be like

1360
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:27,743
Look at him

1361
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,023
Don't listen

1362
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:30,815
Look at him

1363
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:32,863
Look at Trump look at house

1364
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:36,447
Slick look at how his hair is always

1365
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:39,007
Don't engage with his thoughts

1366
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:39,775
Or his

1367
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:43,359
Opinions or his research

1368
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:44,639
No course

1369
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:47,199
It's too it's too hard for him

1370
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:50,271
I would say

1371
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,063
Within

1372
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,855
This 35-minute clip

1373
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:56,927
Alex Jones hit the most of his greatest hits of Lies

1374
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:01,535
Hahaha and also comes in with some new ones that I'm going to debunk along the way

1375
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:04,607
And then also American Pie also right

1376
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:13,567
I don't know how to put a finer point on this

1377
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,103
Keystone

1378
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:18,431
Please just mad at himself one of the arguments that he makes

1379
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:20,223
Is so absurd

1380
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:21,759
Italy

1381
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,039
It undercuts

1382
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:25,087
Alex Jones's entire philosophy

1383
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,695
F****** Keith Olbermann

1384
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:33,535
She's attacking himself yet when you punch your mirror your hands is fine

1385
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:37,119
Go to the next web

1386
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:39,679
So we can move this along cuz I

1387
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,703
23 clip

1388
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:47,103
This next one is about Trump

1389
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:49,407
Many varied

1390
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:51,455
Over delivered

1391
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:53,503
Dominique koplo

1392
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:56,063
You're tired of accomplishing things

1393
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:58,879
Zika women

1394
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,671
This is mental illness

1395
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:01,695
That's more than that

1396
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:08,095
It's called

1397
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,887
Power

1398
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:14,495
Criminal

1399
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:17,567
Operations against your country it's called

1400
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:23,455
As though you were

1401
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:29,855
Sedition

1402
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:33,439
Was really the sparring power

1403
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:35,487
And he was screwing us over like

1404
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:54,687
WorldStarHipHop

1405
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:00,831
So in there he makes these

1406
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:02,111
Desert of argue

1407
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:03,135
Commence about Trump's Aqaba

1408
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,231
None

1409
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:10,815
Globalist are real

1410
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:15,167
I'm sorry if aren't real accomplishment against them

1411
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,703
That isn't real is real

1412
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:24,383
It's like when he says that Trump is Rita Claire its offerings

1413
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:27,711
What does that mean

1414
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:37,695
Renewing your wedding vows

1415
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:42,815
3 times before that any raped one of your former wife

1416
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:45,631
Write a book about it anyway

1417
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:49,983
Is really interesting because

1418
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,031
The funding that actually is going to

1419
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:52,799
Because it is a toy

1420
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:53,823
Humanitarian

1421
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:54,847
Organization

1422
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:56,383
Like food

1423
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:58,687
Organization and things like that

1424
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,223
If you really look into

1425
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:03,807
Specific cuts that are going to have to be made to make his budget

1426
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:05,599
People who are involved

1427
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:06,879
With those organizations

1428
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:07,903
This will be

1429
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:08,671
The barge

1430
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:10,463
Humanitarian crisis that we've ever

1431
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,999
Blueface

1432
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:14,047
I believe

1433
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:15,839
We're going to f*** porpoise

1434
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:16,607
People

1435
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:19,679
Ahca

1436
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:23,263
The quote from

1437
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:24,543
Have a name

1438
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:25,823
It's kind of irrelevant

1439
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:26,591
But like

1440
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:33,247
This lack of funding we will not be able to make up from Individual donors

1441
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:35,039
The amount of money

1442
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:36,063
The US gives

1443
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:38,111
Dive to keep people alive

1444
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,391
Foreign countries

1445
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,415
Third world countries

1446
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:43,743
Medical release

1447
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:48,607
Entirely shift

1448
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,655
The nature of human

1449
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:58,847
On funding of the UN is not going

1450
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:01,151
To be some political game going

1451
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:03,455
To be mad

1452
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:05,759
People are going to die

1453
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:08,831
Unreleased

1454
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:18,047
That's what's being cut funding North Carolina's hurricane relief

1455
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:25,983
It doesn't f****** matter if your worldwide

1456
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:28,287
Look up

1457
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:30,591
True but we got to keep it on the globalist

1458
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:38,015
I don't know I have you ever come into North Carolina for disaster

1459
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:42,623
F*** it the free market I'll take care of you

1460
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:45,951
Listen to interviews It's Like Romeo Dallaire

1461
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:52,095
The guy who is on the ground in Rwanda during Civil War

1462
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:55,423
She wished that the UN gave them less funding

1463
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,471
No

1464
01:16:57,727 --> 01:17:02,335
It's kind of the opposite

1465
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:05,919
I was I was like wait

1466
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:06,687
Do like that

1467
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:09,759
Global corporations are they really just kind of

1468
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:11,039
Screwed everybody over

1469
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,575
And it was a temporary relief for a

1470
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,367
The moment they left

1471
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:16,159
All that s*** started up again

1472
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:20,255
No it's not on

1473
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,535
The the funding

1474
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:24,351
Exactly what needed to be done

1475
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:25,375
Cause

1476
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:26,911
Countless deaths

1477
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:27,935
Genocide

1478
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:32,031
We're going to we're going to end up seeing in war-torn regions

1479
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,823
Because of trump

1480
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:35,359
Proposed lack of

1481
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:37,407
And it's not

1482
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,455
Like we want to imagine

1483
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:43,039
But people like Alex one

1484
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:45,599
You went to the money suck

1485
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:47,391
Yeah just trying to keep

1486
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,927
Consolidate business interests

1487
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:50,207
Stuff like that

1488
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:52,511
Usurp our sovereignty

1489
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:57,631
Bright and in reality a lot of the money that you that we pitch into it goes to

1490
01:17:58,911 --> 01:17:59,423
People alive

1491
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:01,727
It's and it's amazing that he

1492
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,263
He kept Butler

1493
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,543
That's not a story

1494
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:06,079
Like you and I

1495
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:07,103
Like most people

1496
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:11,199
Do not know that those

1497
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:17,855
Taking to the UN

1498
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:19,135
So that

1499
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:20,671
Basically means that

1500
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:22,463
They can get away

1501
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:29,887
This is no one's picking it up really don't it's not it's not carrying on as a narrative

1502
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:32,191
Give a f***

1503
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:37,055
It's the same thing with Americans are poor and brown

1504
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:39,103
So if that's America

1505
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:39,871
His philosophy

1506
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:42,943
This next door I was really interested in it because

1507
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:45,503
He keeps talking about how like in his short time in office

1508
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:47,039
Trump is boosted

1509
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:48,831
The stock market more than anyone ever

1510
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:51,903
The massive rise

1511
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:52,927
Like a bubble

1512
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:55,743
Well that's one thing I have

1513
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:58,303
Talk about how we're going to be okay for a little while

1514
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:01,887
This will be the biggest crash that we've ever seen

1515
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:03,423
Like

1516
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,983
The sort of things everybody plays at no infrastructure

1517
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,775
It's unsustainable it's

1518
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:10,079
It's just on hubris

1519
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:11,359
Yeah and I

1520
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:12,127
Hot air

1521
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:14,431
I wanted to look into specifics

1522
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:17,247
Percentage of the

1523
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,015
It's growth

1524
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:19,295
Presidents

1525
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,063
First

1526
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:23,647
100 days in office

1527
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:26,975
No I'm an

1528
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:28,255
Delano Roosevelt

1529
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:30,047
Oh yeah well

1530
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:36,447
But he has of the single worst thing that ever happened to literally anything

1531
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:41,311
33 came to office and raised

1532
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,847
The stock market by 79 point

1533
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:43,871
60%

1534
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:45,407
What you got on

1535
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:51,039
Call Totoro

1536
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:52,063
Also just

1537
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:52,831
Not having

1538
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:54,111
Hoover in there

1539
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:55,391
Who was active

1540
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:56,671
Play f****** people over

1541
01:19:57,183 --> 01:20:00,255
The fact that you have somebody who espoused

1542
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:02,559
Some socialist beliefs

1543
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:03,327
The stock market

1544
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,095
Was going to go up

1545
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:05,631
And then the New Deal of course

1546
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:08,959
LED 28.

1547
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:13,055
Consistent growth for 40 years and then somebody

1548
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,592
The New Deal

1549
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:16,896
And somehow everything started going

1550
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:17,664
F****** s***

1551
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,736
Actually Hoover is first hundred days in office wasn't

1552
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:21,760
Terribly bad

1553
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:23,296
We only saw one point

1554
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:24,320
2%

1555
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:25,600
Decreasing the stock

1556
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:27,136
Botanical Park

1557
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,928
Hoover was elected

1558
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:30,464
2929

1559
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:33,536
A 28

1560
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:34,560
28

1561
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:38,912
Number 5

1562
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:39,680
On the list

1563
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:40,960
Of the

1564
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:41,984
Biggest growth

1565
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:44,032
In stock market in the first hundred days

1566
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,312
With a 5.3

1567
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:46,336
2% train

1568
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:48,896
How about

1569
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,688
Junior number three

1570
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:51,712
No

1571
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,992

1574
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:02,464
Obama Barack motherfuking Obama

1575
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:06,560
In 2013 7.51 almost at 2%

1576
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:08,352
Better growth of the stock market

1577
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:10,400
In his first hundred days of his second term

1578
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:12,448
How far is Dhaka dick Alex

1579
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:16,032
Like your own stats there the guy who you hate

1580
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:19,104
Is better than your guy

1581
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:20,896
It's insane

1582
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,688
Why doesn't anyone look this up

1583
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:24,736
Why do outlets look this up

1584
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,040
I know gives a

1585
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:29,600
Goddamn f*** about whether or not something is true

1586
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:31,648
I was I was talking my dad

1587
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:33,696
And it was just literally like

1588
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:36,256
Everything is fake news

1589
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:43,168
That's that's abdicated your responsibility is a human being

1590
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:45,472
Responsibility

1591
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:49,568
It's not food

1592
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:51,872
Media's responsibility right all the time

1593
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:53,920
Responsibility

1594
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:58,272
It's every

1595
01:21:58,528 --> 01:21:59,040
Citizens

1596
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:02,624
Responsibility to engage with news that you get

1597
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:05,440
Don't trust

1598
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:06,464
Look into it

1599
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:08,512
Who everyone is just giving up on that

1600
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:10,560
There is there is something about

1601
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:13,888
I will never remember the quote and I'm probably going

1602
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:14,912
To paraphrase

1603
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,704
Screw everything up

1604
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:17,728
Without a name

1605
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:19,008
Informed citizenry

1606
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:20,800
Christy cannot fly

1607
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:21,824
Shakespeare

1608
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:30,528
It's one of the founding fathers

1609
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:35,136
Where was Cooper

1610
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:38,976
Clip

1611
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:41,024
Just overall Alex not getting the point

1612
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:42,048
Pokey toberman

1613
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,072
Video

1614
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:50,496
He is literally scared

1615
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:53,824
These people are crazy they thought they ran America

1616
01:22:54,336 --> 01:23:00,480
Extra power strip

1617
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:03,040
Calling to kill

1618
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:06,624
Trump supporters

1619
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:10,976
Pluto

1620
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:16,608
Kill Everybody

1621
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,448
The right there

1622
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,240
Right there what happened

1623
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,848
What happened

1624
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:27,872
Hey

1625
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:29,152
Auntie Fee

1626
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:30,688
Kill everyone

1627
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:33,760
But what happened there was like Alex DeLong

1628
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:36,832
Was because Alex said that he reaches millions of people

1629
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:37,856
I need to be like

1630
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:40,928
OSHA

1631
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:44,000
So he got into his headspace

1632
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:46,048
Yeah I realize I don't know what

1633
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:48,096
Saying

1634
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:48,864
Twice

1635
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:51,168
Material

1636
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:54,240
So

1637
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,776
If you keep probably did

1638
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:56,800
Watch it twice

1639
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:59,104
But I think our larger issue is

1640
01:23:59,360 --> 01:23:59,872
Is that

1641
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:02,176
He met he doesn't have any comprehension

1642
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,456
Information

1643
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:09,856
Sympathy

1644
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:11,392
Broca's area in his brain

1645
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:12,160
Just damaged

1646
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:13,952
Like the idea of like

1647
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:15,744
You can't take in communication

1648
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,280
Appropriately

1649
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:21,120
It's possible that we could

1650
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:21,888
Even really

1651
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:24,192
Kind of speculate on because

1652
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:29,568
I don't know enough about it to have any I'd like to start a Kickstarter to get a CT scan

1653
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:33,408
And unlike many people in the

1654
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:34,944
Commentary industry

1655
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:39,552
I would prefer not to comment wildly on something I knows

1656
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:40,320
0 about

1657
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:46,976
Webster the Hallmark of our shows all of the stuff that you just said like a the different parts of that that brain

1658
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:51,584
There's a certain parts of the brain that responsible for ingoing and outgoing

1659
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:56,704
Absolutely agree with you

1660
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,496
Is Brandon

1661
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:02,848
One-to-many of putting some other dudes into a coma

1662
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:04,128
Situation

1663
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:05,408
So back to

1664
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:12,320
Disagrees with it was a war with Russia in Russian

1665
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,904
Shred

1666
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:19,744
I'm a military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over

1667
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:23,584
Russian

1668
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:38,176
When people remain in this is the resistance

1669
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:43,296
What is the weather

1670
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:45,088
Entities

1671
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:48,416
Entireties as

1672
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:53,792
Gchq and MI6

1673
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:16,832
That is the problem

1674
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:32,192
Call David Hall

1675
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:50,368
That makes me happy that's like I know I can suck on a lozenge we're going to break I'm going to come to f****** text thing

1676
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:56,512
That's some classic Alex Jones right there

1677
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:59,072
This the rest of this episode is classic

1678
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:00,096
Wasp

1679
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:01,888
Like he's media criticism

1680
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:04,448
I don't want you to

1681
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:06,240
I do want you to your stopwatch out

1682
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:09,824
I don't want you to count out loud over the eclipse

1683
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:13,408
How long it takes him to interrupt but it's

1684
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:19,808
Buckwild and the reason I put my hand up

1685
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:20,576
To play

1686
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:22,880
Like Keith Olbermann intro

1687
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:24,928
Right because he replays it

1688
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,232
And interrupt the f*** out of it

1689
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:28,768
And I wanted everyone to be able to

1690
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:31,328
But hear what he was saying in a coherent sentence

1691
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:32,096
Book

1692
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:35,680
If you just take Alex's analysis you'll never know what he was actually saying

1693
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:38,496
Like

1694
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:41,824
Before I even thought about Alex listening to that alderman

1695
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:42,848
Is

1696
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:43,616
That is

1697
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:44,640
Oberman

1698
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:45,664
Barry Rec

1699
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:51,040
Capricious about Russian

1700
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:51,808
Scum take

1701
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:52,576
Taking over the Alexa

1702
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:55,648
Is very much a

1703
01:27:56,160 --> 01:28:00,256
Couple months back

1704
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:01,536
Just getting it now

1705
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:02,560
No he

1706
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:09,216
I think we just didn't cover it.

1707
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:11,264
He didn't tee off like he did

1708
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,288
No I think

1709
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,336
I think one of the things that

1710
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:16,128
Get me about all of this

1711
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:16,896
Debate

1712
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:17,664
And all of the

1713
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:19,712
Is that

1714
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,248
Nobody is

1715
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,040
Clearly delineate

1716
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:24,832
That the Russian

1717
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:25,600
People are

1718
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:26,368
Not

1719
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,136
Problem

1720
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:28,672
It is

1721
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:29,696
Very

1722
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:30,464
A few people

1723
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:31,744
In the Russian government

1724
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:33,024
It is

1725
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:33,792
Very few

1726
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:35,840
In the United States

1727
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:38,656
Like these are his f****** Alec

1728
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:40,960
It is not

1729
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:41,728
People

1730
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:45,312
Well they are people I mean like

1731
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:49,920
America is at war with Russia

1732
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:51,968
What's

1733
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:54,272
What's going on

1734
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:56,064
Is the Russian

1735
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:58,112
Pro-america

1736
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:05,280
And nobody cares about all of the people living in America or you got it twisted

1737
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,888
Neutral

1738
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,704
You're not getting involved

1739
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:16,032
So all of this is

1740
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:17,568
Because guys like

1741
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:18,336
Keith Olbermann

1742
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:20,384
Always boiled it down

1743
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:21,664
Nation yeah

1744
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,688
And it is not

1745
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:23,968
No that's why I don't

1746
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:26,528
Defend Keith Olbermann

1747
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:27,552
A bit wrong

1748
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:31,136
If I had to side with one

1749
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:33,184
I think the goals of Keith Olbermann

1750
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:36,512
Better-than-expected

1751
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:40,352
But I don't I still am absolutely his rhetoric is a little bit on him

1752
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:42,656
But just like we were talking about earlier

1753
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:44,960
That is that is the question

1754
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,520
We all know that there's some in

1755
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:50,080
How do we solve this problem

1756
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:51,104
Without also

1757
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,384
Sparking a war

1758
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:56,736
Waterman's overman's goals

1759
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:58,784
I get are the same as

1760
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:06,464
The meats

1761
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:07,744
Have to declare

1762
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:08,512
War

1763
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:11,584
Well I don't know I do

1764
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:13,632
Yes

1765
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:14,400
Weed

1766
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:16,704
Don't have proof

1767
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:19,008
That would justify a war

1768
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:23,104
But there is active involvement

1769
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,384
With

1770
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,152
Foreign power

1771
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:28,480
I think that we just have to suck it up

1772
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:29,248
We have to go to

1773
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:30,784
Like I think it's

1774
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:31,808
Terrible outcome

1775
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:38,720
Man that's a long conversation between you and maybe we'll do that all therapy

1776
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:45,120
Is already shaping up to be a seven-and-a-half hour-long episode as it is

1777
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:46,144
Snake salafi

1778
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:52,288
Already called for a revolution Kevin murderer

1779
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:54,848
The Justified

1780
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:56,128
British mortified

1781
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:57,920
Execution

1782
01:30:58,176 --> 01:30:59,456
Very different from America

1783
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:00,992
I would say

1784
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:02,016
If

1785
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:03,040
We can't

1786
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:05,344
Get undue influence out

1787
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:07,136
Of all our body politic

1788
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:08,672
Check without a war

1789
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:09,696
We have to go to war

1790
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:12,000
Because the alternative is the rosian of Art

1791
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,792
Government

1792
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:15,840
Believes everything

1793
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:20,192
Problem is that we have no moral High Ground whatsoever

1794
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:23,776
None will ever have we've done it

1795
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:26,080
Exactly what Russia has done.

1796
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:28,896
The real reason that we are angry is not be

1797
01:31:29,152 --> 01:31:30,432
Because of the

1798
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:31,456
The doing of it it

1799
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:32,224
It's that it happening

1800
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,760
But that's human

1801
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:38,880
No I know you understand that there isn't any

1802
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:40,672
An internal logic to

1803
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:41,440
To declare war

1804
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:44,000
I don't want to make the argument of like America first

1805
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:45,536
Cuz I'm not on that bandwagon

1806
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:48,608
But like if someone punches me way more

1807
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:49,632
Like us

1808
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:52,192
Like I feel that more than someone punched you

1809
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:53,984
I'd be empathic and I wouldn't

1810
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,264
Enjoyed

1811
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,824
Right

1812
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:03,200
I wouldn't like that

1813
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:05,248
I have to respond somehow

1814
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:07,040
Probably by running away

1815
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:08,320
Strangely enough

1816
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:10,880
This is one area where I'm going to go

1817
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:11,904
Full religion

1818
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:12,672
Oh boy

1819
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:16,256
There is a reason that Jesus

1820
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:17,280
Has resonated

1821
01:32:18,048 --> 01:32:18,816
Throughout time

1822
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:19,840
It sure is f*** isn't

1823
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:21,888
The Bible like

1824
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:23,168
Fully subscribed

1825
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:24,448
The philosophy of

1826
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:26,496
Look Russia did this

1827
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:27,264
We correct

1828
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:29,056
Look like

1829
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:30,336
Here's here's my

1830
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:31,360
It let me put it to you this way

1831
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:33,920
All right here's my response to 9/11

1832
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:35,968
We build the Tower

1833
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:36,736
The exact

1834
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:41,088
There's no record

1835
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:45,440
Of their doing them doing nothing

1836
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:48,512
But that's the point I don't know what they want

1837
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:49,280
Is Oscar

1838
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:50,304
To react in this

1839
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:56,448
What I don't disagree with you in terms of 9/11 but we're getting off track is that

1840
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,496
What I'm saying is

1841
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,080
If there is no way to correct this

1842
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:02,848
Without

1843
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:04,128
Triggering a war

1844
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:08,992
If there is a way to correct this with rabbit that's

1845
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:10,784
The preferable

1846
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,856
Bedford where you and I

1847
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:15,392
We would like to

1848
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:16,160
To be happen

1849
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:17,440
Right but

1850
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:18,976
Because of the exist

1851
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:21,536
Doberman

1852
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:23,072
It seems incredibly unlikely

1853
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,888
Conversation for another time

1854
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:27,168
Alex

1855
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,192
Have some thoughts

1856
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:35,104
The treasonous people

1857
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,920
Covid-19

1858
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:42,784
Absolute organized crime treason espionage

1859
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:49,952
Organization

1860
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:53,280
Three different things a lot of things

1861
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:54,304
Squad

1862
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:06,848
Years ago

1863
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:11,456
Now hold on this is this is the foundation

1864
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:14,528
Foundation Alex Belize but if you commit treason

1865
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:16,320
If you trying

1866
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:17,344
Induce

1867
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:19,392
People to take over our government

1868
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:22,720
Do you mean like saying that the Russians should info

1869
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:24,768
Only implied that earlier

1870
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:25,536
Nothing

1871
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:31,936
Real

1872
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:35,264
Costco

1873
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:38,592
My my

1874
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:39,616
Peacenik

1875
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:46,272
Alex Jones

1876
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:47,296
Very similar to

1877
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:50,368
That I am but for a different guy

1878
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:54,720
Yeah exactly that's

1879
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:56,000
Headspace

1880
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,304
Let's move on a little bit

1881
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:07,776
TV shows

1882
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:13,408
And he wants to sit here

1883
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:19,040
Look at how sweet

1884
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:21,600
Isn't running the government

1885
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:24,416
We

1886
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:42,848
World is country

1887
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:47,712
This guy is not an American this is a dirtbag liar thinks he's better than you

1888
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:53,600
Sagittarius

1889
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:59,744
What part of the narrative but also I just want to point out that in the past episode

1890
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:06,144
South

1891
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,192
But this one particular

1892
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:11,008
He also gave a speech at the Alamo couple years back

1893
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:13,568
Diaper

1894
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:14,848
Mark Dice

1895
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:18,944
The narrative

1896
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,528
The bitter clingers

1897
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:27,136
He thinks he's better than you think he's better than

1898
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:32,256
That's when people are going to latch onto a

1899
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:34,304
He's yelling at you because he thinks he

1900
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,072
He's better than you

1901
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:37,632
I'm yelling at you because I love you

1902
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:38,400
Right

1903
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:40,960
The vets

1904
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:44,288
Divorce stepdad situation going

1905
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:47,616
I hate you I hate you because I love you

1906
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:49,664
Now we're going to rain

1907
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:50,944
The section of the show where

1908
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:53,760
Every clip

1909
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:55,296
Immediately

1910
01:36:56,576 --> 01:37:02,464
Hold on I'm going to let you talk real quick let me let me let you finish

1911
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:04,256
Portcullis

1912
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:08,096
I've been in this is the resistance

1913
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:17,824
We are the resistance to use the globalist America

1914
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:24,480
The resistance

1915
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:29,344
The first instance of teleprompter

1916
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:31,904
Threats teleprompting ask

1917
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:34,464
So just remember that keep track that's one

1918
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:36,000
But also like

1919
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:38,304
Come on man

1920
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,608
Resistance

1921
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:42,400
You nobody's ever thought about it before

1922
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:43,936
Well except Wilshire

1923
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:46,496
Almost every piece

1924
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:52,896
Insufficient funds

1925
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:54,176
It was the result

1926
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:56,992
Right now over minutes

1927
01:37:58,784 --> 01:37:59,552
And now we can

1928
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:02,368
That sound

1929
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:06,464
Don't say too much about that

1930
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:07,744
K very

1931
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,304
Okay

1932
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,840
And very quick

1933
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:12,864
A little bit threatened

1934
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:34,624
Don't want to sell their country

1935
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:41,792
You're appealing to people that just help

1936
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:43,840
Election dumbass

1937
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:46,400
Everything

1938
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:48,192
Understand

1939
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:51,264
So hold on

1940
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,032
Helps

1941
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:53,312
Trump get elected

1942
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:54,080
Because they're sick

1943
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:55,104
People like over

1944
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:55,872
It's irrelevant

1945
01:38:56,128 --> 01:39:02,272
Only 85% of people don't want their kids to live in poverty

1946
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:08,160
Very weird fairy ways to make sure the kids

1947
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:11,232
15% of

1948
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:14,304
The population knows that 85%

1949
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:16,864
Want to make sure

1950
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:17,888
That

1951
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:19,424
School lunches

1952
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:20,448
Our health

1953
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:22,496
Contain

1954
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:23,264
That's

1955
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,032
Nobody

1956
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,568
That's nobody in the GOP

1957
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:27,616
Thrown around

1958
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:28,896
That's a

1959
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:32,992
Five percent Nation talk right there

1960
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:37,344
You're a pile of steaming.

1961
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:38,368
Okay

1962
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:50,912
You better pray there's a civil war because I guarantee you you're the one calling for all this

1963
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:53,472
You son

1964
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:13,184
Alex Jones is really mad

1965
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:14,208
Yeah

1966
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:16,512
Someone is

1967
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:21,888
To do with it has nothing to do with

1968
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:23,936
Anything that he says it's all about

1969
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:25,216
Very personal

1970
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,288
Email to the left

1971
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:33,152
Alex

1972
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:36,480
Is a man doing a stick of

1973
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:37,760
Yelling about

1974
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:39,296
Throwing egg

1975
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:43,904
Alpha male

1976
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:46,720
Really doesn't yell that much

1977
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:49,792
No but that's not that's not the point

1978
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:52,608
Babe maybe everybody is yelling office

1979
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:53,632
Betfair

1980
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:55,168
Entirely

1981
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:57,728
But the point is at 8

1982
01:40:57,984 --> 01:40:58,496
He's not yelling

1983
01:40:58,752 --> 01:40:59,264
Prius V

1984
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:00,544
Forcefully

1985
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:01,568
Direct

1986
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:09,760
Aboard is left of the Free World

1987
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:12,064
This next

1988
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:13,856
Is Astoria

1989
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:14,624
Two parts

1990
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:15,904
The first

1991
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,440
Is from the next

1992
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:18,976
Thing he says when he comes back

1993
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,584
Will be horribly embarrassing for Alec

1994
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:28,960
Tweety

1995
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:34,080
We the citizens of the United States of America

1996
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:39,200
We need to release your information

1997
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:40,736
Your conscience

1998
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:50,464
Noreen the controller

1999
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:55,072
Republic

2000
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:57,888
He's from the Constitution

2001
01:41:58,144 --> 01:42:00,192
How

2002
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:07,104
You can't just say it's a coup

2003
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:09,408
Elected

2004
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:17,856
Version of reality

2005
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:22,464
Inversion of reality I think that Alex Jones

2006
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,000
Really needs to stop

2007
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:24,768
Saying

2008
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:25,536
2

2009
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:27,584
Cool cuz here is a clip

2010
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:32,960
Text Alex Jones

2011
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:37,312
What do you think is really going on here

2012
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:40,128
You know Alex

2013
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:41,920
You've been together

2014
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:46,272
Was so obvious

2015
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:51,904
You show

2016
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:05,472
Ecstasy drug

2017
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:10,080
Ouija

2018
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:12,128
Intelligence community

2019
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:22,624
It was done through emails

2020
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:29,024
To Julian Assange I will not name individuals

2021
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:34,144
Foreign Russia was

2022
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:40,800
Respectful

2023
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:44,128
Union

2024
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:50,528
Anything they want

2025
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:53,344
So can we do 2

2026
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:04,864
1 billion

2027
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:15,872
Alex will not interrupt but it's so funny cuz been for like the next five minutes there's

2028
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:17,152
Just some like assistance

2029
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:22,016
Scampering around trying to close

2030
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:27,392
Kind of like a little bit of physical comedy 100% not intended when I loved

2031
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:33,792
Just like this this guy tries on the Legacy

2032
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:40,704
It's hilarious that fantastic

2033
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:55,296
On this issue but the bottom line is freezing level three

2034
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,864
Secretary of Defense

2035
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:10,400
The White House

2036
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:15,008
In the White House Homeland Security military

2037
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:18,336
Department of interior

2038
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:20,384
But you get what you saying

2039
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:21,152
Yeah

2040
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:23,456
Like I I don't

2041
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:25,504
I don't necessarily

2042
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:26,528
Believe

2043
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:28,064
All of

2044
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:29,600
Steve pieczenik stories

2045
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:32,928
He's coming on Alex Jones Show

2046
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:35,488
Is congratulating him

2047
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:38,304
For hypothetically performing a coup

2048
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,840
To take the presidency

2049
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:41,376
And place people

2050
01:45:41,632 --> 01:45:43,936
In certain offices

2051
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,776
Is Mike Flynn

2052
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:49,568
I've sent

2053
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:52,896
Registered as a foreign agent

2054
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:56,992
Counter-coup how great could his wedding have been about the people

2055
01:45:57,504 --> 01:45:59,296
It that were involved in his coup

2056
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:01,344
That he would not would he have not known

2057
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:03,648
When was an employee of Turkey

2058
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:05,184
What do you not know that

2059
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:10,048
Level the level of ignorance

2060
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:11,840
Could could

2061
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:15,936
That's a good question

2062
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:19,520
Shattuck have not known the plan was working for turkey

2063
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:21,312
Is that possible

2064
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:23,104
I don't know

2065
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:24,384
I don't know

2066
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,152
I don't either

2067
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:26,432
The fact that he says

2068
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:30,784
And you're right he was mentioning working with Julian Assange

2069
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:34,624
So like even there is a foreign interest Alex

2070
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:37,184
I've always said Julian Assange

2071
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,976
Not American citizen

2072
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,792
0

2073
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:44,352
Unduly influence

2074
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:45,888
Based on

2075
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:51,008
What we've already established about Alex's beliefs about what happens when you

2076
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:53,312
Alex Jones

2077
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:54,592
Mike Flynn

2078
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:55,360
Kellogg

2079
01:46:57,408 --> 01:47:03,296
All should be hung in between.

2080
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:05,344
Condescending

2081
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,624
No you're exactly right

2082
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:09,952
So they're fine with it if it's Julian Assange

2083
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:13,024
Is leaking this ship that was clearly given to them by a

2084
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:13,792
A foreign agent

2085
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:15,840
But if Overman says

2086
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:16,864
Foreign agent

2087
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:18,144
Please leak this s***

2088
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:18,912
Then

2089
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:24,288
Also cockamamie and it's all an invertebrate

2090
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:27,360
This is a complete inverter reality

2091
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:28,896
It's Sonu

2092
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:31,968
So weird to not have a team in this fight but hate both

2093
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:34,784
Yeah like it's so f****** insane for me because I'm like

2094
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:35,552
I don't

2095
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:37,344
Fully support with Oberman say

2096
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:39,392
So this is

2097
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:40,416
The central question

2098
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:41,184
2

2099
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:42,208
My response

2100
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:42,976
The Overman

2101
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:45,280
Is it worth

2102
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:46,048
While

2103
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:47,072
2

2104
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:48,608
Get rid of

2105
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:49,376
Trump

2106
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:51,424
By then devaluing

2107
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:57,824
Like you see what I'm saying right there

2108
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:00,128
Yeah

2109
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:05,504
What is what is

2110
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,576
Is it better to get rid of

2111
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:10,880
By any means or is it

2112
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:12,672
Is there a way to get rid of trump

2113
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:13,440
The right

2114
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:19,840
So we get rid of Trump by vissla

2115
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,656
Right so then we put in the next

2116
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:24,704
Which right now would be

2117
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,240
But if there is a leak

2118
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:29,056
We have to assume that it goes to

2119
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:30,336
The speaker lighthouse

2120
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:32,640
Oakley hats

2121
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:40,064
There's some indications that he released was having conversations about money s*** with kislyak

2122
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:46,976
Phuc yea

2123
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:48,256
Strategic campaign

2124
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:49,792
Group right

2125
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:52,096
But that was in association with stuff that was happening

2126
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:53,632
313

2127
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:56,448
Sara Lee might be a bit of a Smokescreen

2128
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:57,984
And I don't want to buy into

2129
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:59,264
Conspiracy theories

2130
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,824
Because even though we do a conspiracy theory

2131
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:06,432
Yeah it is entirely possible

2132
01:49:09,504 --> 01:49:11,552
Timing is also very

2133
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:13,088
Suspect and the fact

2134
01:49:13,344 --> 01:49:14,112
That the guy

2135
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:19,232
He has connections to Rodger Stone and Paul manafort

2136
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:22,048
Call used to work for their firm

2137
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:22,816
Their firm

2138
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:24,864
And on top of that

2139
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:25,632
To campaign group

2140
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:26,656
Has

2141
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:30,752
I don't know if I can fully explain it necessarily

2142
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:32,032
Jeep

2143
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:33,056
Robert Mercer

2144
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:33,824
Sartorius

2145
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:35,616
Robert Mercer

2146
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:38,432
That campaign the Strategic campaign group

2147
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:39,712
Created

2148
01:49:40,224 --> 01:49:40,736
A political Act

2149
01:49:40,992 --> 01:49:42,272
Committee for

2150
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:43,296
Bubba Bubba

2151
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:44,832
Fake mustache

2152
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:46,624
Un

2153
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:48,672
Guy for

2154
01:49:48,928 --> 01:49:55,072
Bolton political action committee for John Bolton and the only person

2155
01:49:55,328 --> 01:49:56,352
You donated to it was

2156
01:49:56,608 --> 01:49:58,656
Mercer and it was consistent donation

2157
01:49:58,912 --> 01:49:59,936
The $500,000

2158
01:50:01,984 --> 01:50:03,520
Mercer is

2159
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:07,104
One of the immerser got Trump elect

2160
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:16,576
It looks

2161
01:50:16,832 --> 01:50:17,344
It's like

2162
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:18,624
I had something

2163
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:24,768
To do with Mercer and Cambridge Cambridge analytica

2164
01:50:25,024 --> 01:50:28,864
Watching us influences on the campaign

2165
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:31,168
There's Russia stuff on the side

2166
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:40,896
Dubious there Debbie wild research Cambridge analytica the memorial

2167
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:42,688
Taking over

2168
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:48,576
Earlier

2169
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:51,904
To get rid of

2170
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:53,440
Trump in a way that kills

2171
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:57,280
Right maybe underway the wave

2172
01:50:59,072 --> 01:51:00,352
5

2173
01:51:01,632 --> 01:51:02,144
Just rotten

2174
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:03,424
Yeah that's

2175
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:04,704
But but

2176
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:06,240
The problem therein lies

2177
01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:07,520
If Overman does

2178
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:09,568
Then

2179
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:11,872
If it is foreign agent

2180
01:51:12,384 --> 01:51:13,152
Enough

2181
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:13,920
Full on

2182
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:14,688
Chaos mode

2183
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:22,624
I'd like

2184
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:23,392
World War

2185
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:26,720
That's not war with Russia War

2186
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:28,512
With every intelligence agency

2187
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:29,792
Who knows

2188
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:30,816
Who's doing what

2189
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:31,584
And when

2190
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:32,864
Nym

2191
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:34,400
When it's like

2192
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:36,192
What will they do with this

2193
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:37,472
I think

2194
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,288
You who me

2195
01:51:43,872 --> 01:51:47,712
Here's what I'm trying to say

2196
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:49,504
And frankly Alex Jones

2197
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:54,880
Creon what it is

2198
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:58,208
Or how did you mean

2199
01:51:58,464 --> 01:52:01,280
Sega framing this metaphor

2200
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:02,304
There

2201
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:07,424
Like there's a bottle does a glass bottle of ketchup that's falling off the counter and you know that it's going to break when

2202
01:52:08,192 --> 01:52:09,216
Haha so

2203
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:11,264
Our response to it would be

2204
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:13,312
Either try and catch it

2205
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:15,872
And clean it up

2206
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:24,064
You know Oberman might his response might be throw bottle of mustard at it

2207
01:52:26,112 --> 01:52:26,624
Let's just

2208
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:27,648
Rebecca

2209
01:52:33,024 --> 01:52:36,096
Okay I understand what it is

2210
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:39,680
We are

2211
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:41,472
The fact that Alex Jones

2212
01:52:41,728 --> 01:52:43,520
Legitimately for the last

2213
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:44,800
6 months

2214
01:52:45,056 --> 01:52:45,824
2 a year

2215
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:47,104
Has been pitching

2216
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:49,408
An entire narrative on his show

2217
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:51,200
It has to do with a

2218
01:52:51,456 --> 01:52:54,528
A counter-coup

2219
01:52:54,784 --> 01:52:56,832
Hillary Clinton

2220
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:58,112
George Soros

2221
01:52:58,624 --> 01:52:59,136
And broccoli

2222
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:02,464
Against an imaginary

2223
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:03,232
That is just

2224
01:53:03,488 --> 01:53:04,768
A regular Coupe

2225
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:06,816
Now if you can

2226
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:07,584
Steeplechase

2227
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:09,888
Wants to come on podcast I'd love to talk to her

2228
01:53:10,656 --> 01:53:11,424
That's number one

2229
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:12,192
Number two

2230
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:17,312
The first question I would have is please prove that there was a coup going on

2231
01:53:17,568 --> 01:53:18,848
Cuz if there was

2232
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:20,640
That makes things a little bit

2233
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:22,432
Yeah that makes

2234
01:53:23,712 --> 01:53:24,480
Defensible and I think

2235
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:30,368
I don't think I don't think there was the original coup

2236
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:32,160
I think it was hatred of Hillary

2237
01:53:33,696 --> 01:53:34,208
Conservative

2238
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:36,256
We got to do what we got to do

2239
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:38,048
Right kind of mentality

2240
01:53:39,072 --> 01:53:39,584
I'm so

2241
01:53:44,704 --> 01:53:46,240
He is not a real great

2242
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:47,264
God

2243
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:48,288
Dammit

2244
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:50,080
His ideas

2245
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:50,848
We were just

2246
01:53:51,104 --> 01:53:53,920
That mean we were just doing our coup

2247
01:53:54,944 --> 01:53:55,712
Whatever you were doing

2248
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:57,248
No matter how effective it is

2249
01:53:57,504 --> 01:53:59,040
No matter how much you're lying about it

2250
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:00,064
You had

2251
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:01,088
The intention

2252
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:02,880
Of overthrowing our government

2253
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:07,744
Agreed now just because you were overthrowing the government while the government was

2254
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,536
Between Administration

2255
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:11,584
Doesn't really matter

2256
01:54:12,352 --> 01:54:13,120
Think you were overthrown

2257
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:14,400
Government for a good

2258
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:17,472
That's the biggest

2259
01:54:17,728 --> 01:54:19,520
That's the biggest issue when you start throwing

2260
01:54:19,776 --> 01:54:20,288
Cool around

2261
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:21,312
Is like

2262
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:23,360
Well it's fine

2263
01:54:23,872 --> 01:54:25,920
Because we did the coup for the right reasons

2264
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:29,760
Just validate

2265
01:54:30,016 --> 01:54:33,600
Anybody who wants to do is like that's vigilante justice

2266
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:34,880
The same way like

2267
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:38,464
We know he's guilty so that justifies us with doing anything

2268
01:54:40,256 --> 01:54:40,768
Becomes a purse

2269
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:48,192
Everybody's everything

2270
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:49,216
What they believe

2271
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:55,872
And you know what that's why this entire rhetoric of inverting reality is so dangerous

2272
01:54:56,128 --> 01:54:57,408
Because if I just make the Arkham

2273
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:59,200
You've inverted reality

2274
01:54:59,456 --> 01:55:01,248
Send

2275
01:55:01,504 --> 01:55:03,552
If I save it

2276
01:55:03,808 --> 01:55:06,368
You're completely wrong about everything regarding reality

2277
01:55:06,624 --> 01:55:07,648
Your

2278
01:55:07,904 --> 01:55:08,416
That it is

2279
01:55:10,976 --> 01:55:17,120
I call you a literal demon smells sulfur, coming off

2280
01:55:17,376 --> 01:55:21,472
I've heard reports it doesn't matter what I say doesn't matter what you say

2281
01:55:21,728 --> 01:55:22,752
You're a demon

2282
01:55:23,008 --> 01:55:27,872
Even on this like 40-something episodes into it now

2283
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:29,920
Like we hate Alex

2284
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:32,992
Put will give him credit when he makes a good point

2285
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:38,880
Like he's not incapable of telling the truth now he just seems to lie all the time

2286
01:55:39,136 --> 01:55:39,904
And that's the difference

2287
01:55:40,416 --> 01:55:41,952
I would never accuse him of

2288
01:55:42,464 --> 01:55:47,840
Like all he does is invert reality I pray he lies all the f****** something

2289
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:52,192
This is

2290
01:55:52,448 --> 01:55:53,728
Leads into the tree

2291
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:55,264
Like interesting

2292
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:56,800
Meaning meaning

2293
01:55:57,056 --> 01:55:59,104
Here is a

2294
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:01,664
And he lies almost like a

2295
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:02,688
F****** knife

2296
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:03,456
Directly

2297
01:56:04,992 --> 01:56:05,760
Break any kind

2298
01:56:06,528 --> 01:56:07,040
Continuity

2299
01:56:07,552 --> 01:56:10,880
So so long as you can lie in this certain

2300
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:11,648
Spot

2301
01:56:11,904 --> 01:56:13,184
You can never allow that

2302
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:14,464
Kind of continuity

2303
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:19,840
Agree with you

2304
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:20,864
I've been trying to

2305
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:27,264
The transition to a clip about inverting reality for about the last two minutes

2306
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:29,568
Are not strong

2307
01:56:29,824 --> 01:56:30,592
Rihanna has saved

2308
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:34,176
Inversion

2309
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:34,944
Reality

2310
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:37,248
Total inversion of reality

2311
01:56:37,504 --> 01:56:38,528
Father's Day

2312
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:52,864
At least in theory

2313
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:57,216
Investigation by the FBI

2314
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:09,760
The second president

2315
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:23,584
Rex Tillerson

2316
01:57:24,352 --> 01:57:26,912
Arise

2317
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:28,960
Global expert

2318
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:31,776
Who's working over 160 countries

2319
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:34,336
More.

2320
01:57:34,592 --> 01:57:35,616
Bull

2321
01:57:36,128 --> 01:57:38,944
How does a guy openly calling for foreign government

2322
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:43,552
Here's why that clip started with

2323
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:45,344
The inversion of reality

2324
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:47,392
And I cut it where I did

2325
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:49,184
Rex Tillerson

2326
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:50,720
Tillerson

2327
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:52,512
Is it tillison or tillers

2328
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:53,280
Tillerson

2329
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:54,048
Tillerson

2330
01:57:55,072 --> 01:57:55,584
Biggie

2331
01:57:56,608 --> 01:58:02,752
Has been an oil CEO who's been through a lot been to a lot of country

2332
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:04,800
That's not the same as

2333
01:58:05,056 --> 01:58:05,568
Diplomacy

2334
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:07,872
It's not

2335
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:11,200
Oil

2336
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:15,296
It's the same thing as diploma so you understand if I said I was an oil man

2337
01:58:25,024 --> 01:58:27,072
The inversion of reality is that like

2338
01:58:27,328 --> 01:58:29,888
He's worked in these countries you've been there

2339
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:33,984
The inversion of reality is out

2340
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:38,592
Pretending that he's qualified to be the Secretary of State cuz he's

2341
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:40,896
Talk to CEOs another country

2342
01:58:42,688 --> 01:58:43,200
That means nothing

2343
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:44,736
Ambassador

2344
01:58:49,344 --> 01:58:50,624
Metaphorize wow

2345
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:55,488
Maybe the worst thing anybody's ever said

2346
01:58:55,744 --> 01:58:56,256
I apologize

2347
01:58:57,280 --> 01:59:00,608
I'm so this next clip just get to the straight up

2348
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:33,632
Elite Class

2349
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:51,296
They are almost silent

2350
01:59:56,416 --> 01:59:56,928
Back it up

2351
01:59:58,976 --> 02:00:01,024
The only present 50-plus years

2352
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:06,656
I really wanted it

2353
02:00:06,912 --> 02:00:07,424
Stuck up there

2354
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:09,216
Is the only President in 50 years

2355
02:00:09,472 --> 02:00:10,496
To put plants in charge

2356
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:12,288
Absolutely true

2357
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:17,664
Get rid of all

2358
02:00:20,992 --> 02:00:22,016
A special interest

2359
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:23,808
All of the lobbyists

2360
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:32,000
Didn't do that

2361
02:00:49,152 --> 02:00:51,200
Chicken Alderman Ura

2362
02:00:51,456 --> 02:00:52,224
Speaker wires

2363
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:54,528
Let's

2364
02:00:54,784 --> 02:00:55,296
How much

2365
02:00:56,064 --> 02:00:59,904
Goldman Sachs

2366
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:03,488
If you really want to play this game first

2367
02:01:03,744 --> 02:01:04,256
We can

2368
02:01:06,048 --> 02:01:06,560
JPMorgan

2369
02:01:08,352 --> 02:01:09,120
17

2370
02:01:09,376 --> 02:01:10,656
$2000000

2371
02:01:10,912 --> 02:01:11,680
To Hillary Clinton

2372
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:14,496
Fred Goldman Sachs

2373
02:01:14,752 --> 02:01:18,848
500 million dollars over a million dollars from

2374
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:20,384
Write to Hillary Clinton

2375
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:22,688
To Trump as far as I

2376
02:01:22,944 --> 02:01:24,480
I can tell

2377
02:01:24,992 --> 02:01:27,296
That's not that much money for a big Bank

2378
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:29,344
To give to a presidential candidate

2379
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:32,416
University of California almost gave $2000000

2380
02:01:32,672 --> 02:01:33,184
Words to her

2381
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:39,840
Google alphabet Incorporated gave 1.5 million

2382
02:01:40,096 --> 02:01:41,376
EMILY's List

2383
02:01:44,704 --> 02:01:45,472
To get more

2384
02:01:45,728 --> 02:01:49,056
Women involved in politics

2385
02:01:49,312 --> 02:01:49,824
I have a list of them

2386
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:55,968
They gave 1.3 million Emily Brown above JPMorgan Chase

2387
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:57,248
Citigroup

2388
02:01:58,784 --> 02:02:01,088
Citigroup also gave

2389
02:02:01,344 --> 02:02:03,392
Yeah

2390
02:02:03,648 --> 02:02:05,440
Donators and this is

2391
02:02:05,696 --> 02:02:06,208
Through like

2392
02:02:06,976 --> 02:02:08,256
The Freedom of Information Act

2393
02:02:08,512 --> 02:02:10,048
All the stuff is public

2394
02:02:10,304 --> 02:02:13,376
His number-one donator is Renaissance Technologies

2395
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:16,960
They gave 15501001

2396
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:17,984
$600

2397
02:02:18,496 --> 02:02:20,032
That's a lot of money

2398
02:02:20,288 --> 02:02:20,800
Renaissance

2399
02:02:21,056 --> 02:02:21,824
What do they do

2400
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:28,224
You want to know what they do

2401
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:29,760
It's owned by Robert Mercer

2402
02:02:31,296 --> 02:02:34,112
Yeah we met

2403
02:02:34,368 --> 02:02:37,184
He's the guy who's responsible for the funding of Breitbart

2404
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:39,488
There is not a left

2405
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:42,304
He is the most

2406
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:43,072
Right wing

2407
02:02:43,584 --> 02:02:45,632
Okay you got me scared that I said left-wing

2408
02:02:45,888 --> 02:02:47,680
Oh I apologize

2409
02:02:47,936 --> 02:02:49,216
Correct

2410
02:02:49,472 --> 02:02:50,752
He is

2411
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:54,848
Curse of Steve Bannon is funded all kinds of things that he's been up to in the past

2412
02:02:55,872 --> 02:02:57,408
He's involved in Cambridge analytica

2413
02:02:57,664 --> 02:03:01,504
Technologies is a couple million dollars

2414
02:03:02,016 --> 02:03:05,344
The trumps campaign bit that holds self-funding

2415
02:03:05,856 --> 02:03:06,368
Canard

2416
02:03:06,624 --> 02:03:07,904
Of his campaign

2417
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:11,744
Of his own will absolutely

2418
02:03:12,512 --> 02:03:14,048
He already he already has

2419
02:03:17,376 --> 02:03:18,656
He made he made a name

2420
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:19,424
Investment

2421
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:23,264
The Chinese

2422
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:25,056
That alone will make him

2423
02:03:25,568 --> 02:03:26,080
Billions

2424
02:03:26,592 --> 02:03:30,688
Donator

2425
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:32,480
Paid

2426
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:36,832
Business administration

2427
02:03:37,344 --> 02:03:38,880
They gave 6 million

2428
02:03:39,136 --> 02:03:39,904
2000

2429
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:40,928
$700

2430
02:03:42,208 --> 02:03:43,232
So that

2431
02:03:43,488 --> 02:03:46,304
Might look like a little bit of pain

2432
02:03:46,816 --> 02:03:48,352
Also as much as

2433
02:03:48,608 --> 02:03:49,888
Understanding as I have

2434
02:03:50,144 --> 02:03:51,424
Of the pro wrestling business

2435
02:03:51,936 --> 02:03:54,240
Real reason why she would want to be in charge

2436
02:03:54,752 --> 02:03:55,264
Small businesses

2437
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:56,032
Association

2438
02:03:56,288 --> 02:03:57,056
Yeah

2439
02:03:57,312 --> 02:03:58,592
Because there is

2440
02:03:58,848 --> 02:03:59,616
Trim

2441
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:02,176
In pro wrestling towards the unionizing

2442
02:04:02,432 --> 02:04:02,944
The wrestler

2443
02:04:03,712 --> 02:04:05,504
They're not employees

2444
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:08,576
They're free contract

2445
02:04:08,832 --> 02:04:10,624
Yeah they don't get insurance

2446
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:12,416
Pay for their own transportation

2447
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:13,952
Between events

2448
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:16,512
And stuff like that their independent contractors

2449
02:04:16,768 --> 02:04:18,816
And the WWE has a vested

2450
02:04:19,328 --> 02:04:21,120
And them never becoming employees

2451
02:04:22,912 --> 02:04:23,424
Dollars

2452
02:04:23,936 --> 02:04:24,704
Ensure them

2453
02:04:25,984 --> 02:04:30,592
Sporteverywhere all the time right

2454
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:33,408
365

2455
02:04:33,664 --> 02:04:34,688
For all of these people

2456
02:04:34,944 --> 02:04:35,968
You'd be insane

2457
02:04:36,224 --> 02:04:42,368
It is already in saying that they're not as a business practice

2458
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:44,160
Obviously think it's

2459
02:04:44,416 --> 02:04:45,440
Worth it to pay trumpsta

2460
02:04:45,696 --> 02:04:46,464
6 million dollars

2461
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:48,512
And then on the off-chance he gets in

2462
02:04:49,792 --> 02:04:50,304
She becomes

2463
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:51,584
The head of a small business

2464
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,888
Of course of course it's worth it

2465
02:04:54,144 --> 02:04:55,424
Six million dollars would be

2466
02:04:55,936 --> 02:04:59,008
What one year of their WWE travel

2467
02:04:59,264 --> 02:05:01,056
Target close

2468
02:05:01,312 --> 02:05:02,848
They have a roster that's like

2469
02:05:03,104 --> 02:05:03,872
How many they have

2470
02:05:04,384 --> 02:05:05,920
SmackDown and Raw

2471

They have their pay-per-view people are in different cities

2477

Play Future roster is like 40 50

2479
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:27,168
Does a hundreds of people you got to pay for transportation

2480
02:05:27,424 --> 02:05:29,216
Not including I mean I don't know what the

2481
02:05:29,472 --> 02:05:30,496
The situation is with their like

2482
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:33,824
And the people who actually do the building of the

2483
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:36,128
As it were

2484
02:05:36,384 --> 02:05:37,408
I don't know about that part

2485
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:38,432
But like

2486
02:05:38,944 --> 02:05:39,712
Yeah took Millions

2487
02:05:39,968 --> 02:05:40,736
Nothing nothing

2488
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:46,368
Oh there's a God damn

2489
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:48,416
Global

2490
02:05:48,672 --> 02:05:49,184
People trying to

2491
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:51,232
It's over so interesting

2492
02:05:52,512 --> 02:05:53,024
Thunder

2493
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:54,048
Izakaya

2494
02:05:54,304 --> 02:05:56,352
Business called GHB

2495
02:05:57,376 --> 02:05:57,888
And they gave

2496
02:05:58,144 --> 02:06:00,960
5005000 + $400

2497
02:06:01,472 --> 02:06:01,984
The Trump campaign

2498
02:06:03,008 --> 02:06:04,800
That doesn't ring a bell necessarily.

2499
02:06:05,312 --> 02:06:08,640
That is no

2500
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:14,784
That was a man who in 1991 paid a $30,000 fine for laundering campaign

2501
02:06:15,296 --> 02:06:17,344
The support of the Incorporation

2502
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:19,392
California is a city

2503
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:21,184
And the reason he did that

2504
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:22,720
It's cuz he had a bunch of

2505
02:06:22,976 --> 02:06:23,744
Property

2506
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,816
Taxes will go up if I became

2507
02:06:27,072 --> 02:06:28,096
Incorporated as a city

2508
02:06:28,352 --> 02:06:30,144
And there would be all sorts of

2509
02:06:30,656 --> 02:06:32,448
Registrations all kinds of

2510
02:06:32,704 --> 02:06:34,752
Things you have to follow also to rule

2511
02:06:35,008 --> 02:06:35,776
And so what are you doing

2512
02:06:36,032 --> 02:06:37,056
Is he at a big company

2513
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:39,104
He had his employees donate

2514
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:40,640
To this Thai

2515
02:06:40,896 --> 02:06:46,272
Incorporation cost

2516
02:06:46,528 --> 02:06:49,856
Now he is still active to the 3rd $1,000

2517
02:06:50,112 --> 02:06:51,136
F****** nothing

2518
02:06:54,208 --> 02:06:55,744
Giving money to

2519
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,048
Nope

2520
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:02,912
Curbed

2521
02:07:03,168 --> 02:07:03,936
Dot-com

2522
02:07:05,472 --> 02:07:05,984
About

2523
02:07:06,496 --> 02:07:07,264
Geoffrey Palmer

2524
02:07:08,032 --> 02:07:12,128
Is Biltmore apartments in downtown Los Angeles than anyone else

2525
02:07:12,640 --> 02:07:13,152
More than

2526
02:07:13,408 --> 02:07:13,920
3000

2527
02:07:14,176 --> 02:07:15,200
And they're all f****** Tarot

2528
02:07:15,968 --> 02:07:19,296
His Squad nearly identical fortresses with embarrassing names like the

2529
02:07:19,552 --> 02:07:20,832
Visconti and the Medici

2530
02:07:21,088 --> 02:07:23,136
Aren't just ugly although they are very ugly

2531
02:07:23,392 --> 02:07:24,160
They're vacuum

2532
02:07:24,416 --> 02:07:28,000
Designed to suck the life out of a neighborhood that has worked so hard to become

2533
02:07:28,256 --> 02:07:28,768
The past decade

2534
02:07:30,304 --> 02:07:35,168
So basically what he does comes into makes cookie cutter

2535
02:07:35,424 --> 02:07:36,192
Remix project

2536
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:39,008
That's very

2537
02:07:39,264 --> 02:07:40,032
Expensive project

2538
02:07:40,544 --> 02:07:43,360
Cheese that specifically are designed

2539
02:07:43,872 --> 02:07:44,384
To keep

2540
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:45,408
Affordable housing

2541
02:07:45,664 --> 02:07:46,688
Course

2542
02:07:46,944 --> 02:07:47,968
So

2543
02:07:48,224 --> 02:07:51,040
This this article goes on to give some of his worst-hit

2544
02:07:51,808 --> 02:07:53,088
I hear a couple of

2545
02:07:53,856 --> 02:07:57,184
Palmer wrote in an email to Los Angeles mag

2546
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:03,584
The buildings which are collectively referred to barf

2547
02:08:04,352 --> 02:08:05,376
Has the Renaissance collect

2548
02:08:06,144 --> 02:08:12,032
He is totally kind of italianate architecture style is

2549
02:08:12,288 --> 02:08:13,568
Actually historical

2550
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:17,152
The Italians actually settled before the Spanish and Chinese

2551
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:20,224
That of course is not true

2552
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:25,856
Spanish 1700

2553
02:08:27,392 --> 02:08:28,928
Wow

2554
02:08:29,184 --> 02:08:31,744
Complete inversion of reality

2555
02:08:32,256 --> 02:08:33,536
There's the Man responsible for

2556
02:08:33,792 --> 02:08:35,328
Destroying the very last building

2557
02:08:36,352 --> 02:08:38,144
Downtown neighborhood of Bunker Hill

2558
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:41,216
The city wiped out most of the neighborhood which it deemed a slum

2559
02:08:41,728 --> 02:08:42,240
Starting in the night

2560
02:08:42,496 --> 02:08:43,008
50

2561
02:08:43,264 --> 02:08:44,288
But there was one

2562
02:08:44,544 --> 02:08:45,056
1800

2563
02:08:45,568 --> 02:08:47,616
1800 Queen Anne house left on

2564
02:08:47,872 --> 02:08:49,664
Cesar Chavez Avenue and Figueroa Street

2565
02:08:50,176 --> 02:08:51,200
In the late 1980s

2566
02:08:51,456 --> 02:08:52,480
When Plummer began

2567
02:08:52,736 --> 02:08:54,272
Work there on the Orsini

2568
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:56,064
It was called the geese house

2569
02:08:56,576 --> 02:08:58,368
It was protected under preservation laws

2570
02:08:58,624 --> 02:08:59,648
Their plans in place

2571
02:08:59,904 --> 02:09:01,440
To move the house to Angelino Heights

2572
02:09:01,696 --> 02:09:03,232
A workers demolished

2573
02:09:04,256 --> 02:09:05,024
Lyrics

2574
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:07,328
A bulldozer had accidentally backed into it

2575
02:09:07,584 --> 02:09:08,352
Making it unsafe

2576
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:10,144
It gets even more screwed up

2577
02:09:10,656 --> 02:09:13,728
When the city suggested it might hold Palmer accountable for his actions

2578
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:15,264
He sued the city

2579
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:17,824
And he only had to pay $200,000

2580
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:18,592
Provided some

2581
02:09:18,848 --> 02:09:19,872
Public mitigation

2582
02:09:21,152 --> 02:09:24,992
The public medication so we can find our that

2583
02:09:25,248 --> 02:09:27,296
All of his amenities are private

2584
02:09:27,808 --> 02:09:29,856
So basically his outward-facing home

2585
02:09:30,112 --> 02:09:32,672
Yeah but like if you walk down the street it's just the

2586
02:09:32,928 --> 02:09:33,952
The facade of a building

2587
02:09:34,208 --> 02:09:36,768
There will be like a pool in

2588
02:09:37,024 --> 02:09:38,048
In a courtyard and s*** like that

2589
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:40,096
He has one building that has a fountain

2590
02:09:41,632 --> 02:09:42,400
Accessible to the public

2591
02:09:43,936 --> 02:09:45,216
His public mitigation

2592
02:09:46,496 --> 02:09:47,008
This is

2593
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:48,544
We are living in

2594
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:49,312
VX

2595
02:09:52,384 --> 02:09:52,896
Is the roaring

2596
02:09:53,152 --> 02:09:55,968
Robber Baron territory

2597
02:09:56,480 --> 02:10:01,344
A potentially hurt efforts throughout the state to build more affordable housing

2598
02:10:01,856 --> 02:10:02,880
He's 12 lawsuit

2599
02:10:03,392 --> 02:10:03,904
Affordable

2600
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:04,928
Out of his building

2601
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:07,232
Including one over the pro2

2602
02:10:07,488 --> 02:10:11,328
It pokes a hole in the city's ability to make zoning laws that require affordable housing

2603
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:12,864
According to l.a. magazine

2604
02:10:13,376 --> 02:10:15,936
Affordable housing Advocates often blame that decision

2605
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:16,960
The one

2606
02:10:17,728 --> 02:10:19,008
Yeah. Palmer was response

2607
02:10:19,264 --> 02:10:21,312
To the paucity

2608
02:10:21,568 --> 02:10:23,104
Of low-income housing downtown

2609
02:10:24,128 --> 02:10:24,896
So he's actively

2610
02:10:26,176 --> 02:10:27,200
Hurting the ability people

2611
02:10:27,456 --> 02:10:28,224
How to get Apartments

2612
02:10:28,736 --> 02:10:30,528
Palmer's properties are recorded

2613
02:10:32,576 --> 02:10:35,904
Rent range from about $2,000 to about $5,000

2614
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:37,696
But the tenants don't actually seem to like

2615
02:10:38,464 --> 02:10:39,232
Quote therapy

2616
02:10:39,488 --> 02:10:42,560
Consistent complaints about trash

2617
02:10:43,072 --> 02:10:44,352
About the noise from other tenants

2618
02:10:44,608 --> 02:10:45,120
Nearest food

2619
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:47,424
And about what people described as

2620
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:48,192
Oversight

2621
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:51,008
His company actually has its own management

2622
02:10:51,264 --> 02:10:52,544
Subsidiary that runs the building

2623
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:53,824
So it's all his fault

2624
02:10:54,592 --> 02:10:56,640
Also someone had emailed

2625
02:10:56,896 --> 02:10:58,432
This article in the main update

2626
02:10:58,688 --> 02:11:01,504
I bet the Palmer's buildings are also magnets for breaking

2627
02:11:02,016 --> 02:11:03,808
Far more than any other downtown building

2628
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:07,392
Plus they have security cameras that don't seem to stop any of that

2629
02:11:07,904 --> 02:11:09,440
I read the article that was linked

2630
02:11:09,696 --> 02:11:12,000
To about the break-ins and it's insane

2631
02:11:12,256 --> 02:11:13,536
The statistics in terms of like

2632
02:11:13,792 --> 02:11:14,816
What you should expect

2633
02:11:15,328 --> 02:11:17,120
For these buildings

2634
02:11:17,376 --> 02:11:20,704
8 time easy to break into apparently

2635
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:23,776
Wow so that's his biggest

2636
02:11:24,288 --> 02:11:29,152
Donator Woo's a shity slumlord on a massive scale

2637
02:11:30,432 --> 02:11:31,712
Now the NFL

2638
02:11:31,968 --> 02:11:35,296
Team the Houston Texans

2639
02:11:35,552 --> 02:11:41,696
NFL is a slumlord operation if ever there

2640
02:11:41,952 --> 02:11:46,048
I have no idea

2641
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:49,888
Houston I have no idea

2642
02:11:50,144 --> 02:11:52,448
So we can Houston the Texans

2643
02:11:52,704 --> 02:11:53,984
We got Robert Mercer

2644
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:57,824
Linda McMahon this Plum Lord and then the Houston Texans

2645
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:02,176
Stupid like the argument there

2646
02:12:02,432 --> 02:12:06,528
If you know more about the NFL

2647
02:12:06,784 --> 02:12:07,296
Business model

2648
02:12:08,064 --> 02:12:08,576
It's

2649
02:12:08,832 --> 02:12:09,344
More shock

2650
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:11,136
All of the NFL did

2651
02:12:13,184 --> 02:12:14,464
Yeah Rodger Goodell can go

2652
02:12:16,512 --> 02:12:18,048
When you want to say that like

2653
02:12:18,304 --> 02:12:21,376
Hillary's evil cuz she took a million dollars from JPMorgan

2654
02:12:21,632 --> 02:12:24,192
Yeah we got five times that from this shity slumlord

2655
02:12:24,448 --> 02:12:28,800
Linda McMahon

2656
02:12:29,312 --> 02:12:31,360
Yeah there's no way

2657
02:12:31,616 --> 02:12:32,896
Love individual donations

2658
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:34,688
Drive-thru

2659
02:12:34,944 --> 02:12:35,456
Super Pacs in

2660
02:12:35,712 --> 02:12:41,600
I tried to find breakdowns of like Donald Trump for president

2661
02:12:42,112 --> 02:12:42,880
I can't find

2662
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:44,928
Publicly available

2663
02:12:46,464 --> 02:12:47,232
Very specifically

2664
02:12:47,488 --> 02:12:48,000
Public

2665
02:12:49,536 --> 02:12:50,048
Whole point of super

2666
02:12:50,816 --> 02:12:53,120
Like the idea of Goldman Sachs

2667
02:12:53,376 --> 02:12:54,144
Did not donate

2668
02:12:56,192 --> 02:12:56,704
Is f****** in

2669
02:12:57,472 --> 02:12:58,752
Because I guarantee

2670
02:12:59,008 --> 02:13:00,032
That end

2671
02:13:00,288 --> 02:13:00,800
Individuals

2672
02:13:01,056 --> 02:13:01,824
From Goldman Sachs

2673
02:13:02,592 --> 02:13:03,872
Absolutely donated

2674
02:13:07,968 --> 02:13:10,272
So now we've got to get back to the other b*******

2675
02:13:10,528 --> 02:13:11,552
That was in that cliff

2676
02:13:11,808 --> 02:13:13,856
Jesus there's so much bullshittin

2677
02:13:14,112 --> 02:13:15,648
Like that one is like

2678
02:13:15,904 --> 02:13:16,416
Alright

2679
02:13:16,672 --> 02:13:18,208
You can hang your hat on

2680
02:13:19,232 --> 02:13:20,768
Giving her money

2681
02:13:21,024 --> 02:13:23,328
The lobbying

2682
02:13:26,656 --> 02:13:28,448
Sad sad that people can't Lobby

2683
02:13:28,704 --> 02:13:29,984
I recall that

2684
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:30,752
For that

2685
02:13:31,264 --> 02:13:32,544
Unfortunately

2686
02:13:33,312 --> 02:13:34,592
A little bit after that

2687
02:13:34,848 --> 02:13:35,616
It came out

2688
02:13:35,872 --> 02:13:38,176
But he was just giving people secret waivers

2689
02:13:38,688 --> 02:13:40,224
Oh what a surprise

2690
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:41,504
He was giving lobbyist

2691
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:43,808
In his campaign

2692
02:13:46,624 --> 02:13:52,256
Well he promised that he would cut when he was campaigning was the one thing

2693
02:13:52,768 --> 02:13:53,792
You could not argue

2694
02:13:54,304 --> 02:13:55,328
Shirt special inside

2695
02:13:55,584 --> 02:13:58,400
Get rid of

2696
02:13:58,656 --> 02:13:59,168
I'm saying

2697
02:13:59,424 --> 02:14:00,960
I'm going to get rid of

2698
02:14:01,216 --> 02:14:02,752
Is a good idea

2699
02:14:05,568 --> 02:14:06,080
And it's

2700
02:14:06,336 --> 02:14:06,848
It seems like it has

2701
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:08,384
Open. Even in the slightest

2702
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:10,176
I'm going to read

2703
02:14:10,432 --> 02:14:12,736
View from this New York Times article

2704
02:14:14,272 --> 02:14:20,416
6 officer is campaigns issuance of secret waivers that allow for

2705
02:14:20,672 --> 02:14:22,464
The handle matters they recently worked on

2706
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:24,768
Setting up a confrontation between the ethics officer

2707
02:14:25,024 --> 02:14:25,536
President-trump

2708
02:14:26,048 --> 02:14:28,352
The move by Walter M shop jr.

2709
02:14:28,608 --> 02:14:32,448
The director of the office of governmental ethics

2710
02:14:32,704 --> 02:14:33,984
Mister shop

2711
02:14:34,496 --> 02:14:38,080
Mr Chavez tried several times to use his powers

2712
02:14:38,336 --> 02:14:41,152
Mr. Trump Federal ethics rules

2713
02:14:41,408 --> 02:14:46,528
As well as the Epic order that mr. Trump

2714
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:49,856
That's a bad start to the article

2715
02:14:50,368 --> 02:14:54,208
Largest uphill battle there ever have been

2716
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:55,488
Office

2717
02:14:55,744 --> 02:14:56,768
Is trying to force

2718
02:14:57,536 --> 02:15:00,096
The least ethical Administration in

2719
02:15:00,352 --> 02:15:01,632
Fairlife

2720
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:03,680
To observe ethical Norm

2721
02:15:03,936 --> 02:15:06,240
0 navico stander

2722
02:15:06,496 --> 02:15:07,008
No just

2723
02:15:08,544 --> 02:15:09,056
Not even close

2724
02:15:09,312 --> 02:15:13,408
No constitutionally he's already violated the emoluments clause

2725
02:15:13,664 --> 02:15:16,736
10 million *

2726
02:15:17,248 --> 02:15:22,112
The most recent request came late Friday when Mister shop asked

2727
02:15:22,368 --> 02:15:24,160
Including the White House to give him

2728
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:25,440
First a copy of

2729
02:15:25,696 --> 02:15:31,072
Any waivers issued to political employees of the executive branch

2730
02:15:32,096 --> 02:15:33,376
Saying in his letter that he was quote

2731
02:15:33,632 --> 02:15:35,936
Advancing the mission of the executive branch

2732
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:39,264
Such waivers are typically issued when the administration

2733
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:41,056
Wants to allow a new political

2734
02:15:41,312 --> 02:15:42,336
Employees

2735
02:15:42,592 --> 02:15:43,616
To work on an issue

2736
02:15:43,872 --> 02:15:45,152
Like Federal housing or

2737
02:15:45,408 --> 02:15:46,432
Environmental policy

2738
02:15:46,688 --> 02:15:47,712
That involves people

2739
02:15:47,968 --> 02:15:50,016
The new employee may work with previously

2740
02:15:51,296 --> 02:15:52,576
Ernest J Borden

2741
02:15:52,832 --> 02:15:55,136
The energy secretary in the Obama Administration

2742
02:15:55,392 --> 02:15:57,696
Matters that involve General

2743
02:15:58,208 --> 02:15:59,488
Even though mr. Moniz

2744
02:15:59,744 --> 02:16:00,768
As in nuclear physics

2745
02:16:01,024 --> 02:16:03,328
It's served on a General Electric

2746
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:06,400
About 70 such waivers were issued during the Obama

2747
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:08,192
Mister

2748
02:16:08,448 --> 02:16:11,520
It is several fundamental changes

2749
02:16:12,032 --> 02:16:12,544
Some of which

2750
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:13,568
Mr. Shabbos challenge

2751
02:16:14,336 --> 02:16:14,848
First

2752
02:16:15,104 --> 02:16:18,176
Mr Trump eliminated the prohibition opposed by Barack Obama

2753
02:16:18,432 --> 02:16:19,200
2009

2754
02:16:19,456 --> 02:16:20,480
On the hiring of staff

2755
02:16:20,736 --> 02:16:22,528
In the previous two years

2756
02:16:25,344 --> 02:16:26,880
Former lobbyist

2757
02:16:27,136 --> 02:16:29,696
Speaking jobs in mr. Trump's Administration Administration

2758
02:16:29,952 --> 02:16:30,976
Must get a waiver

2759
02:16:31,232 --> 02:16:31,744
From the attic

2760
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,304
6 rules if they want to work on matters that overlap

2761
02:16:34,560 --> 02:16:35,072
With their lobbying

2762
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:36,608
The previous two years

2763
02:16:37,376 --> 02:16:37,888
But

2764
02:16:39,936 --> 02:16:42,240
Mr. Trump is chosen to keep the waiver Secret

2765
02:16:42,752 --> 02:16:45,312
He dropped a practice in place during the Obama

2766
02:16:45,568 --> 02:16:49,152
Registration with the office of governmental ethics

2767
02:16:49,408 --> 02:16:53,760
And posted on the White House website or the ethics office website or on phone

2768
02:16:54,272 --> 02:16:55,040
The combined result

2769
02:16:55,552 --> 02:16:58,112
Eliminating the ban on hiring former lobbyist

2770
02:16:58,368 --> 02:17:01,184
Hey babe keeping secret any waivers granted to new hires

2771
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:05,792
Means the public has no way of knowing if mr. Trump staff are complying with the rules

2772
02:17:06,816 --> 02:17:12,192
Terminator

2773
02:17:12,448 --> 02:17:13,216
Whether or not

2774
02:17:13,472 --> 02:17:14,496
Anybody

2775
02:17:15,776 --> 02:17:17,312
And so far publicly

2776
02:17:17,568 --> 02:17:18,848
Nobody

2777
02:17:19,104 --> 02:17:20,896
Nope

2778
02:17:23,968 --> 02:17:24,736
Coming close

2779
02:17:26,528 --> 02:17:32,672
Talk about how like the idea of terminating the release of the visitor logs to the White House

2780
02:17:32,928 --> 02:17:34,208
Plays into that even

2781
02:17:34,464 --> 02:17:37,536
Is broody

2782
02:17:38,816 --> 02:17:39,584
Show up

2783
02:17:41,888 --> 02:17:45,216
Like the nuclear

2784
02:17:45,472 --> 02:17:45,984
Detest

2785
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:47,264
Aa've

2786
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:48,288
Weaver

2787
02:17:49,312 --> 02:17:51,616
Even though he's worked with GE in the past year like

2788
02:17:51,872 --> 02:17:52,384
Dude

2789
02:17:53,152 --> 02:17:53,664
I don't even

2790
02:17:54,688 --> 02:17:59,552
Even Nuclear Physics like there's a part of me that's like always a nuclear physicist

2791
02:18:06,464 --> 02:18:08,768
Like Obama giving waivers to people

2792
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:09,792
Is

2793
02:18:10,304 --> 02:18:12,096
I mean we don't like the idea of

2794
02:18:12,352 --> 02:18:14,912
Lobbyist to being involved in things that they

2795
02:18:15,424 --> 02:18:17,216
The same time if it's open

2796
02:18:18,496 --> 02:18:19,008
Officially

2797
02:18:19,264 --> 02:18:21,568
There are reasons for a nuclear physicist

2798
02:18:21,824 --> 02:18:26,176
In the field that he used to work it seemed like he was doing Lobby was like

2799
02:18:26,432 --> 02:18:27,968
You just worked for GE in the past

2800
02:18:28,480 --> 02:18:30,784
Yeah he's like

2801
02:18:31,296 --> 02:18:32,832
We know you worked

2802
02:18:33,344 --> 02:18:33,856
We want to be

2803
02:18:34,112 --> 02:18:35,648
Way above board

2804
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:39,744
You you work for them and so if you were not

2805
02:18:40,768 --> 02:18:42,048
And if you just got the headline

2806
02:18:44,096 --> 02:18:44,608
Employee

2807
02:18:44,864 --> 02:18:45,632
Now working

2808
02:18:45,888 --> 02:18:46,656
For the Obama

2809
02:18:47,424 --> 02:18:48,960
Can you call Energy

2810
02:18:49,216 --> 02:18:51,264
Play you be like all there's something going on there

2811
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:52,032
Instead of

2812
02:18:53,824 --> 02:18:55,872
Employee who was also a

2813
02:18:56,384 --> 02:18:57,152
Clear physicist

2814
02:18:58,688 --> 02:18:59,456
Clear Expo

2815
02:19:00,224 --> 02:19:02,784
As well as the

2816
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:03,808
The Obama

2817
02:19:04,576 --> 02:19:05,344
Instead of just

2818
02:19:05,856 --> 02:19:10,464
This guy works for that Obama. His

2819
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:11,232
Design

2820
02:19:11,488 --> 02:19:13,280
As it were

2821
02:19:14,816 --> 02:19:16,864
He crossed the t's and dotted his eyes

2822
02:19:17,376 --> 02:19:18,144
Little heart

2823
02:19:19,424 --> 02:19:20,448
Trump doesn't know how to write

2824
02:19:21,216 --> 02:19:26,336
What's going on

2825
02:19:26,592 --> 02:19:27,616
I think

2826
02:19:27,872 --> 02:19:29,152
Obama had to be a

2827
02:19:29,408 --> 02:19:29,920
Zacchaeus

2828
02:19:32,736 --> 02:19:33,248
Exact

2829
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:34,528
That's what I'm saying

2830
02:19:34,784 --> 02:19:36,064
No matter what

2831
02:19:38,368 --> 02:19:39,392
And apparently

2832
02:19:39,648 --> 02:19:40,416
No matter what

2833
02:19:41,440 --> 02:19:42,464
Nobody's going to stop

2834
02:19:42,720 --> 02:19:43,488
I'm at

2835
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:45,792
All the evidence you need that we live in the

2836
02:19:46,048 --> 02:19:46,560
Profoundly races

2837
02:19:46,816 --> 02:19:47,328
The society

2838
02:19:47,584 --> 02:19:48,096
Absolutely

2839
02:19:48,352 --> 02:19:48,864
Anyways

2840
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:50,912
This next clip is about coming

2841
02:19:56,800 --> 02:19:58,336
It's pathetic what you claim

2842
02:20:08,064 --> 02:20:10,112
Woodforest

2843
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:12,160
They are almost silent

2844

Why you have notes

2855
02:21:12,832 --> 02:21:15,904
Teleprompter

2856
02:21:16,160 --> 02:21:17,184

We can move on to the next clip cuz that's all stuff

2861
02:21:31,264 --> 02:21:35,616
Yeah

2862
02:21:35,872 --> 02:21:37,152
Instead going to say what I want

2863
02:21:37,664 --> 02:21:43,808
Hey I'm going to pretend about a different situation

2864
02:21:44,064 --> 02:21:48,928
Or whatever we're doing but only to stop Democrats

2865
02:21:49,184 --> 02:21:51,744
We're doing Alex

2866
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:56,352
Loses track of what's going on two hinges come off the door

Republican

2882
02:23:42,592 --> 02:23:44,896
The good news is that he's totally in control

2883
02:23:49,248 --> 02:23:49,760
What he lets

2884
02:23:50,016 --> 02:23:52,064
He's angry

2885
02:23:52,320 --> 02:23:53,088
He let his anger

2886
02:23:53,344 --> 02:23:55,648
Right right

2887
02:23:55,904 --> 02:23:57,440
Letting the dogs off

2888
02:23:57,696 --> 02:24:03,840
Elite of accidentally expose as you were saying that this is all about this warped version of

02:24:04,096 --> 02:24:06,400
Conservatism that is all that gun

Very easy

2908
02:24:45,312 --> 02:24:45,824
That is the

2909
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:47,360
Sing about

2910
02:24:48,128 --> 02:24:48,896

02:24:59,136 --> 02:25:00,672
Second Amendment

2917
02:25:03,488 --> 02:25:04,512
VM

2918
02:25:05,536 --> 02:25:06,816
Conservatives ideology

2919
02:25:07,072 --> 02:25:07,584
Regarding

2920
02:25:10,144 --> 02:25:11,168
It's not really about

2921
02:25:11,424 --> 02:25:12,192
Supporting those things

2922
02:25:12,448 --> 02:25:13,216
About fear

2923
02:25:13,472 --> 02:25:14,496
Yeah it's about this

2924
02:25:14,752 --> 02:25:16,800
Like it gets into that idea of like

2925
02:25:17,312 --> 02:25:19,360
You Liberals are in bed with Islam and its

2926
02:25:19,616 --> 02:25:20,384
Cuckolding off

2927
02:25:20,640 --> 02:25:21,920
Ryan

2928
02:25:22,688 --> 02:25:26,016
Warming the cockles of our heart

2929
02:25:26,528 --> 02:25:27,040
So

2930
02:25:27,296 --> 02:25:29,088
Was just nut

2931
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:31,392
That was not

2932
02:25:31,648 --> 02:25:32,672
Do reveal

2933
02:25:35,488 --> 02:25:36,000
Thing about

2934
02:25:36,256 --> 02:25:37,536
The thing that we talked about last

2935
02:25:38,048 --> 02:25:39,072
2

2936
02:25:39,328 --> 02:25:40,096
He's always priming

2937
02:25:40,864 --> 02:25:41,376
For the argument

2938
02:25:43,168 --> 02:25:43,680
This is

2939
02:25:43,936 --> 02:25:44,960
There's they're like

2940
02:25:45,472 --> 02:25:45,984
F******

2941
02:25:47,776 --> 02:25:48,288
Okay

2942
02:25:48,544 --> 02:25:49,824
You support the Second Amendment

2943
02:25:50,848 --> 02:25:51,872
Name the 4th

2944
02:25:54,176 --> 02:25:55,200
What what

2945
02:25:55,456 --> 02:25:55,968
The 17th

2946
02:25:56,736 --> 02:26:00,576
What's the 21st like all of this s*** you go through all of these

2947
02:26:00,832 --> 02:26:02,112
These Constitutional Amendments

2948
02:26:02,368 --> 02:26:03,136
Unem

2949
02:26:03,904 --> 02:26:04,416
Again

2950
02:26:04,672 --> 02:26:06,976
Imagine imagine the world were these amendments

2951
02:26:07,744 --> 02:26:08,256
Happened like

2952
02:26:08,512 --> 02:26:09,280
It requires

2953
02:26:09,536 --> 02:26:10,560
Two-thirds of the states

2954
02:26:10,816 --> 02:26:11,328
It requires two

2955
02:26:11,584 --> 02:26:12,096
Two-thirds of

2956
02:26:12,352 --> 02:26:14,400
The Congress it requires two-thirds of

2957
02:26:14,656 --> 02:26:15,424
All of this s***

2958
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:17,984
It is impossible never

2959
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:20,032
Possible to imagine amendments

2960
02:26:20,544 --> 02:26:21,056
Happening to

2961
02:26:22,336 --> 02:26:22,848
Never

2962
02:26:23,104 --> 02:26:24,384
You can imagine one Amendment

2963
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:25,920
The Constitution

2964
02:26:26,944 --> 02:26:27,968
In 6 months

2965
02:26:28,224 --> 02:26:30,272
An amendment very similar to a Simpson

2966
02:26:30,528 --> 02:26:31,552
Situation where it says

2967
02:26:31,808 --> 02:26:32,576
No Trump

2968
02:26:32,832 --> 02:26:33,600
Like that

2969
02:26:33,856 --> 02:26:36,160
No more reality show people

2970
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:43,328
Clippers

2971
02:26:44,096 --> 02:26:44,608
I'm definitely

2972
02:26:45,632 --> 02:26:48,704
That would still Public School

2973
02:26:49,216 --> 02:26:51,008
Sporting event like I do

2974
02:26:58,944 --> 02:27:05,088
4th and 5th graders run over like you were a rockstar impressed wouldn't those kids don't know who you are

2975
02:27:06,112 --> 02:27:12,256
Overman

2976
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:25,824
What is my IQ

2977
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:29,664
Miniature Doberman

2978
02:27:32,224 --> 02:27:34,528
How f****** awesome is that

2979
02:27:36,320 --> 02:27:42,464
Alex is bragging about being huge with the 10-year old Market 9

2980
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:46,304
211 year old Market of 3rd to 5th grade

2981
02:27:46,560 --> 02:27:47,840
They love me

2982
02:27:48,096 --> 02:27:50,400
At my kids school

2983
02:27:52,192 --> 02:27:56,544
The show I quit the show that's all I've ever wanted I wish that was the end

2984
02:28:00,128 --> 02:28:01,408
Have you ever been to my son

2985
02:28:06,016 --> 02:28:07,808
You're not a patriot

2986
02:28:08,064 --> 02:28:09,088
Because Mike Dunn

2987
02:28:11,136 --> 02:28:11,648
Now

2988
02:28:18,560 --> 02:28:24,704
When I was in high school I took broadcast production classes on local access

2989
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:25,728
TV

2990
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:33,152
Really nice guy

2991
02:28:33,664 --> 02:28:35,200
Ron Ron Whitman

2992
02:28:35,456 --> 02:28:36,224
Rod

2993
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:37,248
Wrong

2994
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:40,064
With Ben Ben

2995
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:46,464
That's the super coolest dude the coolest dude you ever met in your life

2996
02:28:46,976 --> 02:28:48,256
Ron Ron

2997
02:28:48,512 --> 02:28:50,560
Windber Ron Whitby

2998
02:28:50,816 --> 02:28:54,400
I'm never going to remember this

2999
02:28:55,936 --> 02:28:57,216
And then he

3000
02:29:02,080 --> 02:29:04,640
There was a station called on TV

3001
02:29:04,896 --> 02:29:06,176
Todd's Channel 16

3002
02:29:06,432 --> 02:29:07,712
It was like School access

3003
02:29:07,968 --> 02:29:10,528
Talk kids how to use cameras

3004
02:29:10,784 --> 02:29:11,552
And create new story

3005
02:29:13,344 --> 02:29:17,184
Your stories would be on the public access years in high school

3006
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:18,720
He was like a mentor to me

3007
02:29:18,976 --> 02:29:20,000
He was a really awesome dude

3008
02:29:20,512 --> 02:29:21,792
But I can tell you

3009
02:29:22,304 --> 02:29:25,120
They went he went to games that his kids play

3010
02:29:25,376 --> 02:29:26,400
But when he went

3011
02:29:27,168 --> 02:29:28,448
People would storm the s*** out of them

3012
02:29:28,704 --> 02:29:34,336
It's cuz he was kind of a local weather local in the same way that Alex there's not a lot of media in Austin

3013
02:29:34,592 --> 02:29:40,736
If you go to a game for kids who just know the idea this guy is famous

3014
02:29:40,992 --> 02:29:42,016
Right when you're 10

3015
02:29:42,528 --> 02:29:43,296
You're about the globalist

3016
02:29:43,808 --> 02:29:46,880
Your guy's a huge liar

3017
02:29:47,136 --> 02:29:52,000
They're like what are two bellwethers I know regarding popular

3018
02:29:52,256 --> 02:29:54,816
Knowledge of globalist how many shirts are being sold

3019
02:29:55,072 --> 02:29:56,096
Sure

3020
02:29:56,864 --> 02:29:57,888
10 year olds

3021
02:29:58,656 --> 02:30:02,752
Who like it's so pathetic too because even if you take the artificer waiver

3022
02:30:03,008 --> 02:30:05,824
Even if you take the part that there lies

3023
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:08,896
Argument is that 10 year olds love

3024
02:30:10,944 --> 02:30:11,968
Jurist Merritt

3025
02:30:12,224 --> 02:30:13,504
Telling the truth

3026
02:30:14,272 --> 02:30:17,344
He is making an argument that I'm more popular than you

3027
02:30:18,112 --> 02:30:19,392
Which is at its base

3028
02:30:20,416 --> 02:30:21,696
Kind of is again

3029
02:30:21,952 --> 02:30:23,232
What he tries to argue

3030
02:30:23,744 --> 02:30:25,024
Well he always argues that it's

3031
02:30:27,072 --> 02:30:29,376
But it's about him being popular with 10 year olds

3032
02:30:29,888 --> 02:30:30,400
Well it is a

3033
02:30:33,728 --> 02:30:36,800
Alright alright

3034
02:30:37,312 --> 02:30:37,824
2

3035
02:30:38,336 --> 02:30:40,640
Like even if those kids agreed with you

3036
02:30:40,896 --> 02:30:42,432
On your b******* position

3037
02:30:43,456 --> 02:30:45,248
I don't believe that it's impressive that

3038
02:30:45,760 --> 02:30:46,784
People who are done

3039
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:48,064
Informing their brains

3040
02:30:48,320 --> 02:30:50,624
Agree with you

3041
02:30:50,880 --> 02:30:52,416
They didn't have political positions

3042
02:30:52,672 --> 02:30:53,952
This begs the question

3043
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:56,512
To you

3044
02:30:58,048 --> 02:30:59,328
How many of you are 10

3045
02:30:59,584 --> 02:31:01,376
And how do 10 year olds feel about

3046
02:31:01,632 --> 02:31:03,680
Jesus I don't want to know

3047
02:31:04,192 --> 02:31:08,544
For a while there was a there was a girl called in my old podcast she was like

3048
02:31:08,800 --> 02:31:09,312
X17

3049
02:31:09,824 --> 02:31:15,968
I like I can't talk to you I know you're just calling into my podcast but this is still so how is illegal if your

3050
02:31:16,224 --> 02:31:20,576
Stop listen to this podcast

3051
02:31:20,832 --> 02:31:21,856
I don't want you to have a

3052
02:31:22,368 --> 02:31:24,416
I don't want me to have a son

3053
02:31:24,928 --> 02:31:26,464
Congratulation

3054
02:31:26,720 --> 02:31:27,232
Who's on the

3055
02:31:27,744 --> 02:31:28,512
Fourth grade Market

3056
02:31:29,024 --> 02:31:29,792
Pretty thrilled with you

3057
02:31:30,304 --> 02:31:32,096
And if you thought that it was over

3058
02:31:32,352 --> 02:31:33,376
It's not

3059
02:31:33,632 --> 02:31:34,144
Meant it off

3060
02:31:36,192 --> 02:31:36,704
This

3061
02:31:36,960 --> 02:31:37,984
Next part

3062
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:39,264
Is weird

3063
02:31:41,568 --> 02:31:45,408
That was super weird this is even weirder

3064
02:31:53,088 --> 02:31:56,672
We the citizens of the United States of America

3065
02:32:05,888 --> 02:32:07,936
Call Matthew Wilder

3066
02:32:08,192 --> 02:32:10,496
Whatever we in this country are too.

3067
02:32:17,664 --> 02:32:23,808
5:30 is all about winning and all about Never Letting himself get any trouble and being upright

3068
02:32:24,064 --> 02:32:26,112
He does is eat sweets

3069
02:32:28,928 --> 02:32:29,440
Every night

3070
02:32:29,952 --> 02:32:31,232
No alcohol

3071
02:32:31,744 --> 02:32:33,536
No drugs no cigarettes

3072
02:32:33,792 --> 02:32:34,304
Do nothing

3073
02:32:35,840 --> 02:32:38,912
That's why he's so successful

3074
02:32:40,448 --> 02:32:45,312
You got all the stuff give it to it

3075
02:33:12,704 --> 02:33:18,848
Organized

3076
02:33:27,296 --> 02:33:28,576
Floof let me ask you a

3077
02:33:29,088 --> 02:33:29,600
I'm listening

3078
02:33:35,488 --> 02:33:36,512
Scoops of ice cream

3079
02:33:36,768 --> 02:33:41,376
That that came out the news apparently the truck

3080
02:33:42,912 --> 02:33:43,680
Two scoops

3081
02:33:44,192 --> 02:33:45,472
And everybody else got one SKU

3082
02:33:45,984 --> 02:33:48,544
Which again I don't want to live in this

3083
02:33:52,896 --> 02:33:54,432
Right right

3084
02:33:54,944 --> 02:33:56,224
That's a pro

3085
02:33:56,992 --> 02:33:58,016
I guess

3086
02:33:58,272 --> 02:33:59,296
Active ice

3087
02:33:59,552 --> 02:34:02,880
Also assaulting women

3088
02:34:03,136 --> 02:34:06,464
Also assaulting women

3089
02:34:07,744 --> 02:34:08,768
There's only one Vice

3090
02:34:10,304 --> 02:34:10,816
Sweets

3091
02:34:11,072 --> 02:34:11,584
Sweet

3092
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:13,120
He's got to fight tooth

3093
02:34:13,376 --> 02:34:15,424
He was the cleanest life

3094
02:34:15,936 --> 02:34:18,496
That's why he's a mentally degrate

3095
02:34:18,752 --> 02:34:20,288
Who's clearly on in phetamine

3096
02:34:20,544 --> 02:34:22,336
It is weirdo doctors vouch for him

3097
02:34:22,592 --> 02:34:23,360
Creeper

3098
02:34:24,128 --> 02:34:28,736
Look is that the craziest f****** thing I've asked f****** hilarious

3099
02:34:28,992 --> 02:34:30,784
Lunesta the same time

3100
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:32,832
Okay

3101
02:34:33,088 --> 02:34:33,856
Come totally clean

3102
02:34:34,624 --> 02:34:35,392
I've been doing

3103
02:34:35,648 --> 02:34:37,184
Ice cream

3104
02:34:37,440 --> 02:34:43,584
You monster I had to ice cream bars one night to ice cream bars

3105
02:34:45,376 --> 02:34:47,680
So I've been doing a lot of listening

3106
02:34:48,960 --> 02:34:49,472
Call

3107
02:34:49,728 --> 02:34:50,240
COP stock

3108
02:34:50,496 --> 02:34:51,776
I've been listening

3109
02:34:52,032 --> 02:34:52,544
This

3110
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:54,080
Invalidated our entire

3111
02:34:54,592 --> 02:34:56,128
Outback research

3112
02:34:57,920 --> 02:34:59,712
And I've started to realize

3113
02:34:59,968 --> 02:35:01,248
The key is an adaptable creature

3114
02:35:02,784 --> 02:35:03,296
From his past

3115
02:35:03,552 --> 02:35:05,344
Mistake

3116
02:35:06,624 --> 02:35:07,904
So in this

3117
02:35:08,160 --> 02:35:09,184
Well in this instance

3118
02:35:09,696 --> 02:35:11,744
Like you heard him do that speculation

3119
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:12,512
About

3120
02:35:13,536 --> 02:35:17,120
You know koverman what if you're not you're not

3121
02:35:17,376 --> 02:35:21,728
Right in the past instead

3122
02:35:21,984 --> 02:35:23,008
Buy Chobani

3123
02:35:23,264 --> 02:35:24,800
He's very clear

3124
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:28,384
Right

3125
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:31,456
If this is exactly the same thing that happened

3126
02:35:31,712 --> 02:35:32,224
On

3127
02:35:32,736 --> 02:35:34,272
December 21st

3128
02:35:34,528 --> 02:35:35,040
2012

3129
02:35:36,576 --> 02:35:38,368
He learned the lesson of Y2K

3130
02:35:39,648 --> 02:35:42,208
We've we went over the Y2K episode

3131
02:35:42,464 --> 02:35:44,512
I where he was causing panic

3132
02:35:45,792 --> 02:35:46,560
Everything

3133
02:35:46,816 --> 02:35:52,960
Concentration

3134
02:35:53,216 --> 02:35:53,728
Underwater

3135
02:35:53,984 --> 02:35:56,032
Yeah there was all kinds

3136
02:35:56,544 --> 02:35:57,056
When the next

3137
02:35:57,312 --> 02:35:58,080
Sort of big

3138
02:35:58,848 --> 02:35:59,616
Media hoax

3139
02:35:59,872 --> 02:36:06,016
End-of-the-world thing happened December 21st 2012 and I was like that just seems like a reggae

3140
02:36:06,272 --> 02:36:07,552
Either date and now I remember

3141
02:36:07,808 --> 02:36:11,136
That's when people thought the world

3142
02:36:11,392 --> 02:36:14,720
Yeah so on that episode first of all on the 21st

3143
02:36:14,976 --> 02:36:16,768
Do you have David Icke as a guest which is

3144
02:36:17,024 --> 02:36:17,536
Grateful

3145
02:36:20,096 --> 02:36:21,120
Put on the 20th

3146
02:36:21,888 --> 02:36:23,680
He is going on like

3147
02:36:23,936 --> 02:36:27,776
I got to be honest

3148
02:36:28,032 --> 02:36:28,544
That's like

3149
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:31,104
Like really emphatically be like

3150
02:36:31,360 --> 02:36:35,456
Listen I got f****** crucified because of how f***** up I was

3151
02:36:35,712 --> 02:36:36,480
I'm not doing that

3152
02:36:38,272 --> 02:36:39,296
An adaptable creature

3153
02:36:39,808 --> 02:36:40,320
It's interesting

3154
02:36:40,832 --> 02:36:41,856
It's like

3155
02:36:42,368 --> 02:36:43,392
Camping chair

3156
02:36:43,904 --> 02:36:45,184
Kind of by the world

3157
02:36:45,696 --> 02:36:47,232
Now he eventually will end up for

3158
02:36:47,488 --> 02:36:48,000
Forgetting those

3159
02:36:48,512 --> 02:36:50,816
Right like you going to slander someone again

3160
02:36:51,328 --> 02:36:51,840
In the future

3161
02:36:52,096 --> 02:36:53,376
But

3162
02:36:53,632 --> 02:36:56,192
Yeah but for now it's it's recent enough

3163
02:36:56,704 --> 02:36:57,984
Next time he like

3164
02:36:58,240 --> 02:36:59,008
Oh f*** I'm closed

3165
02:36:59,264 --> 02:37:01,824
Supplanter

3166
02:37:03,872 --> 02:37:04,640
It's also like

3167
02:37:05,408 --> 02:37:06,688
My go-to is pedophilia

3168
02:37:08,480 --> 02:37:10,528
Because that's the worst crime you can

3169
02:37:13,856 --> 02:37:14,368
But

3170
02:37:14,624 --> 02:37:16,672
I know I can't do that as aggressive

3171
02:37:18,464 --> 02:37:18,976
Say it

3172
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:21,792
To fraud

3173
02:37:22,048 --> 02:37:24,096
Exactly that Hillary stuff isn't

3174
02:37:24,352 --> 02:37:25,888
Look into it

3175
02:37:26,144 --> 02:37:26,656
10%

3176
02:37:27,424 --> 02:37:29,728
Most

3177
02:37:29,984 --> 02:37:31,776
Charities don't give nearly as much

3178
02:37:32,032 --> 02:37:34,592
Absolutely research

3179
02:37:35,104 --> 02:37:36,128
A charity before you give to

3180
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:37,152
Cuz a lot of them

3181
02:37:37,408 --> 02:37:41,248
That's Wyler nonprofits they are also

3182
02:37:42,272 --> 02:37:42,784
They're still

3183
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:43,552
A lot of them

3184
02:37:43,808 --> 02:37:44,576
Businesses

3185
02:37:44,832 --> 02:37:48,160
Giving to Independent charities

3186
02:37:48,416 --> 02:37:52,256
Ali Forney Center

3187
02:37:54,048 --> 02:37:54,560
Look

3188
02:37:54,816 --> 02:37:56,096
Clinton Foundation

3189
02:37:56,608 --> 02:37:57,888
But they were not running

3190
02:37:58,144 --> 02:38:00,192
Beholder money

3191
02:38:00,704 --> 02:38:01,216
That part is

3192
02:38:01,728 --> 02:38:03,264
F****** cockamamie bulshit

3193
02:38:03,520 --> 02:38:04,288
They just

3194
02:38:05,568 --> 02:38:11,712
Play by the same rules please do

3195
02:38:11,968 --> 02:38:15,552
God they're so goddamn many

3196
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:16,832
But like

3197
02:38:17,856 --> 02:38:19,136
But also at the same

3198
02:38:19,392 --> 02:38:22,464
Time but you have to understand if you're running a global charity

3199
02:38:22,720 --> 02:38:24,000
There's massive overhead

3200
02:38:24,256 --> 02:38:24,768
Add to it

3201
02:38:25,024 --> 02:38:25,536
In terms of

3202
02:38:25,792 --> 02:38:27,840
Administration Employees things

3203
02:38:29,888 --> 02:38:31,168
By default going to be

3204
02:38:34,240 --> 02:38:40,384
According at all these usually the best way to go

3205
02:38:41,920 --> 02:38:42,944
They're more on the ground

3206
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:46,016
The resources go more directly to the cause

3207
02:38:46,272 --> 02:38:46,784
That your age

3208
02:38:47,040 --> 02:38:47,808
Justin supporting

3209
02:38:48,320 --> 02:38:50,112
And what's the most effective

3210
02:38:50,624 --> 02:38:51,136
Charity

3211
02:38:51,904 --> 02:38:52,672
Bowlero

3212
02:38:52,928 --> 02:38:53,696
Federal funding

3213
02:38:54,720 --> 02:38:55,232
Well that too

3214
02:38:55,488 --> 02:38:59,072
Unfortunately

3215
02:38:59,328 --> 02:38:59,840
Yeah exactly

3216
02:39:02,912 --> 02:39:03,424
To get rid of

3217
02:39:04,192 --> 02:39:04,704
In terms of

3218
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:05,472
Oversight

3219
02:39:05,728 --> 02:39:06,240
And the lights

3220
02:39:06,496 --> 02:39:07,264
If it is

3221
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:08,032

I can't read in the tub

3258
02:41:51,616 --> 02:41:53,408
The thing that relaxes me

3259
02:41:53,664 --> 02:41:55,712
What's wrong with it

3260
02:41:55,968 --> 02:41:58,272
If people started calling me back

3261
02:41:59,296 --> 02:42:02,880
I get that an insult from a lot of my friends that are like

3262
02:42:03,136 --> 02:42:04,160

But I like to sit in the tub

3267
02:42:10,816 --> 02:42:11,328
I like

3268
02:42:11,584 --> 02:42:12,352
Most of my life

3269
02:42:12,608 --> 02:42:14,144
I was a bubble bath guy

3270
02:42:14,400 --> 02:42:16,960
But then as I got older I transition to bath salts

3271
02:42:17,216 --> 02:42:19,520
Best alter amazing

3272
02:42:21,056 --> 02:42:26,432

AB Lux my way into my younger years that had that

3302
02:43:38,624 --> 02:43:42,208
Starting right now we're going to discuss

3303
02:43:42,464 --> 02:43:42,976
Rich

3304
02:43:44,256 --> 02:43:45,536
Some people who are not

3305
02:43:45,792 --> 02:43:46,816
And also Alex

3306
02:43:47,072 --> 02:43:47,840
Lying about them

3307
02:43:49,376 --> 02:43:50,656
You're sure

3308
02:43:55,008 --> 02:43:55,776
We need

3309
02:43:56,032 --> 02:44:01,408
Your help

3310
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:09,344
Afford

3311
02:44:09,600 --> 02:44:12,160
Heartfelt Veterinary

3312
02:44:12,416 --> 02:44:13,184
Wings

3313
02:44:24,960 --> 02:44:29,568
He says the worlds in danger because of us

3314
02:44:35,456 --> 02:44:35,968
Since either

3315
02:44:47,232 --> 02:44:52,864
So the third part they were disabled eyes in the world totally turd

3316
02:44:53,120 --> 02:44:53,632
She threw the fact

3317
02:44:53,888 --> 02:44:56,192
About new clear history

3318
02:44:56,448 --> 02:44:57,472
Here's the thing that gets

3319
02:44:59,776 --> 02:45:00,288
Call Hema

3320
02:45:01,568 --> 02:45:02,080
Tool

3321
02:45:02,336 --> 02:45:02,848
Which is

3322
02:45:03,104 --> 02:45:04,384
Which is like that

3323
02:45:04,896 --> 02:45:05,920
It's similar to the races

3324
02:45:07,456 --> 02:45:08,224
But it's at like

3325
02:45:09,248 --> 02:45:10,272
He's not saying anything

3326
02:45:10,784 --> 02:45:11,296
Particularly

3327
02:45:11,808 --> 02:45:13,856
Intellectual

3328
02:45:14,112 --> 02:45:14,880
Clearly an

3329
02:45:15,136 --> 02:45:15,648
Directly

3330
02:45:17,440 --> 02:45:18,976
I want you to hold off on this criticism

3331
02:45:19,232 --> 02:45:21,280
Cuz I think he'll get too wide

3332
02:45:22,816 --> 02:45:25,888
He's going to insult his appearance real hard in a little bit

3333
02:45:26,144 --> 02:45:28,192
Alright

3334
02:45:28,448 --> 02:45:29,728
That's the quickest way to

3335
02:45:29,984 --> 02:45:31,008
To get that alt-right

3336
02:45:31,264 --> 02:45:35,104
On your side

3337
02:45:35,360 --> 02:45:35,872
He's an expert

3338
02:45:36,640 --> 02:45:42,272
Experts tell me what did you go to college

3339
02:45:42,784 --> 02:45:46,368
J I'm a proud boy

3340
02:45:50,720 --> 02:45:52,512
Former Chinese nuclear history

3341
02:45:52,768 --> 02:45:54,560
Yes so

3342
02:45:56,352 --> 02:45:58,144
We had the Korean War

3343
02:46:01,984 --> 02:46:03,519
20% of North Korea's Poppy

3344
02:46:04,031 --> 02:46:06,079
And here's a really f***** up thing I learned

3345
02:46:06,335 --> 02:46:08,383
During my research into this

3346
02:46:08,895 --> 02:46:13,503
General MacArthur wanted to shoot 34 nuclear bombs at China

3347
02:46:14,015 --> 02:46:16,575
The quote create a belt of radioactive Cobalt

3348
02:46:17,087 --> 02:46:18,367
Across the neck of Manchuria

3349
02:46:18,623 --> 02:46:21,439
So there could be no Korea from the north

3350
02:46:22,463 --> 02:46:22,975
60 years

3351
02:46:24,767 --> 02:46:25,535
That's crazy

3352
02:46:26,303 --> 02:46:26,815
I'm starting

3353
02:46:27,071 --> 02:46:27,839
America's not always

3354
02:46:29,631 --> 02:46:30,399
Nuts

3355
02:46:30,655 --> 02:46:36,799
I'm guessing that's not a widely published

3356
02:46:37,055 --> 02:46:40,383
Size Fat American history

3357
02:46:42,175 --> 02:46:44,991
High school they don't go over by the way our general

3358
02:46:45,247 --> 02:46:45,759
Have a case

3359
02:46:46,527 --> 02:46:50,623
Murder millions of people in make sure that there's a radio on

3360
02:46:53,439 --> 02:46:59,583
College history

3361
02:47:01,887 --> 02:47:02,399
Bestway

3362
02:47:03,679 --> 02:47:04,191
Like

3363
02:47:04,703 --> 02:47:06,751
I recommend reading Barbara

3364
02:47:07,519 --> 02:47:08,543
All day everyday

3365
02:47:08,799 --> 02:47:10,847
At no point in time did I ever hear about

3366
02:47:11,103 --> 02:47:11,871
This

3367
02:47:12,127 --> 02:47:16,479
The Soviet Union assist research

3368
02:47:16,991 --> 02:47:18,271
Peaceful uses of atomic energy

3369
02:47:19,039 --> 02:47:20,063
Hey 1956

3370
02:47:20,319 --> 02:47:22,879
University in Taiwan

3371
02:47:23,135 --> 02:47:23,903
Built its first

3372
02:47:24,159 --> 02:47:24,671
Research

3373
02:47:24,927 --> 02:47:25,695
Nuclear reactor

3374
02:47:26,463 --> 02:47:29,791
In 1960 nuclear energy research

3375
02:47:30,303 --> 02:47:31,839
A reactor from

3376
02:47:32,095 --> 02:47:32,607
Canada

3377
02:47:32,863 --> 02:47:35,935
Those are how China got their nuclear

3378
02:47:36,959 --> 02:47:39,263
Could you play Builder

3379
02:47:39,519 --> 02:47:40,543
The name of it was it

3380
02:47:40,799 --> 02:47:42,079
Xian

3381
02:47:42,335 --> 02:47:43,615
Space

3382
02:47:45,151 --> 02:47:45,663
GF

3383
02:47:45,919 --> 02:47:47,455
Eng Hua

02:47:55,903 --> 02:47:59,487
But University in Taiwan

3387
02:47:59,743 --> 02:48:00,511
4front

3388
02:48:00,767 --> 02:48:06,143
Call Chinese nuclear research

3389
02:48:06,399 --> 02:48:09,471
Year it's theorize will create a meltdown proof

3390
02:48:09,727 --> 02:48:10,239
Nuclear real

3391
02:48:11,775 --> 02:48:15,615
Yeah they're they're doing some amazing research there and have been for the last time

3392
02:48:15,871 --> 02:48:17,407
60 years

3393
02:48:17,663 --> 02:48:18,175
Cuz that is

3394
02:48:19,455 --> 02:48:23,551
That's a really valuable just like other

3395
02:48:24,319 --> 02:48:25,087
Other alternative

3396
02:48:25,343 --> 02:48:26,879
It feels like solar power washer

3397
02:48:27,135 --> 02:48:27,647
If you actually

3398
02:48:27,903 --> 02:48:31,487
Get nuclear reactors

3399
02:48:31,999 --> 02:48:32,767
Yeah absolutely

3400
02:48:33,023 --> 02:48:33,791
Yeah because

3401
02:48:34,047 --> 02:48:35,327
Is it because when you talk about

3402
02:48:35,583 --> 02:48:36,095
I mean like

3403
02:48:36,607 --> 02:48:37,631
When you talk about

3404
02:48:37,887 --> 02:48:39,423
Pure pound-for-pound Energy

3405
02:48:39,935 --> 02:48:41,471
There isn't really much that

3406
02:48:41,983 --> 02:48:42,495
Compared with

3407
02:48:42,751 --> 02:48:44,287
Fusion invisibility

3408
02:48:48,895 --> 02:48:49,663
Borderline info

3409
02:48:51,455 --> 02:48:52,223
The f******

3410
02:48:53,247 --> 02:48:55,039
That's when we get the

3411
02:48:55,295 --> 02:48:56,319
Next phase of our

3412
02:48:56,575 --> 02:48:59,647
Cultural evolution

3413
02:49:00,415 --> 02:49:01,439
That's entirely pause

3414
02:49:03,487 --> 02:49:04,511
We had nothing

3415
02:49:04,767 --> 02:49:08,095
Really fundamental to do with Chinese nuclear

3416
02:49:08,351 --> 02:49:10,911
Expansion

3417
02:49:11,423 --> 02:49:11,935
Help

3418
02:49:12,191 --> 02:49:14,495
Of course it was just

3419
02:49:15,007 --> 02:49:15,519
Really

3420
02:49:16,031 --> 02:49:17,567
For really good research

3421
02:49:17,823 --> 02:49:20,127
And work being done by the Chinese themselves

3422
02:49:20,383 --> 02:49:22,943
I'm in a little bit later in like I said 1969

3423
02:49:23,199 --> 02:49:23,711
Canadians

3424
02:49:23,967 --> 02:49:26,015
Sold them a bunch of uranium

3425
02:49:29,087 --> 02:49:29,855
Even

3426
02:49:30,111 --> 02:49:30,623
They didn't really

3427
02:49:31,135 --> 02:49:31,647
Like

3428
02:49:31,903 --> 02:49:32,671
In-N-Out

3429
02:49:33,951 --> 02:49:35,231
You could buy Radioactive

3430
02:49:35,487 --> 02:49:35,999
Toothpaste

3431
02:49:37,535 --> 02:49:38,815
Like they didn't understand

3432
02:49:39,071 --> 02:49:39,583
Quite what

3433
02:49:40,607 --> 02:49:43,423
Fluoride toothpaste

3434
02:49:43,935 --> 02:49:45,727
Understand what

3435
02:49:45,983 --> 02:49:47,007
Radiation

3436
02:49:47,263 --> 02:49:49,823
Did two people that were missed

3437
02:49:50,591 --> 02:49:52,127
And then as far as as far as

3438
02:49:52,383 --> 02:49:53,407
Nuclear

3439
02:49:54,175 --> 02:49:54,687
. like

3440
02:49:55,199 --> 02:49:55,967
The moments

3441
02:49:56,479 --> 02:49:56,991
It was

3442
02:49:57,247 --> 02:49:57,759
Is discovered

3443
02:49:58,015 --> 02:49:58,783
It was

3444
02:49:59,295 --> 02:50:00,319
Inevitable that

3445
02:50:00,575 --> 02:50:02,111
That possibility would be reach

3446
02:50:02,367 --> 02:50:02,879
Which by other countries

3447
02:50:03,391 --> 02:50:05,695
Pencil the myth of Pandora's Box

3448
02:50:06,975 --> 02:50:08,255
I am

3449
02:50:10,047 --> 02:50:11,839
The f*** with it

3450
02:50:12,095 --> 02:50:12,863
Absolutely right

3451
02:50:13,631 --> 02:50:15,167
When he quoted

3452
02:50:17,727 --> 02:50:18,495
Destroyer of worlds

3453
02:50:18,751 --> 02:50:20,287
Yeah I become death

3454
02:50:21,311 --> 02:50:21,823
So

3455
02:50:22,079 --> 02:50:23,615
North Korea

3456
02:50:24,383 --> 02:50:24,895
Haha

3457
02:50:25,151 --> 02:50:26,175
Shockingly similar

3458
02:50:26,943 --> 02:50:30,527
1956 the Soviet Union begin training North Korean scientist

3459
02:50:31,039 --> 02:50:31,807
Engineers enabling

3460
02:50:32,063 --> 02:50:33,087
The dprk

3461
02:50:33,343 --> 02:50:34,111
To acquire face

3462
02:50:34,367 --> 02:50:36,159
Acknowledge to initiate a nuclear program

3463
02:50:36,927 --> 02:50:37,695
1959

3464
02:50:38,207 --> 02:50:41,023
North Korea and the USSR sign nuclear cooperation

3465
02:50:41,791 --> 02:50:44,863
Over the next 30 Years Moscow provides the north of phasic

3466
02:50:45,119 --> 02:50:45,631
Nuclear training

3467
02:50:48,191 --> 02:50:52,287
As well

3468
02:50:52,543 --> 02:50:54,847
The work doing s*** in 1959

3469
02:50:55,359 --> 02:50:56,895
Which end of course this makes

3470
02:50:57,151 --> 02:51:01,503
Robertson's considering the fact that immediately after WWII you have guys like

3471
02:51:03,295 --> 02:51:04,319
MacArthur and

3472
02:51:04,575 --> 02:51:05,343
And f******

3473
02:51:09,183 --> 02:51:11,743
Just saying all right now we defeated the

3474
02:51:11,999 --> 02:51:13,023
Let's go after Russia

3475
02:51:13,279 --> 02:51:17,375
Like that was there a media thought Churchill would like

3476
02:51:17,631 --> 02:51:18,143
Hey

3477
02:51:18,655 --> 02:51:19,679
Now we go into Russia

3478
02:51:20,447 --> 02:51:20,959
Because

3479
02:51:21,215 --> 02:51:22,239
It's super smart

3480
02:51:22,495 --> 02:51:25,055
Fight a land war in Russia

3481
02:51:29,919 --> 02:51:34,271
A little more about North Korea before the clintons were ever in power in any meaningful way

3482
02:51:34,527 --> 02:51:35,551
Hahaha in the midnight

3483
02:51:35,807 --> 02:51:37,343
1880s North Korea reach

3484
02:51:37,599 --> 02:51:40,159
Dangerous level of nuclear capacity

3485
02:51:40,671 --> 02:51:41,183
With it

3486
02:51:41,439 --> 02:51:42,719
Mensa due to increased

3487
02:51:42,975 --> 02:51:43,999
Support for their nuclear

3488
02:51:44,767 --> 02:51:46,303
In 1990s

3489
02:51:46,559 --> 02:51:48,351
84

3490
02:51:48,607 --> 02:51:52,191
North Korea completed construction of a 5 megawatt

3491
02:51:52,703 --> 02:51:53,471
I don't think that's correct

3492
02:51:53,727 --> 02:51:55,007
Mmw.

3493
02:51:55,263 --> 02:51:56,031
Mwe

3494
02:51:58,591 --> 02:52:01,407
Cooled graphite moderated nuclear reactor

3495
02:52:01,663 --> 02:52:02,943
For plutonium production

3496
02:52:04,223 --> 02:52:06,015
If our

3497
02:52:06,271 --> 02:52:07,551
For a majority of the year

3498
02:52:12,159 --> 02:52:13,439
Plutonium

3499
02:52:13,951 --> 02:52:17,535
There is still great disagreement as to just how much plutonium was produce

3500
02:52:18,047 --> 02:52:19,839
That was in 1984

3501
02:52:20,095 --> 02:52:21,375
Route 33 years ago

3502
02:52:22,655 --> 02:52:23,167
So

3503
02:52:23,679 --> 02:52:24,447
Alex's hold

3504
02:52:24,703 --> 02:52:25,727
Narrative

3505
02:52:25,983 --> 02:52:27,263
Dave Murray

3506
02:52:28,031 --> 02:52:29,823
Was already there

3507
02:52:30,591 --> 02:52:33,919
China and North Korea both had Soviet help

3508
02:52:34,175 --> 02:52:35,455
It was an offshoot of the

3509
02:52:35,711 --> 02:52:36,479
The Korean War

3510
02:52:38,783 --> 02:52:39,295
What the f***

3511
02:52:40,063 --> 02:52:41,087
This is such stupid

3512
02:52:41,343 --> 02:52:44,159
S*** this narrative doesn't hold any water in what

3513
02:52:44,415 --> 02:52:48,767
What year is the singer

3514
02:52:49,023 --> 02:52:50,047
Fertile ground because

3515
02:52:52,095 --> 02:52:53,375
Like I didn't know where the

3516
02:52:53,887 --> 02:52:54,399
Chinese or no

3517
02:52:58,239 --> 02:52:59,775
The clintons a liberalism

3518
02:53:00,031 --> 02:53:03,359
No of course not but if if I don't have any reference

3519
02:53:03,615 --> 02:53:04,127
Point for that

3520
02:53:04,639 --> 02:53:05,663
Then I am

3521
02:53:05,919 --> 02:53:08,991
I'm still susceptible to whatever it is

3522
02:53:10,015 --> 02:53:11,551
Because

3523
02:53:11,807 --> 02:53:13,087
You are always

3524
02:53:14,111 --> 02:53:19,999
Super diligent in your research papers from like nuclear organizations

3525
02:53:21,279 --> 02:53:23,071
Like I don't have any

3526
02:53:23,583 --> 02:53:24,351
Personal research

3527
02:53:25,375 --> 02:53:26,911
So if I

3528
02:53:27,423 --> 02:53:28,447
Have you

3529
02:53:28,703 --> 02:53:29,215
Who are you

3530
02:53:29,471 --> 02:53:30,495
Who's doing the

3531
02:53:31,007 --> 02:53:31,775
Very necessary

3532
02:53:32,799 --> 02:53:34,079
It would be fertile ground

3533
02:53:34,335 --> 02:53:35,615
For me if I already had a fear of

3534
02:53:36,383 --> 02:53:37,407
If I already have a fear of

3535
02:53:38,175 --> 02:53:38,687
North

3536
02:53:39,455 --> 02:53:40,735
I also North

3537
02:53:41,503 --> 02:53:43,807
These days

3538
02:53:44,063 --> 02:53:44,575
City Place

3539
02:53:46,111 --> 02:53:46,623
He's much more

3540
02:53:46,879 --> 02:53:47,391
Plausible B

3541
02:53:48,415 --> 02:53:48,927
04

3542
02:53:49,183 --> 02:53:51,487
Dream about you're not dumb you would look into it

3543
02:53:51,743 --> 02:53:55,583
You would find these same thing

3544
02:53:56,351 --> 02:53:57,631
Because I have

3545
02:53:57,887 --> 02:53:58,399
No frame

3546
02:53:58,655 --> 02:53:59,167
Reference for

3547
02:53:59,679 --> 02:54:00,191
I'm much

3548
02:54:02,495 --> 02:54:03,007
Empathic

3549
02:54:05,055 --> 02:54:06,079
Because if you're already

3550
02:54:06,335 --> 02:54:07,871
Predisposed to believing

3551
02:54:08,127 --> 02:54:08,639
Anything

3552
02:54:09,151 --> 02:54:09,663
About North

3553
02:54:10,943 --> 02:54:11,455
Thing about China

3554
02:54:11,967 --> 02:54:18,111
Like

3555
02:54:18,367 --> 02:54:20,927
Disregard

3556
02:54:21,183 --> 02:54:21,695
Well and nausea

3557
02:54:22,975 --> 02:54:23,999
I can't know every

3558
02:54:25,279 --> 02:54:27,071
And so if I get it at

3559
02:54:27,327 --> 02:54:28,095
Assertive

3560
02:54:28,351 --> 02:54:30,399
Authoritarian voice telling me this

3561
02:54:31,167 --> 02:54:32,191
8 much more likely

3562
02:54:32,447 --> 02:54:32,959
Play for me too

3563
02:54:33,471 --> 02:54:34,495
If I have

3564
02:54:34,751 --> 02:54:35,263
04

3565
02:54:36,287 --> 02:54:40,895
Especially if you've bought into a bunch of other b*******

3566
02:54:41,151 --> 02:54:45,247
Unfortunately a lot of my knowledge of the Korean War

3567
02:54:46,271 --> 02:54:46,783
Math

3568
02:54:47,039 --> 02:54:48,831
Like I don't know enough

3569
02:54:50,367 --> 02:54:51,391
It was it was an actor

3570
02:54:52,415 --> 02:54:52,927
Well I can tell

3571
02:54:53,439 --> 02:54:54,975
The movie of the show

3572
02:54:55,999 --> 02:54:56,767
Okay nevermind

3573
02:54:58,559 --> 02:55:02,399
So this next clip he gives them more b******* and I've got more facts

3574
02:55:05,215 --> 02:55:07,007
He's at least saying

3575
02:55:13,151 --> 02:55:17,759
Christian Christian

3576
02:55:18,015 --> 02:55:24,159
The last decade by Muslims against Christian

3577
02:55:24,415 --> 02:55:27,231
How Christians are being persecuted the world

3578
02:55:27,487 --> 02:55:32,607
That Muslims about killing all the Jews in Copenhagen Denmark

3579
02:55:48,479 --> 02:55:54,623
So that's complete bulshit the 80% military aged man of refugees numbers

3580
02:55:54,879 --> 02:55:55,391
Make an eagle

3581
02:55:56,159 --> 02:56:02,303
Physically based on the statistics

3582
02:56:02,559 --> 02:56:03,583
7%

3583
02:56:03,839 --> 02:56:05,631
Refugees are

3584
02:56:07,167 --> 02:56:08,191
Your number is already

3585
02:56:09,727 --> 02:56:10,751
Well here's the thing

3586
02:56:12,543 --> 02:56:16,383
At the refugee demographics

3587
02:56:17,151 --> 02:56:21,247
Syria in particular is a country with a large population of young people between

3588
02:56:21,503 --> 02:56:22,783
Especially in comparison

3589
02:56:23,295 --> 02:56:23,807
Europe

3590
02:56:24,319 --> 02:56:26,623
25

3591
02:56:26,879 --> 02:56:27,903
54 years old

3592
02:56:28,159 --> 02:56:30,207
It only 4.02%

3593
02:56:30,463 --> 02:56:31,231
The serious population

3594
02:56:32,511 --> 02:56:33,023
C5

3595
02:56:33,535 --> 02:56:35,071
Compared to the European Union

3596
02:56:35,327 --> 02:56:36,095
18 point

3597
02:56:37,119 --> 02:56:38,911
Refugee and migrant population

3598
02:56:39,167 --> 02:56:40,447
Balls are originating country

3599
02:56:40,703 --> 02:56:41,215
Is demographic

3600
02:56:41,471 --> 02:56:44,031
Then we should expect

3601
02:56:45,311 --> 02:56:47,359
Will be male and most of them will be young

3602
02:56:48,127 --> 02:56:49,407
To put the issue of agent

3603
02:56:49,663 --> 02:56:51,199
Perspective as of 2015

3604
02:56:51,455 --> 02:56:52,479
Sirius median age

3605
02:56:52,735 --> 02:56:54,015
Was 23.8

3606
02:56:54,271 --> 02:56:55,295
Arax was night

3607
02:56:55,551 --> 02:56:56,319
18.7

3608
02:56:56,575 --> 02:56:57,343
And Afghanistan

3609
02:56:57,599 --> 02:56:58,623
18.4

3610
02:56:59,135 --> 02:57:01,439
By comparison the median age in the United States

3611
02:57:01,695 --> 02:57:03,231
What's 37.7

3612
02:57:03,487 --> 02:57:05,279
Did the United Kingdom it was 40

3613
02:57:05,535 --> 02:57:06,047
4

3614
02:57:06,303 --> 02:57:07,071
In Germany was 40

3615
02:57:07,839 --> 02:57:08,351
5

3616
02:57:09,119 --> 02:57:11,423
Children from Syria and elsewhere makeup at least

3617
02:57:11,679 --> 02:57:12,959
The refugee

3618
02:57:13,471 --> 02:57:16,287
Children who whether a company or alone or looking

3619
02:57:16,543 --> 02:57:17,311
A chance to grow

3620
02:57:17,823 --> 02:57:19,103
That is not shredded by viola

3621
02:57:19,615 --> 02:57:20,127
Now

3622
02:57:20,383 --> 02:57:21,663
If you want to really break it down

3623
02:57:21,919 --> 02:57:22,943
The reason the population

3624
02:57:25,247 --> 02:57:27,039
Terrible

3625
02:57:28,063 --> 02:57:29,343
Help Healthcare

3626
02:57:29,599 --> 02:57:30,623
Is provided

3627
02:57:30,879 --> 02:57:33,439
In third world countries

3628
02:57:33,695 --> 02:57:35,231
And also then

3629
02:57:35,487 --> 02:57:36,767
And killed

3630
02:57:37,023 --> 02:57:37,535
Kilt

3631
02:57:37,791 --> 02:57:38,559
It just

3632
02:57:39,071 --> 02:57:42,399
The reason that population is so young is cuz everyone's eyes really young

3633
02:57:42,911 --> 02:57:43,423
That's

3634
02:57:47,007 --> 02:57:48,799
The equation is so simplistic it

3635
02:57:49,823 --> 02:57:51,615
Expensive

3636
02:57:51,871 --> 02:57:53,663
It's not specific

3637
02:57:54,687 --> 02:57:55,711
So f****** stupid

3638
02:57:55,967 --> 02:57:58,783
It's ignorant like that's like saying

3639
02:57:59,039 --> 02:58:00,319
You know the population

3640
02:58:00,575 --> 02:58:01,855
In medieval Europe

3641
02:58:02,367 --> 02:58:02,879
Was

3642
02:58:03,647 --> 02:58:04,671
Heavily skewed towards

3643
02:58:06,463 --> 02:58:07,999
Cuz most of them.

3644
02:58:08,511 --> 02:58:11,839
Well now the reality is a lot of those marauding

3645
02:58:12,095 --> 02:58:15,935
Is operating basically off

3646
02:58:16,959 --> 02:58:21,311
Because there have been memes that have come out that show I'm going to show them both to you

3647
02:58:21,567 --> 02:58:23,359
There is a picture of

3648
02:58:23,615 --> 02:58:26,175
Muslim men

3649
02:58:30,527 --> 02:58:32,575
And it's got the Getty Images

3650
02:58:32,831 --> 02:58:33,343
Tag 2

3651
02:58:33,599 --> 02:58:36,671
Getting off a bus

3652
02:58:37,439 --> 02:58:38,975
Really scary

3653
02:58:39,231 --> 02:58:43,071
Every will use that as an example of like book it's all young men coming

3654
02:58:43,327 --> 02:58:44,863
But what they didn't show

3655
02:58:45,119 --> 02:58:47,423
Is that another boss showed up the next

3656
02:58:47,679 --> 02:58:50,239
With all of the women and children

3657
02:58:50,751 --> 02:58:55,103
They travelled in separate buses because of cultural for

3658
02:58:55,615 --> 02:58:56,383
Yeah it's it's

3659
02:58:57,919 --> 02:58:58,687
What the f***

3660
02:58:59,199 --> 02:59:01,247
What is wrong because it's the other

3661
02:59:01,503 --> 02:59:03,039
It's the other so long as it's

3662
02:59:03,295 --> 02:59:05,343
The other it's ranked

3663
02:59:05,599 --> 02:59:06,111
Rank big

3664
02:59:06,367 --> 02:59:07,135
You will believe

3665
02:59:07,391 --> 02:59:08,415
Anything so long as

3666
02:59:08,671 --> 02:59:09,183
It's your auntie

3667
02:59:09,695 --> 02:59:10,975
The 80% military men

3668
02:59:11,231 --> 02:59:11,743
Statistic is

3669
02:59:11,999 --> 02:59:13,023
F****** horseshit

3670
02:59:13,279 --> 02:59:17,375
The spirit behind it that it's all young men coming cuz it's an invading

3671
02:59:17,631 --> 02:59:18,655
Force

3672
02:59:19,935 --> 02:59:20,959
Because women and children

3673
02:59:22,239 --> 02:59:23,519
They are coming along

3674
02:59:23,775 --> 02:59:25,311
Just don't

3675
02:59:25,567 --> 02:59:30,943
Which I mean we can have it we can have a conversation about how everyone

3676
02:59:31,199 --> 02:59:34,271
That's a different conversation two different conversations

3677
02:59:34,527 --> 02:59:37,087
Now there's also a bunch of reports of people

3678
02:59:37,343 --> 02:59:38,111
Like.

3679
02:59:38,367 --> 02:59:39,135
Showing up alone

3680
02:59:39,391 --> 02:59:39,903
Dudes

3681
02:59:40,159 --> 02:59:44,511
Pulling up alone who taken boats across the Aegean Sea

3682
02:59:47,071 --> 02:59:48,095
To die alone

3683
02:59:51,423 --> 02:59:55,263
And everyone who gets all the boat knows that's a possibility

3684
02:59:56,031 --> 02:59:57,567
So when they get on those boats

3685
02:59:57,823 --> 03:00:01,663
Oftentimes what they do is they go It Alone

3686
03:00:01,919 --> 03:00:03,711
And when they get to where they're going

3687
03:00:04,223 --> 03:00:08,831
Claim the refugee status establish themselves and send for their families

3688
03:00:09,087 --> 03:00:11,647
I don't know I know another place where that happen

3689
03:00:12,671 --> 03:00:14,719
What's it called

3690
03:00:14,975 --> 03:00:21,119
America remember when the Irish

3691
03:00:22,399 --> 03:00:24,447
Do you remember that

3692
03:00:24,703 --> 03:00:25,983
I do

3693
03:00:28,031 --> 03:00:29,823
What do all of those people have in common

3694
03:00:30,335 --> 03:00:31,103
They're fleeing something

3695
03:00:31,359 --> 03:00:32,383
Earthlings

3696
03:00:33,407 --> 03:00:35,967
I remember also how back then when the

3697
03:00:36,223 --> 03:00:36,735
Jews were

3698
03:00:36,991 --> 03:00:38,015
Fling

3699
03:00:38,271 --> 03:00:39,295
Some guy

3700
03:00:41,855 --> 03:00:45,183
I remember their I remember a guy

3701
03:00:45,439 --> 03:00:48,511
Right so they were fleeing from this horrific

3702
03:00:49,023 --> 03:00:49,535
Catastrophe

3703
03:00:50,047 --> 03:00:50,559
That was being

3704
03:00:51,071 --> 03:00:51,583
Visitor

3705
03:00:52,607 --> 03:00:54,655
Due to no fault of their own right

3706
03:00:54,911 --> 03:00:56,959
America

3707
03:00:57,215 --> 03:00:59,775
We can't let these people do it

3708
03:01:00,031 --> 03:01:00,543
It's bad

3709
03:01:00,799 --> 03:01:04,895
They're bringing the same brand of fascism from their world

3710
03:01:05,919 --> 03:01:06,943
I remember

3711
03:01:11,039 --> 03:01:12,319
It's interesting that

3712
03:01:12,831 --> 03:01:15,647
I remember that our memories we have reports

3713
03:01:15,903 --> 03:01:18,207
People who read denied Asylum to

3714
03:01:18,463 --> 03:01:22,303
Literally being murdered cuz they couldn't get over here

3715
03:01:22,559 --> 03:01:24,351
I mean I bet we don't have a

3716
03:01:24,607 --> 03:01:25,375
Many newspapers

3717
03:01:25,887 --> 03:01:26,399
A written word

3718
03:01:30,495 --> 03:01:31,007
There's like

3719
03:01:31,263 --> 03:01:32,799
I mean we didn't even have

3720
03:01:33,055 --> 03:01:33,567
Newspapers back

3721
03:01:34,079 --> 03:01:35,871
Oh wait America's erases f******

3722
03:01:36,383 --> 03:01:36,895
That's always been

3723
03:01:37,407 --> 03:01:39,199
Drive me up a

3724
03:01:39,455 --> 03:01:40,479
Walking wall

3725
03:01:41,759 --> 03:01:44,319
That Alex Jones is making these arguments

3726
03:01:44,575 --> 03:01:45,599
Based on

3727
03:01:45,855 --> 03:01:46,367
Lies

3728
03:01:46,879 --> 03:01:48,927
Based on facts that he's twisting

3729
03:01:49,439 --> 03:01:50,975
And the same episode

3730
03:01:51,487 --> 03:01:55,071
Where he's mad that Muslim women are at Starbucks

3731
03:01:56,607 --> 03:01:58,911
How old is he f****** not realize

3732
03:01:59,167 --> 03:02:00,447
What leaves within him

3733
03:02:00,959 --> 03:02:03,263
How does he not take a look in the mirror and realize

3734
03:02:04,031 --> 03:02:04,799
Maybe it's me

3735
03:02:05,311 --> 03:02:07,103
Maybe I have the problem

3736
03:02:07,871 --> 03:02:09,663
It's not to say that Muslims

3737
03:02:11,967 --> 03:02:15,807
Wide group of people don't include some people

3738
03:02:16,063 --> 03:02:16,831
How do you mean in

3739
03:02:17,087 --> 03:02:23,231
In his group of two billion people you might

3740
03:02:27,583 --> 03:02:31,935
I got to make it clear that I don't think that Muslims have never done anything bad in the world

3741
03:02:32,703 --> 03:02:35,263
That's about the argument I'm making the argument

3742
03:02:35,519 --> 03:02:36,031
Video

3743
03:02:36,287 --> 03:02:37,311
You don't want

3744
03:02:37,567 --> 03:02:38,847
You see them all is

3745
03:02:39,103 --> 03:02:40,127
1

3746
03:02:40,383 --> 03:02:41,919
You see them all is bad

3747
03:02:42,943 --> 03:02:43,455
You

3748
03:02:43,711 --> 03:02:45,503
Refuse to wrestle with it

3749
03:02:46,015 --> 03:02:46,783
Definition

3750
03:02:47,807 --> 03:02:48,575
Absolutely

3751
03:02:48,831 --> 03:02:49,599
That is the difference

3752
03:02:51,391 --> 03:02:53,183
Bill because all trance

3753
03:02:53,439 --> 03:02:57,279
People are bad

3754
03:02:57,535 --> 03:03:02,399
People get married because people are trying to destroy marriages inactivity

3755
03:03:02,655 --> 03:03:03,167
Yeah

3756
03:03:03,679 --> 03:03:04,191
F*** you

3757
03:03:04,447 --> 03:03:06,751
Alright big soapbox moment

3758
03:03:07,007 --> 03:03:08,287
I loved it

3759
03:03:08,543 --> 03:03:09,055
Yours

3760
03:03:09,567 --> 03:03:11,103
Probably

3761
03:03:11,359 --> 03:03:12,127
Coming in this next

3762
03:03:13,663 --> 03:03:19,807
Segment on the show right

3763
03:03:20,063 --> 03:03:22,623
I think because

3764
03:03:22,879 --> 03:03:23,391
Pink

3765
03:03:23,903 --> 03:03:24,415
Isabella climate

3766
03:03:24,927 --> 03:03:27,743
I'm not sure but I am not sure

3767
03:03:27,999 --> 03:03:28,511
Alright

3768
03:03:30,559 --> 03:03:31,839
Your surest guarantee

3769

There any future at all

3770
03:03:33,631 --> 03:03:39,775
Future at all unless you are

3771
03:03:40,031 --> 03:03:40,543
Science Guy

3772
03:03:41,055 --> 03:03:47,199
Bill Nye saves the Earth or space the Earth

3773
03:03:49,503 --> 03:03:53,087
It's all lies lies why isn't another fake

3774
03:03:53,599 --> 03:03:56,927
Election

3775
03:03:58,719 --> 03:03:59,231
5

3776
03:03:59,487 --> 03:04:00,511
5 teleprompter

3777
03:04:01,279 --> 03:04:02,303
B o

3778
03:04:02,815 --> 03:04:04,095
How do you feel about this

3779
03:04:04,351 --> 03:04:04,863
Look

3780
03:04:05,375 --> 03:04:06,655
I am running out

3781
03:04:06,911 --> 03:04:09,215
I'm running out of gas

3782
03:04:09,471 --> 03:04:10,495
Gas on the climate

3783
03:04:13,567 --> 03:04:14,079
It's

3784
03:04:14,591 --> 03:04:17,151
So my my operating

3785
03:04:18,175 --> 03:04:18,687
Is

3786
03:04:19,967 --> 03:04:20,479
Very simple

3787
03:04:21,503 --> 03:04:22,271
4

3788
03:04:24,063 --> 03:04:24,831
Climate scientist

3789
03:04:25,343 --> 03:04:26,623
Have deliberately

3790
03:04:26,879 --> 03:04:27,391
Downplay

3791
03:04:28,159 --> 03:04:28,671
The dangerous

3792
03:04:29,183 --> 03:04:30,207
And they've done this week

3793
03:04:30,463 --> 03:04:31,231
Cuz they don't want

3794
03:04:31,487 --> 03:04:31,999
To look like

3795
03:04:34,047 --> 03:04:34,815
Yeah exactly

3796
03:04:36,351 --> 03:04:37,375
Need to do something about this

3797
03:04:37,631 --> 03:04:39,423
It's really important that we do something

3798
03:04:40,447 --> 03:04:42,239
It's not like I'm saying the skies

3799
03:04:42,495 --> 03:04:48,639
They're like the polite people who want you to leave their house in the morning

3800
03:04:48,895 --> 03:04:51,199
Get the f*** out of my house

3801
03:04:56,319 --> 03:04:58,623
This isn't just an old story about

3802
03:05:00,927 --> 03:05:01,951
Malcolm Gladwell

3803
03:05:06,815 --> 03:05:07,327
Airplane

3804
03:05:07,583 --> 03:05:10,655
So if you listen to the Black boxes

3805
03:05:11,167 --> 03:05:11,679
Of a bunch

3806
03:05:11,935 --> 03:05:12,447
Korean Air

3807
03:05:13,471 --> 03:05:14,751
At the time were the most

3808
03:05:15,007 --> 03:05:15,519
Dangerous

3809
03:05:15,775 --> 03:05:16,287
Airline

3810
03:05:16,543 --> 03:05:17,055
In the world

3811
03:05:17,823 --> 03:05:18,847
5 because they have

3812
03:05:19,103 --> 03:05:19,871
Had the

3813
03:05:20,127 --> 03:05:20,895
Number of planes

3814
03:05:22,175 --> 03:05:22,687
And you're like

3815
03:05:22,943 --> 03:05:23,455
Why

3816
03:05:23,711 --> 03:05:24,735
Does this one place

3817
03:05:25,759 --> 03:05:26,527
Such high

3818
03:05:28,063 --> 03:05:28,831
And they go through all these

3819
03:05:30,111 --> 03:05:30,623
See that

3820
03:05:30,879 --> 03:05:31,647
Pilot get tired

3821
03:05:32,671 --> 03:05:33,183
Copilot

3822
03:05:33,695 --> 03:05:34,207
Because of the

3823
03:05:34,463 --> 03:05:34,975
Culture of

3824
03:05:35,231 --> 03:05:35,743
Deference

3825
03:05:35,999 --> 03:05:37,279
Would be very Jen

3826
03:05:37,535 --> 03:05:38,303
Teal and they're like

3827
03:05:38,559 --> 03:05:39,327
Hey I think

3828
03:05:40,095 --> 03:05:41,119
I think there might be something

3829
03:05:44,703 --> 03:05:45,471
And then boom

3830
03:05:46,239 --> 03:05:50,079
Soda comes from not listening to other voices

3831
03:05:50,335 --> 03:05:52,127
Even when those voices

3832
03:05:53,151 --> 03:05:53,663
Deliberately

3833
03:05:53,919 --> 03:05:55,199
Lee trying to be as deferential

3834
03:05:56,223 --> 03:05:56,991
Nobody's going to get

3835
03:05:57,247 --> 03:05:58,527
The true scope of the emergency

3836
03:05:59,551 --> 03:06:00,575
Vista

3837
03:06:01,087 --> 03:06:02,879
And this is something that I

3838
03:06:03,647 --> 03:06:04,415
It's true and I'm

3839
03:06:05,439 --> 03:06:06,463
Probably right

3840
03:06:07,743 --> 03:06:09,279
All of the stuff they predicted

3841
03:06:10,047 --> 03:06:10,559
60 years in the

3842
03:06:11,583 --> 03:06:12,351
Will be 10 years

3843
03:06:13,887 --> 03:06:16,703
I've heard you make this claim before in a worried you're right

3844
03:06:17,727 --> 03:06:18,239
Absolute

3845
03:06:20,543 --> 03:06:22,591
Jones has claimed that whatever you see

3846
03:06:22,847 --> 03:06:26,431
Time elapsed things about polar ice caps melting

3847
03:06:26,687 --> 03:06:27,199
Is it summer

3848
03:06:27,455 --> 03:06:31,551
They don't show growing back up in the

3849
03:06:33,599 --> 03:06:34,111
Seasons

3850
03:06:34,623 --> 03:06:35,647
Siemens

3851
03:06:36,927 --> 03:06:38,207
Climate is just

3852
03:06:38,463 --> 03:06:38,975
Summer

3853
03:06:39,231 --> 03:06:39,743
Spring

3854
03:06:39,999 --> 03:06:40,767
Winter

3855
03:06:42,815 --> 03:06:43,327
Fireball

3856
03:06:43,583 --> 03:06:45,375
I remember that remember the fifth

3857
03:06:45,631 --> 03:06:47,167
Season

3858
03:06:49,215 --> 03:06:51,775
F****** song greener pastures

3859
03:06:52,799 --> 03:06:57,919
Who cares millions of people who are going to die

3860
03:06:58,175 --> 03:07:01,503
And the thing that kills me is that there is no other way to

3861
03:07:01,759 --> 03:07:02,271
Describe it

3862
03:07:02,527 --> 03:07:04,063
Then if you are a climate change

3863
03:07:04,319 --> 03:07:04,831
Change denier

3864
03:07:05,343 --> 03:07:05,855
You

3865
03:07:06,623 --> 03:07:07,135
Person

3866
03:07:07,903 --> 03:07:08,415
Ark

3867
03:07:10,463 --> 03:07:11,487
Of millions of

3868
03:07:12,255 --> 03:07:13,023
Million

3869
03:07:14,047 --> 03:07:14,559
You think

3870
03:07:16,863 --> 03:07:18,399
PG crisis is bad now right

3871
03:07:19,679 --> 03:07:25,567
Just a f****** imagine whenever sealine border

3872
03:07:26,079 --> 03:07:28,127
Which is my new favorite show on Fox

3873
03:07:32,479 --> 03:07:33,759
Just Florida

3874
03:07:34,015 --> 03:07:37,087
Just Florida a lot of territory in

3875
03:07:37,343 --> 03:07:38,111
In Florida is going to

3876
03:07:38,367 --> 03:07:39,135
Disappeared

3877
03:07:39,391 --> 03:07:42,719
Georgia and Louisiana

3878
03:07:43,231 --> 03:07:45,279
I'm unhappy that

3879
03:07:46,303 --> 03:07:47,071
Scared

3880
03:07:50,655 --> 03:07:54,239
That's only displacement has nothing to do with even like

3881
03:07:54,751 --> 03:08:00,127
Encroaching new deserts unlivable

3882
03:08:00,383 --> 03:08:01,407
Movie Crisis now is

3883
03:08:01,663 --> 03:08:02,175
Is about

3884
03:08:02,431 --> 03:08:02,943
People moving from

3885
03:08:04,223 --> 03:08:04,735
And you think

3886
03:08:04,991 --> 03:08:05,503
Terrorism

3887
03:08:06,527 --> 03:08:07,807
Imagine

3888
03:08:08,063 --> 03:08:08,831
Freshwater

3889
03:08:09,087 --> 03:08:09,599
Becomes the neck

3890
03:08:10,111 --> 03:08:12,159
Well that's how many millions of people

3891
03:08:12,415 --> 03:08:12,927
Fighting over

3892
03:08:13,183 --> 03:08:13,951
Just

3893
03:08:14,207 --> 03:08:14,719
Drinking water

3894
03:08:14,975 --> 03:08:17,279
Portable water

3895
03:08:17,791 --> 03:08:19,327
It's going to get ugly it's going to be

3896
03:08:19,839 --> 03:08:20,351
Roodle

3897
03:08:20,607 --> 03:08:22,143
And Alex Jones

3898
03:08:22,399 --> 03:08:24,191
That's all

3899
03:08:24,447 --> 03:08:28,031
Like it's gone from it's gone from me busy

3900
03:08:28,287 --> 03:08:29,311
Are you

3901
03:08:31,359 --> 03:08:32,639
I'm at the point

3902
03:08:35,711 --> 03:08:36,479
We're all going to die

3903
03:08:37,247 --> 03:08:37,759
It's over

3904
03:08:38,783 --> 03:08:39,295
Fort Lee

3905
03:08:39,807 --> 03:08:40,319
Billy's

3906
03:08:41,855 --> 03:08:42,623
I just

3907
03:08:42,879 --> 03:08:44,415
That I like I used to be like hey

3908
03:08:45,183 --> 03:08:45,695
Guys

3909
03:08:46,207 --> 03:08:47,231
If you're denying climate

3910
03:08:47,743 --> 03:08:48,255
You're killing your grin

3911
03:08:49,023 --> 03:08:50,303
Now I'm at the point where I'm like

3912
03:08:51,839 --> 03:08:52,351
OpenSnow so I can

3913
03:08:54,399 --> 03:08:56,703
I Told You So as we both

3914
03:09:04,639 --> 03:09:05,151
Let's get back

3915
03:09:05,407 --> 03:09:06,431
To modern-day not

3916
03:09:06,687 --> 03:09:08,735
Speculating about the future this is Alex Jones

3917
03:09:08,991 --> 03:09:09,503
Junior

3918
03:09:09,759 --> 03:09:10,271
Real fun

3919
03:09:10,527 --> 03:09:11,295
Big Lots

3920
03:09:11,807 --> 03:09:12,319
On that soapbox

3921
03:09:14,367 --> 03:09:16,159
About Trump and Russia

3922
03:09:18,207 --> 03:09:19,487
We need

3923
03:09:19,743 --> 03:09:20,511
Your help

3924
03:09:21,535 --> 03:09:23,583
Whatever there is

3925
03:09:24,095 --> 03:09:24,863
Review it

3926
03:09:25,631 --> 03:09:28,447
Issue is officially if you can

3927
03:09:29,215 --> 03:09:33,567
Whatever it is

3928
03:09:38,943 --> 03:09:40,479
Whatever it is you got

3929
03:09:56,351 --> 03:09:57,375
I did put Trump

3930
03:09:58,399 --> 03:10:00,703
My vision board absolutely

3931
03:10:01,215 --> 03:10:01,727
Also

3932
03:10:01,983 --> 03:10:03,775
Hey Alex go f*** yourself for

3933
03:10:04,287 --> 03:10:05,567
Getting shity at the secret

3934
03:10:05,823 --> 03:10:07,615
You believe in 12 dimensional demons

3935
03:10:08,127 --> 03:10:13,503
Don't f****** play that game

3936
03:10:13,759 --> 03:10:14,527
I'm going to get

3937
03:10:14,783 --> 03:10:15,295
Him get

3938
03:10:15,551 --> 03:10:16,319
I'm going to let him

3939
03:10:16,831 --> 03:10:17,343
So far in

3940
03:10:18,367 --> 03:10:19,135
And then I'm going to cut it off

3941
03:10:19,647 --> 03:10:20,671
Because there is a

3942
03:10:21,951 --> 03:10:23,231
That there is to be made by

3943
03:10:23,999 --> 03:10:25,279
Will be made

3944
03:10:25,535 --> 03:10:26,303
If you let

3945
03:10:26,559 --> 03:10:28,607
I love you listen

3946
03:10:28,863 --> 03:10:30,143
If you let him finish

3947
03:10:30,655 --> 03:10:33,727
There is like like the Fox news clip

3948
03:10:34,239 --> 03:10:35,519
I don't know if you saw this

3949
03:10:35,775 --> 03:10:38,079
But they went to a Small Town Diner

3950
03:10:38,591 --> 03:10:39,359
StarTalk

3951
03:10:39,615 --> 03:10:41,919
Come to this old dude right about Trump

3952
03:10:42,175 --> 03:10:44,479
Reliably old white dude

3953
03:10:44,735 --> 03:10:46,271
Even the old white dude is like

3954
03:10:46,783 --> 03:10:51,903
Well I think the timing of this whole thing is very subjective a fire

3955
03:10:52,159 --> 03:10:53,951
Interview over

3956
03:10:54,463 --> 03:10:57,023
Like if you allow them

3957
03:10:57,279 --> 03:10:58,559
Ruminate

3958
03:10:58,815 --> 03:11:00,095
On all of this circum

3959
03:11:00,351 --> 03:11:01,119
Stantial evidence

3960
03:11:02,143 --> 03:11:05,215
Even people who are predisposed to agree with you

3961
03:11:05,471 --> 03:11:05,983
It starts to look bad

3962
03:11:06,239 --> 03:11:10,847
Alex Jones claims

3963
03:11:11,103 --> 03:11:13,919
Fox News

3964
03:11:14,175 --> 03:11:16,735
He's not allowing on his own show any contacts

3965
03:11:16,991 --> 03:11:17,503
To develop

3966
03:11:17,759 --> 03:11:19,295
For this thing

3967
03:11:19,551 --> 03:11:22,111
Criticism over like

3968
03:11:22,367 --> 03:11:23,135
He's doing this

3969
03:11:27,231 --> 03:11:27,743
The show

3970
03:11:27,999 --> 03:11:30,047
Dobermans

3971
03:11:30,559 --> 03:11:31,839
10 words during that attack

3972
03:11:32,095 --> 03:11:34,143
Pilots like

3973
03:11:34,399 --> 03:11:35,167
42nd

3974
03:11:36,447 --> 03:11:37,983
But most of the time it's

3975
03:11:45,407 --> 03:11:46,687
Why what's the point

3976
03:11:47,199 --> 03:11:47,967
What do you mean what's the

3977
03:11:48,479 --> 03:11:49,503
The point is

3978
03:11:49,759 --> 03:11:50,271
Obvious

3979
03:11:50,527 --> 03:11:51,295
Know the point

3980
03:11:53,855 --> 03:11:56,415
The point is really simple it's to inoculate

3981
03:11:58,719 --> 03:11:59,487
All of this stuff

3982
03:11:59,999 --> 03:12:01,023
Sounds reasonable if

3983
03:12:01,279 --> 03:12:02,047
If you listen to it

3984
03:12:02,815 --> 03:12:04,095
All the way through

3985
03:12:04,607 --> 03:12:06,911
If you listen to it all the way through what Olbermann

3986
03:12:07,935 --> 03:12:08,447
Sounds reason

3987
03:12:09,983 --> 03:12:10,495
If you take

3988
03:12:10,751 --> 03:12:12,543
Word by word interruption

3989
03:12:12,799 --> 03:12:14,591
Your inoculating your list

3990
03:12:15,359 --> 03:12:16,895
I just had a revelation

3991
03:12:17,663 --> 03:12:18,175
So basic

3992
03:12:18,943 --> 03:12:19,967
What is it about the 7th

3993
03:12:20,479 --> 03:12:23,039
Know about the seventh Elion

3994
03:12:23,295 --> 03:12:25,087
They're attacking

3995
03:12:25,599 --> 03:12:27,903
The hitting Florida right now

3996
03:12:28,415 --> 03:12:29,951
So

3997
03:12:30,207 --> 03:12:31,743
460 years

3998
03:12:32,255 --> 03:12:34,303
You said

3999
03:12:34,815 --> 03:12:36,095
So I think

4000
03:12:36,351 --> 03:12:39,679
Okay so Alex is imagining a world where a bunch of people have watched

4001
03:12:39,935 --> 03:12:40,447
The old

4002
03:12:40,703 --> 03:12:43,007
Watch it all the way through

4003
03:12:43,263 --> 03:12:45,055
Making sure that his illicit

4004
03:12:46,079 --> 03:12:47,359
Can argue with them

4005
03:12:47,871 --> 03:12:48,383
Right

4006
03:12:48,639 --> 03:12:50,175
With point-by-point

4007
03:12:51,455 --> 03:12:52,991
Here's an objection you can make eggs

4008
03:12:53,247 --> 03:12:53,759
Exactly

4009
03:12:54,015 --> 03:12:54,783
Whooping

4010
03:12:55,295 --> 03:12:58,623
But everyone who's seen the old will just blindly accept whatever

4011
03:12:58,879 --> 03:13:00,671
And in that case

4012
03:13:00,927 --> 03:13:02,719
His listeners would win that

4013
03:13:03,231 --> 03:13:03,743
Cuz they're just

4014
03:13:03,999 --> 03:13:05,279
Noxious and bringing up stuff

4015
03:13:05,535 --> 03:13:07,071
That the Overman listeners

4016
03:13:07,327 --> 03:13:09,119
Like I don't know what you're talkin about

4017
03:13:12,191 --> 03:13:16,799
North Korea's nuclear program

4018
03:13:17,055 --> 03:13:19,871
If you were in a conversation with one of Alex Jones

4019
03:13:20,383 --> 03:13:22,431
I don't know about that doesn't sound good but I don't know about

4020
03:13:25,247 --> 03:13:30,111
They get aggressive with you doesn't go well if you go

4021
03:13:31,391 --> 03:13:33,951
I don't know about that

4022
03:13:34,207 --> 03:13:35,231
I need to Google this

4023
03:13:37,023 --> 03:13:38,559
Unfortunately

4024
03:13:38,815 --> 03:13:39,327
Rhetoric

4025
03:13:39,583 --> 03:13:40,095
A lot of it

4026
03:13:41,375 --> 03:13:41,887
Reality

4027
03:13:42,143 --> 03:13:43,935
Especially when it's super aggressive rhetoric

4028
03:13:48,287 --> 03:13:49,055
This next

4029
03:13:49,311 --> 03:13:49,823
Alex

4030
03:13:50,079 --> 03:13:50,591
F******

4031
03:13:50,847 --> 03:13:52,127
Completely take

4032
03:13:52,383 --> 03:13:53,151
Two words

4033
03:13:56,223 --> 03:13:56,991
Out of context

4034
03:13:57,247 --> 03:13:58,271
And pretends their bib

4035
03:13:58,783 --> 03:14:00,831
It's wild it's wild

4036
03:14:01,087 --> 03:14:03,391
Just listen to this closely

4037
03:14:03,647 --> 03:14:04,671
Don't talk over there

4038
03:14:04,927 --> 03:14:06,207
It's pretty quick

4039
03:14:12,095 --> 03:14:15,679
Pure and ask yourself

4040
03:14:16,191 --> 03:14:17,727
If there is any

4041
03:14:22,079 --> 03:14:24,895
Look to the last year

4042
03:14:25,151 --> 03:14:25,919
He's talking with the last

4043
03:14:26,175 --> 03:14:32,319
Few days

4044
03:14:38,975 --> 03:14:42,559
He's got to talk about apocalypse

4045
03:14:48,447 --> 03:14:49,215
So f***** up

4046
03:14:50,751 --> 03:14:52,287
It's it is

4047
03:14:52,543 --> 03:14:53,311
This is what I'm saying about this

4048
03:14:54,335 --> 03:14:55,103
This is very much

4049
03:14:55,871 --> 03:14:56,383
Alex

4050
03:14:57,919 --> 03:14:58,687
You're on

4051
03:15:00,735 --> 03:15:01,503
You are mine

4052
03:15:02,015 --> 03:15:03,551
This is where I

4053
03:15:04,319 --> 03:15:05,855
So don't f*** with me

4054
03:15:07,391 --> 03:15:09,951
Conspiracy territory in Utah

4055
03:15:10,207 --> 03:15:11,743
And Oldman is

4056
03:15:11,999 --> 03:15:12,767
Is doing that

4057
03:15:13,279 --> 03:15:13,791
Like

4058
03:15:14,047 --> 03:15:14,559
He might be

4059
03:15:14,815 --> 03:15:15,327
Right

4060
03:15:15,583 --> 03:15:18,655
And I definitely don't rule it out right now

4061
03:15:19,167 --> 03:15:21,727
But over it is definitely stepping into Russia

4062
03:15:21,983 --> 03:15:22,495
Conspiracy theory

4063
03:15:24,031 --> 03:15:27,615
Towers into let's not get into it

4064
03:15:27,871 --> 03:15:29,151
Just Auto very

4065
03:15:29,919 --> 03:15:30,943
Superficial

4066
03:15:32,479 --> 03:15:34,527
We do have to be super careful

4067
03:15:35,807 --> 03:15:36,575
Ourselves

4068
03:15:37,087 --> 03:15:40,415
And I think everyone else should as well about getting caught up

4069
03:15:40,671 --> 03:15:41,695
And momentum

4070
03:15:42,207 --> 03:15:44,767
With Conspiracy Theory on

4071
03:15:45,023 --> 03:15:47,071
Because we've seen what it's done to the right

4072
03:15:47,327 --> 03:15:48,095
It is this

4073
03:15:48,607 --> 03:15:49,119
But like

4074
03:15:49,631 --> 03:15:51,423
When we talk about Louise Mensch

4075
03:15:52,703 --> 03:15:56,031
Okay look

4076
03:15:56,287 --> 03:16:02,431
Right if I got you I got you I got you I'm not here to defend her she's wrong a lot of the time

4077
03:16:02,687 --> 03:16:04,479
But she is part of that

4078
03:16:04,735 --> 03:16:06,783
Hemisphere

4079
03:16:07,039 --> 03:16:07,551
Twitter

4080
03:16:07,807 --> 03:16:08,831
That has become

4081
03:16:09,343 --> 03:16:10,879
Bhldn

4082
03:16:11,135 --> 03:16:11,647
2

4083
03:16:11,903 --> 03:16:12,927
Rampant speculation

4084
03:16:16,511 --> 03:16:18,047
Maybe more right

4085
03:16:18,303 --> 03:16:24,447
Then the conservative side absolute but at the same time it's dangerous because there's a lot of things that are wrong to get forgot

4086
03:16:24,703 --> 03:16:26,239
Cotton when I write things

4087
03:16:26,495 --> 03:16:27,007
So

4088
03:16:27,263 --> 03:16:27,775
Well it's

4089
03:16:30,847 --> 03:16:31,359
Fortune teller

4090
03:16:32,127 --> 03:16:33,919
You remember when the fortune teller got it right

4091
03:16:34,175 --> 03:16:35,711
Don't remember all the

4092
03:16:39,295 --> 03:16:40,575
When we talk about Russian

4093
03:16:40,831 --> 03:16:41,855
I think

4094
03:16:42,111 --> 03:16:42,879
We're not

4095
03:16:43,135 --> 03:16:45,951
Saying we have any real secret knowledge

4096
03:16:46,207 --> 03:16:48,511
We're saying it looks bad

4097
03:16:49,023 --> 03:16:53,375
Based on the things that are concretely reported there is not nothing

4098
03:16:57,215 --> 03:16:57,727
I think

4099
03:16:57,983 --> 03:17:00,031
I think are our main

4100
03:17:00,287 --> 03:17:00,799
Summation

4101
03:17:01,055 --> 03:17:01,567
Insofar

4102
03:17:03,359 --> 03:17:03,871
Russian

4103
03:17:04,639 --> 03:17:05,151
Is

4104
03:17:06,431 --> 03:17:06,943
Is

4105
03:17:08,479 --> 03:17:09,247
The architect

4106
03:17:09,503 --> 03:17:10,271
Something

4107
03:17:10,783 --> 03:17:11,807
We know these

4108
03:17:12,063 --> 03:17:13,087
People have

4109
03:17:13,855 --> 03:17:15,391
With a guy who is a

4110
03:17:17,695 --> 03:17:18,975
Front

4111
03:17:21,023 --> 03:17:22,047
So we know that there's

4112
03:17:22,303 --> 03:17:22,815
There's all kinds

4113
03:17:23,071 --> 03:17:23,583
Shabby chic

4114
03:17:24,095 --> 03:17:25,631
There's a lot of circumstantial

4115
03:17:25,887 --> 03:17:27,679
We don't have a Smoking Gun

4116
03:17:28,447 --> 03:17:31,519
But at least my operating

4117
03:17:32,031 --> 03:17:32,799
Is there is this

4118
03:17:36,383 --> 03:17:37,151
Through this that doesn't

4119
03:17:37,407 --> 03:17:37,919
Kill Millie

4120
03:17:38,431 --> 03:17:39,967
That's where we come from

4121
03:17:40,223 --> 03:17:44,575
So what if it's important

4122
03:17:44,831 --> 03:17:45,343
Become

4123
03:17:45,855 --> 03:17:48,159
And don't allow a left-wing Alex Jones

4124
03:17:48,415 --> 03:17:49,439
2xist

4125
03:17:49,695 --> 03:17:51,999
Yeah because if that person does exist

4126
03:17:52,767 --> 03:17:53,791
You're just going to get

4127
03:17:54,047 --> 03:17:56,607
It's just going to be an infinite psychotherapy

4128
03:17:57,119 --> 03:17:58,143
It's

4129
03:17:58,399 --> 03:18:00,191
If it's an eye-for-an-eye everybody's blah

4130
03:18:00,959 --> 03:18:01,471
Absolutely

4131
03:18:04,287 --> 03:18:05,567
He's putting his toe into

4132
03:18:05,823 --> 03:18:08,383
The water

4133
03:18:08,639 --> 03:18:10,175
Angling for

4134
03:18:10,431 --> 03:18:10,943
Again

4135
03:18:11,967 --> 03:18:15,551
Is it cuz she's not a demagogue

4136
03:18:16,831 --> 03:18:19,391
Sullivan Real McCoys

4137
03:18:19,647 --> 03:18:21,439
I'm saying that

4138
03:18:21,695 --> 03:18:23,743
Who is legitimately

4139
03:18:23,999 --> 03:18:26,047
Conversation cuz he is on

4140
03:18:26,303 --> 03:18:29,375
The internet as a as a video personality

4141
03:18:29,631 --> 03:18:30,655
As a newscaster

4142
03:18:31,167 --> 03:18:32,191
What let me put it in

4143
03:18:32,447 --> 03:18:33,983
In the way that I've already

4144
03:18:34,495 --> 03:18:35,007
Right

4145
03:18:36,543 --> 03:18:37,311
Trump facts

4146
03:18:37,567 --> 03:18:38,079
Executed

4147
03:18:38,591 --> 03:18:39,103
Judicially

4148
03:18:40,127 --> 03:18:41,151
I want him to be

4149
03:18:41,407 --> 03:18:41,919
Tried

4150
03:18:43,199 --> 03:18:43,967
And then because he

4151
03:18:44,223 --> 03:18:45,247
Committed that I want him

4152
03:18:46,271 --> 03:18:47,039
Punished

4153
03:18:47,551 --> 03:18:48,575
For treason in the way that it's

4154
03:18:48,831 --> 03:18:50,367
And if the fact that he

4155
03:18:50,623 --> 03:18:52,415
He didn't want him to

4156
03:18:53,695 --> 03:18:54,207
Right

4157
03:18:54,463 --> 03:18:56,767
That's how

4158
03:18:57,023 --> 03:19:00,863
But I really like

4159
03:19:01,119 --> 03:19:03,935
If if my stated goal is I want him to be

4160
03:19:04,959 --> 03:19:05,983
The way that you should be

4161
03:19:07,519 --> 03:19:10,079
Home from the neck till dead broke his watch

4162
03:19:10,335 --> 03:19:13,919
I don't want you forever

4163
03:19:14,175 --> 03:19:14,687
Fair enough

4164
03:19:14,943 --> 03:19:15,967
But I don't want him

4165
03:19:17,759 --> 03:19:18,271
Extra

4166
03:19:19,295 --> 03:19:21,087
So in the same way

4167
03:19:21,599 --> 03:19:22,111
I want

4168
03:19:23,391 --> 03:19:24,159
I don't want him

4169
03:19:24,415 --> 03:19:26,207
I'm gone because of a whole series

4170
03:19:26,719 --> 03:19:27,231
Conspiracy theory

4171
03:19:27,999 --> 03:19:29,535
True because that is the

4172
03:19:29,791 --> 03:19:33,119
The same narrative

4173
03:19:33,631 --> 03:19:34,911
Thursday right

4174
03:19:37,983 --> 03:19:38,495
FAQ

4175
03:19:38,751 --> 03:19:39,263
Above

4176
03:19:39,519 --> 03:19:40,799
Agenda and narrative

4177
03:19:41,055 --> 03:19:43,615
Yeah it's beyond that also I mean

4178
03:19:44,639 --> 03:19:46,943
Trump's already done is enough

4179
03:19:47,711 --> 03:19:48,479
Totally

4180
03:19:48,991 --> 03:19:50,527
Even just

4181
03:19:51,039 --> 03:19:54,879
Of course that you can't it's not

4182
03:19:55,391 --> 03:19:56,415
There's a

4183
03:19:56,671 --> 03:19:57,439
Institution early service

4184
03:20:00,255 --> 03:20:03,583
Insane the punishment should absolutely be

4185
03:20:03,839 --> 03:20:04,351
Commensurate with the

4186
03:20:05,375 --> 03:20:06,399
And I don't want

4187
03:20:06,655 --> 03:20:07,167
To get into

4188
03:20:07,423 --> 03:20:07,935
That same

4189
03:20:08,191 --> 03:20:08,959
Kangaroo court

4190
03:20:09,471 --> 03:20:12,287
Anime

4191
03:20:13,055 --> 03:20:16,127
Wiggle wiggle

4192
03:20:16,383 --> 03:20:16,895
Like we got some good

4193
03:20:17,151 --> 03:20:19,199
Policy wonks out there good heads on their shoulders

4194
03:20:23,807 --> 03:20:24,831
Because here's the thing

4195
03:20:25,343 --> 03:20:28,159
If you have people like Louise Mensch on this side

4196
03:20:30,975 --> 03:20:34,047
I meant also back to the other side

4197
03:20:34,559 --> 03:20:38,655
The thing that sort of Unites them as this idea of they have a savior

4198
03:20:39,679 --> 03:20:42,239
After is the I'm going to save everybody

4199
03:20:42,751 --> 03:20:44,287
And that is a dangerous thing

4200
03:20:44,543 --> 03:20:45,311
Like I said

4201
03:20:45,567 --> 03:20:46,079
Lunchtime

4202
03:20:48,639 --> 03:20:51,711
I would love for people who are beholden to Alex Jones asphalt narrative

4203
03:20:52,223 --> 03:20:53,759
Did recognize that he's lying.

4204
03:20:54,015 --> 03:20:55,551
Terrorist

4205
03:20:55,807 --> 03:20:56,831
I do it or they just

4206
03:20:57,855 --> 03:20:59,135
Breakthrough one day

4207
03:20:59,391 --> 03:21:01,951
Amazon idiot

4208
03:21:04,511 --> 03:21:05,023
We got it

4209
03:21:06,559 --> 03:21:07,583
Likes pain

4210
03:21:08,607 --> 03:21:10,143
Better than Alex Jones

4211
03:21:10,399 --> 03:21:11,935
Talk about it for a little bit

4212
03:21:12,447 --> 03:21:13,215
It is a

4213
03:21:13,471 --> 03:21:13,983
Pendulum

4214
03:21:15,519 --> 03:21:21,663
My transition game blew it again

4215
03:21:22,687 --> 03:21:23,711
We need it now

4216
03:21:24,735 --> 03:21:26,783
This country

4217
03:21:34,719 --> 03:21:39,839
Vincent Edwards

4218
03:21:48,799 --> 03:21:50,079
Blowhard

4219
03:21:50,335 --> 03:21:55,967
This makes me

4220
03:21:56,223 --> 03:22:01,343
Now I'm interrupting

4221
03:22:02,623 --> 03:22:05,183
Is playing by no rules

4222
03:22:05,951 --> 03:22:06,719
The Trump

4223
03:22:10,559 --> 03:22:11,327
This guy

4224
03:22:13,119 --> 03:22:15,167
This is

4225
03:22:15,935 --> 03:22:17,983
Over the top

4226
03:22:18,239 --> 03:22:24,383
Trump responds nicely anime

4227
03:22:24,639 --> 03:22:29,759
Freak out and go

4228
03:22:30,015 --> 03:22:36,159
Support office

4229
03:22:36,415 --> 03:22:39,231
Supposed to resist

4230
03:22:39,743 --> 03:22:41,791
Bulshit

4231
03:22:42,047 --> 03:22:42,559
Hakama

4232
03:22:45,375 --> 03:22:45,887
Sure

4233
03:22:46,655 --> 03:22:52,799
Dobermans Casino time

4234
03:22:53,055 --> 03:22:54,335
You know him

4235
03:22:54,591 --> 03:22:57,663
Him being like Oh you think you're the only person who can say

4236
03:22:58,175 --> 03:23:03,551
I'm the only person who can save the world from Goblin that's what was energized

4237
03:23:04,063 --> 03:23:05,855
That's why he has his

4238
03:23:06,111 --> 03:23:07,391
Is is

4239
03:23:07,647 --> 03:23:09,183
Is Israel

4240
03:23:09,439 --> 03:23:10,463
Is that expression hack

4241
03:23:10,719 --> 03:23:11,487
Hackles

4242
03:23:14,815 --> 03:23:15,583
He's rankle

4243
03:23:17,375 --> 03:23:18,911
That's why it is this like

4244
03:23:19,935 --> 03:23:20,959
Again you're on my turf

4245
03:23:21,215 --> 03:23:23,007
Yeah you're on my f****** turf

4246
03:23:25,823 --> 03:23:27,615
I think I think it really is that

4247
03:23:28,127 --> 03:23:31,455
I think you're absolutely right like

4248
03:23:33,247 --> 03:23:33,759
Alex

4249
03:23:34,015 --> 03:23:34,527
Getting to

4250
03:23:34,783 --> 03:23:35,551
Parallel

4251
03:23:36,319 --> 03:23:38,111
Liberal Alex Jones

4252
03:23:38,623 --> 03:23:39,135
A little bit

4253
03:23:39,391 --> 03:23:42,719
Not nearly as absolute

4254
03:23:42,975 --> 03:23:44,767
But but the point being Alex

4255
03:23:45,279 --> 03:23:46,815
To come at him from this like

4256
03:23:47,839 --> 03:23:49,375
Your

4257
03:23:49,631 --> 03:23:50,399
Left-wing proper

4258
03:23:51,679 --> 03:23:53,471
You know it's like Alex

4259
03:23:53,727 --> 03:23:54,495
Being off

4260
03:23:54,751 --> 03:23:56,799
Watching history

4261
03:23:57,311 --> 03:24:03,455
Except except except Alex

4262
03:24:03,711 --> 03:24:06,527
Still permeated

4263
03:24:06,783 --> 03:24:08,831
Repeat

4264
03:24:09,087 --> 03:24:13,439
But he's watching respect

4265
03:24:14,463 --> 03:24:19,327
So we kind of get a glimpse of what are podcasts would be if he was on it

4266
03:24:19,583 --> 03:24:23,423
Bother about the orbs

4267
03:24:23,679 --> 03:24:25,215
Is there anything along those lines

4268
03:24:25,471 --> 03:24:28,031
With is a f****** awesome

4269
03:24:28,543 --> 03:24:29,823
Again totally Patty

4270
03:24:30,079 --> 03:24:32,127
And it gets into that idea of what

4271
03:24:32,639 --> 03:24:33,407
Really

4272
03:24:33,663 --> 03:24:34,687
When he talks about like

4273
03:24:36,223 --> 03:24:37,759
Will share its appearance

4274
03:24:38,015 --> 03:24:38,527
Baisden

4275
03:24:44,159 --> 03:24:49,023
By reading a TV news

4276
03:24:50,047 --> 03:24:51,583
They have no rules

4277
03:24:55,935 --> 03:24:57,471
We can have no rules either

4278
03:24:57,983 --> 03:25:01,311
We will take the risk of re-establishing

4279
03:25:01,823 --> 03:25:04,639
Would you

4280
03:25:04,895 --> 03:25:07,455
In the Justice Department

4281
03:25:07,711 --> 03:25:08,479
We also

4282
03:25:08,735 --> 03:25:09,247
Mead

4283
03:25:12,831 --> 03:25:13,855
It may disappear

4284
03:25:16,671 --> 03:25:17,951
May disappear as well

4285
03:25:18,463 --> 03:25:19,231
What's up

4286
03:25:33,567 --> 03:25:36,383
Everything they claim Trump's doing

4287
03:25:40,735 --> 03:25:42,783
Had to pull it down

4288
03:25:46,623 --> 03:25:50,975
Celebrated and celebrate

4289
03:26:00,191 --> 03:26:04,543
Alright well that's

4290
03:26:05,055 --> 03:26:09,663
Take an absolutely attack

4291
03:26:11,455 --> 03:26:14,783
And then put always the same guys like Stephen Colbert and

4292
03:26:15,039 --> 03:26:21,183
Obermann and non-threatening

4293
03:26:28,095 --> 03:26:34,239
Argument

4294
03:26:36,031 --> 03:26:42,175
Nonthreatening picking up young college girls in high school girls

4295
03:26:43,711 --> 03:26:49,855
Where you going to break

4296
03:26:58,303 --> 03:27:03,935
He realizes he's losing

4297
03:27:04,191 --> 03:27:07,775
That's so much projection of the action of a

4298
03:27:08,287 --> 03:27:09,823
He realizes he's losing

4299
03:27:10,335 --> 03:27:11,103
And he's panic

4300
03:27:12,895 --> 03:27:13,407
Alex

4301
03:27:13,663 --> 03:27:14,175
Mirror

4302
03:27:14,431 --> 03:27:16,223
Mirror

4303
03:27:16,735 --> 03:27:18,015
Meanwhile

4304
03:27:19,295 --> 03:27:19,807
Alex

4305
03:27:20,319 --> 03:27:20,831
Sit down

4306
03:27:21,343 --> 03:27:21,855
With that bottle

4307
03:27:23,903 --> 03:27:24,415
Look in the mirror

4308
03:27:26,463 --> 03:27:28,511
There's a lot of people who used to wear a gray suit

4309
03:27:28,767 --> 03:27:29,279
Black tie

4310
03:27:30,559 --> 03:27:31,839
Nope

4311
03:27:34,911 --> 03:27:35,423
What were you saying

4312
03:27:35,679 --> 03:27:36,959
Ted Bundy

4313
03:27:38,751 --> 03:27:39,263
It's

4314
03:27:42,335 --> 03:27:46,943
Where at where at where at seven and a half hour it's so much not we've added about

4315
03:27:47,199 --> 03:27:48,479
3 hours of this lady

4316
03:27:48,735 --> 03:27:53,087
We're coming to the end of this but it's like

4317
03:27:55,135 --> 03:28:00,511
To when we've had a lot of stuff you can respond to

4318
03:28:00,767 --> 03:28:02,047
You are Trump

4319
03:28:02,303 --> 03:28:06,911
Donors who are we

4320
03:28:07,423 --> 03:28:08,447
Nuclear program

4321
03:28:08,703 --> 03:28:10,495
It's really tough for her to be like

4322
03:28:10,751 --> 03:28:16,895
This guy dresses to try and trick you don't know I don't I don't care

4323
03:28:17,151 --> 03:28:21,759
Appearances

4324
03:28:22,015 --> 03:28:28,159
Magazine article on how many people who dress like 60 but what about the

4325
03:28:28,415 --> 03:28:34,559
Percentage of the global population that dresses like that that is also a cereal

4326
03:28:34,815 --> 03:28:35,327
You're no good

4327
03:28:35,583 --> 03:28:39,167
Here's a stat that I can tell you I was Jones

4328
03:28:39,423 --> 03:28:41,727
100-percent again was doing that like

4329
03:28:42,239 --> 03:28:48,383
Cute dresses

4330
03:28:51,199 --> 03:28:56,319
I'm going to watch him until that I would have six months ago but I'm going to walk it back

4331
03:28:58,879 --> 03:29:02,975
That's good. Stay Harbor your phone

4332
03:29:03,487 --> 03:29:03,999
So that is nice

4333
03:29:04,255 --> 03:29:06,559
Is just Alex Jones f****** losing it

4334
03:29:06,815 --> 03:29:08,095
The temperature really hard

4335
03:29:09,375 --> 03:29:09,887
Flashing

4336
03:29:10,143 --> 03:29:11,167
The beginning of the episode

4337
03:29:11,423 --> 03:29:12,959
Him talking about how like

4338
03:29:13,215 --> 03:29:14,239
He's in control

4339
03:29:14,495 --> 03:29:15,775
Listen to this clip in

4340
03:29:16,031 --> 03:29:19,103
If he's in control of himself

4341
03:29:20,639 --> 03:29:21,407
Alright buddy

4342
03:29:27,807 --> 03:29:30,111
I forgot the milk as well and I

4343
03:29:30,879 --> 03:29:33,695
Throwing stuff during the breaks

4344
03:29:36,767 --> 03:29:37,279
I mean

4345
03:29:38,559 --> 03:29:40,607
Beckley wasn't like him screaming but

4346
03:29:40,863 --> 03:29:42,143
That's a horrible

4347
03:29:42,399 --> 03:29:43,167
Things to learn

4348
03:29:44,191 --> 03:29:46,751
He was throwing things during the break because

4349
03:29:47,007 --> 03:29:48,543
He had listened to an old woman

4350
03:29:50,591 --> 03:29:52,127
Alex Jones is my greatest

4351
03:29:54,175 --> 03:29:58,527
I disagree and can disprove most of his worldview

4352
03:29:58,783 --> 03:30:00,319
She makes me really mad

4353
03:30:00,831 --> 03:30:01,599
When I listen to it

4354
03:30:04,159 --> 03:30:04,927
To deal with that

4355
03:30:05,183 --> 03:30:07,999
Inger Stevens

4356
03:30:08,511 --> 03:30:12,095
And then I think about how fun it's going to be when I prove him wrong

4357
03:30:12,607 --> 03:30:16,703
That is how I deal with that I don't necessarily when I'm at work and I'm listening to him

4358
03:30:17,215 --> 03:30:17,727
Don't like

4359
03:30:17,983 --> 03:30:22,079
Throw my computer across the room or something like that

4360
03:30:23,103 --> 03:30:24,639
In his defense

4361
03:30:25,151 --> 03:30:27,967
Pretty much what

4362
03:30:28,479 --> 03:30:34,623
Like a physical manifestation of your anger the Alex

4363
03:30:34,879 --> 03:30:36,927
Laughing

4364
03:30:37,183 --> 03:30:37,695
I am

4365
03:30:37,951 --> 03:30:41,791
The screaming is mostly you just externalize and surprise

4366
03:30:42,047 --> 03:30:43,327
It's not really real

4367
03:30:43,583 --> 03:30:46,399
Embedded within it

4368
03:30:47,423 --> 03:30:49,727
Go home anyting but

4369
03:30:49,983 --> 03:30:52,543
Visibly shook by the reality that

4370
03:30:55,359 --> 03:30:56,895
Alex Jones

4371
03:30:57,151 --> 03:30:58,687
You can't control his temper

4372
03:30:58,943 --> 03:31:00,223
TF2 little baby

4373
03:31:00,479 --> 03:31:02,271
Yeah he's a baby man

4374
03:31:02,527 --> 03:31:06,367
If he could lift your baby if he were the Butt Boy from

4375
03:31:07,647 --> 03:31:08,159
Man

4376
03:31:10,207 --> 03:31:10,975
Maybe

4377
03:31:12,511 --> 03:31:13,535
You know what I meant

4378
03:31:14,815 --> 03:31:15,327
I don't

4379
03:31:15,839 --> 03:31:16,607
It's hard to say

4380
03:31:17,119 --> 03:31:17,631
I think if you

4381
03:31:18,911 --> 03:31:19,423
Visita

4382
03:31:20,959 --> 03:31:22,751
My bigger theory is

4383
03:31:23,263 --> 03:31:25,311
His life is being ruined by his own supper

4384
03:31:31,455 --> 03:31:32,479
Can Superman vitality

4385
03:31:32,991 --> 03:31:35,039
Testosterone, s***

4386
03:31:35,551 --> 03:31:37,343
And so he is wrapped himself up

4387
03:31:37,855 --> 03:31:38,367
Way too much.

4388
03:31:41,695 --> 03:31:42,463
He's experiencing all of this

4389
03:31:42,719 --> 03:31:43,231
Anguirus

4390
03:31:43,487 --> 03:31:43,999
Rate

4391
03:31:44,255 --> 03:31:44,767
Cause of death

4392
03:31:45,023 --> 03:31:47,583
Inability to control his behavior

4393
03:31:49,375 --> 03:31:51,935
PennyMac

4394
03:31:52,447 --> 03:31:53,727
Do not do that

4395
03:31:54,751 --> 03:31:58,079
Super Super Size Me thing where you take a lot of

4396
03:31:58,847 --> 03:32:03,455
Do not want to deal with aggressive dad

4397
03:32:05,247 --> 03:32:08,319
Listen never had to restrain you before

4398
03:32:09,087 --> 03:32:11,135
And throwing stuff

4399
03:32:11,647 --> 03:32:12,927
Can we listen to

4400
03:32:14,207 --> 03:32:19,583
That is a theory that I'm going to be working out over the course of a number of these

4401
03:32:19,839 --> 03:32:20,863
Time travel episode

4402
03:32:21,119 --> 03:32:22,911
I think that you can't

4403
03:32:23,167 --> 03:32:25,215
Attract a very different

4404
03:32:25,471 --> 03:32:26,495
The philosophy and terms

4405
03:32:26,751 --> 03:32:27,263
The globalist

4406
03:32:27,519 --> 03:32:29,311
Like that is absolutely

4407
03:32:29,567 --> 03:32:31,359
Yeah but the behavior the freak

4408
03:32:31,615 --> 03:32:32,383
Currency of outbursts

4409
03:32:32,895 --> 03:32:33,407
The inability to

4410
03:32:33,663 --> 03:32:34,431
Control

4411
03:32:34,687 --> 03:32:36,991
Is very much like he was as a child

4412
03:32:37,503 --> 03:32:38,783
Like we talked about

4413
03:32:39,039 --> 03:32:39,807
We've documented

4414
03:32:40,063 --> 03:32:40,831
The number of times

4415
03:32:41,087 --> 03:32:41,855
Ann Arbor

4416
03:32:42,111 --> 03:32:43,391
Give him all of these

4417
03:32:43,903 --> 03:32:45,439
Incredibly violent outbursts

4418
03:32:45,951 --> 03:32:47,743
Please fight that he get into

4419
03:32:47,999 --> 03:32:48,767
Camas

4420
03:32:49,023 --> 03:32:51,839
You don't see a ton of that necessarily and adult life

4421
03:32:53,375 --> 03:32:54,655
Until

4422
03:32:54,911 --> 03:32:56,703
Wave closer to that now

4423
03:32:56,959 --> 03:32:59,007
In terms of like you don't see it on the show

4424
03:32:59,263 --> 03:33:01,567
But you just admitted the last time

4425
03:33:01,823 --> 03:33:03,871
He was throwing shade

4426
03:33:07,967 --> 03:33:09,247
More than just when he listen

4427
03:33:10,783 --> 03:33:13,599
Colbert

4428
03:33:14,111 --> 03:33:16,415
If you will both of them

4429
03:33:16,671 --> 03:33:17,695
And if you

4430
03:33:17,951 --> 03:33:19,487
Exhibiting those sorts of behaviors

4431
03:33:19,999 --> 03:33:21,023
Adams being a b

4432
03:33:21,535 --> 03:33:22,047
Safeer

4433
03:33:22,303 --> 03:33:23,583
I don't think he is

4434
03:33:24,607 --> 03:33:25,631
To be around

4435
03:33:26,399 --> 03:33:27,935
Like if he has that kind of

4436
03:33:28,447 --> 03:33:31,519
Like hair-trigger disagrees with

4437
03:33:31,775 --> 03:33:32,799
We'll send him into a rave wear

4438
03:33:33,055 --> 03:33:34,079
He breaks things

4439
03:33:34,335 --> 03:33:36,895
That's not someone who can be trusted around

4440
03:33:37,407 --> 03:33:37,919
Growing

4441
03:33:38,687 --> 03:33:39,199
Humans

4442
03:33:39,455 --> 03:33:40,735
I think this

4443
03:33:40,991 --> 03:33:43,295
Is where we are out of our

4444
03:33:44,575 --> 03:33:49,695
That's why I think this is the one where

4445
03:33:49,951 --> 03:33:51,231
His kids are not living

4446
03:33:51,487 --> 03:33:52,511
With him full-time and I feel

4447
03:33:53,023 --> 03:33:55,583
If you listen to this podcast you know that's probably

4448
03:33:56,351 --> 03:33:56,863
For the best

4449
03:33:57,119 --> 03:33:59,679
And again I want it I want to stress

4450
03:34:00,959 --> 03:34:01,983
Don't buy his product

4451
03:34:02,495 --> 03:34:05,567
They are deteriorating

4452
03:34:06,335 --> 03:34:07,871
I think there are negative

4453
03:34:08,127 --> 03:34:09,151
Sequin tracking him

4454
03:34:10,687 --> 03:34:14,015
Tomorrow we're going to be doing an episode come out later in the week

4455
03:34:16,575 --> 03:34:17,343
About an episode 4

4456
03:34:17,599 --> 03:34:18,111
2014

4457
03:34:18,367 --> 03:34:19,135
Haha

4458
03:34:19,647 --> 03:34:20,159
We'll see

4459
03:34:20,415 --> 03:34:21,439
Fresh

4460
03:34:21,951 --> 03:34:22,975
Market

4461
03:34:23,999 --> 03:34:24,511
So

4462
03:34:24,767 --> 03:34:25,279
Anyway

4463
03:34:25,535 --> 03:34:27,327
Finish this s*** out

4464
03:34:27,583 --> 03:34:28,607
We Are One More clip

4465
03:34:28,863 --> 03:34:31,935
This is the end of his analysis

4466
03:34:33,215 --> 03:34:33,983
And

4467
03:34:35,007 --> 03:34:35,519
It's dumb

4468
03:34:39,359 --> 03:34:40,127
Prevent this day

4469
03:34:40,383 --> 03:34:41,407
Others less so

4470
03:34:41,919 --> 03:34:43,199
Right now it doesn't matter

4471
03:34:55,231 --> 03:34:56,767
Lecture

4472
03:34:57,279 --> 03:35:00,607
You've got to be the Patriots now

4473
03:35:05,215 --> 03:35:11,359
Overtime

4474
03:35:16,479 --> 03:35:19,039
You got to do it okay

4475
03:35:19,551 --> 03:35:21,343
Okay

4476
03:35:24,415 --> 03:35:28,255

American

4478
03:35:36,959 --> 03:35:40,799
You need what you have and we need it now and we need it made public

4479
03:35:41,055 --> 03:35:44,639
Give us all your dark

4480
03:35:45,151 --> 03:35:49,247
There is

4481
03:35:54,367 --> 03:35:58,719
Obey the ones running around

4482
03:35:58,975 --> 03:36:03,583
It is more than just the fate of this sloppy but well-meaning

4483
03:36:10,239 --> 03:36:14,079
Flopping

4484
03:36:14,335 --> 03:36:16,639
I like it now

4485
03:36:16,895 --> 03:36:19,711
If our governments helped overthrow this evil president

4486
03:36:19,967 --> 03:36:22,783
So do you out

4487
03:36:23,039 --> 03:36:26,111
We cannot be left as a fascist Rogue

4488
03:36:26,367 --> 03:36:29,695
Enemies of freedom and international, t

4489
03:36:30,207 --> 03:36:33,535
The fate of all in your hands

4490
03:36:33,791 --> 03:36:35,839
And your willingness to not merely hint

4491
03:36:37,887 --> 03:36:38,399
What

4492
03:36:38,655 --> 03:36:39,423
You know

4493
03:36:40,447 --> 03:36:41,727
If we go under

4494
03:36:44,543 --> 03:36:46,335
The freedom you say will be

4495
03:36:46,847 --> 03:36:48,895

F****** second 35 minutes we're going to go to a guy who has been in

4502
03:37:22,431 --> 03:37:24,735
With the regime changes that we do all the time

4503
03:37:25,759 --> 03:37:31,903
Play James on my own show that he was involved in a coup against our government

4504
03:37:34,207 --> 03:37:34,719
Hey

4505
03:37:35,231 --> 03:37:35,999

Hey Dan I think I hear something at the door is it at let me open the store real quick

4507

Gordon 4 hours

4510

The punchline is

4511
03:37:55,967 --> 03:37:58,527
This regime

4512
03:37:58,783 --> 03:37:59,295
Yeah

4513
03:37:59,551 --> 03:38:05,695
I don't get it I don't get it. Damn it I thought we were going to

4514
03:38:05,951 --> 03:38:10,047
Thought we were going to book end it with the clip a couple of cups of this one

4515
03:38:10,815 --> 03:38:11,839
Actually I forgot

4516
03:38:12,095 --> 03:38:14,655
We are out of context a drop so might as well do it now

4517
03:38:14,911 --> 03:38:16,191
There's a book in for you

4518
03:38:21,823 --> 03:38:24,127
Good

4519
03:38:28,479 --> 03:38:33,343
Robots are evil all right you understand

4520

Love chimeras

4521

He said he doesn't

4522
03:38:37,183 --> 03:38:37,695
It's not

4525
03:38:46,911 --> 03:38:47,423

He's probably smart and I wouldn't

4531
03:39:00,479 --> 03:39:02,015
We got to get out of here
