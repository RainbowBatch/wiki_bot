1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,048
Holding

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:07,168
Alexandra Thurston color

3
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:18,176
Little bit about Alex Jones

4
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:22,272
Everything was coming up to

5
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:28,416
And just came up you on the street and said you sir

6
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,208
You look like you have

7
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,512
Perhaps the only podcast

8
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:35,072
That's about one subject I could imagine

9
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,120
No other people could have this podcast

10
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,680
Describe

11
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,960
To whom you know

12
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:41,984
Everything is coming up to

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,384
I would say leave me alone

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,808
I want to talk

15
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,088
Before we get to ourselves

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,744
About something you all in all you

17
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,144
Inside stuff

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,008
Alright I would think of that Isaiah Rashad

19
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,800
All day

20
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,640
The way I love our relationship

21
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,664
Because

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,432
YouTube

23
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,456
Cuties

24
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,736
Life stories

25
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:28,320
Before the show you're like I can't tell you about this

26
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:31,136
Antidote for my regular life until we're on the show

27
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,696
It's it's relevant

28
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:40,096
Okay until today it would kind of a little bit up in the air how the f*** I was going to get to Austin

29
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,144
I'm show in Austin on June 15th

30
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,168
A lamp

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,728
Ashley Judd

32
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,752
Probably okay

33
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:55,200
Because I had an expired ID and I realize I can't get on a plane with expired ID

34
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:00,064
Secretary of State's office over and over again

35
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,344
This isn't good enough

36
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,928
Whatever piece of information that I have about myself is not good enough

37
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:11,328
I'd approve my date of birth approve my address

38
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,096
Like

39
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,400
I had to get them my lease

40
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,192
And I couldn't get my lease

41
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,728
Until after my birthday

42
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,384
And after my birthday my ID was then over a year expired and now I can't use my old id

43
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,920
Approve my birthday anymore

44
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:29,248
So they tell me that I leave either my birth certificate or my

45
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:33,088
School transcript right in order to get my ID

46
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:37,440
Together as everyone knows those are the only two ways to really identify

47
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:42,560
Freaking out the last time I went there and then

48
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,352
Tell you

49
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,376
Start

50
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
Alright

51
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
And she's like

52
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:47,936
Stupid

53
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,960
Scuse me

54
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,984

55
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,752
Please stop.

56
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:59,200
I wasn't crying but I was not happy

57
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,480
And they'll give you one of my

58
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,784
How does that work

59
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:12,768
California images

60
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,352
I think you have a password

61
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,936
Mechanics expired by now

62
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,520
It's not right there like maybe School transcript

63
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,056

00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,336
Top to bottom

65
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,128
Couldn't find my birth certificate

66
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,688
But I did find my school transcript

67
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,064
And Jordan I have a little bit of a reveal for you here is my high school equivalent

68
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,344

Cancel my social security number on

70
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,744

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,632
To congratulate David a freezin for graduating from the Department of Elementary

And my middle initial

78
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,760
Perfect completely fuk sound like

79
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:10,880
There's no way they're going to accept a problem

80
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,720
And that does not have your name

81
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,744
You might be off

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,280
The group

83
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,815
I thought you even have

84
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,839
Text

85
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,655
I thought for sure I'm going to go in there and I'm

86
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,959

87
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,751

00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,031
7:30 in the morning

89
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,359
To get there right when they open today sweating bullets

90
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,175
As I put this transcript down on the table just like

91
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:38,527
No fart

92
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
They're going to catch

93
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:45,951
I'm the guy who has like a balloon of cocaine up his a******* going through customs

94
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,255
At the Secretary of State's office

95
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,791
I'm like

96
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,559
God this is

97
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,583
The disaster

98
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:56,703
They accepted and I got my ID we will be in Austin that's my long way of saying that

99
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:03,103
But in going through weird and stupid that they're like

100
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,943
That's wrong name

101
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,343
Because your ID expired 4 days ago so that means clearly

102
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,623
You could be any

103
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,719
School transcript without your name on it

104
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,999

Very sentimental

110
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,079

124
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:12,223
Swear to God I thought you were a baby with just 99% of the time

Thank you so much we got a couple more folks coming along

192
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:41,279
Remembered and said that he had praised Hitler in the

193
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
The past

194
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,119
Forgot I forgot that he had called him and Stalin

195
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,055
What a weird thing to say very strange

196
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:59,455
Episode

197
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,735
May 7th through 29

198
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
2009

199
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:06,623
All right there's a reason for it I was going to do a project Camelot show today but

200
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:07,903
It was tough

201
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,975
My original plan

202
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,351
What are the reasons what are the reasons that my day was so ha

203
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:21,471
It was I was trying to prepare Project Camelot episode

204
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,775
Cuz what I intended to cover was

205
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,055
Courtney Brown

206
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,383
The remote viewer who I inadvertently

207
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,151
You know

208
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:35,551
Basically like pleasure Heaven's Gate

209
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:40,927
You were both interviewed an object UFO behind

210
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,791
He was on Project Camelot again and eat remote viewed Moses

211
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,815
And the Ten Commandment

212
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,095
Right and I was like

213
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,119
Which one was the favor

214
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,679
I didn't watch it cuz it was so boring

215
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,751
Like 25 minutes

216
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,775
Half an hour

217
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,311
None of this was entertaining

218
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,359
It's just a really annoying dude

219
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,407
So I started looking through more of his s***

220
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,431
And I found

221
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:06,527
But he is doing right now and investigation using remote viewing

222
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,551
To talk about

223
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,831
Future of Bitcoin

224
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
But

225
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:15,999
But because of his financial advice

226
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:22,399
He has to give a disclaimer that is like this is for entertainment purposes only cuz he doesn't want to get f******

227
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:26,495
What's really undercuts his own belief in his remote viewing capabilities

228
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,311
Does watching that and like this is a disaster

229
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:33,151
This sucks so much

230
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,687
Hilarious

231
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,759
He did a remote viewing into Alex Jones

232
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,087
Amazing

233
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,671
You just played Rises are episodes entirely that we made tattoo

234
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,951
Alright

235
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,743
Kody Brown's new episode sucks

236
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,279
Let's go back to Mark Richards

237
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,839
Watch the first episode

238
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
Just

239
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,935
The time the Kerry Cassidy

240
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,727
And Mark Richard Matt

241
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
And I realize

242
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,591
You've been lying to her the exact same way the entire time

243
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:09,247
It's all the same ship in the first person

244
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,039
Jesus shoes she's like

245
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:14,367
In her car after she got out of Vacaville prison and cheeses like

246
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,183
He's friends with the Raptors or like

247
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:22,559
Alright we can do this again I love Mark Richards but like I said it's the same thing right

248
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:26,399
So then I was like all right you were hoping for the story

249
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,215
Evolved over time it said of almost being

250
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
Yeah pretty much

251
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,103
You know what the fun of Project Camelot is

252
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,895
It's us finding

00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,663
New crazy

254
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:44,063
I'm so I found this other guy

255
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
Because he was so terrible

256
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,415
But he was on talking about how Mormonism was created by a lie

257
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
Battlegrounds

258
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,207
Right

259
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,231
This could be juicy

260
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
Fat

261
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,815
What you talking about new crazy

262
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,143

Project Camelot

264
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:05,055
Imes

00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,591
I wrote a book

266
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
Signs for

267
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,151
He wrote a book

268
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,175
Called

269
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,711
Deception of the ages

270
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,783
Mormons Freemasons in extraterrestrials

271
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,111
It's always watching

272
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:18,879
Great

273
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,159
Great books

274
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,719
Title

275
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,767
Terry is arguing with him

276
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,071
She's like she's like that doesn't make sense

277
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,631
What like Battlestar

278
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:35,007
Jessica was based on Mormon beliefs or something like the ten tribes of Israel or out in space

279
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,591
Carrie was like that doesn't make sense

280
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,359
It was just

281
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,127
It wasn't good

282
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,687
Is really fun

283
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,967
This guy who wrote a book about

284
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
Terrestrials in Boardman

285
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015

If you need if you'd like me to speak to your event about politics or tell jokes or both

294
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
That is fine

295

Material I can write jokes

307

Any crowd

308
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,671
He could only write jokes for the crowd

309
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,975
It doesn't

310
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,255

332
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607

335
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:26,015
This is great but is this whole episode if it's just like

336
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:29,087
Nonsense and him being like

I don't want to do this

339
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:34,463
How is his physical presence with with Carrie

340
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,255
Not good

341
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:39,071
Not not great

344
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,615
Local jokes means local work

345
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,943

One of these episodes that we're going to cover in this December or January 27th to 29th

349
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:10,559
He's my second favorite episode of Alex Jones I've ever listened

350
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:14,143
The first my number one favorite of course is that time that he

351
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,679
Rhetorically jump the shark

352
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:18,751
By suggesting that we kick all Muslims out of United States

353
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,799
Bobby with kind of making that argument

354
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,615

00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,919

Seven days in Obama's presidency giving him a chance

369
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
Not great

370
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,599
No

371
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,671
No he is not having a good time

You setting up a all sorts of negative things

374
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:22,239
Can come grab was running around battle guns

375
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:28,639
Is that like one of those hand extension things that old people use to pick up a robotic arm

376
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,919
Leprechaun

377
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,711
And it only

378
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,991
Took it to the chat room

379
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,295
We will call Larry Nichols again sometime

380
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
But not tonight

381
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,599
Too late for the old man

382
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,159
Alex

383
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
Discusses

384
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,463
This

385
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,511
Very very ironic position

386
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,327
That he has on what's going to happen after Obama

387
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,943
That's a quote

388
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:15,999
You say they're going to

389
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,359
Man

390
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,407
Physician's basic Elementary psychology

391
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687
Interesting

392
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:41,599
2016 the person who is destroying Obama

393
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,487
Although there was

394
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,535
No reasonable reason

395
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,583
Have some harsh criticism

396
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,655
You mean he was probably a little bit more than fair

397
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,447
22 Obama on his way out

398
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,471
I didn't know way

399
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:01,567
Trump look like

400
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:06,431
Soul job pretty much

401
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:12,063
2009 Global is they're going to do want Obama is out

402
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,855
We have in 20

403
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,879
16

404
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:20,512
Exactly what he predicted the global in 2009

405
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,584
Learn from your enemies

406
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,400
You learn their tactics and you deploy them against

407
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,448
Yeah

408
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,240
Thinking

409
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,288
I do agree

410
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,824
You fight fire with fire

411
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:38,176
It was like crap I just have the time just to re-establish that Alex

412
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,968
If it's not a flipping state

413
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,760
For him he does believe that a run

414
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,784
Nuclear program

415
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,720
Very deceptive business for peaceful purposes

416
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,256
Spectrum

417
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
For them to do that

418
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,368
I don't know what I don't know how you make it more clear than these

419
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,416
He's not

420
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,208
Repro Ron

421
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,024
At least

422
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,072
As far as this this angle

423
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:34,496
I mean I know we already established that we already talked about it but he's not considering

424
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,288
A huge backer of

425
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,080
Right right

426
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,896
But that makes me furthers my theory

427
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,688
But I don't think he's actually

428
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,456
Bike

429
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,272
Beholding to Russia necessarily or on the hook

430
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,552
Jax off to Putin

431
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,648
He's like I love you but I don't know if I like your friend

432
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,720
I don't know about that

433
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,000
Well

434
00:22:56,256 --> 00:23:02,400
Alex

435
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,520
I'm I am digging you

436
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:08,800
Advocate

437
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,200
RockAuto

438
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,736
Ice cream socials

439
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,368
God dammit

440
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,648
The deterioration of

441
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,928
The family

442
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,464
Dating

443
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
I don't know

444
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,280
So

445
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:39,776
I regret that you were not around for that episode that I did with Marty where we talked a lot about libertarianism and

446
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:42,080
The Von mises Institute

447
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,664
If you were here we would have done a lot more

448
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:51,040
Who screamed a lot more about all the stuff I've researched about how heartless these f****** are

449
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,600
At its core the Austrian

450
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,136
School AMV

451
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,928
Institute version of libertarianism

452
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,696
Is like

453
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,720
Real harsh

454
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,024
F*** you and your needs

455
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:05,120
It doesn't matter

456
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,144
Cowboy news

457
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:09,984
They're straight-up making an argument for why you don't have an obligation to

458
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,384
2 ft or close your child because that would be a negative obligation on yourself right as opposed to

459
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,176
Positive faith is a huge mass

460
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,968
You can read their articles about it

461
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,760
I'm not making any of this up

462
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:25,600
So that's the school of libertarianism to Alex come from and a lot of

463
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,136
The John Birch Society stuff is

464
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:32,512
And so on this episode here on the 27th of January

465
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,584
Alex is talking about a story where an old man freezes to death

466
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,352
In his home

467
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,144
He's angle on it.

468
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,912
Does not make sense

469
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:39,936
With his

470
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,704
Philosophical

471
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,568
They turn people's power off during the winter

472
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,272
I got some of the

473
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,832
Local news

474
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,048
This is what's going on

475
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,072
Turn

476
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,120
Power off

477
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,424
When they're living in freezing temperatures

478
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:29,088
Dollars

479
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,096
Scores

480
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:48,800
So a couple things this guy owed $1,000 to the utility company with says a lot of back bills

481
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:54,944
I'm not saying he deserved to f****** die or anything like that power off in the winter

482
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,736
But you know how you do that

483
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,016
Suck a government

484
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,040
Regulating business

485
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:05,440
Message literally the

486
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,536
Literally the office

487
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:10,816
Fair enough

488
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,632
The old Liberty

489
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:20,032
The only way for that like Alex's desired outcome to come is against his philosophical position

490
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:24,384
Because this guy was an old white World War

491
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,456
What's happening in this economy that's Obama's fault

492
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,992
Or whatever

493
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,784
But that's what libertarian is

494
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,344
Libertarianism is entirely

495
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,416
I believe myself to be a god

496
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,512
And if everything isn't going right for me

497
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,792
F***

498
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
Real

499
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,120
Doesn't matter which direction

500
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:48,192
It could be if you're in the lower powers that you know

501
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:53,056
I tried to buy this with currency that I wrote on my hand that said

502
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,592
All the money

503
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,408
And you would let me that's anti-libertarian

504
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,272
But you didn't

505
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:08,416
You turn it off cuz I didn't business it morally wrong user

506
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:15,072
Are immoral businesses should be able to exclude gays are black people if they want to because the market

507
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:19,936
Take care of that in their freedom to segregate

508
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:24,800
Then whenever anything goes against me oh my God this is

509
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,336
Yeah there's a breach of

510
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:29,920
Very fabric of American society

511
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,712
It's all this this horseshit

512
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:35,552
But I like that because libertarianism is just

513
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,576
Amman

514
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,344
Staying

515
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,392
Well it shouldn't happen to me

516
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,184
Whatever

517
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,512
But I think that this is a moment we're like Alex Jones

518
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,792
He's like

519
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:49,120
I think it's a little bit of a towel and I don't want to say it

520
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:54,240
Just because he's an old white World War 1 veteran died WWII veteran I use that as like a

521
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,288
You know I get a little bit of a

522
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:01,920
Big but at the same time I think that this is a moment where like is Humanity's waiting out over his

523
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:02,944
Like

524
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,968
Bulshit

525
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,272
I don't mean to say that makes him

526
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:10,368
Good or anything like that really believes in his beliefs

527
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:16,768
Like I don't think these libertarian beliefs that describes to really go much deeper than

528
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:22,656
Leave me the f*** alone I hate gay people I don't want to be forced to talk to black people they scare me Muslims are weird

529
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,680
And I want my gun

530
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,728
I think that's probably like

531
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:32,896
The rest of its kind of scattershot intake really really an ideology

532
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:39,296
Really and ideology that falls under the banner of any larger thing other than

533
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,088
I want to be

534
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,368
Quietly racist

535
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,648
Please

536
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:48,768
Well it's kind of say the n-word if I never saw any Edwards

537
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:54,144
It's a process 20th century

538
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:54,912
Masturbate

539
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,680
Be like Ike

540
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,960
I'm so

541
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,984
Episode

542
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,752
We get

543
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,336
Probably other than old man house phone

544
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,384
We get one of my favorite colors

545
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:09,760
I miss old man house phone

546
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,296
But you got calling a lot

547
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:21,536
No

548
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,584
This caller is in

549
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,864
Credibly inside

550
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,912
Also my phone is in the shape of a

551
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,680
Golfer

552
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,312
Yes

553
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:37,408
A really pointed question cuz I was complaining about the transit

554
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,456
The quarter that never got built

555
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,992
Figueroa

556
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:46,624
Take over the United States through a road

557
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,904
District

558
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,536
Suspiciously very similar to the timezones this is all stuff we got over in endgame

559
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,120
Game coverage going to learn more about to go listen to those episodes

560
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:03,008
I'm not going to break it down again as an amazing question but Alex

561
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:10,176
Another question go ahead

562
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,736
Yeah I'm up

563
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,088
What

564
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,648
With the depopulation agenda

565
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,720
Why do you think they would need a

566
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:27,072
Superhighway of 90% of people going to be dead you know and other all the

567
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:30,400
And other things it seems like you're doing

568
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,728
Are really don't seem like they would be necessary in it

569
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,800
With 90% of people gone

570
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,568
Mopeds

571
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,384
The issue

572
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:52,928
More preamble preamble before you get to onions

573
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,560
First I got to talk to you about this one thing but then I think I'm going to analyze

574
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,864
I am going to synthesize

575
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,264
I am going to buy also I am going to dance like Giorgio moroder

576
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,848
I will be able to tell you why,

577
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:17,248
You sir are obviously incontrovertibly wrong sir

578
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:20,064
Another word for we have to go to break

579
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:25,696
I'm going to Vamp talk about how smart my answer is

580
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,216
That's just to show you there's no Cuts here

581
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:47,712
Official

582
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:51,040
The world's population

583
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,064
Baytown

584
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,856
Go with Vivian GameStop week

585
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,328
Internet

586
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:06,656
Encarta

587
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,592
University

588
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,232
This is

589
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,768
Control grid

590
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,888
Rambles about how like they need to put this road in and

591
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:42,240
Poison the water so they can do a slow kill

592
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,312
Tammy Heaton the road

593
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,640
So you can incrementally.

594
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,688
The population

595
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:55,552
Super Highway if it's taken over by the US and then

596
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,832
Sovereignty blah blah blah

597
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,648
Maybe what the globalist are really against

598
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,696
Traffic

599
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,488
Yeah I need a bigger Road

600
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,328
And then I need to get rid of a super highway

601
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,120
That's just for

602
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:09,888
Cargo

603
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,168
I think

604
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:19,104
To use that if everybody's dead there's a there's a diamond lane

605
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,712
A global cash card

606
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,992
And then you get to go through

607
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,784
The carpool lane

608
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:33,184
But I will give Alex credit and maybe I hear peep

609
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,048
People's criticisms that I'm being too positive about him in 2009 I think they're missing the f****** point

610
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:40,096
But I will take my cat

611
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,144
Take captive because he

612
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,192
For so long about nothing

613
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,008
He did manage to come up with an answer

614
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,056
Very least answer the question

615
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,296
But the whole time you talk in here

616
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:05,696
OK Google, can you look at your B if you're like where you from

617
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:13,120
How do you do a little bit of crowd work while you're trying to figure out what was like that

618
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:19,520
Was that going that's what he's doing the autopilot is like April

619
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,128
So this guy

620
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:24,896
Then

621
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:30,528
Comes in with an amazing follow-up the follow-up question 6 amazing

622
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,576
Yeah alright

623
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,112
What one of the things

624
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,392
What you thought

625
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,672
Why do you think that

626
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,464
Alma Hollywood

627
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,744
People that you know and

628
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,512
Big big

629
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,048
Time people and wealthy

630
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:42,816
People rich

631
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:47,168
What why you think nobody's ever just giving you a million dollars or

632
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,216
No half-a-million

633
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,496
So you would

634
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,544
Spend so much time advertises

635
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:54,848
You're called

636
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,896
That is another

637
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:01,248
Really important complex question

638
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,552
But but first

639
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,928
But I want to go back to your first wife

640
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:19,680

Alex Jones

642
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,008
That's a state

643
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,104
Questioningly don't do it

644
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:31,712
So how do I answer this question where it is very clear

645
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,736
Keep pretending

646
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,272
With millionaire support man

647
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:37,856
Billionaire support me in multi-millionaires and Kardashian gave me his coat

648
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:42,464
Why won't they just give me the money I need to run this operation instead of me having to sell

649
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,864
F****** dumbass didn't have his guys soap guy come do limericks on myself but I look like an a******

650
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:51,680
I just look back

651
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,960
Why wouldn't I

652
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:57,056
Alex Hester like Rude Boy

00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:04,736
Promenade sometime today

654
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:11,136
Hollywood first question that I've already

655
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:15,488
So he mumbles around a bit and then he finally lands on this as his answer with his like

656
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:16,768
Alright

657
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,928
I got a reputation in Hollywood baby

658
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:51,072
Cuz it would be gauche exactly it would be

659
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,424
Notice it is simply

660
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,216
Done sir

661
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,752
You you notice

662
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:02,336
The caller didn't ask why haven't you asked them for a million dollars

663
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:06,432
There's why haven't they given you a million dollars

664
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:12,832
You know they would do if they supported and believed his dumbass b******* about the globalist

665
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:19,232
You are doing the most important

666
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,256
Call Alex

667
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,536
What he presents things

668
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:26,656
They know even more than him that he's right because we are apart of the system

669
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:31,264
Charlie Sheen's pedophile party

670
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,504
Bitcoin worth

671
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,040
But if you actually

672
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,064
It's controlled up

673
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,856
You can't allow him to get

674
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:46,880
Too powerful

675
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,928
Getting all these million-dollar checks

00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,160
Halloween

690
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:20,928
That tracks

691
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:28,352
Tracks that is when the spirits and the devil's come out to play

00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:33,728
Yep buddy dresser like a death Queen

693

I think possibly yes I don't know what movies came out in 2009

694
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,992
Yeah I would assume

695
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,552
Some pop culture bulshit

696
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,440
A visit from Gerald Celente

697
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:57,536

00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,184
He is a mess

00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:04,352
He appeared briefly in r2000

712
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,888

He is here I'm not going to side with him on this except for the Hayden Alex parts

719
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,480
Your reasons are wrong

720
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:21,504
Probably

721
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,040
But he at some point

722
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:26,880
I'm not sure exactly when we're going to have to figure that out as we go along

723
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,928
Now is like heat

Hard-hitting reporting bro

735
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,088
He wants to come in

736
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,624
And talk about Rahm Emanuel

737
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,416
Good because

738
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:08,352
Reasons they don't make

739
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:15,008
So many worse things than just being they don't make it that it's not about that but it's it's

740
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,288
It kind of about

741
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:23,712
The singular focus and how weak this f****** reporting is it feels like you're pointing finger for a reason

742
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:29,344
Don't make this up text textbook how f****** week this story is the

743
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,160
Would you say it's fair to say that Obama

744
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,304
High-powered

745
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,960
Honeymoon

746
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:48,288
Is this honeymoon was over before they checked into the

747
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,056
Motel room

748
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:52,640
Real quick I also wish that really a honeymoon

749
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:58,271
A whole bunch about how like Obama

750
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,295
What

751
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,831
It's crazy

752
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:05,695
It's crazy these try I don't know if he did or did not support Obama or vote for him

753
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:08,255
But if he did

754
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,535
Wow

755
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:11,327
What is

756
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,887
I voted for him to bring back hope and change

757
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,983
Write clearly

758
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:21,567
I need that

759
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,615
This was never a honeymoon because

760
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:26,943
Oyc doesn't like Emmanuel Emmanuel

761
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:29,247
I don't know if you know about this but the other days

762
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,271
Report a New York time

763
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,807
There was a cabinet meeting

764
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:36,927
And Emanuel was sitting there at the cabinet meeting cracking his knuckles that Obama was to him he said

765
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:37,951
Where am I wish you would

766
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,743
Stop that I find that annoying

767
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:43,583
Emmanuel gets up and cracked his knuckles right in Obama's here

768
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,775
Discussing with him

769
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,567
That's this respectful to the office

770
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:57,151
The presidential debate

771
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,063
Okay

772
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,343
So

773
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:10,207
The story is that he cracked his knuckles at Obama

774
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,767
What a delightfully Pettibone

775
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,327
First of all

776
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:20,959
Who cares I don't know I care

777
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:27,359
Can you imagine be like

778
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:34,527
President of the United States you're annoyed by my knuckle cracking well

779
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:39,903
But one that is to try and President Obama

780
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:45,535
I think every part of it

781
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,071
A week after

782
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,095
2016 election

783
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:52,191
The twittersphere that is the propaganda against Donald Trump

784
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:52,959
Let's say

785
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,263
The shity stupid dick do dick holes

786
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,799
If there

787
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,591
Propaganda line

788
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:02,175
Steve Bannon cracked his knuckles at Trump

789
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:06,271
What the f*** are you doing

790
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,807
That's your story

791
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,647
That's all we need

792
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,183
Boy you got to try harder

793
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,463
Real bad

794
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,743
They don't

795
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:26,751
If everybody is a Fox news story for two days they do not have to try at all

796
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,775
They don't give a

797
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,567
Jet the glom onto anything

798
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:32,639
And if you already hate Obama you're going to join in

799
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,919
They talk about knuckle gay

800
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:39,807
On this side is episode they come back to it a couple times unacceptable

801
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:40,575
Crazy

802
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,111
But

803
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:44,415
Only thing I will accept

804
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:49,023
Being called knuckle gate is a Jean-Claude Van Damme

805
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:55,679
Whoever becomes the president but I also had to fight B Underground

806
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,703
This would be great

807
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,263
What even great

808
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,311
Is that in 2009

809
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:04,127
Wayne Madsen comes on Alex Jones Show

810
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,663
He says

811
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,199
A bunch of positive things

812
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,479
About John podesta

813
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:09,759
Maui

814
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:10,783
In present day

815
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,319
No problem

816
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:15,391
With John podesta at all I'll tell you what

817
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,415
If if

818
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:21,279
Alex had an idea of what he would become king

819
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:24,095
Wayne Mattson play positive things about John podesta

820
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:26,143
Now Alex Jones

821
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,447
To be the center of a pedophile Network that kills

822
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,775
I'm in order to get into the blood

823
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,151
But you know what Andrew Breitbart

824
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,175
Wait he's not dead yet

825
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:38,943
2009

826
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:41,503
2012

827
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,575
Who cares

828
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,695
Going to get back to it real Emanuel and visit

829
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,975
You keep your mic down for this

830
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,255
If you need to hear house

831
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:55,583
Walking hard Alex laughs fake Lee

832
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,887
It's something about Rob

833
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,239
And and even John podesta was ahead of

834
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:04,543
The transition team interesting

835
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,823
He was Clinton's chief

836
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,359
Stampy at the same job.

837
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:09,407
Emanuel has under Obama

838
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:11,967
Baby found in

839
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,503
Administration

840
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:19,903
Political ways and his mannerism

841
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,695
180 outfit

842
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,999
From this guy Emmanuel Emmanuel

843
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,303
I just a nasty guy

844
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,583
Anna and you know

845
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,143
Obama talked about bringing change to watch

846
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:33,983
Well this is it suck I am on you I was a former ballet.

847
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,775
You're not to impugn ballet dance

848
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,359
But anyway

849
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,127
I did listen

850
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:43,967
This is like this guy's like at call rauf I wearing a tutu

851
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:54,207
What is not very good

852
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:04,703
What a goddamn fake laugh

853
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:09,055
Hahaha all right. We got to get back in

854
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:13,407
Some serious issues

855
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,991
Oh boy he does even more

856
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:22,623
Come back to the well on me the ballet dancer

857
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,719
It's because like

858
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,255
Comedy comes from

859
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,815
Largely surprised and

860
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:35,167
Familiarity being Blended together

861
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:37,471
They don't understand how do I get that

862
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,543
That symphysis together I'm not entirely sure why but

863
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,591
He was a ballet

864
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,615
Gay

865
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,895
Hilarious right

866
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,431
What why isn't everybody

867
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,967
Everybody laughing

868
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:48,991
No you

869
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,527
Because Isabelle

870
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:55,135
Get off the stereo

871
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,927
Supposed to be

872
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,519
I'm looking over by my clips

873
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:13,823
I realize that I labeled some of them accidentally

874
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:14,847
December

875
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,639
I don't know what I was doing when I was cutting clips

876
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,943
I got the dates wrong

877
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:22,015
Interesting John podesta

878
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:31,999
So

879
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:36,863
Adesa is the exact opposite of Rahm Emanuel Rahm Emanuel was in nasty

880
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:37,631
A piece of work

881
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:38,911
Therefore

882
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,191
But I could also

883
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,727
Pajama Tessa is not

884
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:44,031
That's the logical

885
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:44,799
A conclusion

886
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,103
Hilarious

887
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,639
Hahaha

888
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:52,479
So a little bit later in the show Alex Jones going to take some more collars

889
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:55,295
And you get a call from a guy who is

890
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,343
Sounds black

891
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,927
And I said some bad things about Obama

892
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:04,255
Okay I meant he's like cuz it's literally the show

893
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:07,071

894
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:12,191
The musical playing so call in tomorrow

895
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,983
Do that

896
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:24,223
Yeah they did Obama they need a black person to be president cuz they're vampires so they can

897
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,015
Chicken takeover

898
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:30,111
The Africa because there's a black face on it and then they can steal their gold and like

899
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,135
That's what Bob chat

900
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,159
Batman dead

901
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,951
Isn't you already have

902
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,487
A friend boots

903
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,047
Africa

904
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,375
It's not important OB

905
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,167
Because January 28th

906
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,191
Yes

00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:48,543
It will go down in Waterbury

Touche

This

914
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,767
Should give you a sin

915
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:09,791
Of why

916
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:31,295
The documents are still killing

917
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,599
Americans

918
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:38,719

00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:42,815
Interview with Kevin

00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:43,839
At the end of the show

922
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:46,143
And I do want to get into

923
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,679
Cuz it's really long

924
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:50,495
I thought I forgot

925
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:51,519
Specific

926
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:54,847
But Kevin is a guy who is a lunatic

927
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,895
And

928
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:59,711
A minister for the United Church of Canada

929
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,759
I got excommunicated by them and

930
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,039
And told

931
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:09,439
They stripped like on their roles

932
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,231
Get the f*** out

933
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:17,887
He had a series of Sony

934
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:20,191
Not allowed to be buried in a United churches

935
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,215
Camden

936
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:25,311
Knows he's a freeman-on-the-land kind of guy which is

937
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:30,175
Some s*** great he's a monster is transphobic

938
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,711
Montrell guy

939
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,247
He's a complete mess

940
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:35,039
But he's claimed

941
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,367
If you talkin about

942
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,391
A genocide

943
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,183
It's going on against natives

944
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:41,951
Canada

945
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,231
And

946
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:43,999
It's about

947
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:46,303
Like a school building

948
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:51,679
Kind of complicated to get into and I don't really want to

949
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:54,239
Except to say that Native American

950
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,031
Can tribes have written him season 2

951
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:56,799
Assist leaders

952
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:59,871
Like the people that he's claiming to stand up for

953
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:01,407
Have written him inside

954
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,687
Please do not

955
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,711
Username

956
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:05,247
You don't speak for us

957
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,039
Because they are in

958
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,855
Concert with the United Church of Canada

959
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:12,159
Which was the organization that had

960
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,183
School setup

961
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:15,743
Where he's claiming that there were like genocide

962
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,303
It's being done sure and

963
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,607
Excommunicated from even

964
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,887
Talkin about

965
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:22,911
First Nations

966
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:26,239
Communicated from the church

967
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,799
Keep our name out your mouth

968
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,335
Right by the native

969
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,919
He keeps trying to

970
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:34,687
Use

971
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,967
Attachment

972
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:37,503
To Native folks

973
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:38,527
In order to

974
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,807
Raise money

975
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:43,135
International tribunal into crimes

976
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,159
Church and state

977
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:47,999
Which is basically just a Blog he has that he acts like they can

978
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,023
Put out warrants

979
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,815
Some stuff like Asher

980
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:51,583
Complete Luna

981
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:55,935
And it's one of those things that like

982
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:59,775
You kind of get a scent like you get a feeling immediately of like

983
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:07,199
And I kind of empathize and I bet there was some really bad things done today to people in Canada to assume there

984
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:12,319
Knowing OK Google

985
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:20,511
Even in Canada the white man came and that means horrible shape

986
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:23,839
You get you get like empathic to the argument that he's making

987
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,887
Until you look more into Mineola

988
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:26,911
F****** con man

989
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:29,215
It is like you look into it in your leg

990
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:34,591
This guy is also part of the white man destroying Native American maybe horse

991
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,895
Yeah maybe some Subway

992
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:45,599
Broadcast ever done

993
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,623

Primitive

1002
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:27,583
Mammalian response to something

1003
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,863
Immobilization

1004
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:29,887
Mobilize

1005
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,727
Coming out

1006
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:43,455
It's just no other way

1007
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:49,855
Red light in their car

00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:55,487
Go knock on neighbor's door call everyone you know cuz this is the s***

Sequel to Ferris Bueller's Day Off

1012
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,031
Sir that is not

1013
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,567
That is not what

1014
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,335
Flights

1015
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:12,383
Such incongruous music

1016
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:14,943
The most important announcement

1017
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,783
Music to play Vine

1018
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,623
Being played

1019
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:29,023
During The Towers falling on 9/11 you don't know what the most important news in the world

1020
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,303
Did Alex

1021
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,351
Choirs who to stop people at red lights

1022
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,631
No I don't

1023
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,911
Man that's that's a bummer

1024
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,215
Well I'm not going to tell you what it is either

1025
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:43,615
5-minute story

1026
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:46,943
News report

1027
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:49,247
Good

1028
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:53,087
Injustice

1029
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:58,975
Peace of a puzzle

1030
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:02,559
Precisely

1031
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:05,887
Tire infrastructure of what they're setting up

1032
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:11,775
Course we have been completely historical research and government documents

1033
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:19,711
Hundred percent as we said that

1034
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:24,831
This is it

1035
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:31,231
Is this it

1036
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:37,887
Air raid sirens in the background

1037
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:40,703
Make no mistake what you're doing is

1038
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:46,335
Don't f****** pretend you're taking a Highway 6 is going on

1039
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,103
Theatrical

1040
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:53,247
But it's so serious

1041
00:56:58,879 --> 00:56:59,647
You just

1042
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:04,511
Told everybody

1043
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:10,655
Park

1044
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:15,263
Call your neighbors your friend your boss

1045
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:18,335
Right now

1046
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:25,247
Information

1047
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,855
Calmly

1048
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:32,927
Okay

1049
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:36,511
So he wants you to get in the middle of traffic

1050
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:42,143
Block people off Patrick hallway

1051
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:48,287
To write a sternly worded

1052
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,567
To the glow

1053
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,127
Global global

1054
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,151
In traffic

1055
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:56,735
Begin handing it out politely if someone were to say no

1056
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,271
You say of course not

1057
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,807
And you continue going

1058
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:06,207
Can I ask you

1059
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,279
Close

1060
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,327
Yukata calmly go over

1061
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:13,887
Did you know that

1062
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,679
Right

1063
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:22,591
Well I'm still not going to tell you but he has another story wasn't no

1064
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:31,551
Amazing

1065
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:35,647
Real quick marketwatch's not the wallpaper

1066
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:41,535
Both owned by the same company

1067
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,031
What are they going

1068
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:56,127
This isn't the big story

1069
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:04,319
Jabberjaw

1070
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,207
Now that's Street Journal

1071
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,487
Nope MarketWatch

1072
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:13,791
He told you

1073
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:16,351
So I looked at that article I found it

1074
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:21,215
And there's some interesting things in this article

1075
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:24,543
Man this article doesn't say anything like what he saying

1076
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:26,847
First of all

1077
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,895
I got red flags all over MarketWatch

1078
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:31,455
Because this guy was right it's in the opinion

1079
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:32,991
And

1080
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:37,855
Was it Kissinger no I just saw that you wrote Atlantic and that's why I

1081
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,903
I didn't recognize this guy's name

1082
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:41,695
But he was like

1083
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:46,815
He starts out with like now that we're in the grip of the New World Order

1084
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:50,911
Yeah

1085
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:55,263
I should have been in the letters to the editor section and the very back of vanity

1086
00:59:56,031 --> 01:00:00,895
Let me read to you from this article about is a North American currency realist

1087
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:06,015
Know if this Dynamic plays out and I've got no Insight that it will

1088
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:12,415
The global balance of powers with fragment

1089
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,183
Primary read

1090
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:15,231
North America Europe Asia and the Middle East

1091
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:15,999
Time zone

1092
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:17,279
Play I don't know about that

1093
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,303
The breakdown

1094
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:22,143
In such a scenario ramifications of manifest through social unrest

1095
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,167
Geopolitical console

1096
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:27,519
This particular path isn't something one would wish for but the cumulative imbalances

1097
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,543
Steadily built

1098
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:31,871
In our finance based economy must be resolved one way or another

1099
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:34,687
Therein lies the critical Crossroads weed together face

1100
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:36,223
SeaWorld

1101
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,503
To find its way

1102
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,271
Scary

1103
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,039
Yeah

1104
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,855
Probable

1105
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,135
Probable

1106
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,159
Not so much

1107
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,695
At least for the time being

1108
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:47,231
Possible certainly

1109
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:53,631
All again offer before the pieces of his prickly puzzle fall into place

1110
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,911
Have I said anything

1111
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:59,263
No effective money management dictate swaying the entire probability Spectrum

1112
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,287
Potential outcome

1113
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:02,591
In factoring that into our decision-making process

1114
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:05,151
Right so this guy literally saying

1115
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,175
This is likely

1116
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:09,503
He has written

1117
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,087
That does not

1118
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,111
Express in Topanga

1119
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:17,183
No just not it's wishy-washy

1120
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,207
Does not use

1121
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,231
Information

1122
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:21,791
That is all just

1123
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:24,863
Pure speculation

1124
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,911
I have no insight into this

1125
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:32,543
So that's the main story

1126
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,311
Continues

1127
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:35,103
I have no idea what I'm talking about

1128
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,383
And I'm making this b*******.

1129
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:38,175
So this is not the main

1130
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,199
Story

1131
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,479
On any other day

1132
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,247
It would be

1133
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:44,319
That's true it is weak enough to be the main story absolutely

1134
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:50,975
And it's got a good enough headline for Alex to have not read the entire article is a North American currency

1135
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:51,743
Impossible

1136
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:55,583
Shrug that no one's into it but I guess

1137
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:59,167
We still don't know what the

1138
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,447
Pistorius the main story

1139
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:02,239
But I have called my friend

1140
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:04,031
Britain this next clip

1141
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,079
Alex is not one

1142
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:06,847
For theatrics

1143
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,639
But perhaps does

1144
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:12,479
One of the most embarrassing Lee theatrical things I've ever seen on this.

1145
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,015
This

1146
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,295
Like this is my town

1147
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,111
When I was listening to this episode

1148
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,647
Like I blurt laugh

1149
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:21,695
Sitting alone in my apartment

1150
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:32,703
This made me laugh harder than maybe anything I've heard on Alex's show alright in the past who are playing this up

1151
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:41,151
To call your friends your family your neighbors Wiener House

1152
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:45,247
A huge responsibility

1153
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:54,207
Proper analysis

1154
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:00,351
Establishment

1155
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:05,471
With their spin on it

1156
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:17,247
Has a chance to understand

1157
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:31,839
Right now before I go into

1158
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,935
Campbell report

1159
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,383
Door open

1160
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:45,919
22nd

1161
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,015
Confirmation

1162

Understand

1164
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:06,655
Julian's epitome

1165
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:10,495
Still long

01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,487
Last night's Top story

1169
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:43,775
Stop

1170
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:48,895
That to me is biggest news

1171
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,175
That requires

1172
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,223
Not just a moment of silence

1173
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:53,503
But frankly

1174
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:57,599
Bye-bye account between 14 and 60 moments of Silence

1175
01:04:57,855 --> 01:05:00,671
Is an article that was written yesterday

1176
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,047
Take me to go

1177
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:10,655
Super-mega viral because they already made it viral

1178
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:11,935
Fairway

1179
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:13,471
Like this

1180
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,495
Clip

1181
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:16,543
Episode

1182
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,871
Keys this b******* is like

1183
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,151
Stop traffic

1184
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:22,175
Call your mom

1185
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:24,991
Burn It Down

1186
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:29,343
She still needs to know this is the most important thing

1187
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:35,743
70 TV store in stand and stare at the TVs in the window as if

1188
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:37,279
You imagine the experience

1189
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:39,583
Me listening to all that buildup

1190
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:41,119
What's going on here

1191
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,655
What's this what's this

1192
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:48,287
But something exciting is going on at Disney's commercial breaks I still have to listen to he's selling gold

1193
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:49,823
Dip roses

1194
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,871
You selling tchotchkes on the show

1195
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:58,271
Rose's dipped in gold that sounds sexy easy also the memory scam commercials

1196
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,831
Absolutely don't need it

1197
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:07,231
Comes back on air Republic

1198
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:15,679
There's a story by Paul Joseph

1199
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:21,823
The fuc

1200
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:22,847
Bird

1201
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:29,247
I should have known

1202
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:31,295
Isn't saying what this bill is

1203
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,415
The death of the Republic

1204
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:43,583
What it is

1205
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:47,935
Man

1206
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,983
This is one of those

1207
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:53,823
If this it is this description that Alex is about to

1208
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,615
To give was real

1209
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:08,415
Infrastructure and architecture

1210
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:13,791
It's going to be shut up under the superhighway

1211
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:15,071
Grinch

1212
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:17,631
Everything

1213
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:22,239
Coronavirus Boston

1214
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:29,919
Secretly recruiting preachers

1215
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,343
So

1216
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,159
He still hasn't said what

1217
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:41,183
Ezekiel

1218
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:42,207
Chapter 11

1219
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:46,815
He hasn't give up your guns

1220
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:48,351
To inoculations

1221
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:53,215
Even those haven't been invented yet we heard from Daniel and accusations or table

1222
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:55,519
Daniel Daniel got that one done

1223
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:57,823
I also

1224
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:58,591
You know what

1225
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,895
Why not there's going to be a road

1226
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:04,735
What the bill is yet

1227
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:05,759
So we're not going to talk about

1228
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:09,343
But I will say it's really important

1229
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,879
So goddamn afraid

1230
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,647
A FEMA camp

1231
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:12,927
I like

1232
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:13,695
Heath

1233
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:18,303
I I legitimately think I haven't listened to too much after this

1234
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:21,119
But I suspected might be what is brain bro

1235
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:27,519
Like I think the word list like this episode I think it's all downhill from here I think

1236
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:28,287
Starcrest

1237
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:34,175
To begin the decrescendo might believe his b*******

1238
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:36,479
Actually I don't like I don't fully believe that

1239
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:39,551
But I think that this is a very useful

1240
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:42,367
Like way for him to descend it away

1241
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:48,767
I don't know what episode

1242
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:49,791
Yes but

1243
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,375
16 moment

1244
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:56,447
Infinitive silent that is not adopted

1245
01:08:56,703 --> 01:09:00,287
We need to be clear 2009

1246
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:02,591
We talk about what's going on 2018

1247
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,383
We have a situation where ice

1248
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:06,175
Is separating families

1249
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:06,943
Inputting

1250
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:10,271
Children into like military warehouses

1251
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:11,295
Right

1252
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,575
That sort of thing

1253
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,647
They would prefer to be in

1254
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,415
FEMA camps

1255
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:21,279
Any any conversation of Alex Jones

1256
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,815
Like all this

1257
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,095
Pedaling

1258
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:27,935
Fear about white people being put into FEMA camps of the time for the Patriots

1259
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:30,495
White people stuff like that but the rest of my

1260
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:31,775
If you believe

1261
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:33,311
If you believe that you think it's

1262
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,847
So goddamn

1263
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:36,127
Human and disgusting

1264
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:38,431
And you aren't offended by what I see

1265
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:42,015
Is doing right now Trump is

1266
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:45,087
The presiding over

1267
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:46,879
Yourself

1268
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:53,279
Not separate whiteness is rightness and we are witnessing

1269
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,583
Now granted

1270
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,607
At this point

1271
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:58,143
Where We Are

1272
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,679
Present day in 2018

1273
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:01,471
We are not witnessing

1274
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:05,823
But we are

1275
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:10,175
We're witnessing

1276
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:16,575
Terrifyingly absolutely edit something that is so

1277
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:17,343
Solutely

1278
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:20,671
Buy antithetical today

1279
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:21,951
Is stated

1280
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:24,255
Bring it up ever

1281
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:30,655
Just bring it up ever is so f****** crazy

1282
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:31,935
2009

1283
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:34,239
When I listen to this imp

1284
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,543
Present date September 2009 Warriors doing this

1285
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:37,823
20 minutes

1286
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:39,871
20 to 20 seconds of Silence

1287
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,407
For the Republic I'm like

1288
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:44,991
You son of a b****

1289
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:47,039
The clergy response team

1290
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,575
You heard about this

1291
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:51,647
No but I would watch that show

1292
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:55,231
So this all goes back to Mansfield

1293
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:55,999
He's a guy who likes

1294
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:57,791
Call himself Pastor Revere

1295
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:02,143
I heard that no

1296
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,679
No no

1297
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:09,055
Stupid warning about the imminent end wa2000

1298
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:13,919
It's not that a bunch of the interview

1299
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:15,455
All of them link back

1300
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:17,247
To an interview

1301
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:19,551
About him

1302
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:22,623
On Prison Planet from May 24th 2006

1303
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:24,159
Written by Paul Joseph Watson

1304
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:26,975
All of it traces back to Alex Jones

1305
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:28,255
Great

1306
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:32,607
All this is based on paranoia about the Bible verse Romans

1307
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:33,375
13

1308
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:35,423
Which says that all power on earth is

1309
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,959
Bestowed its power through God

1310
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,007
So that is

1311
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:43,103
Is the give to Caesar what is Caesar's

1312
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:45,407
Side effects of the reversal

1313
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:48,223
Can we get some of the reverse of the versus River

1314
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:50,271
Is can we get some of the verses like removed

1315
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:51,295
Just to like

1316
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:54,367
Indian new Council of Nicea

1317
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:56,415
Just a couple of verses removed

1318
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:59,999
Things change why is it the 14 words

1319
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:00,767
Sentence

1320
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:03,839
People's horrific world.

1321
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,631
Well here's the thing

1322
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:10,239
Anti-government crank they were tough time with that scripture because it does

1323
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:13,311
Seem like you should submit to the authorities of the world or whatever

1324
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:15,615
I've been bestowed with through God

1325
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:19,199
Scripture they created an entire

1326
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:21,503
Conspiracy around the government using the scripture

1327
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:22,527
10 list

1328
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:24,063
To pacify their congregation

1329
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:26,111
And get them to accept the New World Order

1330
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:29,951
I can find no concrete evidence of this program

1331
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:32,255
Tell all of the links

1332
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:35,839
The documentary evidence of Paul Joseph Watson article is just

1333
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:38,655
Substantiated rumors this has to do with religion

1334
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,959
Stop

1335
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:43,007
And start searching Within

1336
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:44,031
You and your relays

1337
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:50,943
I've got anything searching my heart through a glass Darkly

1338
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,991
Everything

1339
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:59,647
Is completely vague and based on Infowars history

1340
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,207
Paul Joseph Watson

1341
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:02,975
Weaver's

1342
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:09,375
Confirmation from other preachers and pastors that this program is Nationwide initiative and

1343
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:12,191
A literal Soviet model

1344
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:18,591
Where in the churches are being systematically infiltrated by government volunteers and uses conduits for martial law training and conditioning

1345
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:21,407
The pastor was told that over 13

1346
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:23,711
100 counties are already on board

1347
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,991
So that's where Alex gets

1348
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:30,111
Is 13 hundred a number

1349
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:33,951
Mansfield AKA Pastor Revere are assigned by

1350
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:36,767
You didn't know that but it's

1351
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:39,071
It was in the Protestant Reformation

1352
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:41,375
Martin Luther himself set

1353
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:43,423
We will assign passers-by County

1354
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:47,007
If you gerrymander your county line

1355
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:48,799
You will not get

1356
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:51,871
It's all it's all

1357
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:53,407
Oh yeah

1358
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:56,479
And I didn't I didn't know any of that cuz I've always just been like

1359
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,015
A bomb

1360
01:13:58,527 --> 01:13:59,295
Whatever I just took

1361
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:05,695
What it's like to love I love the name clergy response team though it rolls off my back like water off a duck

1362

01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:12,351
I imagine just a series of just like

1364

40 preachers in Convent or something along those lines but with like the Giants

1365

Fire station doors

1366
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:26,175
Like just sitting out there the way firemen do it at 11 p.m. all smoking cigarettes and then to get the call

1367
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:28,223
Clergy I'll put on there

Checkpoint

Tricks on the street corner control grid

1378
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:09,695
With millions of Americans forced labor camps

Expressed through letters

1406
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:06,175

Really thought about it

1446
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:19,807
Need to remind people that

1447
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:24,927
Libertarian

1448
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:27,999
This guy have to die in his home cuz it's cold

Like that sort of Disconnect would apply with a situation like this where in there setting up

1450
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:35,167
Places where in

1451
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:35,935

01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,263
House

01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:41,823
People could be taken care of there could be emerge

1455
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:43,359
Duty services available to them

1456
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:49,247
He's so mad about the idea of it but if that desire New Orleans

1457
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:54,111
Disaster happens and services are available

1458
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:54,879
Huey like

1459
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:57,183
How dare this government. Take care of evil

1460
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:00,255
You know he plays both sides of this

1461
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:02,047
And the only thing that's really important

1462
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:08,447
Consider these roads are a lot

1463
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:11,519
Okay so this episode of Alex Jones Show is

1464
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:14,336
December 8th January 28th

1465
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,360
2009

1466
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:17,152
What is a.

1467
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:19,456
6 days after this bill was introduced

1468
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:20,480
HR

1469
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:22,784
645 by representative Hastings

1470
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:23,552
Florida

1471
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:24,832
And you know what

1472
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:26,112
It died in committee

1473
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,160
It never got out of committee

1474
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:29,696
Cuz of course it

1475
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:36,608
No of course it didn't because Pastor Revere got the word out

1476
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:37,888
Issue is that

1477
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:40,192
If you scroll down far enough

1478
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:42,496
You find the the amount of money it would cost

1479
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:44,032
And that was

1480
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:47,872
Not all bad

1481
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:53,760
No it's not that bad but people don't want to prioritize that s*** about the name Pastor Rivera

1482
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:57,344
It's not that bad Pinterest

1483
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:03,744
Interesting pivot for you to make

1484
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:07,840
This is

1485
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:08,608
All of this

1486
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,888
Is Been A build-up for

1487
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:12,960
This is Alex Jones does he ride a horse

1488
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:14,752
Paul Revere

1489
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,592
Anyway

1490
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:19,872
This is

1491
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:20,896
Crazy

1492
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:22,688
We are crazy

1493
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:23,968
This bill

1494
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:25,760
What suggested

1495
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:27,808
Hypnosis

1496
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:29,856
Didn't get out of committee

1497
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:31,392
Didn't even get voted

1498
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:35,488
This is the end of the Republic

1499
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:37,024
Let's have a 22nd

1500
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,560
Pause

1501
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:40,608
It hasn't hasn't happened

1502
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:41,888
Consent

1503
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:43,168
It's not like it's happen

1504
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:43,936
Nope

1505
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:44,960
Alex

1506
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:47,264
This is still part of his career

1507
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,800
To present day

1508
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:50,592
He still talks about the

1509
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:51,872
Dissenters established

1510
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,432
This is a pivotal

1511
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:55,456
In his career

1512
01:21:55,712 --> 01:22:01,600
This January 28th to get one of his big

1513
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:02,880
Pieces of propaganda

1514
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:04,672
This might as well be Waco

1515
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:06,464
For him because he's like oh

1516
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:09,536
I got this

1517
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:11,328
Give me the ball coach I'm going to run

1518
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:13,376
I'm going to f****** run like a Forrest Gump

1519
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,912
Touchdown keep running

1520
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:15,680
Oh yeah

1521
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:16,960
So

1522
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:18,496
I don't know anyway

1523
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:21,312
Done with Alex

1524
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:22,080
His breakdown

1525
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:24,384
Of this is a bunch of like really

1526
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,408
Scary stuff

1527
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:26,432
About the Bell

1528
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:29,248
Here's tries to make everyone really afraid

1529
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,832
And then he has an interview with a lawyer

1530
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:36,672
Is he still also spinning like he's the kind of music I would like to the keep

1531
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:37,696
Plate spinning

1532
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:42,560
It was one of those guys look like 45 plates Shopkin plates to the county fair

1533
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:48,960
It so he has one that one from earlier about the lady who spilled her her Bloody Mary on the play

1534
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:53,056
Are kids field 1

1535
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:56,384
To talk about grass

1536
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:58,688
They talk about it

1537
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:00,736
Before eventually become his lawyer

1538
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:05,344
0 there is a zero in the middle of it

1539
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,880
In the middle of it Alex Jones

1540
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:08,416
Kind of slips up

1541
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,696
Accidentally said something

1542
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:11,488
Did I don't think most people would recognize

1543
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:12,768
Lesbian

1544
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:13,536
Super f***** up

1545
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:32,736
It was not a privilege

1546
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:34,016
Travel

1547
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:35,040
Does that mean anything

1548
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:36,064
Nope

1549
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:38,624
That's because you have not studied

1550
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:39,392
Sovereign

1551
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:42,976
Alex Jones is espousing

1552
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:45,024
Literally a sovereign citizen

1553
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,328
Whatever you watch any videos

1554
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:51,680
Getting arrested for not having a f****** driver's license while they're driving

1555
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:53,728
I'm traveling

1556
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:57,312
Did the Constitution guarantees the right to travel

1557
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,104
And in quarts

1558
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,896
They've decided that what that mean

1559
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:02,944
You have the right

1560
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:03,712
To go between

1561
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:07,552
You're the right to wander about as you see fit

1562
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:08,832
The Sovereign citizen

1563
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:11,392
Believe that if you're not carrying cargo

1564
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:12,416
You're not driving

1565
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,696
You're traveling

1566
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:15,232
In an automobile

1567
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:18,048
So therefore you don't need the government

1568
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:20,608
To certify you to be able to

1569
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:22,912
I don't need a license I'm traveling

1570
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:27,520
So there's all these videos I'm driving as I was traveling

1571
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:29,056
How fast do you think you're traveling

1572
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:29,824
I love it

1573
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:32,384
Has like little like

1574
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,688
I guess what

1575
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:36,224
We got this loophole

1576
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:38,272
You guys don't have any jurisdiction

1577
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:44,672
Gold actually around flag there's no power in the land of the local sheriff

1578
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:45,696
Play why

1579
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:49,536
The Constitution

1580
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:50,816
Whitley said that

1581
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:52,096
Everybody

1582
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:55,168
Constitution was written when they were cars

1583
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:57,216
And also

1584
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:57,984
Go fuc

1585
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:01,568
But it's it's crazy because Alex like

1586
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:03,104
To pretend that he use

1587
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:04,128
Oliberte

1588
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:06,176
All that stuff

1589
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:08,480
The more we look at it it does seem like

1590
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:09,760
There's more

1591
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,296
Similarities of Hammond

1592
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:12,832
These guys who end up

1593
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:13,600
Bucking chute

1594
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:19,488
Yep also from the 28th Alex Jones

1595
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,792
Hip hop a little bit

1596
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:22,816
Great

1597
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:25,376
I am

1598
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:26,144
Trouble

1599
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:34,336
Who do you think that is

1600
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,384
Is it Terminator X

1601
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:39,456
Is it

1602
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:40,992
Flavor Flav

1603
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:42,272
Is it

1604
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:43,552
Check the

1605
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:45,600
4 is a pentagram

1606
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:49,952
Flavor Flav

1607
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:52,256
Spoiler alert

1608
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:57,120
It's a problem for all the

1609
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:59,424
He got kicked out

1610
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:03,520
I'm really sorry about that

1611
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:08,896
Not great not great

1612
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:17,344
You don't like to remember that part of Public Enemy fast

1613
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,392
Anyway

1614
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:22,208
It's really interesting is

1615
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,000
Overlook

1616
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,792
That is the differences and similarities

1617
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:27,072
2009

1618
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:28,096
2018

1619
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:29,888
And I found a

1620
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:31,680
Probably expected

1621
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:32,704
Similarity

1622
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,240
Between Alex Jones smoothies

1623
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:35,776
9 years of history and that is

1624
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:38,080
Try to steal fetishizes

1625
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:15,456
Truckers

1626
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:16,736
So

1627
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:19,296
There is little Alex sing along a little bit

1628
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:21,344
You know it is just his like

1629
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,392
His eyes

1630
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:25,184
Loving violin

1631
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,816
The masturbation to the idea of Justified Violence

1632
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:31,840
I

1633
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:33,120
Can only think

1634
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:35,424
Is

1635
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:37,472
Precursor to

1636
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:38,240
Unjustified

1637
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:42,336
Hours of really wanting

1638
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:47,456
But I know I can't just kill a man

1639
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:51,296
Dreaming of the day where a man gives me a reason

1640
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:52,064
How to kill a man

1641
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:53,856
That's what it is

1642
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:06,656
Like maybe he could sublimate his No-No No-No No-No No-No No-No No-No

1643
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:16,896
He would be way on the side of the Nazi zombies in Call of Duty or was it also one of his big things is

1644
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:19,200
Is that the use of video games

1645
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:20,992
In professional football

1646
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:22,784
Are taking a wave

1647
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,320
Warlike Tendencies of

1648
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:25,088
The man

1649
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:27,648
Write in order to like make it so they can't

1650
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:29,440
Fight against the New World Order

1651
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:31,232
Mountain Laurel today

1652
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,024
Could we do that

1653
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:34,560
Do that

1654
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:35,584
I would love it

1655
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:37,376
Because

1656
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:38,400
In this next clip

1657
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:41,472
Another similarity to live in Grand Theft Auto

1658
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:49,664
Around La in god mode

1659
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:52,224
Never bother you wants the plot to be

1660
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,552
Similar to The Fugitive

1661
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:58,368
But with the game functionality of

1662
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:00,416
Grand Theft Auto

1663
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:03,488
Justly being accused of a crime

1664
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,048
And everyone more like more like death wish

1665
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,096
He's going for

1666
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:08,864
No

1667
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,144
No cousin

1668
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:16,032
3D makes friends with an old Jew that's true that would never

1669
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:20,384
I watch all of them

1670
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:23,456
So glad I could pull that

1671
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:26,272
DoubleTree 3 is the best of that person

1672
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:32,672
I will not stand for anyone arguing.

1673
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:35,744
Enjoyment when it comes to your your pop culture

1674
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:41,376
Trivia gifts probably in the chat room still we watched all five movies back-to-back

1675
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:42,144
19

1676
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:47,264
That's too they were on I don't know what channel it was on but we had a case of beer

1677
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,288
I just got

1678
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:49,312
F***** up

1679
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:52,128
Rock salt

1680
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:58,528
Made a pyramid out of the empty candy that was the best time ever

1681
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:00,832
Time for us to really get into the weeds

1682
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:04,928
Commentary tracks on death wish

1683
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:08,256
Anyway for the 28th year

1684
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:11,584
And if this is again another similarity

1685
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,864
Between modern

1686
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:14,144
Alex Jones

1687
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:16,960
Thick f******

1688
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,008
That he has

1689
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:20,800
This

1690
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:23,616
This is disturbing on a whole bunch of levels

1691
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:25,152
Levels is

1692
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:28,992
There is a girl a woman

1693
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:30,528
On the phone caller

1694
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:31,552
Who keeps we like

1695
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:32,832
Okay

1696
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,112
Okay

1697
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:38,976
Oh no she seems a little bit scared of the things that are coming out of Alex's mouth

1698
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:40,512
And rightfully so

1699
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:44,352
Yeah

1700
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:57,408
Bob Hill

1701
01:30:57,664 --> 01:31:03,808
Sprouts

1702
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,392
Argue with any of them

1703
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:10,976
20 years in prison

1704
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:17,376
What

1705
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:20,960
They're getting shots

1706
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:26,592
Just trying to do our jobs

1707
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:58,592
I know

1708
01:31:58,848 --> 01:32:03,200
Torturing people

1709
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:06,784
Thank you Allah

1710
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:08,320
Thank you

1711
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,720
That's so f***** up

1712
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,280
That's so f***** up

1713
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:24,192
If if Alex was just doing that alone

1714
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:30,080
That would be really f***** up but the fact that he had someone else on the line

1715
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:31,360
I know

1716
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:32,128
Right

1717
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:34,432
Threat like that is

1718
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:37,760
Profoundly f***** up

1719
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:44,160
That was a that was a college where it was going well until like 11 whenever he started

1720
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:45,184
Doing a lot of cocaine

1721
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:45,952
Senior Life

1722
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:47,488
Oh s*** I'm not going to get

1723
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:49,024
What are anything out of this

1724
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:51,584
From here to hang up

1725
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,888
Shitol out

1726
01:32:54,144 --> 01:33:00,288
Oh I'm sorry I'm sorry you broke your hand getting really mad about nothing about a bill that doesn't even make it out of committee

1727
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:04,128
But thank you thank you Alex for fighting

1728
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:06,176
To be that

1729
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:07,456
To be Alex

1730
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:08,480
To be both

1731
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:14,112
Fragile

1732
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:15,648
So

1733
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:17,952
We are now onto the 29th

1734
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,840
And I want to say one thing real quick

1735
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:25,376
Real clearly

1736
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:26,656
Real public

1737
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:27,680
Yeah

1738
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:31,776
I have received criticism

1739
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:34,080
From the chair

1740
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:36,128
The group

1741
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:38,688
So sensitive

1742
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:42,784
I know I'm not defensive cuz I actually think it's fairly accurate

1743
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,600
That we indulge a little too much

1744
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:46,368
And how much

1745
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,648
Italics

1746
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:49,440
Business

1747
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:51,232
Criticism

1748
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:06,080
F****** sing-alongs from now and there's an argument to be made like we're dealing with a harsh

1749
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:07,360
Awful propagandists

1750
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:09,920
We're being suckered in by like

1751
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:11,200
This

1752
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:14,784
Right there is an argument to be made to that

1753
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,320
My response to that

1754
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:17,856
Is on the 29th

1755
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:21,696
Alex Jones sings the entire song

1756
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:27,584
I Was a Highwayman

1757
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:50,368
I want to be really clear all of it specific reason but also

1758
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:51,136
I want to say this

1759
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:51,904
Like

1760
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:58,048
It's the same song over and over again

1761
01:34:58,304 --> 01:34:59,072
Not that like

1762
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:02,912
He keeps singing over other song

1763
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:08,032
Eastbound & Down Silver Stallion

1764
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:10,592
80% of 9

1765
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:15,456
He just has to single-a it's like a guy who goes to

1766
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:21,856
Karaoke every week and does the same song turning me into like

1767
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:24,672
Biking Sasha Banks new theme song

1768
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:27,488
Eventually you just start getting

1769
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,840
Inured to it takes on a different context

1770
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:34,400
Here's how I don't work for 3 minutes

1771
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:36,704
Back to it

1772
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:52,480
Wake Forest

1773
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:11,680
Galaxy

1774
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:15,424
Nardis is my grandfather

1775
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:17,984
Okay

1776
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:24,128
3 + minutes of his f****** show that he dedicated

1777
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:26,432
Exit

1778
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:28,736
He did a 22nd

1779
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:31,808
Moment of silence for the death of the Republic

1780
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:32,832
What is there to do

1781
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:34,624
That the end of the Republic

1782
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,672
Highway

1783
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:38,976
And I promise you

1784
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:43,328
I'm not being petty being a dick about people saying we played s*** like that too much

1785
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:46,144
I promise there's a Reaper a little bit

1786
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:52,288
I'm going to play later

1787
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:57,152
There's a method to my madness when you things that twice

1788
01:38:57,664 --> 01:39:03,552
Yeah just go to break at the end of that just

1789
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:05,088
Alright we're back from break

1790
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:15,328
If he'd heard episodes where he doesn't entire break just doing a

1791
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:21,728
Like he goes from commercial to commercial commercial if he did

1792
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:25,824
Victor singing

1793
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:32,224
Stairway to Heaven

1794
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:38,624
Through weather radio Bryce over the

1795
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,608
Where's my book I mean script run Infowars better than we would

1796
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:55,264
We bringing like a professional wrestling sensibility online

1797
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:59,616
Anger on your side

1798
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:05,504
This is why we're not just

1799
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:11,904
For Success Dan we're not know exactly

1800
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:16,768
Interested with reasonable people and just goofin on clown

1801
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:18,304
Clarendon food

1802
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:22,144
Oh God yeah Rev

1803
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:28,544
Freebird would take a break.

1804
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,336
That would that would

1805
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:33,664
Hotel California

1806
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:37,248
Clip Alex realizes

1807
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:38,272
Vet like

1808
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:40,832
How long is Hotel California

1809
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:42,624
It is still being recorded

1810
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:49,024
Jetimat draft

1811
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:56,448
Alex realizes he needs backup

1812
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:02,080
The fight is coming and he needs backup

1813
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:04,128
What is coming in

1814
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:06,432
Coronavirus

1815
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:07,968
Saudia

1816
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:09,504
Anything by Michael

1817
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:10,528
McDonald's

1818
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:16,928
Great for Alex's range grapefruit great like Yacht Rock

1819
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:23,328
A varied career boobies

1820
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:28,704
Regulators

1821
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:31,520
Outlook

1822
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:32,800
Alex needs backup

1823
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:35,104
And up to this point

1824
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:36,128
In 2009 what was

1825
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:38,944
I'm seeing is a very anti-cop mentality

1826
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:39,712
Auto Parts

1827
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:43,296
But because cops are a representation of the government overreach

1828
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:47,136
So but on this episode here on January

1829
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:47,904
29th

1830
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:48,928
2009

1831
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:49,696
He realizes

1832
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:53,536
I might need

1833
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:54,816
To get them on my side

1834
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:55,840
And I don't think this

1835
01:41:56,096 --> 01:41:56,608
The successful

1836
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:57,632
But

1837
01:41:57,888 --> 01:41:59,680
I think the people who manipulate

1838
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:00,704
Can probably heard

1839
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:03,520
This sort of rhetoric coming out of him and used it be like

1840
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:05,568
Love you

1841
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:06,848
And maybe twisted

1842
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:08,128
Because this

1843
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:08,896
This is gray

1844
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:15,808
Your pension fund

1845
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:26,048
Love you

1846
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:30,400
And honor you

1847
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:36,544
The Daughters of Liberty

1848
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:38,592
Republic

1849
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:42,176
Choose

1850
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:51,648

Everything

1855
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:18,272
He does this for another like you might be awhile

1856
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:19,040
Ecos

1857
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:19,808
Disco

1858
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:22,624
Music

1859
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:23,904
Stop baby

1860
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:24,928
Love power

1861
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,720
I'm maybe they are not

1862
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:28,512
Ready to get on board

1863
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:32,608
Have good Hearts all man

1864
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:35,424
Snakes and sometimes

1865
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:37,984
I go out by my house that I have to kill a snake

1866
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:44,384
Butt snakes want to bite my family

1867
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,408
It goes on for

1868
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:47,712
F****** ever I want to play it all but I'm like

1869
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:49,248
As I was turning the clip sound like

1870
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:54,112
This is a six minute clip of him a rambling trying to be like

1871
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,160
Please cops

1872
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:00,000
Because we live in

1873
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:02,304
Cops respond to that by saying

1874
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:03,584
Nah

1875
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,632
How about you come over to our side

1876
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:08,192
I love killing black people to

1877
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:14,592
I think if we want to really parsed

1878
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:15,360
Like

1879
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:16,384
Things

1880
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:18,176
That are happening

1881
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:19,968
Wait we can't

1882
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:20,736
Not

1883
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:22,272
Chicken eyes that like

1884
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,320
As this is all happening

1885
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:25,856
Initial

1886
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:26,624
Tea Party

1887
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:28,672
First Salvo is already here

1888
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:30,976
And things are are moving

1889
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:36,352
I think I think within the next couple episodes this is my big prediction

1890
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:38,400
We're going to see a lot of these narratives

1891
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:39,424
That we have seen

1892
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:40,704
That surprises

1893
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:42,752
Support for a Ron

1894
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:44,032
The net neutrality

1895
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:46,080
The cop f*** you cops

1896
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:47,872
Kind of stuff go by the wayside

1897
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:50,944
We're going to see it as we get more into

1898
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:53,760
We're going to see that stuff sort of shift

1899
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:56,576
Into a much more familiar Alex Jones

1900
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:58,368
And I think that one of the things

1901
01:44:58,624 --> 01:44:59,392
Things that we have to take

1902
01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:00,416
Consideration

1903
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:03,488
This clip gives us a little bit of a glimpse into

1904
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,024
Is that like

1905
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:10,656
That hr6

1906
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:11,424
45

1907
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:14,752
That's nothing it's literally

1908
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:21,664
Don't like the idea that he made a mountain out of that molehill to me

1909
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:22,688
Memes

1910
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:23,712
Either like

1911
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:24,480
He is just

1912
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:25,760
Desperate

1913
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:27,808
Latch onto which

1914
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,416
Or he needs

1915
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:33,184
A big

1916
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:36,512
And you need an excuse to make a big bow

1917
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:38,816
And I suspect

1918
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:40,096
That this

1919
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:40,864
Is

1920
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,144
He uses

1921
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:43,168
2 launcher

1922
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:44,448
Okay

1923
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:47,264
I think that we're going to see that HRC

1924
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:48,288
645

1925
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:50,336
Even as

1926
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:52,384
You know time goes on

1927
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:54,176
Text couple episodes that we do

1928
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:54,944
Will be

1929
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:56,480
When

1930
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:58,016
It's dying in committee

1931
01:45:58,272 --> 01:45:59,552
Wreck it out

1932
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:01,344
It will be what he uses

1933
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:02,368
In order to change

1934
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:03,904
Track a little bit

1935
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:04,928
From this

1936
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:06,976
Support of Palestinian

1937
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:09,024
Support of net neutrality

1938
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:10,048
Support of

1939
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,328
Ron

1940
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:12,352
Into

1941
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:13,632
Just being

1942
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,168
Straighten line with

1943
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:16,192
What you would

1944
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:17,216
Respect of

1945
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:21,824
I think I'm not entirely sure but that's that's my that's my operating

1946
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:22,848
Thesis right now

1947
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:25,408
I'm ready to be proved wrong

1948
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:26,176
Hypothesis

1949
01:46:29,248 --> 01:46:30,016
I'm ready to be wrong

1950
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:31,296
If I ever

1951
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:32,320
Thrilled

1952
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:33,088
Is that vegan

1953
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:34,368
Weirder

1954
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:38,464
Spell generally speaking we have always been

1955
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:41,024
Like there are always two tracks that we

1956
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:41,792
Confirm.

1957
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:47,168
White nationalism Alex is going to Veer towards that

1958
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:52,032
If you had guns Alex we're going to be rude towards that but everything else

1959
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:53,568
It's on like the margins

1960
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:56,384
We always wind up getting it wrong and goes in such a

1961
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:57,664
Estranged

1962
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:58,432
Stupid Direct

1963
01:46:58,688 --> 01:46:59,968
There's no way to predict it

1964
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:02,272
Rite-Way

1965
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:04,576
2009

1966
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:12,512
In 2009 and 2010 and you said he would get more

1967
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:13,792
I would give you

1968
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:19,168
You know 100%

1969
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:20,192
In terms of guns

1970
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:21,728
With white National

1971
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:23,008
Little bit

1972
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:24,800
Just because I have listened

1973
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:25,568
2

1974
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:27,360
Forever

1975
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:28,128
Bike

1976
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:30,176
Our of this podcast we do there's

1977
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:31,200
20 hours

1978
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:35,040
I get a

1979
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:36,320
Sent from Lyft

1980
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:37,344
To him

1981
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:38,624
Villa

1982
01:47:39,392 --> 01:47:41,184
Very late racing

1983
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:43,232
You know like even back then

1984
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:45,280
It's not like he's not

1985
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:47,072
A cool dude

1986
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:49,376
But he doesn't

1987
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:50,656
Have the same

1988
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:52,960
Tality that he does now

1989
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:56,032
Or even in 2015 2014 some of the episodes of

1990
01:47:56,288 --> 01:47:56,800
We listen to like

1991
01:47:59,104 --> 01:48:00,128
There is there is

1992
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:03,200
That happen

1993
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:05,504
I don't know what it is

1994
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:06,272
I hope it's soon

1995
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:07,296
Cuz

1996
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:08,064
Much more interesting

1997
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:09,600
Then

1998
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:16,000
We do three years

1999
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:17,024
We happened sometime in

2000
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:17,792
2011

2001
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:19,072
Weird

2002
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:20,608
So

2003
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:25,728
I know I told you about those old people with their little robotic arm

2004
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:27,520
Handguns

2005
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:28,800
But I

2006
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:35,968
Alright

2007
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,272
Left and right

2008
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:40,320
Gun grab Jordan I got to show you this map

2009
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:43,904
I have right here right right right

2010
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:52,096
Are there begun Grabbers in hippogriffs

2011
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:53,888
Hippogriff

2012
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:57,984
So anyway Alex's claims that he has tons of bills

2013
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:59,008
That are being pushed

2014
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:00,032
In order to take

2015
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:03,616
And this is the coverage of the gives for it

2016
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:23,328
Seminole

2017
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:33,312
Record

2018
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:45,856
Firearms owners also required to report all gun transfers even those other phone number

2019
01:49:58,912 --> 01:49:59,680
Titles

2020
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:10,176
He never mentions any of the other night

2021
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:14,528
We now know

2022
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:19,136
Also we do that

2023
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:20,672
Because of how Amanda

2024
01:50:20,928 --> 01:50:21,440
Let's work

2025
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:24,768
House resolution on

2026
01:50:25,024 --> 01:50:25,536
Additional

2027
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:31,936
Because everytime a bell go through

2028
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:38,848
Through the elaborate process of undoing an event language

2029
01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:39,872
Parts of the state

2030
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:42,944
Why do we still have those

2031
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:44,736
Alex pretends that like

2032
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:48,576
Hey if you get us on a technicality with a bill this amendments done

2033
01:50:48,832 --> 01:50:52,160
It's so stupid gives no understanding of civics

2034
01:50:52,928 --> 01:50:54,464
Now hr45

2035
01:50:55,744 --> 01:50:56,768
From 2000

2036
01:50:57,536 --> 01:51:00,096
I hear from factcheck.org

2037
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:03,168
If elected it would require a federal license

2038
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:05,984
To own any handgun or any semiahmoo

2039
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:07,520
Automatic firearms

2040
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:08,288
Except

2041
01:51:08,544 --> 01:51:10,592
Any detachable ammunition feeding

2042
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:13,152
It has a single sponsor

2043
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:14,688
Representative Bobby Rush

2044
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:15,712
Chicago

2045
01:51:15,968 --> 01:51:18,016
It was introduced on the first day of the new car

2046
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:20,320
And on February 9th it was referred

2047
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:22,368
Is a routine matter

2048
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:24,416
As of February 20th

2049
01:51:24,672 --> 01:51:25,184
Still sitting

2050
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:26,464
With no action sketch

2051
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:28,512
So

2052
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:29,792
Also real quick

2053
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:32,352
Bobby Rush introduced the same legislation

2054
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:33,632
June

2055
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:34,400
1007

2056
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:36,192
HR 2666

2057
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:38,240
Yeah it wasn't wrong

2058
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:39,264
It was Bobby Rush

2059
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:43,360
Quietly in the house

2060
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:45,664
Committee on crime terrorism and Homeland Security

2061
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:46,432
Like all day

2062
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:48,480
Subcommittee where hr45

2063
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:49,248
Now reside

2064
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:54,112
The people who need gun control die loudly in gun control bills.

2065
01:51:58,720 --> 01:51:59,232
Subcommittee

2066
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:03,584
Pretty f****** screams bad and yells back

2067
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:06,144
It's just random ass politicians right to build

2068
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:06,912
Get some sort of

2069
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:14,848
Like that

2070
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:18,176
I don't know Bobby Rush I don't know his career

2071
01:52:18,432 --> 01:52:18,944
But there's a

2072
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:20,992
These impossibility that he was like

2073
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:23,552
Someone's got to do it

2074
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:28,160
The bill out and if it fails it fails but I did what I could write

2075
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:30,720
I don't know if that's what I'm going to

2076
01:52:30,976 --> 01:52:32,768
Did I when I leave Congress

2077
01:52:33,024 --> 01:52:36,608
I'm going to atleast be able to stay I f****** gave it a go

2078
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:43,008
I put a lot of calls they were f****** dicks because America

2079
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:46,592
Could be like like you say

2080
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:47,360
Jaded

2081
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:48,896
Like

2082
01:52:51,712 --> 01:52:52,992
I know that what Alex is saying

2083
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:59,392
A decent number of congressmen

2084
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:01,440
Every every year they're like

2085
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:06,048
And now I'm repping this bill and throwing this back out there like it could just be one of

2086
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:08,608
What happens all the time is that

2087
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:09,888
I don't know if you was in

2088
01:53:10,656 --> 01:53:11,168
Before

2089
01:53:11,424 --> 01:53:11,936
2007

2090
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:12,960
So it might have been his

2091
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:14,496
Rodeo

2092
01:53:15,008 --> 01:53:15,520
But

2093
01:53:16,032 --> 01:53:16,800
Yeah that does have

2094
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:18,080
What happens if

2095
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:19,616
Any idea that Alex

2096
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:21,152
Presenting this is why

2097
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:23,712
This is a scary thing

2098
01:53:26,528 --> 01:53:27,552
This exact same

2099
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:28,576
If it's the same thing

2100
01:53:33,184 --> 01:53:34,976
If you said that I respected more

2101
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:42,656
In his worldview like a globalist

2102
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:44,192
Control Barack Obama

2103
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:45,984
And George W bush so

2104
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:47,520
He doesn't see a difference

2105
01:53:50,592 --> 01:53:51,104
Only in terms

2106
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:55,968
The blackface

2107
01:53:56,224 --> 01:53:58,016
Jordan I know I told you earlier

2108
01:53:58,272 --> 01:53:59,040
That

2109
01:53:59,808 --> 01:54:01,088
We listen to that entire Highwaymen

2110
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:02,112
Windsong for a reason

2111
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:03,392
And that reason

2112
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:44,608
He tries to sing along with the rest of hurt

2113
01:54:46,144 --> 01:54:48,448
He doesn't realize how long

2114
01:54:48,704 --> 01:54:49,472
That's right.

2115
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:51,776
Okay cuz he's waiting like

2116
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:52,800
45

2117
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:55,360
You tries to sing along with it

2118
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:56,896
And he's never

2119
01:54:57,152 --> 01:54:58,432
It's the right Mark at all

2120
01:54:58,944 --> 01:55:01,504
But it just goes on and on and then at the end of the

2121
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:05,088
Great

2122
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:08,160
Alex you know that was a nine inch nails song

2123
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:09,696
First right

2124
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:12,256
IMEI Maybe eunos

2125
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:17,376
Cover

2126
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:18,656
Spectacular

2127
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:24,288
I'm really emotional it's coming from Johnny Cash late in his career like he was

2128
01:55:25,056 --> 01:55:25,568
Intex

2129
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:29,920
That is the definitive version of

2130
01:55:30,176 --> 01:55:30,688
The song

2131
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:32,736
I don't think that Reznor's version

2132
01:55:32,992 --> 01:55:33,504
Is better than

2133
01:55:38,112 --> 01:55:42,976
Video music

2134
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:45,024
Covers are much more

2135
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:46,048
Like residence

2136
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:51,680
But All Along the Watchtower

2137
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:56,544
Write with plenty of I-40 Bruce Springsteen

2138
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:59,104
Acoustic

2139
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:01,152
Nirvana cover of the meat puppet

2140
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:03,968
Sure yeah that one was a big deal

2141
01:56:04,224 --> 01:56:04,992
Show up

2142
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:08,064
This the rest of the episodes of three more clips

2143
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:10,624
And the rest of them are like

2144
01:56:12,672 --> 01:56:14,464
What I would describe as like

2145
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:15,744
Liquors

2146
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,280
Alex Jones is salesman

2147
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:18,048
Ship from the

2148
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:19,072
The present

2149
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:20,608
Starting to manifest

2150
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:23,424
And it's really interesting because it

2151
01:56:24,448 --> 01:56:24,960
Alex likes

2152
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:26,240
The cell survival

2153
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:28,032
Speedvault

2154
01:56:29,568 --> 01:56:33,408
I think this what we're seeing is a survivalist camp

2155
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:34,688
This is a seed

2156
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:36,992
Cuz they come up every year without you having

2157
01:56:37,504 --> 01:56:38,528
Listen to this phone

2158
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:39,296
Can clip

2159
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:40,832
And tell me that this

2160
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:41,856
Is not

2161
01:56:43,648 --> 01:56:44,672
What will grow into the

2162
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:46,720
The plant of Infowars sales

2163
01:56:49,536 --> 01:56:50,048
Nice metaphor

2164
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:55,936
He's just gotten out of like AIDS other letter

2165
01:56:56,704 --> 01:56:59,008
Efoodsdirect food.com

2166
01:56:59,264 --> 01:57:03,616
Yeah but like he's gotten out of like a two-minute about how great they are

2167
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:06,944
3-day survival pack weather

2168
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:07,712
Seafood

2169
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:11,296
409

2170
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:43,040
Melago

2171
01:57:54,304 --> 01:57:55,328
Special

2172
01:57:55,584 --> 01:57:56,608
Sounds right

2173
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:08,384
What the fuk was that

2174
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:10,944
What the fuk was that

2175
01:58:11,712 --> 01:58:17,856
Yes of course they are telling us that they're not going to give her if you were willing to fire on Americans

2176
01:58:18,112 --> 01:58:24,256
You get a promotion if you're not you're going overseas they're putting it on the front to die because you're not waiting

2177
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:26,048
By the way

2178
01:58:26,304 --> 01:58:26,816
800

2179
01:58:27,072 --> 01:58:27,840
409

2180
01:58:28,608 --> 01:58:34,752
Wow there is no need spectacular no need to book with another plug for your

2181
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:35,520
Sponsor

2182
01:58:35,776 --> 01:58:37,312
Unless you're doing it

2183
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:39,360
In order to make people scared

2184
01:58:39,872 --> 01:58:41,408
Let's get to the spot

2185
01:58:42,432 --> 01:58:45,760
Have they started

2186
01:58:46,016 --> 01:58:46,528
I haven't

2187
01:58:46,784 --> 01:58:48,576
This is this is a month

2188
01:58:48,832 --> 01:58:49,344
In

2189
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:50,880
To what I've been listen

2190
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:51,648
2

2191
01:58:51,904 --> 01:58:52,416
In 2000

2192
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:55,232
29th

2193
01:58:55,744 --> 01:58:57,024
Listen to a full month

2194
01:58:58,304 --> 01:59:01,120
And I've not really seen that mentality

2195
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:03,168
Am I saying it didn't exist before

2196
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:05,472
He may have you met only employee.

2197
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:07,520
2009

2198
01:59:07,776 --> 01:59:09,568
Something like that that's entirely possible

2199
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:10,336
But

2200
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:11,360
It's

2201
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:12,640
F***** up

2202
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:13,920
To see it cuz it

2203
01:59:14,176 --> 01:59:14,688
Clumsy

2204
01:59:14,944 --> 01:59:17,760
Back that you know what's interesting

2205
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:19,808
He's much better now

2206
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:22,624
Anybody ever considered calling their Bluff

2207
01:59:23,392 --> 01:59:23,904
On what

2208
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:25,440
The gun thing

2209
01:59:25,696 --> 01:59:29,280
Letgo

2210
01:59:30,048 --> 01:59:32,096
I think we should not give them quarter

2211
01:59:32,352 --> 01:59:37,472
I think they've actually been telling us this whole time that the only way for us to get rid of gun

2212
01:59:37,984 --> 01:59:39,776
Call their Bluff on this dumb bulshit

2213
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:43,360
And just do what they say and then they'll find out throat

2214
01:59:45,408 --> 01:59:46,944
So in this next

2215
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:57,184
100

2216
01:59:58,208 --> 01:59:59,744
100

2217
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:08,704
Anderson

2218
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:12,032
He's run out of everybody else me literally

2219
02:00:20,224 --> 02:00:22,016
Literally Alex is saying

2220
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:24,320
The Ted is selling

2221
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:25,088
For what he

2222
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:25,856
Bought it for

2223
02:00:26,368 --> 02:00:26,880
Am I

2224
02:00:27,648 --> 02:00:28,416
That's not a business

2225
02:00:29,696 --> 02:00:30,720
I don't know where the barge

2226
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:35,584
If you're just selling it for what you bought it for and you're telling people like

2227
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:40,448
Oh it's amazing it's worth much more now but I can sell it to you for this cuz I bought it for

2228
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:42,496
You don't

2229
02:00:43,008 --> 02:00:43,520
You make any

2230
02:00:44,288 --> 02:00:44,800
And

2231
02:00:45,568 --> 02:00:46,080
Is it

2232
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:47,872
It's a promotional cost

2233
02:00:48,384 --> 02:00:50,176
Is it promote you bring out the promotion

2234
02:00:50,432 --> 02:00:51,968
It's a buy-one-get-one

2235
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:56,832
I will give you one of these gold for 8:30

2236
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:58,368
Whatever whatever that is

2237
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:06,304
Going to have to get it

2238
02:01:07,584 --> 02:01:10,400
Whatever what is the price I don't know I don't know

2239
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:13,216
