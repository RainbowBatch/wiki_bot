1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alex

2
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:16,896
Remember to Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

3
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,920
But

4
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,224
What's your favorite memory of being fried

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,064
I don't know man

6
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:27,392
Parade a lot of the years that

7
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,672
But I've lived in Chicago

8
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,464
Entirely sure all of

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,232
The

10
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,352
Blur together

11
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,376
I mean I don't I don't

12
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:43,264
My first year here I'll say this was my this was my response

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,592
Do at this maybe this is my favorite memory just because I

14
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:50,944
I came from Columbia Missouri was very liberal town in Missouri

15
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,736
Cute population

16
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,880
This is urban living

17
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,232
Like big cities

18
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,024
Skyscrapers

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,840
Nothing like that in Columbia

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,912
Crazy

21
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,728
And pride

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,824
My response to it

23
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:22,176
It wasn't as good as I expected

24
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:25,760
Did you have this perception in your pocket

25
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,576
Describe bubble bars

26
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:32,672
Kind of expecting nakedness everywhere

27
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:45,472
That's a false image being penetrated for sure or puncture

28
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,288
I remember growing up with a very similar

29
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,592
False Image like my parents

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,640
Incredibly

31
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:57,760
Homophobic and really awful about that so I always have this

32
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,552
They were always giving me this

33
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,112
Mental picture of just a bunch of dudes with dicks

34
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,184
Throwing around walking down the street

35
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,720
Look it up

36
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:11,328
We're allowed to do this because Christian destroyed

37
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,632
It was really nice

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,704
Annoying

39
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,008
When you do experience it for the first time in your life

40
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,288
Oh yeah this is

41
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,056
This is normal

42
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,592
Why did I ever say

43
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:28,480
Think anything else would you let other people's Sensational in slightly.

44
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:32,320
Images into your head without even realizing that they are

45
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:37,952
That sort of thing

46
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:43,840
Coming through a little bit of white wearing black pride weekend

47
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:56,640
No longer that wide-eyed child coming to Chicago voice

48
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:02,016
Traffic to Pulaski

49
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,464
Yeah it is interesting to see a lot of people dressed up for pride and then other people just walk

50
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,512
Walking around

51
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,560
Very

52
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,864
Very nice

53
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,056
We are going over these scratches

54
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,336
February 10th to 3rd

55
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,688
2013 NRA

56
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,736
With Alex Jones after

57
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,272
Dokkan how is rhetoric

58
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,296
Evolved

59
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,904
Honestly finding out a lot more about other stuff

60
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,440
Quite frankly

61
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:47,840
But it will get into that I want I want to see the real priority

62
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,144
To keep focusing on this 2013

63
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,960
Sandy Hook start even as the

64
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:57,312
Someday become so crazy and Alex's Flames out in front of our very eyes

65
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,592
Acceleration

66
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,456
It's still super important because barring any kind of like

67
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,224
Really

68
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,064
Catastrophic still is going to have to do this loss

69
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
Coming up

70
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:15,488
The families are still going to have their day in court

71
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,536
Recording this he has to give his deposition

72
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,815
I'm in that case

73
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,095
And I think there is any

74
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,887
Incredible amount of value for us

75
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,423
To understand the present

76
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,191
Alex

77
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:24,959
Does present become

78
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,751
Closer to the actual lawsuit

79
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,031
First to understand

80
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,335
Stretch

81
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,783
I'm saying this as much to myself as to you and to the audience that I believe that this is a valuable thing

82
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,551
Even if

83
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
8 *

84
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,583
I was just rambling about nothing

85
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,631
Send the next episode

86
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:57,215
Episodes

87
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:03,103
Or just

88
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,127
To respond

89
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:10,527
Well I mean had we have not done those episodes in 2009

90
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:14,111
We wouldn't know Alex's affinity for the Somali pirate

91
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,415
So it wouldn't have been strained

92
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,559
To the Trump administration's treatment of the children

93
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,863
I'm with the

94
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,911
You know his response

95
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:35,359
Hey you know we know

96
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:40,991
You must have known they were giving them at least you tip your hat to that

97
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,271
So there's that value

98
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:46,367
Go back to the past

99
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,719
February 10th to 13th

100
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,375
There's certainly an evolution of some of the narratives that are are

101
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,935
Really

102
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,007
Orlando

103
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
What evolution

104
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
Oh

105
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,895
Before we get to today's episode

106
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,223
Very much

107
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,551
So first of all Marissa thank you so much

108
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:26,047
Text Felicity thank you so much

109
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,327
You're an alcoholic

110
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,215
Eli

111
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,543
Eli I'm not sure Ellie Eli whatever it is we're free

112
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,335
You're now a policy walk

113
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,687
Back alley thank you

114
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,711
Next

115
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,039
Merle Grinch thank you so much and I don't know policy

116
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,671
Camaro Brake

117
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:56,511
Appreciate that very much

118
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
You're now technocrat

119
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,079
Heroin

120
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,943
Freakishly large

121
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,343
Do you like

122
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,999
Please

123
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:34,655
So Jordan last week

124
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,423
Piers Morgan

125
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:41,311
F*** it take intermittent outages

126
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,103
Characterized

127
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,127
His coverage of everything

128
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,663
In 2013 he is a

129
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:50,271
He is a attention-hungry little boy a is

130
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,551
Yeah the guy who selling chocolate

131
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,831
Attention chocolate

132
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,159
Metaphor fell apart

133
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,951
12

134
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:04,095
And on our last episode we have the beginning

135
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,631
Of Alex paying attention

136
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,167
Tuesday Christopher dorner's shooting

137
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:09,983
In California

138
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,543
Where doerner it has shot

139
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,103
A woman who is daughter

140
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,383
Of his defense

141
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,687
When he was

142
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,991
To overturn

143
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
Determination from

144
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,343
He killed that guy's daughter and her fiance

145
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,879
Another cop

146
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,463
On the way around terrorizing

147
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,535
Most of southern California for

148
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,071
Alex

149
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,839
Does

150
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,911
You know otherwise episode he wasn't informed

151
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,191
About it

152
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,239
Uninterested

153
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,519
Certainly

154
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:48,383
Do you get the indications of disinterest from him and are covering it from the jump

155
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,967
True

156
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:56,319
Bolivar last episode

157
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
You think this is bad

158
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:02,719
If you take our guns you're all day that was kind of one of his

159
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,839
Pieces

160
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,863
Jumping on the 10th

161
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
Do the Sunday show

162
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,447
Dior handbag

163
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,727
Basically the same

164
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,455
Motorcycles

165
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,879
20 something

166
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,327
Wow

167
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
When did they

168
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,639
And just go out

169
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,415
So you're all dead

170
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,695
Are you trying to take our guns

171
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,511
Implications

172
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,303
1 points

173
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,095
6 million responsible gun owners

174
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
Responsible

175
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,679
Where to have their guns taken away

176
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:20,031
Gray like ninja every cop

177
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,223
Never maybe I'll turn in my gun

178
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:33,087
Every single

179
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,879
Okay alright

180
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,183
That's Troublesome I.

181
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:48,703
It is just almost directly a listing of it

182
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,727
This fetishization

183
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,775
Of the idea of like if we are pushed

184
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,799
Too far

185
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,335
We have it within us to

186
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:07,647
Weak-willed temperature I want

187
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
The toxic masculinity

188
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:19,167
So what what are the things that I'd really troubling about this February 10th episode is it is a really hard show.

189
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,471
It's mostly aimless

190
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,519
Talking about just about nothing

191
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:28,383
And then I would start taking phone calls from listeners specifically asked to call in

192
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,199
We're people as family members who were enlisted person

193
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,479
Who committed suicide

194
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
It's at moments

195
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,295
Like this

196
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,831
The show could be very touchy

197
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:40,671
It's kind of a thing where callers are able to honor their loved ones memories

198
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:45,535
And I don't want to make fun of that and I don't even want to really talk about it I don't think it's appropriate

199
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,839
I don't think it's appropriate for his show and I don't think it's

200
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,119
Certainly not appropriate

201
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,191
The thing is at other times

202
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,799
The show is really it feels like Alex is using these colors loved one

203
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,847
And their memories to help push his narrative

204
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,663
And even that is something that I don't feel really right

205
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,223
So I'm leaving

206
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
Most of the

207
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,807
The temp outside

208
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:14,207
Bible Daniel did not posted at all Bible

209
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:20,607
I regret now that I haven't told the other

210
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
Cuz I have heard him

211
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:29,055
Not if not as much as old man house phone

212
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,847
It's always the same thing

213
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,175
I don't want to argue about the Rapture with you

214
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,551
No he seems incredibly frustrated every single time he calls

215
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,879
Because at this point in time Alex doesn't have

216
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,671
Like a good screening staff

217
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
Right

218
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,279
Looking for like military and police collars

219
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,095
He's specifically looking

220
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:52,863
Four cops called

221
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,911
And he says repeatedly

222
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,215
When you hear someone hang up

223
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:01,823
Which indicates to me that you might not have multiple phone lines

224
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,151
He might just have a situation where it's like well

225
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:09,503
If you call it it's busy keep calling

226
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,527
Google

227
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:17,183
Folsom Prison

228
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:23,583
Maybe I mean it's it's like a radio station running

229
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,655
It might be I don't know what

230
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,935
Whatever the case

231
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,263
Surprised by someone like Mile Dam

232
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,799
Probably because of the lack of

233
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,823
Infrastructure

234
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:37,663
So but there's one more clip here I want to play from this February 10th

235
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,431
Episode

236
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,455
Alex

237
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,479
Repeating

238
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,759
Something about Dorn

239
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,319
That is not true

240
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:49,439
Christopher Dorner

241
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,847
Using a predator drone

242
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:13,247
Eisenhower warned

243
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:22,207
So Alex covers the Christopher dorner's Story very little on this Sunday

244
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,767
February 10th show

245
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,583
That is reporting the door has been hit by

246
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,375
He's a victim of a drone

247
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:33,983
TV is reporting Bureau Al Gore net worth

248
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
Two owls

249
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:39,615
Probably

250
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,943
You out happy

251
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,551
So that it's important to track it Alex's language in that clip because it's

252
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
Curious

253
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:53,951
You sing the outlets are reporting the Christopher dorner's the first US person domestically to be the victim of a drone

254
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,743
But you can test the report it

255
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,071
It's important to clarify however that the party saying isn't

256
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:00,863
U.s. purse

257
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:05,983
Some part not the part about the completely made up story about daughter getting hit by a drone

258
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,311
Because daughter is alive at this point he doesn't die for two more days

259
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,359
He does

260
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,895
Right

261
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:19,039
Because all I do is listen to Alex Jones I know why you

262
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,575
Contesting this part of the story

263
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:24,927
It's because there's a taylor-white victimhood to be told here and Alex is never a man

264
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,951
To let that go to Waze

265
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:31,071
The North Dakota story he's talking about his

266
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:36,191
Broussard was a farmer who owns apparently that included

267
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,239
Which is irrelevant to the story

268
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,287
Interesting details

269
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:55,391
Haha effect because there's some cows that come up and leave

270
00:15:55,647 --> 00:16:00,767
Did end up at the missile site what I understand

271
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:08,959
So what day is six cattle from a neighbor's Ranch Land property

272
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:15,103
When the Rancher came by tried to ask brother to let him properties

273
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,127
To get them back

274
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,943
Which is kind of like passive-aggressive

275
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,807
This on its own is Ali

276
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,111
There's something known as esperame

277
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,903
Which governs how people must

278
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,951
Treat stray valuable animals they fine

279
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,535
Wanders onto your property

280
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,559
Just keep them

281
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,119
If you know the owner you're the legal obligation to in

282
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:41,471
Inform them and if you don't know who owns the animal you have to contact the authorities to help

283
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
Do you sort it out

284
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,335
If you incur expenses and housing the animal until the owner collect you're entitled

285
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
Compensation

286
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,151
But what you can't do is

287
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,967
Extort the owner

288
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:57,343
So the cattle owner called the police because his cows are being held to Ransom

289
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:01,695
Cuz we all know where this ends

290
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:07,583
We don't but he pisses you off okay I'm sorry Alex just said that he was going to get hit by a drunk

291
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,607
Well then fuc

292
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:13,215
Use drones to surveillance house

293
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:20,895
Utterly disappointing really hoping that it starts with c and ends with a drone strike on his face

294
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:27,295
Don't be a dick to your no one learns anything from this story

295
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,599
So the County Sheriff Deputy

296
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,415
Inspector from the stockmen's association responded to brother

297
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:36,255
Accommodating

298
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
Mainly they were supposed to free these cows

299
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,863
Broussard said that he deal with it later

300
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,727
The deputy said we need to take care of it now then threatened to kill the deputy

301
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:51,359
If you step foot on my property Mister you're going to not be walking away

302
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:59,039
Boy it is it's nice to see somebody move to North Dakota just to commit to it

303
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,879
Can you give me one more stereotype about North dakotans I would like

304
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,695
To live at

305
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,535
Best brother who resisted arrest

306
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,863
That was handcuffed and taken in

307
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,655
Police still needed to resolve

308
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:19,263
The case those they wanted to investigate the property could find about the cattle situation

309
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:25,663
But unfortunately the brossart family are truly all related as they refused to police search warrant at.

310
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:39,999
Randy was released on bail but the family would still not allow anyone to come investigate nor would they even respond to orders

311
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,023
To appear in court

312
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,375
Life with no real options other than a gun battle with a family

313
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,935
Cops decided to employ surveillance drone

314
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:53,567
Which gathered enough evidence to proper tactical operation where the authorities arrested

315
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,359
On in November 2011

316
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,895
Here's the thing

317
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,943
This story is profoundly stupid

318
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:03,551
Brother was found not guilty of stealing that guy's house because he really steal

319
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:09,951
He was later found not guilty of terrorizing the police because of jury decided the same quotes you step foot on my land

320
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:16,351
Apparently the jury sided persuasive when my car golf

321
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,887
Captain of the Sheriff's Department

322
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:24,287
Cause for concern

323
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:30,687
Police officer with literally like

324
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:35,039
Dakota it's a cause for concern

325
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,831
It's just a cause for

326
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:42,207
It took until 2015 for all this to play out but literally nothing happens

327
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,791
The family

328
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,071
Took some time

329
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,887
They all got found not guilty

330
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,959
Charges dropped

331
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,495
You can be a dick

332
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,055
If you just really commit to it and you have a lot of guns

333
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:02,943
Yeah but I mean if you really think about it this all could have not happened at all if it wasn't

334
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:07,551
Like that comes over to retrieve his cattle

335
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,623
Don't make him pay for them

336
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,183
Will the cops coming

337
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,487
Don't vaguely threatened to kill them

338
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,023
What's a big dick move

339
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,839
All this is his fault that magically there's no charge

340
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,631
No one goes to jail

341
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,911
Go to be white in America

342
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:26,239
Does seem like that actually in North Dakota

343
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,079
A black person doing exactly that

344
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,359
Find their doorstep

345
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,919
I don't think it would go as well

346
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:40,319
You get those cows back later

347
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
Get to the threat

348
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,623
This is a story that I was once

349
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,391
Talk about

350
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:47,743
This North Dakota story

351
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,535
Taken out by a drone

352
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:53,375
She is reporting that the daughter was the victim

353
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
Drowning

354
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,703
Here is where we can find a really interesting thing to

355
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,983
Examine

356
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,263
Specific piece of missing for

357
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,127
It's not true that the police were using drones to

358
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
Dutrac doerner

359
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,967
And in fact when the police finally release their full 100

360
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,759
Report on the law enforcement

361
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,783
Response

362
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,831
In 2050 the word drone appears

363
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,855
Exactly one

364
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,135
In this

365
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,184
He really had an annoying

366
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,256
Drone on

367
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:27,168
Federal and local officials also spent considerable time to Bunk in a rumor that a drone was being used to track daughter in the mountains

368
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,824
Ironically the Department of Homeland Security piloted aircraft to help search the forest

369
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,200
Who's capable of locating

370
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:45,600
You don't know what they're doing the only place in the report is like

371
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,136
Damage at stupid s***

372
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,928
We don't deserve it

373
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,584
The story of Christopher Dorner was the target of drones was first reported on February 10th

374
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,888
Tabloid

Beginning of domestic Warfare

378
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,104
But the story wasn't

379
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,920
True it was clarified by representatives of the u.s.

380
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,944
Border Protection

381
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,272
And they were consulted because they would be the

382
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:20,672
People who would be lending the Drone

383
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,464
Really did fall to them

To sort things out

00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,560

00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,400
I really have no idea what

What's going on here

00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,776
I'm in a tabloid you know

And it was a conspiracy

401
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:14,688
We went over this episode to get back into my feelings about Princess Diana

402
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,736
I've been away from this point

403
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:20,832
The story got Twisted into reports of the Drone themselves being weaponized

404
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,880
Being killed by one

405
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,952
Although you wouldn't die like I said

The New American

436
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,920
Greenwald did

437
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,736

440
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,648

Some people have gone so far as to call a hoax

444
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,024
Yeah

445
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,048
Wow

446
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,864
That's what Alex is reporting on

447
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,400
Disgusting here on the

448
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,448
Like a real

449
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:18,080
Outlets that ran with it based on

450
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:22,944
Very little

451
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,064
Irresponsible

452
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,880
Yeah so that's about all we got from the 10

453
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,928
Because like I said most of it is

454
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,208
Stop that I just don't feel

455
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,488
Talking about

456
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,768
It is what it is

457
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,328
So are we getting

458
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,888
And Alex has noticed something

459
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,424
Dispute

460
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,704
Is important

461
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,008
About the doors

462
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:47,776
Situation

463
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,848
And he believes that there is

464
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,616
In the world

465
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,456
Who are

466
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,736
Courts and are supporting

467
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,040
Here's what

468
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:05,696
Situation

469
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,512
Syracuse

470
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,328
Extremely

471
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,888
Christopher

472
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,680
Doerner the alleged person

473
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:37,696
Calling the police

474
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,632
One of the system's killers

475
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,960
Rewire because you got kicked out of a cult

476
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,824
I've never said this on the podcast

477
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,664
Because I remember what happened with the Christopher Dorner Manhunt

478
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,968
Like I wasn't that long ago

479
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,016
I was twenty-nine when it happened or so

480
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,624
But at some point Alex

481
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,904
Going to start claiming the media

482
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,488
I remember the way things

483
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
Progressed

484
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,864
Why don't you like listening to Alec

485
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,656
6 years ago or anything like that

486
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,960
But it was the story played out

487
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,264
Steadfastly refuses

488
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,288
Except complex

489
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:28,896
No one in the media support Christopher Dorner going on a shooting

490
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,944
And terrorizing an entire city

491
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,712
And

492
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,992
Area

493
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,784
There's wall-to-wall

494
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,808
Instigation of his action

495
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:41,440
I assure you all of the major figures in Media

496
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,000
With his this is what's going to happen to all

497
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,280
If you take our guns bulshit

498
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:49,376
That's not a very negative

499
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,936
Didn't like his closest criticism is like

500
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,032
Describe

501
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,312
I mean his approach

502
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:00,640
To it seems to be like less

503
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:03,712
This is a teachable

504
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
Weird

505
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,248
However

506
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,784
Remember

507
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,856
How is information started

508
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,416
Come out about why he was doing what he was doing

509
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:15,488
And some of the media felt that it was worthwhile use of times

510
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,024
Understand the motivation

511
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,304
Tim's of a high-profile

512
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,352
And very scary spree killer

513
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,912
When you start to get into what motivated doerner

514
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,704
A very complicated picture because

515
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,472
Chance to emerge

516
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,800
Daughter previously been an officer with the LAPD

517
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:32,640
He was fired in January 2009 after he claimed a fellow officer

518
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
Kick the homeless man

519
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,688
Who they were detaining

520
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,224
Daughter was a rookie

521
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,272
So he had to go along with a training

522
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,808
Officer

523
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,576
Teresa Eva

524
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,160
When they arrived on a call they approached Christopher gettler

525
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,208
Who suffered from severe mental

526
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,000
Gettler threw a punch

527
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,912
Unreleased

528
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,680
His father's Custer

529
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:59,008
Two weeks later daughter reported Evans to his Sarge

530
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
In the chest

531
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,592
Space drawing blood

532
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,896
To clear excessive force

533
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,688
Internal investigation

534
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,736
Did not conclude that that kicking it happen

535
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,808
Surprise I was fired for filing a false report again

536
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,344
Set timer

537
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,136
After he was fired

538
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,184
Determination

539
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,720
That prompted hearings at the office

540
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:21,536
The inspector-general than the LA Superior Court

541
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,072
And eventually the California court of

542
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:23,840
Appeals

543
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,168
All of them upheld his termination and found no wrongdoing on the part.

544
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,472
However

545
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,520
When you start to get into the details surrounding

546
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,056
Play the case there's a bit of mudding

547
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:36,128
That a lot of people have their difficult time wrestling

548
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,408
What

549
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:42,016
The most believable thing in the world is that an LAPD cops use excessive

550
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:46,624
The first element

551
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,488
You're always going to default to not supporting them

552
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:56,096
Code of Silence

553
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:59,424
Lawsuit prior

554
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,240
There's a lot of reasons why you would have a d

555
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,776
Default position of skepticism

556
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,384
I reported the person I was retaliated

557
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:14,528
As Richard gettler the detain man

558
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:17,088
His father Richard

559
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,368
The Christopher is

560
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,160
Butane

561
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,184
Richard

562
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,256
Call his son

563
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,328
The kitchen

564
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,400
However Richard also pointed out that his son suffered from

565
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,424
Severe dementia

566
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,728
And was quote prone to contradiction

567
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,544
Edit description of the officer who kicked it was a stretch

568
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,080
XtraMath

569
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:38,848
Didn't match

570
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,640
He said that she was almost black

571
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,408
Panda shoes

572
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,176
Caucasian Roman

573
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,736
To testify

574
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,552
His father said that he couldn't because quote

575
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,320
He wouldn't

576
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,088
Understand the question

577
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,648
Nor be able to provide

578
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,952
When he did finally come in for question

579
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,488
He was unable to answer

580
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,512
What about his age

581
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,816
What year it was or even what day it was

582
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,632
Ultimately he made a statement that he was struck with a

583
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,656
The club during the Iraq

584
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,192
Which is categorically not

585
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,984
He's someone who

586
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,032
Video

587
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
Of him

588
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,336
Being interviewed

589
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,616
Describe

590
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,384
Being kicked

591
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:16,224
And it's almost certainly based on his

592
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,760
His other Behavior

593
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,600
Interactions

594
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,648
Almost certainly coach

595
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:30,560
Or it would if not overtly coached at least lead down

596
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,912
Uses of like

597
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:35,936
Defense

598
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,728
Of dorner's argument

599
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,032
Target

600
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,920
Also I mean the Sun

601
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,992
Come home and made the claim to his father unprompted

602
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,832
Do you know his father Richard his son's Facebook

603
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,856
Was slightly puffy

604
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,464
So do those details

605
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:01,024
On the other hand there were three eyewitnesses

606
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,792
The interaction

607
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,072
Between Evans and Gatlin

608
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,864
And none of them remember to kick

609
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,912
This doesn't prove that it didn't

610
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,728
But it doesn't help the argument that

611
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,288
Daughters complain about Evans happen

612
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:13,824
Trivialize

613
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:19,456
But it also happened a day after she told him that her evaluation of him

614
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,272
Was possibly going to involve recommendations

615
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,296
Areas is performed

616
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,576
Needed Improvement

617
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,368
Which is seen by many as

618
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,928
Being indicative of him being worried

619
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,464
About what was going

620
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,768
Come out

621
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,328
So

622
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,168
You know everybody's motives

623
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:44,288
Like I said

624
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:48,896
Fitting way to

625
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,200
You can you can justify it to ascertain

626
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:53,760
To put steak

627
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,576
In this a Charles gamblers

628
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,856
I recorded

629
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,136
Interview

630
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,952
You can go ahead and do that and then if you want to take

631
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,280
Word of his dad contradictions and

632
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,584
Did literally make contradictory

633
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,864
Huiclaims

634
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,656
Witness

635
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,960
You know you could take that

636
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,776
Kenobi trailer

637
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:22,176
Jordan was fired he alleged being the target of racist

638
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:22,944
Switch

639
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,760
Is an area where the LAPD does have some issues

640
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:28,832
The information that was available around the time of the shooting was

641
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:29,856
Sprite

642
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:33,440
Conclusive and naturally it cause some people to question what had happened

643
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,256
But here's where it there's a very critical

644
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,024
Do I have to stink

645
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:43,424
It's very possible to entertain the possibility that Christopher daughter was the victim of wrongful termination by the LA

646
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,704
PD

647
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,032
Strongly believe that is action after the factor of court

648
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,336
A normal human mind could believe

649
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,360
Might have been wrong

650
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:54,176
Simultaneously believe that whatever Roxy supper

651
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,712
In no way Justified

652
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,480
How we decide

653
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,248
Respond to it

654
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:01,856
Alex is rhetoric and propaganda for this level of reflection

655
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,624
Complexity

656
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,440
Possibility

657
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,464
Daughter was wrong

658
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,256
He has to answer

659
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,048
Honda cars

660
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,328
Support for it

661
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,864
And two shootings per day

662
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:15,168
On February 11th 2013

663
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:19,776
The date of this episode of the Guardian reported that the LAPD was reopening investigation

664
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,056
And two daughters termination

665
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,336
Including system

666
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,616
From the FBI

667
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,688
But the belly police chief was very clear

668
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,552
I do this not to appease a murderer

669
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,368
I do to reassure the public that their Police Department is

670
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,648
Heritage Fair

671
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,464
Sorry sorry

672
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,000
I'm almost there

673
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:43,840
That what Alex is responding to is stories covering this developed

674
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,888
The idea that they were going to reopen

675
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,656
The investigation

676
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:50,752
He's trying to paint the picture that the mediator daughter on which is

677
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,800
And I don't know

678
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,848
I have I have a difficult time

679
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,616
Trusting

680
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,384
Any kind of in

681
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,664
Institutional police

682
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,432
Force

683
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,992
Because of course

684
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,040
But

685
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:06,368
In this circumstance I think reopening the investigation

686
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,136
It was a Honda

687
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,160
Got the right thing to do

688
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,976
Because if you did f*** this up

689
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,000
You got on it

690
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,024
And if you didn't

691
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,792
Suck this up

692
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,816
You need to

693
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,584
Restored Republic

694
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,144
I think it's absolutely the right thing

695
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:21,472
To do and I don't I don't know

696
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,056
So on the June 7th

697
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:25,824
2030

698
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,664
The LAPD release the report covering

699
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,688
If you read this

700
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:34,016
Report it's very hard to believe the dorner's claims about you

701
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,040
372 true

702
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,344
What are my primary reasons for reaching this

703
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,880
Conclusion is that V

704
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,160
Self-involved for

705
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,952
Evans

706
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,976
Heiser the guy

707
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,536
And prior to that daughter had tackled him into a bush

708
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:49,632
It's the only PD procedure that anytime any forces used in an arrest

709
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,912
A supervising officer

710
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,192
Has to be notified

711
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,984
And it triggers an automatic forces

712
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,288
That happened in the fence

713
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:57,824
When that supervisor

714
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,872
Kaiser who specifically required to not be

715
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,640
Involved

716
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:03,200
Which is to say that they're neither daughter nor Evans

717
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,224
Supervisor

718
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,504
That guy arrived

719
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,808
Interview daughter and everyone involved

720
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,088
And no kick was mention

721
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,136
They examined

722
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,672
And he did have a scratch on his face

723
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,720
But that was consistent with daughter previously

724
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,744
Jack Williams Facebook

725
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,768
Listen to a bush

726
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,816
Navigate it was like a spear tackle

727
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,096
Coming to the crown

728
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,960
It's one where they have a history of

729
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,800
Where whistleblowers have been the targets of retaliation

730
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,616
It's hard to engage with the story without that

731
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,384
Sabine someone

732
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,248
And I will admit is I dug deeper into the story I felt myself contouring

733
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,040
Each new indication that daughter was

734
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,064
Clearly lying

735
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,832
With also

736
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,856
Well maybe

737
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,624
Cute cover up

738
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,952
Feel like I kept having that instinct to be like

739
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,768
Well I mean but

740
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,120
Ultimately if you look at the evidence

741
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:56,192
To this report there's a mountain of evidence indicating that he made this up

742
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,240
Countless holes in it

743
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:02,592
Obviously police departments are not entities that you want to side with

744
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:07,968
You're cool and it's always good to take allegations of excessive force series

745
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,760
From what I can tell

746
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,064
LAPD was absolutely right

747
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,832
Sapphire crystal

748
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,392
It seems like

749
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,768
It's not the resolution that you necessarily want always

750
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,792
Would rather

751
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,816
Come to the right

752
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,120
Conclusion to write accurate conclusion then

753
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:25,888
Something that I

754
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:32,288
What I desire to be like

755
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:37,408
I feel like Alex

756
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,552
Emotional Detroit Detroit

757
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:47,648
Sheriff Deputy Aloft

758
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,440
Try to fill it up to this

759
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,464
Supreme Court in there like

760
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,608
No

761
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,888
So anyway

762
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,424
I don't believe

763
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,960
First of all I don't believe

764
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,984
The

765
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,520
Basic narrative

766
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,288
Alex

767
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,848
But I also think that there's so much more

768
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,616
Complexity

769
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,408
He's capable or willing

770
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:13,504
So we'll get a little bit more stupidity from him but

771
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,784
Especially surround

772
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:19,392
Button

773
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:22,464
Put Sia closes the book on

774
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:42,432
Because for my health I cannot get angry

775
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,480
You know who else uses laughter is a

776
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,248
The steam valve

777
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,880
The funny hope

778
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:55,232
Should I always called him growing up Batman

779
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,560
I would say that that's some

780
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,584
I mean

781
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:03,168
I know that people often likes

782
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,448
I have to laugh.

783
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,984
From crying but they're not usually

784
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,520
Speaking literally

785
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,080
Kind of a poetic

786
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,896
Way of expressing Outlook

787
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:18,528
Alex is literally saying

788
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,576
The table

789
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,136
Then he's going to murder everybody

790
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,464
Clip

791
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,000
Complains that everyone is silk

792
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,024
Dumb

793
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,584
And part of the reason why they're still

794
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,120
Because they like monster truck

795
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,168
Pro wrestling

796
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,728
I just love where this

797
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:51,040
Professional wrestling in monster truck

798
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:54,112
Monster trucks

799
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:01,024
Monster truck

800
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:30,464
Chiron to pro wrestling

801
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,768
Sucking monster trucks

802
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:37,632
Monster truck rally truck

803
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:44,032
I love it

804
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:47,616
There's so little awareness

805
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:53,248
If he was aware

806
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:57,344
He would do that sort of thing a lot more legit funny

807
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:04,256
Expecting a Colbert type character

808
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,304
Complaining that he's dumb dumbs like

809
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,352
Monster trucks events getting into a

810
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:14,752
30 minutes

811
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:20,640
I think they're real forgets what monster trucks are real professional wrestling

812
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,664
Match the other day

813
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,480
To do that

814
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:31,136
Slap each other on the chest all the Mysterio jr. is a great wrestler

815
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:36,000
Your truck I think you would ask for Rey Mysterio's papers

816
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,280
Probably

817
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:42,144
Is taking a spot from

818
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,192
Other wrestler

819
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,216
Patriot

820
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,496
Jack Swagger

821
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,312
Tritops onnx quip

822
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,336
Alex

823
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:54,943
Pretty clear about his position or has been up to this point and

824
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:59,039
I think a little in the future I visit.

825
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,599
But at least his is

826
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,367
Is Angela

827
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,671
I'm not sure if he's going to say it's a false flag

828
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:08,767
But at this point Alex is very clear that he believes

829
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:11,327
Christopher Dorner and this whole situation is

830
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,423
Turns out that his audience

831
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,703
Doesn't like that

832
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:24,895
This is a stage government event

833
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:45,375
Justin

834
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,191
Barre class

835
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:48,959
I don't know

836
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,519
I choose

837
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:56,639
Engage with that so much I'm really mostly interested in the idea that Alex is kind of

838
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,431
You can feel it like it is

839
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,455
It doesn't come up

840
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,783
Super regularly that you can feel a sense of Alex.

841
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,111
Bummed out of Step

842
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:09,183
Into a certain extent I can respect that

843
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:15,327
Because a lesser person would probably hear the audience

844
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:18,399
Yeah he's sticking to his guns to ascertain

845
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,191
I don't know what that mean

846
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:25,567
4 time

847
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:31,455
On the day when the call is first called in today or later today like

848
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,551
Horrible yeah it was a couple weeks

849
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:39,135
Alex

850
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,415
Is alerted

851
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:44,255
We know that he is red white papers

852
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,815
Is a lot of books

853
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:50,399
No he can't do that's not one of the four ways to learn

854
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,959
No that's true but he's read them is that a lot of books

855
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,751
Yazoo

856
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,799
Bhaijaan Beholder in bookshelf

857
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,871
You've got the right

858
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,687
Stuff

859
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,223
Yet

860
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,759
Whenever you talk since

861
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:06,783
Specifics about

862
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,831
Any of those

863
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,999
Never really points to any specifics about the

864
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,279
Broad

865
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:20,095
Gesticulations towards a

866
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,167
Talks about other things

867
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:23,935
A little bit more

868
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:30,591
Just had an old-fashioned Corruptions

869
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:34,431
Predatory

870
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:40,575
Organized economy

871
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:53,119
Operation

872
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:59,775
12 Monkeys

873
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:07,711
By a biologist / biochemist

874
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:12,831
In their work

875
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,655
It's always a movie

876
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,447
Always

877
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,519
For some science fiction book

878
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:37,919
You got to go

879
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:41,247
No Alex

880
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,295
You dumb dumb

881
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:46,111
Alex talks about the Rothschild

882
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,647
Who are still

883
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,439
Quite Vegas

884
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,511
Interesting

885
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,791
Source

886
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:54,815
Information

887
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,863
For his beliefs

888
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,167
About the Rothschilds

889
00:45:59,423 --> 00:45:59,935
Before

890
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:11,711
Russian press

891
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,735
300

892
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:16,319
Dollars

893
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:20,415
100000000000000

894
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,231
So

895
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:26,303
It's really interesting to hear that Alex's

896
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,095
Media is a sorcerer is playing

897
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,887
The Rothschild family

898
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:30,911
300 trillion

899
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,679
Dollars

900
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,447
Leverage

901
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,983
300 trillion

902
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,311
Six-year-old now would say is a lot of

903
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,359
Or a villain in like a farce

904
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,151
The first

905
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,199
I have a problem with about this

906
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,991
This is the imprecision of the claim

907
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,551
What are the Rothschild family

908
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:52,927
Like their traces back to your amp shell Rothschild

909
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,695
1800

910
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,999
Over 200 years ago

911
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,559
Mayor Rothschild had ten children

912
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:01,375
And even just in one generation to family

913
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,679
Pretty spread thin

914
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,727
Pretty spread out

915
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:10,335
That the folks who are alive today and by that I mean the ones were born in

916
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,359
40

917
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:16,479
There is a sixth or seventh generation of the family traits back from Mayer amschel

918
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,015
Start like

919
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,855
Just a little bit

920
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:25,183
Not to say that a lot of the members of the family aren't real rich and it

921
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,463
Positions of high status

922
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,511
Society but it's important to point out that

923
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:33,119
Never really discussed his how many Rothschilds there are

924
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:36,703
And how it's a real stupid way to look at the world to imagine that they're all working

925
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:41,567
Together or it's some sort of a bloodline bass global domination conspiracy

926
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:44,639
And yet none of them has come out and talked about it not a bummer

927
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:48,991
It's all bulshit

928
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,783
Still running things

929
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:54,879
And lock it work

930
00:47:55,135 --> 00:48:00,767
In that case it doesn't work in this case there's lots of

931
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:06,655
Are the Rothschild is the one family member Alex has ever had on his show

932
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:09,215
You tried really hard to be polite

933
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,519
Sweet a******* to him

934
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,287
For no reason

935
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,567
Consider this

936
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:20,479
David's great-grandfather was Leopold the Rothschild whose great-grandfather himself his own

937
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,527
His great-grandfather is great-grandfather

938
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:24,063
Was Mayer amschel Rothschild

939
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:29,951
Whatever animals Alex has towards David based on lies about what his family did six or seven

940
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,743
Back really only makes sense

941
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,279
When you view it in the context

942
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:38,143
The Alex believe that there's something evil in their blood

943
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:40,703
And that all members of the family are intrinsically up to

944
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:46,079
Generally speaking it's really hard to hear blanket condemnations of quotes of Rothschild

945
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:48,639
As anything other than poorly disguised antisemita

946
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:55,551
Part of this is naturally because throughout history a lot of the people who attacked the Rothschilds weren't interested in Vegas

947
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,319
They're real until

948
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,343
Mysterious

949
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:01,951
A 1909 pamphlet that circulated about the evils of the Rothschild family

950
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,231
Included the proclamation

951
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:06,559
The Real Enemy!

952
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,095
It's only after

953
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,911
I don't know 1945

954
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:13,983
The people in most polite Society felt the need to

955
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,775
Aerotek on the Rothschild

956
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,823
We're totally due to the fact that they're rich in

957
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:20,383
Yeah if we're going to

958
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,175
Still hate Jews

959
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,711
You know I mean yeah

960
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,991
Holocaust happen

961
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,159
Can find a way to CO2 this Electric

962
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,999
The Russia part of it

963
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,559
The Rothschild family ever really,

964
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,327
Complicated history

965
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,655
Dating back to the pogrom of the early 90s

966
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:45,983
Azhar Hussain

967
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,007
Facilitating

968
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,031
Jewish riot

969
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,055
They were asked

970
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:53,407
Looking for 300 trillion dollars

971
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:57,503
Well I don't think the modern state of Russia really hates the Rothschilds

972
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,551
Like that I do believe that there's a lineage

973
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,575
Rothschild

974
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,367
In some parts

975
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,647
Of Russian culture that

976
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,415
It still lingers

977
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,719
And believe that Alex

978
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,743
Be taking its cues

979
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,511
From that point

980
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,303
Part as opposed to

981
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,607
Real History real

982
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:14,655
That's my guy

983
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:17,727
And I also don't know if Alex is like

984
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,007
You know

985
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,543
What you're expressing

986
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:21,567
Semitism

987
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,359
When you make these blankets

988
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,151
Declarations about the Rothschild

989
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,175
But I don't know if that's

990
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,199
What's motivating Alec

991
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,503
I could easily just the European like

992
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,807
This is what conspiracy theorists do

993
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,343
Yeah

994
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,367
I could see it just

995
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,159
BFB in the function of his lazy

996
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,463
More than like over Auntie cell

997
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:42,303
It's interesting

998
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,839
Is is definitely

999
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,119
Hippie Sabotage

1000
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,679
But that doesn't always mean that that's why you're wielding

1001
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:55,615
Variety of benefit of doubt

1002
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:59,711
Yeah it is the same

1003
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:02,271
Been at the heart of most genocide

1004
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:07,647
So everybody kind of knows that if it's if it's effective enough to get you to

1005
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,671
Mass murder

1006
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:13,023
People for no reason other than whatever characteristic

1007
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,047
To describe is different

1008
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,071
Then

1009
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,607
It doesn't even matter what you

1010
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:20,447
You hate just the mere fact that you're doing it expresses

1011
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,495
Jessamine racism

1012
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:23,775
Bigotry and massage

1013
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,543
The whole thing

1014
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,431
But I still think there's a decent chance that Alex

1015
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,199
Just stupid

1016
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,783
One of the reasons

1017
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,831
If you know you know a man by the company

1018
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:37,599
Keeps

1019
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:42,975
You hang out with raisins

1020
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,607
Alex

1021
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:52,447
Won't stop talking about a very specific thing

1022
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:54,751
That multiple people he knows

1023
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:55,519
Have done

1024
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,311
You know what I'm talkin about now

1025
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,383
We've heard him talk about this before

1026
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,175
I can't believe how

1027
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,711
Frequently brings this up

1028
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:22,399
You don't want to admit

1029
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:32,639
You're wrong

1030
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,647
Are mad at me

1031
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:50,559
Reminder

1032
00:52:56,191 --> 00:53:00,543
Obama

1033
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:01,823
He talks

1034
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,615
So much about his friend

1035
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:08,735
Being hit with that Nigerian scam emails

1036
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:12,831
Radio host

1037
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,135
Jesus Christ

1038
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:19,743
Either that or Glenn Beck is that we thought asking for a friend

1039
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:26,399
I'm mad at myself for falling for that

1040
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:29,471
He's all the characters in the storage

1041
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:36,127
I just think it's made it also something I'm going to do from now on

1042
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,919
Finding every five

1043
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:41,247
Every single time

1044
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:47,647
Winchester missed the first time

1045
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:50,463
Under $5,000

1046
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:52,767
Turns out this pocket

1047
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:55,071
Thrusting

1048
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,095
I had a good heart

1049
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,191
Most of the show is

1050
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:00,959
Is just

1051
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,751
Alex

1052
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,823
Musically about the globalist

1053
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,103
And their plans

1054
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,639
Just sort of Freestyle Wrestling

1055
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,431
I'm so now we move on to

1056
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:15,807
So it was next clip but Alex is just trying to make the argument here the rampal

1057
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:22,719
Hypocrite but in the process he does is literally defined

1058
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:43,455
That's a critical hits

1059
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:50,879
Money is philosophically opposed

1060
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:51,647
Taking this money

1061
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,415
He is not

1062
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:55,743
Successful in stopping

1063
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:04,447
What are you what are you going to stand up against an oppressive system like some kind of idiot principles

1064
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:08,799
I don't know

1065
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,103
I would say that that indicates to me

1066
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,895
Is Ron Paul is a big lip service

1067
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,855
People like to talk s***

1068
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,183
Start telling a story about high school

1069
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,511
Things about

1070
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,559
His time in high school that like I don't believe

1071
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,095
This is one that I asked

1072
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:41,567
Sharon High School

1073
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,415
The Breakthrough we got cut off

1074
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:59,231
Before I could really full

1075
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:02,303
Before

1076
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,351
School nurse school nurse

1077
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:06,655
Give people

1078
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,447
I believe this story

1079
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,983
Here's here's why

1080
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,287
In most schools the School nurses

1081
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,103
Prescribed medication

1082
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:20,223
Even if their educational level and Licensing might legally allow them to

1083
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,623
Schoolhouse services are set up

1084
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:28,671
National Association of

1085
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,743
School nurses very clear their guidelines

1086
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:34,815
Administer prescription medication that the student is on

1087
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,607
Without a quote written medication

1088
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:39,167
Conform

1089
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:45,567
With the name of the student the drug dose approximate time it's to be taken at the diagnosis or the Medicaid

1090
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:47,359
Paperwork and

1091
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:49,407
Administering

1092
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,687
Crystal meth

1093
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:52,223
2 p.m. everyday

1094
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:52,991
Why

1095
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:55,295
Cuz it's f****** dope cuz we're moving

1096
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,087
We like to party

1097
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:05,023
Pool versus don't have instead of sitting around their offices to give kids

1098
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:05,791
This is just

1099
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:09,887
Way outside the budget for pretty much all but the richest schools imaginable

1100
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:12,959
Seriously think for one second about what Alex's describing

1101
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:14,239
And you just see I call that's

1102
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:20,639
Most School nurses are required to keep epinephrine albuterol diazepam and glucagon

1103
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,431
Because those are emergency medication

1104
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:24,479
They could literally be needed to save it

1105
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,247
The kid's life

1106
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,783
The Beyond

1107
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:27,551
Just aspirin

1108
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,367
Gargle with salt water

1109
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:32,671
Like

1110
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,207
She kept people

1111
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,487
They asked people to

1112
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:39,839
Keep their adderal in there like

1113
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,911
Amphetamines it around

1114
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:52,127
Talk about anything with real at all what he's describing is that he saw the school nurse dispensing medication

1115
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,151
Primary care physician

1116
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:56,479
I prescribed for them and he's created a nefarious backstory

1117
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:58,527
That into a stupid world

1118
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,599
He's witnessing a

1119
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,903
Crime that would have made national headlines

1120
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:10,559
Somehow this nurses got access to Tons of Speed and she's just getting kids hooked on it presumably for no reason

1121
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:14,655
That's crazy

1122
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:17,727
I prefer that

1123
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,519
Sleep

1124
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,127
If I had to guess

1125
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:24,895
What's might

1126
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,943
Assertive

1127
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:27,711
Morcellation

1128
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,247
Sounds like look at me

1129
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:35,647
As an adult believe that to be a real memory why he experienced that as a child

1130
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:37,951
It's because ADHD was name

1131
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,231
Air conditioning

1132
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:39,999
87

1133
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:41,279
And along with that

1134
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:44,095
Increased understanding of the condition was

1135
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,119
Coming in

1136
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:45,887
Consciousness

1137
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:50,495
Because of that treatment over with ritalin became way more prevalent in the early 90s

1138
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:52,543
Alex would have been

1139
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,311
High School

1140
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:55,871
We already know that his dad and grandfather were both

1141
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,663
Completely insane paranoiac

1142
00:58:59,199 --> 00:58:59,967
The kind of makes

1143
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:00,991
Some of that

1144
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,015
Insanity

1145
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:02,783
Be funneled in this

1146
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,087
Correction

1147
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,111
And Alex seized

1148
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,391
The school nurse handing out

1149
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,159
Prescribed meds

1150
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:16,095
Creative writes a book about it you can totally see him going home and telling his dad about it

1151
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:18,655
Meds and his dad goes off of on this whole life

1152
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,703
Hey man I am a

1153
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:22,751
I know what those meds

1154
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:28,127
Absolutely

1155
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:33,503
So also on this February 12th show Alex has an interview

1156
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,527
For f****** ever

1157
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:36,831
It's because that's

1158
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,111
Alex

1159
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:42,975
Decided that he wants to talk about the universe being a simulation

1160
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:46,303
Do you want Dutch Brothers

1161
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,327
You want to get

1162
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:48,863
Real

1163
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,679
Lionshead on to talk about

1164
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,983
First person you call is

1165
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:55,263
Is David f****** Ike

1166
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,543
And you know what

1167
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,847
I'm sure some people are going to be listening to this

1168
00:59:59,103 --> 00:59:59,615
And they're going to be like

1169
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:00,639
Wait

1170
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:02,943
David Icke was on and you don't any clips of it

1171
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,991
They'll probably think that

1172
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:06,271
Somehow it Injustice

1173
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:08,575
It is not

1174
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:09,855
It is a very bad

1175
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:10,879
Very bad

1176
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:18,559
We got pretty boring

1177
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,839
It's really boring stuff

1178
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:25,983
David I posted an article on his quote

1179
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:29,055
Hook was released

1180
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,847
Contradict

1181
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,383
Sure so

1182
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:34,175
Chalk him up on that team

1183
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:34,943
Gotcha

1184
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:41,599
Also on this episode here on the 12th Alex's really bent out of shape about the idea that Chris Kyle

1185
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,367
Sniper

1186
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,903
He has been killed

1187
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:44,671
Alex

1188
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:48,767
Conspiracy of some sort short but he still hasn't really

1189
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:49,535
He thinks happened

1190
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,559
At all

1191
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:51,583
It's very difficult

1192
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,887
But now there's another conspiracy

1193
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:54,911
Because they're having

1194
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:55,679
The funeral

1195
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,983
Chris Kyle in Austin

1196
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,775
And the highway is closed down

1197
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,055
Because of precession

1198
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,079
Alex

1199
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:06,687
Furious about it

1200
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:09,503
I can't tell you

1201
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:18,975
On somebody

1202
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:25,631
All right that's right now I remember the the whole Jesse Ventura American Sniper off

1203
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:26,399
Yeah

1204
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:31,263
Chris Kyle had claimed the Jesse Ventura was drunk and running his mouth off at a bar

1205
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:35,871
Chris Kyle beat him up and then Victorious

1206
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,455
Alex

1207
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,991
The word of believe

1208
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,271
The globalist

1209
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:44,575
Killed Chris Kyle

1210
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,111
They hit him up

1211
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:51,999
To take down Jesse Ventura Chris Kyle

1212
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:56,095
About who had told him to Target tomorrow okay okay

1213
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,167
Specific about that that I can't even

1214
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,447
I can't

1215
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:02,751
Percent tell you that that's what he's saying

1216
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,543
Seems like that's what Alex

1217
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:09,407
It's very it's very nonsensical

1218
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:10,687
What Alex

1219
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:13,759
Seems to be saying is probably more accurate

1220
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:15,295
Then what is actually

1221
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,135
But I think more important

1222
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,159
Play because of something

1223
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:20,927
Concrete

1224
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,719
Alex

1225
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:23,743
Anger

1226
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:25,535
About this funeral procession

1227
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:27,583
Ludacris

1228
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,631
Deep and meaningful

1229
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:34,495
Map with other people who should have funeral procession

1230
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:37,823
And each one of them I'm like

1231
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:38,591
Okay

1232
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:46,783
Like all of them

1233
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:55,487
You already said yes I also am certain

1234
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:58,303
Any of these things that I also suggest

1235
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:02,655
All the soldier other soldiers funeral procession

1236
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:07,007
A+ is any of that ever at actually happened Alex would be like

1237
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:10,335
35 shutdown

1238
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:13,151
Pissed off no matter what

1239
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,687
As he's complaining about that

1240
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,991
This is the last time we have from the 12

1241
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:18,527
I think

1242
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:19,551
Tips

1243
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:20,575
About something

1244
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:24,927
Another one of these Revelations about him that I wish that I'd had

1245
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:26,719
Cuz I think

1246
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,743
It explains a lot

1247
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:48,479
The control of reality

1248
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,503
Alex

1249
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,295
What are the things that motivate

1250
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,319
Great

1251
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:53,599
Is

1252
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,135
That he wants

1253
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,159
To decide

1254
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,463
He want

1255
01:03:58,975 --> 01:03:59,999
To create reality

1256
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:00,767
Absolutely

1257
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:03,839
He's a reality

1258
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:05,119
Is out of Step

1259
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,679
With

1260
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:13,055
The best job all the time stories

1261
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,663
And because his stories are so

1262
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:19,455
Stilted they're so factually inaccurate

1263
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:22,783
You're so manipulative in headlines

1264
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,319
And Lead

1265
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:26,367
Submarine

1266
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:29,439
Because there's so much manipulation involved no one

1267
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:31,231
The time of day

1268
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:32,511
Any respectable press

1269
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,327
People who read

1270
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,631
The circles

1271
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:42,751
That I think there was a real chip on your shoulder

1272
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:45,823
I don't know if I necessarily

1273
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,871
Fully understood

1274
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:48,639
How much

1275
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,663
That really

1276
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:52,479
The primary driver

1277
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:57,599
I know that I've heard him talk about like we control the narrative

1278
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:58,879
You know

1279
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,159
I get

1280
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:03,999
I get that I've always have always got that

1281
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:06,303
But that always felt more to me like

1282
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:07,839
I'm going to

1283
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:11,679
The primary Pusher of a news story

1284
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:13,215
As opposed to like

1285
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,495
I am going to

1286
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:16,799
Important

1287
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:20,127
I know that that's fine.

1288
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,943
I think that another piece of it too is

1289
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:23,711
Alex

1290
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:24,991
Pretending

1291
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,319
Right

1292
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,087
Ohio

1293
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,415
Besides important

1294
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,183
He has the

1295
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:37,535
Strength and backing of all the people

1296
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:39,327
People really think is important

1297
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,423
A weird sort of delusion

1298
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,191
Yeah

1299
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:46,751
I see him

1300
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:47,775
In this

1301
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:48,799
Place of

1302
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:51,359
I don't know how much of what he believes

1303
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:53,407
How much would he says he believes he

1304
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:56,735
No s*** but I know he believes that enough of it

1305
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,015
2

1306
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,575
Have to feel disoriented almost

1307
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,343
All the time

1308
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:02,879
Because

1309
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:03,647
It's not

1310
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:04,927
Real fright

1311
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:08,255
Situation you can either adjust your

1312
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:11,071
Sense of reality to what is real or

1313
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,351
You can

1314
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:15,935
Feel everyday like you're losing your mind

1315
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:19,007
The feeling of being gassy

1316
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:20,799
All the time

1317
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:23,103
So I imagined him

1318
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:25,663
Saying like the media controls the the

1319
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:27,199
The story or the media is

1320
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:28,735
Is the story or whatever

1321
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:30,783
Is it his way of

1322
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:33,855
Kind of like wiggling out through that gas

1323
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:37,695
Eliza Doolittle

1324
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:38,719
Creative

1325
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:42,815
The only other way you can feel gas-lit all day everyday

1326
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:45,887
Succumb

1327
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,167
Quit

1328
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:47,935
Yeah

1329
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,799
So we move on to the 13th

1330
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:55,615
Crystal Werner has died

1331
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:02,783
In the woods

1332
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:05,599
You know

1333
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,159
Wydown

1334
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:10,975
What ended up happening was the police

1335
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:11,999
Shot in

1336
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:12,767
Some

1337
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:13,535
Canisters

1338
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:14,559
Gas canister

1339
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:15,839
Smoke him out

1340
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,375
Did not work

1341
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,423
Pyrotechnic

1342
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,447
Gas can

1343
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:21,471
Canisters

1344
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,007
Better called burner

1345
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,543
One of them

1346
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:25,311
Set one

1347
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,335
Exterior walls on

1348
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,103
Bonfire

1349
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,895
The place ended up going up

1350
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:29,919
In Flames before

1351
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:30,687
Granny fire

1352
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:31,967
Control

1353
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:33,247
People could get there

1354
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:35,807
Daughter ended up shooting himself

1355
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,087
Inside the belt

1356
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:38,879
Alex

1357
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:40,671
I believe

1358
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:41,951
Is

1359
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,743
To turn the corner

1360
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:44,767
On Chris Dorner

1361
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,303
Because

1362
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:48,351
Of the nature of what hap

1363
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,167
Experience

1364
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:52,703
Which you'll see very clearly

1365
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:53,471
Sports Clip

1366
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,239
February 3rd

1367
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:17,535
Alex cannot talk about the news without tying it to Waco

1368
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:19,071
Here's another example of

1369
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:23,167
Right now

1370
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,551
All he can do is

1371
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:40,831
Burien space through the

1372
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:43,391
The prism of this deeply traumatic events

1373
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,415
From his own path

1374
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,719
I got it he was at Waco

1375
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:47,743
It's so traumatized

1376
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,279
Such a big part of his early

1377
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,047
Career

1378
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,839
Did everything is seen through the prism of

1379
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,375
Man

1380
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:56,447
Criminal in police around

1381
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,727
Fire involved

1382
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:02,079
Must be wake up

1383
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:04,895
I think it's often

1384
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:10,015
Died in a Waco

1385
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:13,599
Statue in a similar Waco situation would be like

1386
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:15,135
Will you know more

1387
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:15,903
Chile

1388
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:17,439
He was probably just being

1389
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:22,815
Control there's a bridge

1390
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:24,863
Safari app

1391
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,703
Cuz I I don't think

1392
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:31,775
Is a full coming around on him

1393
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:33,311
B

1394
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,615
Waco and

1395
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,639
Branch Davidian

1396
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,199
David koresh

1397
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:40,991
Our ultimate

1398
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,015
Victim

1399
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:45,087
They are people just love guns

1400
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:48,415
Good good folk good Christian

1401
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:53,791
Doug McClure

1402
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,071
His

1403
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:57,631
Characterization of them

1404
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:58,655
Is Dutch

1405
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,959
For government murder

1406
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:02,239
Government oppression

1407
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,311
I can't stress enough

1408
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:07,103
There's never a negative word

1409
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,383
About crash in the brain

1410
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:11,455
There's never any negative connotation

1411
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:13,247
In Alex's coverage

1412
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:14,783
Only making

1413
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:16,575
Excuses for why the government

1414
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:17,343
Wrong

1415
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,367
Well that kind of s***

1416
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:19,903
So

1417
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,183
Talks about Waco

1418
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,231
Repeat it

1419
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:24,511
In terms of

1420
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:25,791
It's not

1421
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:28,863
Just a situation where he's saying if there was a fire

1422
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,911
What he's doing

1423
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:32,447
He is at

1424
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,519
His listeners hat

1425
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,311
If you've listened to Alex

1426
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,847
Look for a long. Of time

1427
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:42,431
Expensive like

1428
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:45,247
Magic Arena really f*** this

1429
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:48,063
Good people over

1430
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:51,647
Kill the guy and it was murdered he was probably

1431
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:53,951
Repeat

1432
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:57,279
Funny Rico

1433
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:14,943
Despicable

1434
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:22,623
Evocative but I want you to remember that I'm also

1435
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:24,159
Attaching to Renee

1436
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:26,207
It's that it's pretty

1437
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,999
The responsible thing to do

1438
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,279
Especially considering

1439
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,327
Comparisons are not

1440
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,375
Tear down a wall

1441
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:36,447
In the door situation

1442
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:37,215
Purpose

1443
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:41,823
Alex doesn't know what happened

1444
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:43,103
And he admits as much

1445
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:47,711
Weather was the flower

1446
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:06,655
That's

1447
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:08,191
Is it means those

1448
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,471
The pyrotechnic one

1449
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:10,751
Cuz they had

1450
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:13,055
A potential for being able to set fires

1451
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:16,639
If you want to discuss whether or not that was irresponsible absolute

1452
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:18,175
Let's have a conversation

1453
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,223
I don't know

1454
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:22,015
I don't have a position on it

1455
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,039
Cuz I don't need

1456
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:26,111
If a forced air force

1457
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,647
I'll think about it some more

1458
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:31,999
Question of there were recording

1459
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,303
Burn It Down

1460
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:35,071
Yeah

1461
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:37,119
To the extent

1462
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:39,935
Was that before there was a fire accidentally

1463
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:40,703
We started

1464
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:41,471
Get out

1465
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:45,567
They're yelling burn it down have any

1466
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:50,943
Actual impact of the fire was started that's another important question

1467
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:51,967
None of that

1468
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:52,991
Reconsider buyout

1469
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:54,783
Triggered

1470
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:55,807
By his memories

1471
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:58,111
And feelings about Waco

1472
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:01,183
It's overriding Isabella.

1473
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:02,207
To think critically

1474
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:03,999
It's overriding his ability to assess

1475
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:05,791
The situation as it is

1476
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:08,095
It's overriding his ability to even make a can

1477
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,447
Harken back

1478
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,983
Back to Waco talk about that

1479
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:16,543
Just drying

1480
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:18,591
Move Along

1481
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,895
I I wish I had

1482
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:23,711
Out of nowhere

1483
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:26,015
It almost sounds like they had to life

1484
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:28,575
Wait wait wait

1485
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:31,647
What what

1486
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:38,047
Monkey

1487
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:41,375
I mean it to be responsible level of conjecture

1488
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:43,423
You could

1489
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:45,471
Look into it call somebody

1490
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:46,239
For combat

1491
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:52,639
Check-in what was meant by burners when he said birders on that tape what does that mean find that colloquial

1492
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,431
Slang for these

1493
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:57,503
You know it

1494
01:13:57,759 --> 01:14:00,063
Or you could get on Eric

1495
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,343
Flamethrowers

1496
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,367
Which is a response

1497
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:05,439
TGIF

1498
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,207
Flamethrowers

1499
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:13,119
Provided they never use

1500
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:23,103
It's like the epinephrine of the school nurse office nurse monster come

1501
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:26,943
Fire extinguisher is the flamethrower

1502
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:30,271
Just to keep Fire and Ice right there must always be a balance

1503
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:31,807
So Alex starts talking

1504
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:33,599
This point about how Obama

1505
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:35,647
His administration

1506
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:36,415
Mafia

1507
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:41,279
His only real comment about Sandy Hook

1508
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:42,559
Episode

1509
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:44,095
For this stretch of episodes which

1510
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:49,215
Again since we're trying to understand that path is deeply disappointed

1511
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:50,239
Distracted by

1512
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,519
Other major world

1513
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:54,079
I'm at 10 also.

1514
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:56,895
It's it's kind of disappointing

1515
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:57,919
But here we go

1516
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:00,223
Mafia

1517
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:06,623
Air Force One helicopter

1518
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:12,511
It's Obama probably did say

1519
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:16,095
One thing that is a through line

1520
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:19,935
We can say absolutely is that Alex does not believe

1521
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:22,239
Adam Lanza

1522
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,287
That has been

1523
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:26,335
Consistent from the day of the

1524
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:28,639
The shooting till now here we are in

1525
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:29,663
The second week

1526
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:30,431
February

1527
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,479
He has dabbled with

1528
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:36,575
Flirted with the idea that no one died

1529
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,671
Also was happy to platform

1530
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:42,207
Professor

1531
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:43,231
Right

1532
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,791
It's weird there is

1533
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:46,559
There is

1534
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:50,911
Definite

1535
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:52,447
It's a false flag

1536
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:55,775
And

1537
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:57,823
Push and pull

1538
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:59,615
I lied like pushing

1539
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:00,383
Cool Whip

1540
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,407
It was all actor

1541
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,175
It was fake

1542
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:06,527
I'm so at this point Alex starts to take a call

1543
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:09,087
And gets one call from the lady

1544
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:10,879
Who was in Iraq

1545
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:11,647
Turn on Facebook

1546
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:12,671
Gerald Celente

1547
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:14,463
Are commenting back and forth

1548
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:15,487
Great-aunt

1549
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:17,023
She said something

1550
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:18,303
F******

1551
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:20,095
You know I think

1552
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:22,655
I'll probably hear in 2013 or black

1553
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:23,679
That's a good point

1554
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:27,263
But now it's no

1555
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:28,031
Stupid

1556
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:31,103
And it last night bunch of us were watching you know

1557
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:34,687
President Gerald Celente

1558
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:39,295
Retreating back and forth with some of us on Facebook and things and all I kept thinking is

1559
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:42,623
Before it lurks could have gotten

1560
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,671
Anybody

1561
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:47,743
Information

1562
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:49,279
Probably wouldn't have happened

1563
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,607
Obama kids

1564
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:53,631
The internet

1565
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:54,655
Control

1566
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:56,959
We will lose this battle

1567
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:57,983
Very quickly

1568
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:09,759
Hitler never could a roast

1569
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:12,319
The power with circle

1570
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:24,607
Hitler is in his grave

1571
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:30,751
So in this next clip Alex just

1572
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:32,543
Waco indoor nerd

1573
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:33,567
Together even more clothes

1574
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:38,687
This is confirmed

1575
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:52,767
He's turned it into a verb

1576
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:55,327
Throughout the shower

1577
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,375
Recent gets confirmed they brought in

1578
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,679
These armored vehicles

1579
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:01,983
Thought in the official record at all

1580
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,263
It's not confirmed

1581
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:05,311
He cannot

1582
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,079
Experience

1583
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:07,615
Any other way

1584
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:09,151
Then add another way

1585
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:10,687
That's f***** up

1586
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:12,223
Cuz it doesn't it doesn't work

1587
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:14,783
So get the call

1588
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:17,087
And this dude wants to spread

1589
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,367
Conspiracy about life

1590
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:20,415
Hey they found is I

1591
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:22,975
The building burned

1592
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:29,631
Daughter I thought it strange they now said you know this always weird things every time something like this happens and

1593
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,911
Never ends up the Kinect right

1594
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:34,495
They said that they found his driver's license near his body

1595
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:38,847
Personal license survive that Inferno

1596
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:43,199
I don't know why don't you read up on it under his body

1597
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:44,991
So that's how it survived

1598
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:48,319
I didn't burn up because it was under a body

1599
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:52,671
Very easy

1600
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:57,023
For you to not be a super critical or looking into things

1601
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,559
Kind of person

1602
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,607
He survived a fire

1603
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:02,399
Makes no sense

1604
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:04,447
Simple

1605
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:06,239
There's so many possibilities

1606
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,775
You don't know about

1607
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:09,823
In terms of other places

1608
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:12,383
Could have been

1609
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:14,431
Whatever it survived

1610
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:16,991
Possibilities

1611
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:19,295
Which turned out to be

1612
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:20,831
What's in the report

1613
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:22,367
Is that he was on

1614
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,135
Top of his ID

1615
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:25,439
So it's shielded it from the fire

1616
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:26,463
Made them able

1617
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,487
To find it

1618
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:28,767
And that's what makes

1619
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:30,559
Propaganda so f***

1620
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:32,863
Is because what you would want

1621
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:33,887
To say

1622
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:34,655
Is like

1623
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:38,751
Look it up

1624
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:42,591
You can find that information a lot but do you know what else you can find

1625
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:45,407
Completely contradictory information

1626
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:50,271
That is pushing to your you know like what

1627
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:52,063
Take away the information part of

1628
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:53,343
Contradictory

1629
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:58,463
Contradict

1630
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:01,023
Presentation yeah totally

1631
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:03,327
And also it's a you know

1632
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:07,423
I think it's most unsatisfying February 13th

1633
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,983
Instalike

1634
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,263
To this caller at that point

1635
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:14,592
I don't know why don't we wait to hear Samantha

1636
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:18,944
Right I don't know why because the report

1637
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:22,272
But the answer is very simple

1638
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:25,088
It comes back to the

1639
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:25,856
Concrete

1640
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,672
If you wait until it dries

1641
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:31,744
The idea will not be suspicious

1642
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:35,840
Because everyone will know that it was because it was under his body

1643
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:39,424
If while the concrete is wet you inject the idea that it's

1644
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:45,824
Suspicious that is ID is there it will not be affected by the time that information gets out because by that point

1645
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:49,920
And used it to build the conspiracy up higher

1646
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:52,224
It'll be built upon by that point

1647
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:58,624
And to accept the contradictory piece of information

1648
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,904
Or at least

1649
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:00,928
Risk of falling over

1650
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,976
So this is why these

1651
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,768
It's very important

1652
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:05,536
Boyfriend

1653
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:14,752
Because

1654
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,056
Alex

1655
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:20,384
Probably says one of the craziest things I've ever heard

1656
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:22,944
But this one might rank

1657
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:23,712
Up there

1658
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:27,040
Before he does he clarifies that he does still pretty much

1659
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:28,576
This is not a false

1660
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:31,136
And the daughter is still

1661
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:34,464
Afterwards

1662
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:35,744
Is batch

1663
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:40,352
The system almost always wise

1664
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:54,176
Supposedly what

1665
01:21:54,432 --> 01:22:00,576
I've not heard him bring that up

1666
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:05,440
Before I think you might be able to contribute

1667
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:07,488
Are there Booth guitars

1668
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:10,816
There are

1669
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:11,584
I mean

1670
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:15,680
That's pretty that's pretty that's a big swing

1671
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:22,080
I like I admire the f***

1672
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:25,152
Yes man if you're going to say anything the Volkswagen

1673
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:31,552
Go all the way back to the beginning killed

1674
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:32,320
Who killed

1675
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:41,280
Veterinarian on the case

1676
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:45,120
I'm glad you brought that up I'm glad you brought up.

1677
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:48,448
You're welcome he's not on the show

1678
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,520
Right after all this stuff

1679
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:52,800
African parrot

1680
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:56,128
The daughter situation to go over and over again

1681
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,920
Mischaracterizing

1682
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:58,688
The

1683
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:00,992
Dorner's death

1684
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:03,552
A bunch of idiots

1685
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:05,600
Finally stupid thing

1686
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:06,880
Alex then

1687
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:08,416
Has one of his sponsors on

1688
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:11,488
Clearpoint app

1689
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:12,512
It is introduction

1690
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:33,760
He's on the air weather

1691
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:36,576
So he's got to Steve shank the food guy on

1692
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:38,112
Here

1693
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:38,880
Is how

1694
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:39,648
Beef shank

1695
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:40,672
Uses

1696
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:41,696
Christopher Dorner

1697
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:43,232
And this entire situation

1698
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:44,512
Giselle amergint

1699
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:51,168
If everyone had a year's supply of food

1700
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,704
And

1701
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:59,104
The only ones

1702
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:01,408
Jeremy

1703
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:05,504
The victims are the problem

1704
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:10,368
You know one of the principles that you and I talked about

1705
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:11,136
Is

1706
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,928
Prepared

1707
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:16,256
You can turn a disaster into an adventure

1708
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:19,072
No I'm not saying what

1709
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:20,864
Is a potential

1710
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:22,656
Adventure good

1711
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:24,704
But the mob psychology

1712
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,264
Anxiety

1713
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:30,848
Decided to do something

1714
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:34,944
Preparedness

1715
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:38,528
So I'm glad he's not saying this is a potential Adventures

1716
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:40,832
Is he saying that

1717
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:43,648
Killed more people if

1718
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:44,928
No no no

1719
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:47,744
He's saying the day you know you got a crazy on the

1720
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:54,400
It's scary to go out if you got a home

1721
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:06,176
That's insane levels of exploitation and manipulation

1722
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:10,016
Timeline where we never

1723
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,808
Oh my God that's the worst

1724
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:16,672
F****** thing exploding people

1725
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:17,952
Well yeah of course

1726
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:21,792
Yeah

1727
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:23,584
3 years ago you would have been like

1728
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:24,352
What

1729
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:29,984
That deserves a

1730
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:34,080
A whole f****** article

1731
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:40,480
Whatever

1732
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:41,504
Food

1733
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:46,112
So Alex is talking about how

1734
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:47,136
Ricky heard

1735
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,416
Unlike the police

1736
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:50,208
Radio

1737
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:52,000
What is recording

1738
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:54,048
The police mentioned

1739
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:56,096
Heather talking about

1740
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:58,144
100

1741
01:25:58,656 --> 01:25:59,168
Teriyaki

1742
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,192
Flamethrowers

1743
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:00,960
Alex

1744
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:01,984
Thanks for calling

1745
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:02,752
Forecastle

1746
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:21,952
So

1747
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:26,048
They're looking for the explicit purpose

1748
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:27,584
Vernon's house

1749
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:28,864
Gimme a Break

1750
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:35,520
You just can't

1751
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:36,800
Which he would

1752
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:41,920
Unless you wanted to somehow pivot the story

1753
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:46,784
I don't know how much I felt very strongly suspect

1754
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,344
Because it's soaked

1755
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,624
Consistent throughout this up

1756
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:51,904
But it is

1757
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:52,928
Sew-ins

1758
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:58,304
I know that you still saying it's a real thing

1759
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,840
And I don't know how he's going to change

1760
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:03,424
But I know that he is he's indicating to me

1761
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,960
That the story is about to check

1762
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:08,544
That this is this is going to be a police state story

1763
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:13,408
Narrative in a way that he

1764
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:16,992
Didn't seem all that interested in doing up until pretty

1765
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:18,528
No recently if it's

1766
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:21,088
It needed he needed to check in a fire and then

1767
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:23,392
Fries

1768
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:26,720
This is something I could work with before

1769
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:29,024
There's a f****** dumb Obama guy

1770
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:33,888
The media loves in bonao this is a so I got I got s*** to say

1771
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:37,216
So we started this episode on the 10th

1772
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:40,288
February

1773
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,080
If 1%

1774
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:43,360
Abbas Khan weirdos

1775
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:45,152
Decide to start killing cops

1776
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:46,432
You'll all be deck

1777
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:48,224
And this is how we ended the show

1778
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:48,992
On February 3rd

1779
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:11,776
Very quickly

1780
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:25,600
You do the math

1781
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:28,672
Also be

1782
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:29,952
Deeply

1783
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:31,232
In his

1784
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:33,536
Where he lives

1785
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:34,304
In terms of its

1786
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:36,608
Does he have any friendships

1787
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:37,376
What's that

1788
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:38,656
Based around

1789
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:39,424
Mob like

1790
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,192
Extortion

1791
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:42,496
Rapoport

1792
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:45,824
I don't know

1793
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:46,848
Listen

1794
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:47,872
Rapoport

1795
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,408
If you hang that

1796
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,176
Picture up look

1797
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:51,712
Nobody's better friend

1798
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:54,528
If you hang the end I don't want to see anything bad at

1799
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,576
But if you hang that picture up

1800
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:58,880
1.6 million dominoes are going

1801
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,184
And that is some

1802
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:02,720
Don't want to see

1803
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:04,768
He happened

1804
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:09,888
I don't understand how Alex imagines that all 1 points

1805
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:10,656
6 million

1806
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,960
These gun owners will somehow coordinate

1807
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:13,728
Which cops are going to

1808
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:19,360
Mykel

1809
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:25,760
I would guarantee that anything like this happened they would kill more Avicii

1810
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:27,552
Other 100%

1811
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:30,368
Preoccupation

1812
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:32,416
So deeply f***** up

1813
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:33,696
It's so unhealthy

1814
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:35,488
Some ideas like if

1815
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:36,512
If you put a few.

1816
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:38,816
Towards

1817
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:40,608
This political

1818
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,400
Decision that I am against

1819
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:46,240
Will Altos work

1820
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:49,824
F****** country will be killed and it's ludicrous to imagine

1821
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:02,112
Disappear into the forest you'll never know who did it all the sudden the next thing you know

1822
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:02,880
Very quick

1823
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:03,904
Obviously

1824
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:08,256
Close late

1825
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:10,560
And if you take that book to be

1826
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:11,328
Application

1827
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,352
The people didn't

1828
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:14,400
Just kill police officers

1829
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:15,680
80s

1830
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:17,216
They also went after Paula tissue

1831
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:18,496
So if

1832
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:20,800
This rhetoric is so wrapped up in that

1833
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:22,336
Mythology

1834
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:25,408
It's hard to hear this is not like people listening

1835
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:28,224
Read that book 2

1836
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:30,528
They know they know what this is triggering

1837
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:32,064
And their brains

1838
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,368
Express

1839
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:36,416
Hades god

1840
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:37,184
Politician

1841
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:39,232
Anyone who votes for gun-control measure

1842
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:41,792
6 million

1843
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:45,888
Veiled

1844
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:48,192
It's a variable

1845
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:51,264
But it still veiled enough too much like

1846
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,032
That

1847
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:52,800
Rancher

1848
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:58,688
Was only a cause for concern

1849
01:30:58,944 --> 01:30:59,712
Concerned

1850
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:01,504
It's not a it's not a direct

1851
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,272
Breitbart

1852
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:04,064
Anyone who knows what he's talkin

1853
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,112
About

1854
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:07,904
I don't know

1855
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,696
Is headspace really f***** up

1856
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:11,232
Weird that you can

1857
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:13,536
It's nice

1858
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,072
I think

1859
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:16,096
Long run

1860
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:17,120
In the largest

1861
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:18,912
So you can get on the radio

1862
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:20,704
And threaten to kill one boy

1863
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:23,776
If they do a thing you don't want

1864
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:26,080
Additionally threatened

1865
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:29,152
Ultimately I think

1866
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,528
Testament to

1867
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:35,296
Free speech

1868
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:36,064
Being

1869
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:37,344
Yeah

1870
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,368
Weird

1871
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:42,720
It seems like that's probably one of those things are alike

1872
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:44,512
Weird

1873
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:48,096
I find it.

1874
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:50,144
Over this

1875
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,960
Span of time evolution of Alex's

1876
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:53,984
Position on door

1877
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:58,592
Quarter-turn

1878
01:31:59,104 --> 01:31:59,616
But he's making

1879
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:02,944
See how it plays out

1880
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:03,968
Because I know that

1881
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:09,600
The factory owner killed himself

1882
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:10,880
Stop people from

1883
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:13,696
Talking about it I know there's a story for a bit

1884
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:17,280
After that

1885
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:18,048
The post

1886
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:18,816
Mortem

1887
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:20,864
The story

1888
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:21,888
Asbestos

1889
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:22,912
Is gone as the

1890
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:24,704
Safeer

1891
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:27,264
People were living

1892
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,312
California

1893
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:30,080
Remove

1894
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:31,616
From the equation how does

1895
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:32,896
Move forward with the

1896
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:35,456
The Narrative I think it's going to get

1897
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:37,760
What would I always find fascinating

1898
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,832
His position

1899
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:43,904
Somewhat evolved

1900
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:48,512
With no regard for the story at all.

1901
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:50,048
Nothing to do with his

1902
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,328
No I'm out of him

1903
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:52,096
Information about

1904
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:52,864
Facts

1905
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,400
All you needed to hear

1906
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:55,936
22

1907
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:57,472
Flip that switch was

1908
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:58,496
Shacking fire

1909
01:32:59,264 --> 01:32:59,776
Like I was Bass

1910
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:01,312
Basically yet

1911
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:02,080
You needed a narc

1912
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:05,664
You could resonate with his

1913
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:08,224
Because before that is it really resume

1914
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:09,248
All that much

1915
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:13,856
People are supporting

1916
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:17,440
Triggers

1917
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:19,488
His his audience

1918
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:21,024
Aldi's

1919
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:22,560
These people that we're against

1920
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:26,144
They're fine

1921
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:26,912
Yeah sure

1922
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:29,728
So it's more likely to be a real shooting

1923
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:31,264
False flag

1924
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:35,616
So I don't know if I'm excited too.

1925
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:36,640
2013

1926
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:38,432

A lot of people

Have buckets

1944
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:38,592
I can't imagine rancid granola

1945
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:39,616
Allegedly

1946
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:41,152
Yo it's

1947
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:42,432
That's like I don't nobody

1948
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:44,992
Seems like a pretty consistent threat 100% believe it

1949
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:46,784
