Sit around

4
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,920
There is however

5
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:18,944
Twist that makes it

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,272
That is true that is

7
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,040
Just be to ask

8
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:24,576

Out there you know it

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,752

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,600
I just got weird

22
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,136
It's like homeopathic

23
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,440
A billion

24
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,256
Fruit-flavored

25
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:08,096
It was the year of the fizzy beverage

26
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:08,864
The fizzy water

27
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:28,576

What the f*** happened to Alex Jones

52
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,488
To get him to like Donald Trump

53
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,256
Rustica

54
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,072
Ran like five more than we ever would have its

Who's going to be at

56
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,680
God it's so bizarre

57
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,264
Today's investigation will be covering the period of

58
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,544
September 19th

59
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,568
2015

60
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,848
Up until

61
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,872
September 28th

62
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,200
And the reason is I have this

63
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,480
Discreet.

64
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,016
A narrative evolve

65
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,040
Over this

66
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:03,808
. of time

67
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,112
We will discuss exactly what it is

68
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:12,512
F*** it I'll just tell you

69
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:17,120
This will lead to a 2 out of context drops

70
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,424
That I'll play immediately after that

71
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,496
The reason that this chunk of time I've separated out into

72
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,288
Do this phase of the investigation

73
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,408
Spoiler alert

74
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,688
But

75
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,224
The pope comes to America

76
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
So this

77
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,064
Almost entire week

78
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,880
He is in the middle while he's in the popemobile

79
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,904
He's having a Georg

80
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,768
Exactly what is active recovery

81
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:49,120
The pope comes to America and Alex Jones

82
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,656
Dispatchers Jakari Jackson

83
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,192
Goodnight

84
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,960
And they just

85
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,008
Like they're following the Grateful Dead

86
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,312
They follow the pope or a country

87
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:01,408
Have you looked like weird field reports about how globalism is on the March

88
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,736
And they're only bringing the Pope in because they're making their move

89
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:09,344
So I don't care on tour with the Pope arguing that he's killing

90
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:14,720
Go to New York Philadelphia

91
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:19,071
Jakari and David give Littlefield reports from

92
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
Visual we would have to

93
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,119
To put up one of those

94
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
Like a little

95
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
The little plane

96
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:24,959
From City

97
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,495
Just stay or a little

98
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,359
Infowars only raised $2000000 in their money bomb they can't afford that graphic

99
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,247
I've decided it's not worth our time to

100
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,783
The cover most of the stuff

101
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,063
That Alex Jones has about

102
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,111
Because I can distill it down

103
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,903
To these two out of context drops

104
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,951
Play some up where Alex

105
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:54,911
I can't help it

106
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,247
He's like a reversed

107
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,159
Whatever ails you

108
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:22,559
You calling him a devil worshiper will he

00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,631
Wailord

110
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,959
Here's the other thing that Healthcare Bell

111
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,055
I just been desensitized

112
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,871
Lot of celebrities and stuff is really quite boring

113
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,991
Yeah cool cool cool cool

114
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,463
Spiritual leaders.

115
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:57,119
Sum up a lot of his positions about the I mean besides calling him by rank

116
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,887
Globalist

117
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,655
Pedophile

118
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,567
I don't think it's all that important I wouldn't be impressed

119
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,407
We are so far and Alex

120
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,527
You know besides the regular he's a globalism pedophile don't worry about it

121
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,647
The LaCroix

122
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
Argument

123
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,231
Sofa Dexter it don't even matter

124
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:29,119
Hate is it someone else

125
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,399
In this

126
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,703
If that's one of these sort of downfalls

127
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,983
This podcast I realized

128
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,263
People haven't listened

129
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,335
Send back to a bunch of them they're going to be like

130
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,919
Why don't you care that he making these awful things

131
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,271
We're looking to outliers

132
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,343
Wikipedia sources cited on eBay

133
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,415
Here's why we're cool with just blowing by pedophile

134
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
How's go back to f

135
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,999
Honesty

136
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,535
I'm trying to build that into

137
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,815

Eclipse RC

141
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,311
Because it is

142
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,615
He's a devil worshiper

143
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383

195
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,631
Edward

196
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:47,519
Newsok grade

197
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,591
I would give him a b

198
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,871
That's a good one

199
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,223
Exclusive report

200
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,759
From Russian media

201
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,855
Really careful when you're citing Russian media

202
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,927
Because of their non freedom of the press

203
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:08,255
Interesting because Putin has a long history of

204
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,047
Jalen killing

205
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,655
You have to be very careful what you believe

206
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,191
It comes out of Russian media

207
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,727
Now I looked into this

208
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,263
And check to the sourcing

209
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,287
On Alex Jones

210
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,847
Article.com

211
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
No

212
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,151
That would be too easy

213
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,991
It goes back to

214
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,551
Call.

215
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,111
Is

216
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
Ukrainian

217
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,159
Pro-russian

218
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
Tabloid

219
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,279
Their most notable for being a

220
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
Information

221
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,095
Support of the Prime ministerial

222
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,399
Candidates Victor Yankovic

223
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,703
Who was the

224
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,727
Ukraine

225
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:55,103
Who has deep ties to Paul manafort

226
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,407
Paid millions of dollars

227
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,455
In order to install GameCube

228
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,991
Empower in Ukraine

229
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,015
Really

230
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,599
Do we have

231
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,695
Can we just handcuff

232
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
Just like

233
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,863
Clear like this is bad

234
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,911
Brakes

235
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,215
Because people just

236
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,007
I have this weird assumption that

237
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
Deep down humans are good

238
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,103
Like that is a problem

239
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,431
Well at least we know they'll love America

240
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,479
Completely forgot that people hate

241
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
Beyonce

242
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,111
Beyond being a tabloid

243
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:41,183
Propaganda Outlet in Aurora pro-russian interest

244
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951
In Ukraine

245
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,535
Also in 2011 the papers journals

246
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,559
Threatened

247
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,631
Strike after chief editor

248
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,727
Was controversially fired in his replacement censored certain types of stories

249
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,007
And dictated the journalist

250
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
How certain politicians

251
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
Public figure

252
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,823
Be covered

253
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,127
Their journalists went on strike

254
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,919
Resolve

255
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,759
They they put into editorial

256
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,551
Board members

257
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,879
The unfavorable coverage for certain politician

258
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,695
This day

259
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,743
From 2011

260
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,023
4 years after the

261
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
Has been

262
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,631
Criticize

263
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,959
For their favorable positions towards

264
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,287
And the newspaper has been accused of publishing forged document

265
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:31,871
Over there

266
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:36,223
Hahahahahahahahaha

267
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,247
Part of the world

268
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,551
Silly

269
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,927
Is reading a story The

270
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,951
It's pro-putin

271
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,999
Positive Russia coverage

272
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:51,839
Put out by a Ukrainian pro-russia

273
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,375
Propaganda tabloid

274
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,911
That's the problem

275
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,703
A massive problem

276
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,239
A meeting forms

277
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
So much

278
00:12:59,263 --> 00:12:59,775
Of

279
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,311
His his

280
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
Starting to take

281
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,103
He's starting to leave

282
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,895
Pretty hard into a pro-putin

283
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,431
Mine

284
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,455
Which is

285
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,735
Bizarre cuz it's happening

286
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,783
Even before he gets on board with

287
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,087
So all this stuff

288
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:17,183
What's happening in 2017 is like there is no Russian collusion

289
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,463
This is all bulshit

290
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,047
Start to become possibly a thing where he has even more

291
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,583
Hypothetical Allegiance

292
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,375
Benito's to Trump

293
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,703
I'm not saying that that's absolutely

294
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,263
Look a little bit like that

295
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,311
Inasmuch as I believe the Putin

296
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,359
Is ultimately the one who's trying

297
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,383
To take on the global

298
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,991
I think I think if I was going to venture a

299
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,527
Where does his loyalty lie

300
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,807
Candidate

301
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,855
I would say there be Infowars

302
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,463
Kind of like he's more like likes like

303
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,487
That kind of

304
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,023
As opposed to

305
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,071
He actually believed any

306
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
I think about Putin

307
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,631
Other than

308
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
Is a

309
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,167
Great man

310
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,215
I give you ascribe to the great man

311
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
Theory of History

312
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,519
You're like well Putin

313
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,567
Great like undeniable

314
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,615
I think that

315
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,383
You

316
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,991
But I want you to put a pin in it until the end of this episode

317
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:19,391
Even this next month with more information that I always stare

318
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,975
Fulfilling my role in your life

319
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,311
Russia understands this is about

320
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,615
Warm water

321
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,943
They're on the Mediterranean in Syria

322
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,527
I understand it's part of Russia

323
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:52,415
Cher's wonderful

324
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,719
But Russia's non-offensive

325
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,791
Russia is not putting cancer viruses are vaccines

326
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,583
Russia is not opening our borders

327
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,375
Russia is not funding Isis

328
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,911
Russia is not

329
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,703
Just pushing world government

330
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,751
Russia is not trying to take my

331
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,311
Russia isn't on the news

332
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,943
What he's saying is the because

333
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,735
Our government has been taken over by the

334
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,807
Globalist

335
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
What they aren't doing

336
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,879
There is a bad guy

337
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,671
And Putin is the good guy

338
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,231
Who are the good guys

339
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
Syria

340
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,815
He's basically said

341
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,351
Before but

342
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,935
Is the thought that was

343
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
Bananas

344
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,495
Situation there

345
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,799
Russia's hugely Pro

346
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,383
Undecided still around

347
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,687
Yasso 100%

348
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,503
Couching in this language

349
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,807
We shouldn't be worried about

350
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
That kind of

351
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,367
Don't you think

352
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,903
Like what

353
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,183
What are you saying there is

354
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,719
Russia is

355
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,535
This guy and I know they're not perfect in all that's

356
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,071
But don't worry about that

357
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,143
Worried about our illegitimate government doing all of the

358
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
Get to us

359
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,239
Engel ice

360
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
He's either hiding

361
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
Really trying

362
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:17,151
It's probably more the prior than the ladder because I think he is hoping

363
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,223
Masquerading

364
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,807
You know all the thought is doing the trying to stand up to

365
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,831
Stewby's Rebels

366
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,231
Doing too

367
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,767
When the reality is

368
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,351
There's a lot of indications that

369
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,911
Beyond just killing his own citizens

370
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,727
Has really been trying to do

371
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,519
Izzat get sunnis

372
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,055
Entirely out of the country

373
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,847
Especially out of

374
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,151
The portions of the country that are most

375
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,431
Important to him

376
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,967
And that's why I refuse

377
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,991
Ud's have been able to

378
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,039
To get out in his high numbers

379
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
They have

380
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:59,135
It's because it's not is totally cool with them just leaving the country

381
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,159
He's trying to get them

382
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,439
It's not as much as

383
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,999
Cleansing on a murderous level although there is

384
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,351
Is ethnic cleansing of his neighborhood

385
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,631
Call

386
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,935
Putin is totally cool with that too

387
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,471
If you get them out it causes

388
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,287
Massive destabilization

389
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,591
So the idea

390
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,639
All they're doing is trying to protect

391
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,407
Their own

392
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,943
Position is

393
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,223
That's what Alex Jones

394
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
Believe

395
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,271
In order to make

396
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,855
The thing that is

397
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,391
Very frustrating

398
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
He is

399
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,719
Gladwell and they're all

400
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,255
On the same narrative

401
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,535
Isis

402
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,839
Assad

403
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,655
Right when in reality there is that

404
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,703
Who is trying to post fight off ice

405
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
Anderson

406
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,007
Because it's

407
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,055
This is margarita

408
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,335
The pr campaign

409
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,919
Through Assad Putin and now Alex is

410
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,455
The rebels are part of

411
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:00,319
Legitimacy is only within Assad's government

412
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,343
Even though he

413
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,367
He's murdering every

414
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,135
Buddy Heater

415
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,695
And unfortunately as time goes on

416
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
As

417
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,743
You know they don't care

418
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:11,327
It helped and the world seems to indicate that they don't care all that much

419
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,351
You do see

420
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,447
Some of these people who would be on the good side of

421
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,007
They got to go somewhere

422
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,055
The radicalization

423
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,871
To side with Assad

424
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,943
The end the end the only other alternative

425
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:32,575
If you push

426
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,135
You're going to wind up f****** everybody over

427
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,375
Because

428
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,143
Some kind of fun

429
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,167
I on this

430
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,191
The September

431
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,471
21st episode

432
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,543
Alex Jones has a little interview with

433
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
Dear friend

434
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,359
Who we have reservation

435
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,639
But still like quite a bit

436
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:03,039
Jesse Ventura Jesse Ventura comes on

437
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,343
Whether or not atheism

438
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,367
Iacullo

439
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:10,463
He accidentally engages him on an argument about church taxation

440
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,255
Oh boy it's all under the auspice

441
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,815
Episodes of the idea

442
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,583
Be taxed

443
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
Hideaway

444
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,935
I think it's a good idea for everyone

445
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
Our fair share

446
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,495
That's pretty close to his position

447
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:29,151
Do that

448
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,455
Alex is the losses

449
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,759
Every single point in there are

450
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:34,783
And it's great

451
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,831
But it's all based on the fact

452
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,111
The pope is about to come

453
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:38,879
America

454
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,159
Alex wants to

455
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,439
Jesse Ventura

456
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,767
They talked s*** about

457
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,863
Care about the Pope

458
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,167
Clip

459
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:58,591
I like this ready to go out to see if with a big sign

460
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,127
Atheist for the pulp

461
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:05,759
Why do you lie

462
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:10,111
So do I like this post because he said I can go to heaven

463
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:15,487
That song was that

464
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,559
Oakland 80th Street

465
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:24,447
I understand that you are amazing I love it I have a chance now

466
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,639
Here's Rock Dam

467
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,575
I believe in science

468
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,975
Proven dark matter they prove another dimension

469
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:53,375
Get into the genetic engineering realm until my God something made this

470
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,935
Most

471
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:02,847
What about the guy they just found lately

472
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,687
This latest humanoid

473
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,271
Walked upright they buried their dad

474
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,319
You look like a monkey to me

475
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,864
I think Jesse's High

476
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,568
Alright it's great

477
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,784
Please respond

478
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,624
Humanoid bass monkey

479
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,904
ShopRite

480
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,048
Let's remember something Alex

481
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,352
Whatever man cannot

482
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,888
Explain something

483
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,472
It's real easy then to attributed to God

484
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,848
My only issue. That's not

485
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,112
Atheist don't hate anybody

486
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:29,376
We don't hate nobody you can believe what you want to believe

487
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,424
If you want to go worship a tree

488
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,216
Horses on the beach

489
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:37,312
Terrible job regarding anything that Jesse says

490
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:41,408
Daddy brings in the new archaeological find of the homo

491
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,176
Sapien

492
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,712
Type creature

493
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,552
It sort of invalidates a lot of

494
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,576
Alex's argument

495
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
But

496
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,928
Play you don't hear the where's the missing link

497
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,952
Argument too much from

498
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:54,976
Creationist

499
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,792
No

500
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:04,704
The Missing Link is the idea that there was one

501
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,056
You don't believe in evolution

502
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,336
F****** go

503
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,688
Just don't believe in evolution anymore

504
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:17,760
Nonsense

505
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,784
Climate change

506
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,576
Making an assertion

507
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
Like

508
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,696
Nothing weird Ukrainian

509
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,720
Tabloid

510
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:31,584
Breitbart

511
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,400
If possible

512
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,704
Aren't some sort of weird outline

513
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,032
No but I'm saying that your media.

514
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,312
Because he killed all the

515
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,848
Incarcerate

516
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:47,712
I don't know I'm just saying your medium diet will dictate what you think is normal

517
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,760
Alex Jones

518
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,552
The Vox musication

519
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,904
Yeah I was like news is becoming Infowars light

520
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,768
So this next clip

521
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,536
This is

522
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,560
Really fun for me

523
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:05,632
Because Alex Jones brings up the idea of

524
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,400
I shouldn't

525
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,936
To pay for anchor baby

526
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:10,240
Which Jesse Ventura response

527
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,288
Why do I have to pay for church

528
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,592
Surprised

529
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,360
Respond to that

530
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,640
Forgetting

531
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,920
The Jesse Ventura

532
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,480
Used to be the governor of a state

533
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,320
So he knows

534
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,440
It is easy to forget because there's still a part of your brain that goes

535
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:33,792
Do the governor and the mayor

536
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,560
It's still like

537
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,656
Very intimate knowledge of these sorts of things

538
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,472
Does not to listen to this clip

539
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,752
So fun for me

540
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,056
How badly Alex Jones loses

541
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,128
Why do you keep having

542
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:53,760
Abortion

543
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,552
Don't force me to pay for the boat

544
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,744
Wow it's the leader of Russia came here would we provide security for it

545
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:10,144
Not a religious leader

546
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:15,264
Sports athletes in the world that there probably isn't one country

547
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,712
So I see I understand I haven't been in government Alex

548
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:29,088
I understand the Pomp and Circumstance and I understand what they do and why they do it

549
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,928
It is called Truth proper respect

550
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,952
If you want to

551
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:37,024
I got one for you Alex

552
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,840
Why do churches get buy tax-free

553
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,656
Because Congress shall make no law established

554
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:46,240
Establishment of religion

555
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,032
Congress has no jurisdiction

556
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:52,896
Same benefits that I get I'm an atheist

557
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,688
I have to pee more

558
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:57,760
Exploud

559
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,808
Fire Protection

560
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,792
We should all be treated equally

561
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:14,144
And then you can kill people in all that

562
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,192
Call themselves Church

563
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:22,080
Quickly to avoid being taxed on anything's churches should be taxed

564
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:28,224
Caesar album with Caesars

565
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,576
Well that was a question of taxation of the church and he was saying clearly

566
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:37,696
That that Caesars currency whose face is on it so that's his system so I get what you're saying

567
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:45,376
Why should searches not play property taxes they receive all the benefits

568
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:48,448
Call Kamaya question for you

569
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,216
Because

570
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:56,128
Thomas Jefferson's the left love so much

571
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,200
As an individual you can say or do whatever you want

572
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:05,600
In government buildings or government finances

573
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:12,256
And that Congress has no Authority

574
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:16,864
Respecting an establishment of religion

575
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,680
But I wanted to pause cuz

576
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:26,080
You keep saying that

577
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
Being like this

578
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,664
Kid who read adult books

579
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,200
I didn't understand what he was reading

580
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,736
And then integrate the information

581
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:36,064
I think he has the same understanding of the First Amendment

582
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,344
Because he keeps

583
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,880
Just rattling that off

584
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,160
Am I misinterpreting what if

585
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,696
Right

586
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,720
Heavy rope

587
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,256
Ability to memorize

588
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,536
Pieces of

589
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:50,400
Jim just recite them

590
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:53,728
The free exercise thereof or the establishment of religion

591
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,776
Portion of the First Amendment me

592
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,056
Right it's like it's like

593
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:11,904
Just memorize it without any ability to

594
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,208
Text realized that

595
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,744
How this applies

596
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,512
Anything's

597
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,048
I bet that's why you're going to lose against

598
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:18,816
Jesse Ventura

599
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,352
Cuz he's coming to the ring with

600
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,144
Annex.

601
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,448
Hibiscus Jesse's about to give him a body

602
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,544
Nothing to do with taxi number

603
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,384
Services Alex

604
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,784
I'm paying for the illegal

605
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,856
Come on

606
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:48,256
Illegals get along

607
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,560
How about

608
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:54,144
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment

609
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,776
Take it the roof.

610
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,592
If you're going to use it on one hand you have to

611
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:06,944
Other hand

612
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,344
How come I have to take her claiming you shouldn't have to pay for the pope to be here

613
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,672
More taxes to churches don't

614
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:26,400
Because there is no more critical of establishment

615
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,960
Houses

616
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,520
Most of them

617
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,824
Fake leaders

618
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,224
Manipulate

619
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:55,072
The problem is churches now

620
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,608
501 c 3

621
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:05,312
Symbolism

622
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:11,712
Corporate standards

623
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,808
Religion difference in a corporation

624
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,976
Local taxes for fire

625
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,048
I don't think that's true

626
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:29,632
Turn off limits you can't tax religion

627
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,680
Why not

628
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:38,336
You better make

629
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,872
A lot of stage

630
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:42,688
Other churches do have to pay the fire fees

631
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,704
Completely destroyed property taxes

632
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,496
Churches don't pay property taxes

633
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,776
I was a governor

634
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,336
Yeah

635
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:13,664
Alex is really struggling cuz he's going back and forth between like

636
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,968
What what about illegals even though that doesn't

637
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:19,808
Whataburger

638
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,832
Yeah so he's

639
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,856
Just because

640
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,648
Directions

641
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,672
He's getting his ass beat

642
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,000
Just

643
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,072
Jesse has another Punch coming from the other angle every time

644
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,424
Strongly disagree with

645
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,448
Jesse Ventura

646
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:39,008
Stance that the media was trying to destroy him with that

647
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:40,800
Sniper case

648
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,104
That narrative it was pitching months back

649
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,384
But now I love

650
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,040
The First Amendment

651
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,576
We can't text

652
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,392
Brings up like I believe

653
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:05,376
So forget that part of the First Amendment

654
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,912
That's the poppycock

655
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,520
If you are rattling around

656
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,312
Chances are

657
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,336
You don't know what it actually

658
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,384
You're about to

659
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,920
Something

660
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,944
You probably don't

661
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,968
Defend

662
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,736
You can't

663
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,528
You can criticize me

664
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,296
Just exercised

665
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,344
Free speech

666
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,928
You're dumb you're dumb

667
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,952
Before we get on to some

668
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,720
Some really weird

669
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,816
He brings up

670
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:35,840
The

671
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:40,192
We'll see

672
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:44,032
Religions as well

673
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,568
It's not just a Christian

674
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:50,176
Brother religious

675
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,224
You got it setup on Horus

676
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,808
What about Horace

677
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,672
Jesus 7700 years before Jesus

678
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:09,120
Well I do know that

679
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:15,264
If the entire same biography of a guy on earth

680
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,800
Egyptian

681
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,504
I just saying

682
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,832
The death rattle people with the same

683
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,424
So that's his way of dismissing like historical facts

684
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,192
Zeitgeist

685
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,472
All right right

686
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,240
Right price

687
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,288
I just love the humor of like

688
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:51,104
I know the guy behind the soundboard was like

689
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,664
Alright Jesse brought porous

690
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,688
Long pause

691
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,992
Does Alex respond what are you talkin about

692
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,552
Long

693
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,088
We're going to break

694
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,184
Alex's. Nothing I got to get him out of this hole

695
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,024
I think that's

696
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,584
Appropriately

697
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,608
Unlikely

698
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,144
Yeah absolutely

699
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,264
In 2015 is trying to

700
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,312
You figure out where Alex

701
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,592
To supporting Trump

702
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:25,920
Pause we got to bring up whenever he brings up something about Trump

703
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,456
Here is Alex

704
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:30,528
Explaining that he still loves Rand Paul

705
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:37,184
More pro-russia

706
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:43,840
Another article all Republican presidential candidates

707
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,288
Not supported

708
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,664
Little bit confused

709
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,392
But if you watch that debate

710
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,512
Last Wednesday

711
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:20,704
But

712
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,288
It's just crazy

713
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,152
About Vladimir Putin

714
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,968
President of Italy

715
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,272
Asurion claim

716
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,720
200

717
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,256
10 years old

718
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,912
Ukraine probe Ford

719
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,960
And this is a stunt

720
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:53,984
Will

721
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,264
Wii shop

722
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,456
Bottle of wine with

723
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,784
What's Purdue's

724
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,088
Racha fully controls

725
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,952
And fully controlled there an argument there why

726
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,768
That there.

727
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,816
A bottle of wine

728
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,352
Epr stock

729
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,656
Is promoting local Ukrainian wine

730
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,448
We're here with the farmers

731
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:30,848
Down to the ultimate

732
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:33,408
Fox News

733
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,688
Associated Press

734
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,720
I put in the Civil War

735
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:51,072
They're bombing and shelling all over the country

736
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,120
Small area

737
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,128
Small area admittedly

738
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:06,432
Worth billions of dollars

739
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:11,808
It wasn't a big resources

740
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:21,024
But then the other thing

741
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,048
Just believe that everything

742
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:28,448
Publix

743
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:34,080
Their goal is trying to make countries fight each other

744
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,640
Conception they are there globally

745
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,432
Mego destabilize

746
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,712
In order to attack

747
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,808
Crazy or destabilize Ukraine

748
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,856
Retake it over

749
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:46,880
Maybe I don't know

750
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,184
It's great

751
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:49,952
I didn't

752
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:53,792
Understand the particulars of the Elders of Zion plan and I really don't

753
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,840
Globalist.

754
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:00,192
I think it's fascinating Alex

755
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,216
Is talking about

756
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,008
You know his feelings about

757
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,288
About

758
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,824
Rand Paul and Trump

759
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,640
Have a thought and get sidetracked

760
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,664
Into talking about

761
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,688
Defending Putin

762
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:11,968
And weird

763
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:16,832
I don't think if I was earlier

764
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:19,904
About that. Because Rand Paul needs to

765
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,696
To be visually more aggressive

766
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,488
Until you started to think about

767
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,304
I started to think about the way leaders

768
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,072
Present themself

769
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,120
And that got him onto things

770
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,400
How strong

771
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,704
But also

772
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,728
Even know that

773
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,496
Story

774
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,520
It was a very minor

775
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,312
Hairstory

776
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,872
Yeah

777
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:43,200
These readings are Ukrainian

778
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:47,296
Yep I'm going to

779
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,064
100%

780
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,136
Pro Rush

781
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:51,904
Russian media

782
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,208
Also any time Berlusconi is involved

783
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:54,976
You know

784
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,792
There's going to be a rampant theft of money

785
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:01,376
Going to be drinking and they probably thought somebody afterwards

786
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,144
Ain't nobody

787
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,776
Operator in history

788
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:24,416
Italy has a fascist history where this welcoming he wasn't he wasn't still present

789
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,536
He'd already been kicked out for all the crying but he's super-rich

790
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:32,096
The crime

791
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,632
Bright

792
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:39,776
Alex Jones

793
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,824
By the

794
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,592
Police

795
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,128
Oh and you need to hear about

796
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,408
Before you do Alex

797
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,688
Do not make this very clear

798
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,968
This happened

799
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,040
P2000

800
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:51,808
I believe

801
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,600
The story he's referencing happened

802
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,368
In 2000

803
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,696
Year-old news

804
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,232
Right

805
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,000
Just tell you

806
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,024
He's lying

807
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,584
And I will tell you the truth after this

808
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,376
Horrendous display

809
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,400
Fake emoji

810
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,704
This is what needs to be done

811
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,032
People going into men's barbershop Shane cut my hair

812
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,640
Find

813
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,664
B*******

814
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,712
Define

815
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,760
Hey lady we cut men's hair

816
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,832
This goes back to an area that we talked about in the past episode 1

817
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,600
Just Grants Pass

818
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,184
That's clearly not discrimination

819
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,208
You do

820
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,000
As a business

821
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,328
At this point

822
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,888
At this point Alex Jones is looking at his phone and taking

823
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:44,544
Just that are on right now

824
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,848
There's so much happening

825
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:50,944
That probably comes back

826
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,712
Hurt

827
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,736
Hard

828
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,040
So hard

829
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,392
Just to see

830
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,976
Videos

831
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:05,536
9/11 the road to tyranny that I made

832
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,096
14 years ago

833
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:10,144
13 years ago plus

834
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,264
Quick work

835
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:19,872
Call Michael planned 9/11

836
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,920
No criminal record

837
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,904
Weather

838
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,464
And they

839
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,872
This Is War

840
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,759
Just freaked out this crazy

841
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,831
And then they flip out from there

842
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:05,695
And get the better truck

843
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:13,887
Then they fire department Constitution

844
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:21,567
Maybe that's what she talks about how she's got a constitution

845
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:24,127
Maybe what she means

846
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:31,551
Origami

847
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,879
Here guys that have sworn an oath

848
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,975
To protect and defend the Constitution

849
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,511
Decoration

850
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,047
It's all Foundation

851
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:47,167
All the squad car video

852
00:42:56,895 --> 00:43:00,991
Oprah whatever she's one of them extremists like the clan or something

853
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,295
Balls

854
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:10,207
You got to come to tell you that

855
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:14,815
Sound

856
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,607
It's interesting

857
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,375
Alex

858
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,143
Is

859
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,423
So full of s***

860
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:23,007
Public Storage

861
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:25,311
Read it off

862
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,591
No other information

863
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:30,175
There's no context for that at all

864
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:30,943
Substitution

865
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:37,343
Constitutional

866
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,671
Abby Newman who was pulled over in traffic

867
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,951
Wingstop in 2000

868
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,231
West Virginia

869
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,279
She was driving without a license

870
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,095
Researched

871
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,119
Her car was searched

872
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:52,703
I don't know about the the official record

873
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,727
Containing any reference

874
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,007
Thanks to a constitution

875
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,287
Or Patriots

876
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,567
But the official record

877
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,383
That you had hollow point bullets

878
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:04,991
Cop killer bullets

879
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:08,063
Institution

880
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,879
There's a way you can either have

881
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,743
It's the same stuff

882
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:18,815
G80 bread one you know how to use the other

883
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,351
You know what I'm saying

884
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,143
She decided to represent her

885
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,935
Did not go well

886
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:26,239
She accused the officers of using

887
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,031
Excessive force

888
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,823
Ron Wright

889
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:36,223
The video tape her being verbally

890
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,271
The police

891
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,575
Add when they end up handcuffing her she doesn't

892
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,855
Make any complaint

893
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:45,951
There's no real grounds for argumentative

894
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:49,023
We're treating her roughly or anything like that

895
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:52,351
Something is did find hollow point illegal bullets

896
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,375
In her car

897
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,655
Those are used

898
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,935
To kill cops

899
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,287
To kill armored animals

900
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:06,687
I forgot that

901
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:09,247
Armadillos are everywhere West Virginia

902
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:12,831
I forgot also deer often

903
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:18,719
Stood up

904
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:24,351
Cops are being stupid

905
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:26,911
An extremist

906
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:30,495
She is very clearly a sovereign

907
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:34,335
She is a member of the anti-government group

908
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:39,711
On the fact that I'm reading this offer from roanoke.com

909
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,503
Article about her trial

910
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,271
She is

911
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,319
Got to be good

912
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,879
I love it when the Sovereign citizens go to court

913
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:49,695
She has also argued in the past that she believes the United

914
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,999
It states is controlled by the Federal Reserve Bank

915
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,279
Which is run by Freemason

916
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,815
I'm to obey the British Monarchy

917
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,143
She is also said makes Federal Reserve Bank uses social

918
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,167
Security numbers

919
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,447
And birth certificate

920
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:02,495
Certificate of ownership of America

921
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:08,895
Are there it is during an interview

922
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:14,271
Never get arrested again

923
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:25,279
No

924
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:29,375
Use a part of a very scary Fringe right-wing

925
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,655
Organization

926
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,191
Loosely-knit organization

927
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,471
And how I know that

928
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,239
Pictures of sovereignty

929
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,519
Is

930
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:38,591
That she believes that the Federal Reserve Bank uses social

931
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,383
Security numbers in birth certificate

932
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,687
A certificate of ownership

933
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:48,831
That's the one we talked about earlier with maritime law

934
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:51,135
Security numbers that are created are in order to

935
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:51,903
To create debt

936
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:52,927
Your name

937
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,463
Corporate

938
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,743
Identity as opposed to your

939
00:46:56,511 --> 00:47:02,655
Play it's a very big part of the sovereign

940
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:07,519
Know that that's a Roman font

941
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:11,103
You should have used New Republic fought something along those lines

942
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:20,063
Complete lie I made it to lie about 15 years in the past

943
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,135
The police don't even understand

944
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,671
Do they hate the Constitution

945
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:27,231
No they hate people have hollow tip bullets

946
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,767
Driving around without a license

947
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:31,839
I don't believe the government has any Authority very reasonable.

948
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,655
Cuz cops

949
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,959
I've been killed by a lot of sovereignty

950
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:43,615
You took me on a little bit of an emotional rollercoaster their O'Connor on her side for a little bit I don't like cops either

951
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,919
Then you kept going the holla tip points

952
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:51,551
Not great not great

953
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:54,879
I'll never be arrested again

954
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:59,231
Another further indication

955
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:01,279
Anytime Alex Jones does one of these voices

956
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,303
Completely line

957
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:07,423
Whenever he characterizes

958
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:09,727
So

959
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,775
Even have the balls to be like

960
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,055
I'm not I'm not making

961
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:19,711
The sound

962
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:23,551
Like it there

963
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,343
Get this

964
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:28,415
You think that's so disrespectful to truth

965
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,439
And integrity

966
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,975
And journalism

967
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:33,023
Right you're not ready for what to happen

968
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,863
Alex Jones has

969
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:40,191
Conceptually my favorite guest of all time

970
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:44,031
I don't like this guy at all but the idea that he's on the show

971
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,311
Is awesome

972
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:49,151
Pods are already hitting public roads

973
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:54,015
That's right ladies and gentlemen and sex reassessment is

974
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,319
Company benefit

975
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:58,111
And push for equality

976
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,463
For further confuse

977
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,815
Moving towards an asexual system

978
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:13,215
Where you know what there's going to be no sexualism there can be no culture of any type everything's just Gray

979
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,519
Or you're offending someone else

980
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,799
Who would have ever thought

981
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,847
Bloomberg business

982
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:24,223
Actually

983
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,783
Everyone

984
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:29,343
Tell rather or a woman

985
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,391
Somebody else's

986
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:40,095
Tolerant

987
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:49,567
In the future.

988
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:55,199
Stop right there bro

989
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,551
We are go out and

990
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:04,671
Personal trainer

991
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:08,255
Every few years

992
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:10,303
Takes off for a few days

993
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:14,143
Perfume in Eastern Europe

994
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,423
Wizzy

995
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:27,711
Here in just a moment Alex Jones has his personal trainer on as a guest

996
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,831
He was personally training him and

997
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:36,671
Tropica

998
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,935
Messing around SouthPark

999
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:50,495
So this guy is a

1000
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,543
Like Alex Jones

1001
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:56,895
The dick but this guy brings out so much dick ashness and Alex Jones

1002
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:59,711
Audio of their training

1003
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,759
Is not getting healthier

1004
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:05,087
He doesn't look good so they can't be

1005
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,879
We doing a good job

1006
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:09,951
They have to be doing this is growing out so hard about bigotry

1007
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,231
It got to be

1008
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:12,767
Levitate

1009
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:13,535
Cuz you know you

1010
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,583
You start getting a little bit of exercise in you

1011
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,375
Testosterone kicks in

1012
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:19,423
And I was like oh God

1013
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:23,263
In their interview just bench press that much

1014
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,543
Muslim just put him out

1015
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:29,663
The entire interview is essentially about how when he was overseas

1016
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,967
Alex Jones personal trainers

1017
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:32,991
A lady with some

1018
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,015
Kids grass

1019
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:34,783
Convert money

1020
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,807
Outside of a hotel

1021
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,159
This lady's husband

1022
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,439
Who is threatening to jump

1023
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,719
If I don't get enough money

1024
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,743
Cuz they can't afford

1025
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,071
So this is

1026
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,887
Terrible especially when you read the stories now

1027
00:51:56,287 --> 00:52:01,407
Note

1028
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:05,503
Right

1029
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,271
Back to get help

1030
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,063
Jesus nut

1031
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:11,391
The other thing is I believe

1032
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,159
Emily Watson

1033
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,183
But

1034
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,719
There a lot of scams

1035
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,487
The people do

1036
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:24,191
People who are in Desperate situations are going to run cons

1037
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,215
Not really

1038
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:26,239
Obliged

1039
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,263
On immigrants

1040
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,799
Not what they should be doing is right

1041
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,359
Absolutely

1042
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:35,199
Billion dollars that way paint this

1043
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,479
Just proves

1044
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,247
You can't f******

1045
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:38,783
Rusty's brown people

1046
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,319
There's run these Huggins

1047
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,367
Considering like

1048
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:43,903
This is a really

1049
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:44,671
Stream version

1050
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:49,023
Now he's probably not going to do it but

1051
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,839
Suicide into the equation

1052
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,679
That's much different than like running around in like Chiclets

1053
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:59,519
Yeah

1054
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,311
I'd like these are the two things you

1055
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,615
What else is there

1056
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,383
Hey there's a

1057
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,663
Is the topic itself

1058
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:09,503
I hear things like this and I think

1059
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,295
About how Saturday

1060
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,575
That our world is in

1061
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,343
The situation

1062
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,391
Where a lot of people are forced

1063
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,415
To use

1064
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:17,695
No

1065
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:21,023
Dishonest means in order to make money out of desperation

1066
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:23,327
It is a bummer

1067
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:26,911
Meanwhile Alex

1068
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,703
And his bro out

1069
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,239
Physical personal trainer

1070
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,543
Slightly different angle on

1071
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:39,199
That's regrettable that's what the gypsies Ono

1072
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:53,023
Horticulture

1073
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:03,775
Alright let's start with the self self

1074
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:06,591
Your culture Alex

1075
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,639
Analista anti-government

1076
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,663
Hey man

1077
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:12,223
The gypsies aren't the one being racist to black people in

1078
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:18,623
The gypsies aren't the one who enslave them the one who did the Tuskegee experiments

1079
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:19,391
Turn all of this

1080
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,671
Also

1081
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:26,559
Gypsy Romani I'm not making that are

1082
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:35,007
Well I mean it is a bad culture and we should take all of them out of our country it's not great

1083
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:37,055
It's not a great culture that Alex lives in

1084
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,335
But be that as it may

1085
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:40,639
Luke know it's within his right to

1086
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,199
Unstoppable

1087
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:46,015
I don't understand how he doesn't get the

1088
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,295
The same thing that protect

1089
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:49,087
He's sort of right

1090
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,367
2xist

1091
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,135
Is what percent

1092
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,415
Everyone's rights

1093
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,183
Because they don't

1094
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,207
Just don't

1095
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:55,487
Understand

1096
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:56,255
What I mean

1097
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:58,559
What was the phrase that

1098
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,327
Ventura

1099
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:01,887
If it if it works for one-handed Axolotl health

1100
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:07,007
Trump tweeting out like it should always be popular vote

1101
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:09,311
Goddamnit you idiot

1102
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,079
Do you know

1103
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,615
Stand for a sec

1104
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,895
How this should act

1105
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:15,967
Right and that will suck you over

1106
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:17,503
In the long run

1107
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,271
So

1108
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,319
Great

1109
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,599
You fuking idiot

1110
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,159
2

1111
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:25,951
Either

1112
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:29,023
Knox problems or made-up one

1113
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:33,119
Lights down for this next clip

1114
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,167
Because

1115
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:35,935
Trainer

1116
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,727
Get into

1117
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,751
Oh God

1118
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:39,775
I don't know

1119
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:42,335
It's pretty bad it's gone

1120
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:44,127
It's one of the more misogynist

1121
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:46,175
List of things I've heard on it program

1122
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,551
Who is Rio Grande

1123
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:52,319
Alright Mike

1124
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:54,367
I think they fix their wrist

1125
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:55,391
Which makes it worse

1126
00:55:55,647 --> 00:56:01,279
Riley's

1127
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:27,391
Active women are so that we know

1128
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:29,183
Correct

1129
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,463
I was very good

1130
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:35,583
Continue

1131
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:40,703
Absolutely

1132
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,687
That's their territory

1133
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:55,551
Most understand are lesbians

1134
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:56,319
Like a

1135
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,855
Elephant seal

1136
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:03,487
How's the weather

1137
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:09,887
Elephant seals

1138
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,287
That's always here

1139
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:20,127
Want to do a elephant

1140
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:29,087
First of all

1141
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:34,975
Ugly women

1142
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:37,279
Is his way of life

1143
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:41,375
How do I get

1144
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:44,703
Speculating on this s*** right there

1145
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:45,983
Effects of European women

1146
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:48,287
Play the purse

1147
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,639
I hope

1148
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:56,991
Why didn't he get kidnapped in a taken situation

1149
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,527
And his wife was like

1150
00:57:59,295 --> 00:57:59,807
Yeah

1151
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:00,575
You got them

1152
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,623
You keep you guys keep

1153
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:06,975
The only thing I respect about him is it Alex's like you want to do an elephant seal impression

1154
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:09,791
Now

1155
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:13,375
That's what they wanted

1156
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:20,287
You're right that's an absurd idea

1157
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:22,847
Feminist power rank

1158
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:29,247
World 3 million 240

1159
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:35,647
5

1160
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,487
I'll never break into

1161
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:40,767
The top Melly and I'll tell you that

1162
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,095
That that is

1163
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:45,119
That all reason

1164
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:52,031
Then Alex's they want a harem of women that they don't

1165
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,055
What dudes getting into

1166
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,127
Elephant

1167
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:01,503
Alex Jones is argument that no I'm muscling in

1168
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:06,623
That's still better in terms of Art

1169
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,647
Him saying like

1170
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:12,767
I should be the one who dominates

1171
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:18,143
Exactly I'm the only one who can dominate these women

1172
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,679
Exactly

1173
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:23,263
No matter what

1174
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,799
It's still looking at women is

1175
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,103
So f******

1176
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,383
Who f****** wrong

1177
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:29,663
It's

1178
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:30,943
Justice idea

1179
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,295
He's just projecting

1180
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:36,575
His

1181
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,903
Bulshit on two lesbians at match

1182
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,487
Like a male

1183
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:46,815
Reminded that she's not

1184
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:48,351
Me like that

1185
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:53,471
Thing is what he would do until Montopolis situations like

1186
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:59,615
I would try and get a harem

1187
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:01,407
Basically

1188
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:04,735
Erotic

1189
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:10,367
His personal life is off-limits that's out there

1190
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:12,159
His new wife

1191
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:15,487
Narada married for a little while

1192
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:16,767
Music

1193
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,047
It's possible

1194
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:19,839
Not to slander

1195
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:21,375
Babies

1196
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,447
A little while

1197
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:30,335
Coverage of September 20th

1198
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:32,639
And we'll move along

1199
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,175
September 22nd

1200
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,223
Those two guys

1201
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:37,759
Is Talking Tom bad

1202
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,295
That's really bad

1203
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:40,831
Like

1204
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:43,903
Like all the stuff about the actual immigrants

1205
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:44,671
How do you saw

1206
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:47,231
I mean we can distill it into one sentence

1207
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,279
We did but

1208
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,047
Just started like

1209
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:52,095
You know these are untrustworthy

1210
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,375
These two guys together

1211
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:57,983
That kind of thing

1212
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,007
The ark

1213
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:01,311
Give me the Trump immediately got out of after

1214
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,079
The grabbing by the

1215
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:05,663
It's just locker room talk I thought

1216
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:08,991
There's no way that anybody

1217
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:10,271
Apparently dumb

1218
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:12,063
And that is exactly what

1219
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,599
Apparently this happy

1220
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:14,623
Totally

1221
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:17,183
Just not with

1222
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:22,047
The people we hang out with we're just in this weird bubble up

1223
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:26,143
Yeah the other thing I want to point out his nose

1224
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:29,983
Maybe this is a minor thing for me to be pointing out but

1225
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,007
Dude

1226
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,287
This is the big lie

1227
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:33,823
This isn't some

1228
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:34,591
Podcast

1229
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:36,895
You're having your personal trainer is a guess

1230
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:38,687
Come with it man

1231
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,455
Would you

1232
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:41,503
A billion people you reach

1233
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:42,271
Every month

1234
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:44,575
100 million

1235
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,343
Annex

1236
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,367
Expert you decide to

1237
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,671
To get your f****** personal trainers

1238
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:56,607
It's the same thing like how many comedy shows have you been to where it's like all that guy did not get booked

1239
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:57,631
Cuz he was good

1240
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,423
Forgot because he's friends

1241
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:04,543
That doesn't happen in the big leagues

1242
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:10,687
I don't think JFL is booking based on friendship

1243
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:13,503
Disagree

1244
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,551
If you can help

1245
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:22,207
Agent agent says friendship

1246
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,559
The 22nd

1247
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:30,911
Cast on the 22nd

1248
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,447
Sing this personal trainer that's for sure

1249
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,983
I don't like him

1250
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,007
Personal trainer

1251
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:35,775
Please give us any tip

1252
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:39,871
Nothing to do with your delzer quads

1253
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,919
God dammit

1254
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:47,551
Introducing

1255
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:55,487
For live broadcasting worldwide

1256
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:56,767
2050

1257
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:01,375
We do have some guests joining us for about 30 minutes

1258
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:05,471
At the start of the next hour diamond and silk

1259
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:11,871
Very entertaining and informative

1260
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:18,527
Is Donald Trump in election

1261
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:21,855
2016 for 30 minutes

1262
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:25,951
A1c

1263
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:28,767
Two girls know I don't think that's the case

1264
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:30,815
But it is indicative

1265
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,119
In some ways

1266
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:37,471
Because there's no reason to have these two ladies on your show

1267
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:39,519
Unless you just want someone

1268
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,287
Parroting

1269
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,823
Donald Trump propaganda

1270
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:48,223
Whatever they want to do but

1271
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:52,063
For Trump he's going to bring our jobs back

1272
01:03:54,111 --> 01:04:00,255
Why do they go viral black ladies sitting in front of her like webcam

1273
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,559
Just like doing like you said it

1274
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,583
Like that sort of stuff

1275
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,863
But it's

1276
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:05,631
Tour Trump

1277
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:09,471
And the reason it goes viral is because it's so against

1278
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:15,871
Type you expect to hear like Hillbillies endorsing Trump

1279
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:16,639
Black Pastor it's

1280
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:23,039
Like this legitimizes everything that we say if you black ladies are on our side we can be as races

1281
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:24,063
Just as we want

1282
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,367
And I don't know I don't know what they're

1283
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,927
Story is I don't know what their history is

1284
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:31,487
I do know that other stuff I've seen

1285
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:33,279
Scene of them they don't really have

1286
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:36,351
What appears to be a nuance

1287
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,375
Position

1288
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,143
On the issues

1289
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:39,423
I'm not

1290
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:41,727
It's difficult for me to

1291
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,007
Encapsulate what I mean

1292
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,823
The real name

1293
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:49,151
From what I can tell basically they just repeat

1294
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:50,175
Pro Trump

1295
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:53,503
Was their claim to fame

1296
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:57,087
The interview that Alex Jones end up having is not

1297
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:57,855
Substantive

1298
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:58,879
In any way

1299
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:01,695
And we'll get to one clip of it a little bit later

1300
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:05,023
But before we do is important

1301
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,559
The 22nd Alex Jones

1302
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:08,351
Finally found

1303
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:11,167
It recently

1304
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,191
He still hasn't

1305
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:16,031
It recently came out inside the salon article

1306
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,311
Todd Nickerson

1307
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,847
The article where the guy

1308
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:19,871
Here comes out

1309
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:20,639
Explains that

1310
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,407
But he has

1311
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,175
Attractions

1312
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:24,223
The children but would never act up

1313
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:30,623
And Alex Jones has been saying that they're going to try and mainstream pedophilia

1314
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:32,671
I tried making it with normal deck

1315
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:33,695
Pedophilia

1316
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:35,231
You are a pedophobe

1317
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:41,887
Text makes a f****** meal out of this article and

1318
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:43,167
Back to Salon

1319
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:47,007
I saw this last night

1320
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:51,871
Has a story out on it today

1321
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:58,527
Salon I don't need to understand

1322
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:03,391
Monster

1323
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,415
And it's begun

1324
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:06,463
Show it

1325
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:17,983
When she was the bring her back up

1326
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,567
Surgeon General

1327
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:31,551
Weirdos

1328
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:33,855
They can do anything for sanostee Elations you name it

1329
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:39,743
Acceleration

1330
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:43,839
Whatever this is

1331
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:45,887
Stupid

1332
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:48,703
That whole thing

1333
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,471
Because

1334
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,263
Reading that

1335
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:52,799
Was such a

1336
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:53,823
A complex

1337
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:55,103
Scituate

1338
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:55,871
Very much so

1339
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:59,967
For somebody who's trying to understand people

1340
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:05,599
Just like

1341
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,135
Practically reduce

1342
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:09,183
Pedophilia

1343
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:11,231
What was like what we talked about

1344
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:15,839
The end result that we want his life people being killed by gun pedophiles

1345
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:18,655
What we want is less children being abused

1346
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:22,239
And if the route to that end goal that we

1347
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,519
Is a

1348
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:25,823
Further understanding of where does the

1349
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,895
Just come from what is going on in psychology of the

1350
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:29,919
People who are attracted

1351
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:30,687
The children

1352
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:32,479
Then it was you

1353
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,295
Have some understanding

1354
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,575
That doesn't mean

1355
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,343
Liking it

1356
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,367
That doesn't mean

1357
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,903
Accepting it doesn't mean memes

1358
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:40,671
Streaming it

1359
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,695
What it does mean

1360
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:47,327
Look at the end goal is not well at by murdering everybody who has

1361
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:51,935
Attractions to children will be everyone going underground

1362
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:56,799
You seen that people have

1363
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:58,847
You know c*********

1364
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:01,919
It's like just like the guy said in the article it's like

1365
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:02,943
I can't

1366
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,223
Tell

1367
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:04,991
My therapist

1368
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,271
I can't tell

1369
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,039
My psyche

1370
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,599
Because there

1371
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:10,367
Well

1372
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,671
They don't have an obligation to report just

1373
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:13,439
But you have

1374
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:19,327
Do that

1375
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,351
Ant butt

1376
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,631
That they won't because of

1377
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,655
Touch This

1378
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:24,447
Lusteric

1379
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,215
Like f******

1380
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,519
No you're like all of these

1381
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:29,823
Complicated thing and that's all

1382
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:31,615
If you're on the right

1383
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:33,663
Nope Temple

1384
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:37,247
It goes up your shoot it down

1385
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:42,879
Easy marinade for them to push it so perfectly into fear-mongering and other ring

1386
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:47,487
I get it I don't think that Alex Jones is a

1387
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:48,767
Sleep idiot

1388
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:50,047
For being a verse

1389
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:53,375
But I think he's being incredibly dishonest by saying

1390
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:56,703
That it is part of a push to mainstream

1391
01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:00,031
Pedophilia and then beyond that the things that uses

1392
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:01,823
To bolster that is saying that

1393
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:05,663
Pedophiles are recognized non-governmental organization with the UN

1394
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:09,759
There was the gay advocacy

1395
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:12,831
The group that in the early 80s

1396
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:14,367
Included NAMBLA

1397
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:17,695
The gay rights organization became a recognized

1398
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:18,975
Remember

1399
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:22,815
Advisory member of the UN

1400
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:25,631
I meant came out

1401
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:26,655
So they got kicked out

1402
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:33,311
Never been apart of advisory committees

1403
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,591
When it's

1404
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:37,407
What's a complete lie that he knows no one's going to look into

1405
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:39,967
Then beyond that we see him doing a voice

1406
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:41,503
Was Jocelyn Elders witch

1407
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,295
Help should tell you he's lying

1408
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,855
He absolutely is Jocelyn elders just said

1409
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:48,159
That in terms of discouraging

1410
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:52,255
Dangerous behaviors maybe children should learn about masturbating

1411
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,815
Maybe it's not saying hey

1412
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:56,095
Kojak off those kids

1413
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:00,191
She didn't say that

1414
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,215
And Alex

1415
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,079
2 absolute

1416
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,639
Define

1417
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:10,175
To bolster his argument

1418
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:14,271
He's not willing to wrestle with the nuance

1419
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,599
What's the problem in that suit

1420
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:20,159
Everybody who

1421
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:22,975
Capable of reason

1422
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:23,999
Is paralyzed

1423
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,815
Right cuz there's so much

1424
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:27,839
Kind of steps

1425
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,887
Is if you're on the right

1426
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:30,655
You just get to

1427
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,191
You just get so f******

1428
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:34,239
Put your ears back and go Whole Hog

1429
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:35,775
Right

1430
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,055
For like

1431
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:38,591
The argument

1432
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:40,383
I can have with him is just

1433
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:43,199
It's really complicated

1434
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:48,831
There's any way you'll ever understand it if I

1435
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:55,487
The answer there's no clear answer

1436
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:03,423
If you if you think he's done a bad job so far

1437
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:10,079
Let's listen to this next clip

1438
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:12,127
About the article

1439
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:13,663
Haven't

1440
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:14,687
Well

1441
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:15,967
I guess technically dozen

1442
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:21,855
Salon

1443
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:24,927
Todd

1444
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:27,487
Nickerson says this

1445
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:30,559
Isn't he

1446
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,375
Maybe you should be on the cover of

1447
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:34,655
Sports Illustrated

1448
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:37,471
ESPN award

1449
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:38,751
He should be then he would be

1450
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:39,775
Be hurt by a lot of pain

1451
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:43,871
Subconsciously implant

1452
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:45,407
Singing his audiences

1453
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:46,687
Pedophiles

1454
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:47,711
And Caitlyn Jenner

1455
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:48,735
He's trying

1456
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:50,783
To create a soft metal Bridge

1457
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:52,575
Pedophiles and transgender

1458
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:54,879
Absolutely doing that

1459
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:56,415
Intentional I did not

1460
01:11:56,671 --> 01:12:01,535
It's not intentional in the sense that he meant his mind works

1461
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:05,119
Because

1462
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:05,887
Gay people are pet

1463
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:07,935
Like that hole.

1464
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:10,495
Well

1465
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:16,895
Right there

1466
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:18,431
Transgender people with pattern

1467
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:19,967
Yeah

1468
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:20,735
Atrocious

1469
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:21,759
The beaver

1470
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:23,295
I'm a pedophile

1471
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:25,087
But not a monster

1472
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,903
I'm attracted to children

1473
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:34,303
Before judging me harshly

1474
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,863
Would you be willing to listen

1475
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:38,655
And this is exactly

1476
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:45,055
The homosexual Lobby started back in the forties and fifties with articles in Reader's Digest

1477
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:47,103
Jackson

1478
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,199
Absolutely

1479
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,735
Homosexual

1480
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:55,807
Falls are two different categories

1481
01:12:56,063 --> 01:13:02,207
Job fair

1482
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:04,511
Groups and labels

1483
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:08,095
You're still close

1484
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:11,167
New world

1485
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:17,055
World Revisited UNESCO worldwide treaty Arrangement agreement

1486
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:22,943
That's a long name

1487
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:39,327
So they've chosen

1488
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,119
Solution of women

1489
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:46,751
What is a major

1490
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:55,455
Back to reality oh there goes gravity

1491
01:13:58,783 --> 01:13:59,295
Batman Batman

1492
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,647
So that's nonsense

1493
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:09,791
I love that

1494
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:14,911
YYZ

1495
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:20,799
Dominate the world

1496
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,847
1984

1497
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:24,383
Screw 1988

1498
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:30,783
That's a bunch of stuff they're hoping that it sounds official

1499
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:35,135
What the f*** are you talking about this is all nonsense

1500
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,159
It's an

1501
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:37,695
The factory where he goes

1502
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:38,719
He's like

1503
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,791
They're trying to attack masculinity and femininity

1504
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,863
Your takeaway from this article

1505
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:45,887
This far away from

1506
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:47,679
But that's nowhere near it

1507
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,703
What are you doing

1508
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:51,519
Well

1509
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:54,847
But just from a position of like

1510
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:57,919
Weird

1511
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:58,943
Weird

1512
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:02,015
Alex

1513
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:05,855
To point out

1514
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:07,647
Was trying to bolster his claims

1515
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:08,671
The time

1516
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:09,695
Baby

1517
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:10,719
With the inter

1518
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:12,255
With Adventure interviews

1519
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,023
Pac-Man

1520
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:14,559
Really high-end

1521
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:21,471
My ass are better or maybe it's the one time a year

1522
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:26,079
He gets to the

1523
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:29,151
Here's something real dicey

1524
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:37,087
Dusky foundation with supplying children

1525
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:39,135
So this is one of Alex's bigoted

1526
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:41,183
What was one of his big arguments

1527
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,975
That you only talked about

1528
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:43,999
Procure

1529
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:48,863
And stuff like that Boys Town situation that happened

1530
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,655
Where there was

1531
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:53,215
5 definitively proven

1532
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:54,495
That people were

1533
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:57,311
Taking these underprivileged

1534
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:59,359
And senators were doing

1535
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,127
Doing s*** with

1536
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:05,503
Remember that story a conspiracy of Silence

1537
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:07,807
F***** up super f***** up

1538
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:10,879
Such has not been at all

1539
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:11,647
As it relates to

1540
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:12,671
Sandusky

1541
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,231
Can bile

1542
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:18,559
Some like that his organization that was

1543
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:22,143
Yeah it was trying to get kids play sports with obviously it was a way for him

1544
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:23,935
Intergroup

1545
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:28,031
There are a lot of problems

1546
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:31,871
Procure there's no indication of that all done

1547
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:33,407
And like past investigation

1548
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:37,503
As in the case of the Boys Town situation that was what was going on

1549
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,039
Unfriended

1550
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:41,343
Looked into it tried to find

1551
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:43,647
Where is this stuff coming from

1552
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,439
And I think I figured it out

1553
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:47,743
That is better allegations

1554
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:51,071
Sandusky was pimping out children come from a radio host named bark

1555
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:55,679
Who actually Larry Nichols with a mustache

1556
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:57,983
2011 said quote

1557
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,543
I can give you a rumor and I can give you something I see

1558
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,311
Think might happen

1559
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:04,383
I hear there's a rumor that there may be more shocking

1560
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,919
Men from the Second Mile Foundation

1561
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:08,735
Cuz this is gross

1562
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:11,295
I won't use the language I can

1563
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:15,391
Dusky and the Second Mile were pimping out youngboy's to Rich donors

1564
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:17,439
That was being investigated by two

1565
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,463
Two prominent columnist

1566
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,231
Even as I

1567
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:20,767
How does that sound

1568
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:21,535
Start

1569
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,815
I have a rumor

1570
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:25,119
So when he was pressed on it

1571
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:25,887
You said that

1572
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:28,191
I normally up or giving rumors Creedence

1573
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:29,471
But the whole Sandusky

1574
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:31,007
Scandal started out as a rumor

1575
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:33,567
It gets deeper and more disgusting all the time

1576
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:35,103
It's a rumor

1577
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:38,943
It's a rumor that some radio host put out into the world

1578
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:40,479
Then Alex Jones has been peddling

1579
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:45,343
His entire worldview about these pedophiles and the renfield's and Dracula's

1580
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,367
Basically on this

1581
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,391
This is pizzagate

1582
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:50,719
This is that level of like internet Maberry

1583
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:55,583
Did like I'm not trying to defend Sandusky or Joe Paterno or anybody involved

1584
01:17:56,095 --> 01:18:00,447
They're all f****** awful monsters

1585
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:02,495
Indications of come out to Joe Paterno

1586
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:06,847
Who's wear this dating back to the 70s

1587
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:12,735
Aldi

1588
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:14,783
Journalism

1589
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,831
To try and create this

1590
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:18,111
Broader spiderweb

1591
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:20,671
What's going on

1592
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:25,279
Just one monster who is looking for his own

1593
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:27,071
So

1594
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:31,423
In terms of official information

1595
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:34,751
Maybe maybe there is something out there that I'm unaware of

1596
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:36,543
You feel free to tell me

1597
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:38,591
But from what I've been able to glean

1598
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:40,127
The idea that there was

1599
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:40,895
Gorman

1600
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:42,943
And pimping out of these children

1601
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,223
Goes back to rumors

1602
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:47,295
Like Alex

1603
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,575
Do you got to do better

1604
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:49,599
You got to do better

1605
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:51,903
I understand that you want to Launch

1606
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:52,927
Conspiracy theories

1607
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:54,719
Are you want people to

1608
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,999
I distrust

1609
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,279
Mainstream narrative

1610
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:58,303
Can't

1611
01:18:58,815 --> 01:18:59,583
Can't just do this

1612
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:03,167
You really sensationalize a real problem

1613
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:07,007
To the point where you lose your credibility about that real problem

1614
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:09,567
The problem on

1615
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:13,919
Defeating his

1616
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:15,455
You do have

1617
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:16,735
Take

1618
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:18,015
Sandusky side

1619
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:18,783
Something you know

1620
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:21,855
He was a monster but at least he didn't

1621
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,159
Cure kids like

1622
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:27,487
That I'm not I'm not willing

1623
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:30,815
Like Sandusky is not going to come for libel

1624
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:32,863
No that's not going to happen

1625
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,655
Even though he could win

1626
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:41,567
But you don't have the responsibility to prove an egg

1627
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:45,151
Corprew videos

1628
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:47,199
Children

1629
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:48,479
Prove it he did

1630
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:49,503
See the headline

1631
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:50,271
Find Sandusky

1632
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:51,807
Sue's Alex

1633
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:52,575
What's for lunch

1634
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:53,343
Under stressed

1635
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,367
Like that

1636
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:55,647
Terrific

1637
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:57,951
Nobody wants you to even be alive

1638
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:59,999
We definitely don't want you to win

1639
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,447
That's Tuff

1640
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:15,104
I'm glad never happened because I don't want to hear I don't want to deal with that

1641
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,128
Seriously

1642
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:17,408
Nobody nobody

1643
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,432
Wants to be in that position

1644
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,064
This leaves

1645
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,232
Alright Alex Jones

1646
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:32,512
I don't know

1647
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,328
Out

1648
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:38,912
Angry

1649
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,960
All right beside you doing

1650
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:45,312
The fight with me I don't have a gun

1651
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:52,736
And then you can

1652
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:54,272
Blood

1653
01:20:57,344 --> 01:21:00,928
It's right spirit

1654
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:03,488
Filthy

1655
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:08,352
That goes for those Medical

1656
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:14,240
Alright I kind of agree with that being the rage impulse that you would have

1657
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:15,264
You said he was a Cuban

1658
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:29,088
I get it

1659
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:30,368
I get the idea

1660
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:31,136
Like

1661
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:32,928
What you call a crime of passion

1662
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:36,768
Where you find your kid being abused

1663
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:37,792
I understand that

1664
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:38,560
I get it

1665
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:40,352
I get that reaction

1666
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:42,656
I don't get out

1667
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,704
Equating it with vaccines

1668
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,240
I think that's troubling

1669
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:50,080
The idea that these are medical perverts who want to shoot up your children cry

1670
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,384
I hate that I hate that like

1671
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,432
It's easy to beat some of the brain

1672
01:21:58,528 --> 01:22:04,672
You should be attracted to help children and build them up and nurture them

1673
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:30,272
What's all coming

1674
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:33,856
Cheetah fobs

1675
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,008
Super Mario Brothers

1676
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:21,472
Owlfly the armies

1677
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:23,776
I got to say don't break Super Mario in today

1678
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:33,248
Is nearing the end of the ramp exit music just

1679
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:44,000
So

1680
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:45,280
That's weird

1681
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:47,328
You don't like violence

1682
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:52,704
Alex Jones

1683
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:59,104
I just want to kill somebody and they don't want to be in trouble for throwing punches in the air in like

1684
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:02,944
It's crazy

1685
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:06,784
But also I want to say that I

1686
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,064
I'm starting to

1687
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,088
Figure out Alex Jones

1688
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:09,856
Pattern

1689
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:10,624
In terms of

1690
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:14,208
About three of them about to get into

1691
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:15,744
Yeah

1692
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:18,816
I think we can find his cycle

1693
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:23,424
I think we can based on a couple past month

1694
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,472
I think he is about

1695
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,264
Like a 40 day cycle

1696
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:30,848
Okay haven't figured out exactly anymore

1697
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,664
Cuz one of them falls on when he was in a vacation

1698
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,200
Might have been freaking out of Europe

1699
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:44,160
Two months I'm about two and a half on something along those lines

1700
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:45,440
We're going to be able to

1701
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:49,280
Yeah the cycles

1702
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:55,936
So Alex engaged in what is now a couple of very violent diatribes about

1703
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:57,216
Files and Harry wants to be

1704
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:58,240
People's brains

1705
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:01,568
I am poor you to listen to this next clip

1706
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:02,592
Where he's respond

1707
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:05,152
Going to a caller talking about other civilizations

1708
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:07,712
Having very low age of can

1709
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:10,016
Any old world culture

1710
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,952
That they're a woman at that point

1711
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:22,304
Western culture we started arresting development to push it back 2018 or whatever

1712
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:24,864
I personally think sticking probably

1713
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:26,656
The proper age

1714
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:29,216
Haha he thinks proper age of

1715
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:29,984
Consent is sick

1716
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:30,752
16

1717
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:32,032
May I offer this

1718
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:34,080
The age of consent in Texas

1719
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:35,104
Is 17

1720
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:39,200
So that was Jones's actually advocating is dropping

1721
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:41,504
Of the age of consent

1722
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:45,088
There are a lot of

1723
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:46,112
Get hard

1724
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,160
Just fake it

1725
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:49,440
Mathematically art

1726
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:53,792
There are a number of states

1727
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,072
16

1728
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:56,608
17 or 18

1729
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:00,960
And that doesn't even get into the idea that there are different age of consent laws

1730
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:02,752
Heterosexual and homosexual sex

1731
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:03,776
Is very weird

1732
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:08,128
Age of consent

1733
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:08,896
Lost forever

1734
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:10,944
Write this whole thing is f*****

1735
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:15,296
There are very few safe there are couple that is 15 or 40

1736
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:16,320
Urges why

1737
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:18,368
Well is there places where you can

1738
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:20,160
Be legally married at

1739
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,184
14

1740
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,464
And that's fine

1741
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:25,024
Even though you're still below the age of

1742
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,864
Where Alex is

1743
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:29,632
Alex

1744
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:31,168
Sixteen-year-old with Pump It Up

1745
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,472
No problem

1746
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:36,544
But largely would you be advocating is a drop

1747
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:37,824
Of the age of consent

1748
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,616
Do you have this whole

1749
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:41,152
Episode where he's like

1750
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:48,320
I do not acting pedophiles are lying and I want to beat their brains and it was just going to call me a pedophobe

1751
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:52,928
Pedophiles

1752
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:59,584
He doesn't he doesn't see that these two things are sort of working against each other

1753
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,608
Philosophical

1754
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:04,192
Hard Eight

1755
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:06,496
Who is that

1756
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:07,776
Kind of suggest

1757
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:08,544
That

1758
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:10,080
Western culture

1759
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:11,616
Did it on purpose

1760
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:14,944
Intentionally read the language develop

1761
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:17,248
Not realizing it sort of a

1762
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:21,088
Pristine byproduct of the Agricultural Revolution that

1763
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,184
What argument is that

1764
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:28,512
It was

1765
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,280
That's fine

1766
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:32,096
That it was 13 or 15 back then

1767
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:34,144
Oh

1768
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,168
Decided

1769
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:36,448
2

1770
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:41,312
I don't know I don't want to unpack it I want to get out of this segment of the show

1771
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:42,336
Get it off

1772
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:43,616
Scrapbook move out of this

1773
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:45,920
These gross let's move out of this

1774
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:47,456
And move back to what is becoming

1775
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:51,040
Credibly familiar territory where a little bit later on the 22nd

1776
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:52,064
Alex Jones

1777
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:09,728
Now the news

1778
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:26,112
Even say it.

1779
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:40,192
The world stage released

1780
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:44,032
Okay

1781
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:49,152
What

1782
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:50,688
Russia

1783
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,224
Bulshit

1784
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:06,048
Everyday

1785
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:11,680
Alto sax

1786
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:15,776
You're saying that you've

1787
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:17,312
I think Al Qaeda used

1788
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:18,592
Attacks

1789
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:21,152
Instead of a sod

1790
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:23,456
That is so

1791
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:24,736
Tenaya love

1792
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:28,320
Reality from

1793
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:32,672
Russian media sources like the ones we discussed

1794
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:35,232
He also takes it from there was that ambassador

1795
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:42,912
Suspicious

1796
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:45,472
Chemical weapons attacks

1797
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:46,752
Sade is a good guy

1798
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:48,800
Alright I don't think that you were an unbiased

1799
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:50,080
Now that's

1800
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:51,616
What's that the British guy

1801
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:53,920
Look I mean

1802
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:55,712
Wentworth

1803
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:57,760
Seeing mountains of evidence

1804
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:00,832
We're the Bad Guys

1805
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:01,856
And Putin is a good guy

1806
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:04,416
Alex

1807
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:05,952
One thing to say to you

1808
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,000
Lovett or leave it

1809
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:11,072
Seems very in America

1810
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:14,400
So as we mentioned earlier Alex

1811
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:17,216
I got this interview with diamond and silk

1812
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:20,288
Yep and here is a little excerpt

1813
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:23,104
Eyewear Alex Jones doesn't want to deal with the issues

1814
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,896
And what's the

1815
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:26,944
He wants to inject

1816
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:27,712
Misogyny

1817
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:32,064
Answer this interview guy

1818
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:38,976
McDonald's

1819
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,680
What everybody

1820
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:52,800
Forget about this media bias missing his propaganda attention

1821
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:58,432
Continue continue

1822
01:30:58,944 --> 01:31:01,760
So you get a little sense of like

1823
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:07,648
Have sex with only reason that women have

1824
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:08,672
Right

1825
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:10,208
He's be bringing it up twice

1826
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:12,768
Actually

1827
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,048
Are you hot for truck

1828
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:15,584
No I'm not

1829
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,656
I'm not saying isn't any dismissive way they really just

1830
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:20,448
Just keep saying we stopped for Trump

1831
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:22,752
JustFab

1832
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:25,056
Right you got to do

1833
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:25,824
Is that excited

1834
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:30,944
I got none

1835
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:37,344
There's one lady who says all this stuff

1836
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,112
The next president

1837
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:40,672
I meant the other lady just go that's right

1838
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:49,376
It's just he has them on

1839
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:50,400
To basically

1840
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:52,192
B-black and temperature

1841
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:54,752
Do both the same time

1842
01:31:55,264 --> 01:32:01,408
Alex Jones having them on as a guest indicates to me that he recognizes that maybe they

1843
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:03,456
But he doesn't have maybe

1844
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:05,504
We can tap into it

1845
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,320
Legitimizes it to his old white

1846
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,344
So they don't feel

1847
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,392
Guilt right it's all about knots

1848
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:12,416
Feeling guilty

1849
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:13,184
4

1850
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:14,976
Black women

1851
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,256
Hey I know

1852
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:19,840
All of these millions and millions of black people are telling me this

1853
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:22,912
But look we've got some too so it's not a racial

1854
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:26,496
My position is

1855
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:27,520
But he's already

1856
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:31,616
Behind-the-scenes or subconsciously decide

1857
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:32,896
He's going to jump into

1858
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:35,200
Camp

1859
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:36,480
Aztec balloons

1860
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:41,600
He's doing them is like putting his toe into the water you are

1861
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:43,136
Show pro-trump

1862
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:45,184
On and knowing that you're not going to

1863
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:48,768
Beyond your platform

1864
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:54,656
Some questions but they're more like

1865
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:55,424
Softball

1866
01:32:55,680 --> 01:33:01,824
Little meatballs

1867
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:04,896
Why do you support Trump is just allowing them to say we

1868
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:06,944
We need to get him into the White House to bring

1869
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:12,064
Prosperity

1870
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,088
How is he going to be

1871
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:20,768
Indication that he's already preparing his audience for the

1872
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:21,536
Natural twist

1873
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:22,560
Because

1874
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:24,352
I think you got a bunch of money at the money bomb

1875
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:31,776
Here is Alex Jones invalidating things he said about Trump in the past

1876
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:33,824
Because I don't want people

1877
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:39,200
Such incredible

1878
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:41,248
In this country it makes my head spin

1879
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:46,624
Get upset if somebody

1880
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:49,184
Is better at sports

1881
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:52,000
Personal

1882
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:57,632
But this class Warfare class

1883
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:05,056
What are the positive things

1884
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:11,456
At least she's self-made he's got his problems but at least she's self-made it okay to be successful again

1885
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:16,064
Examples

1886
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,112
For children to believe they can become successful

1887
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:19,904
Because more rich people

1888
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,952
Market means more wealth

1889
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:24,000
Everybody else more economy

1890
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:28,352
Right

1891
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:31,168
That's how we gotten this message

1892
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:32,960
But bye-bye

1893
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:35,776
But the reason that Alex Jones think

1894
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:37,568
The Trump is self-made

1895
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,872
Is because they have similar Baxter

1896
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:42,176
In the sense that Trump

1897
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:48,576
Got bailed out over and over again by his super-rich father has a Empire that

1898
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,440
Money laundering

1899
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:57,280
Businesses

1900
01:34:57,536 --> 01:35:01,888
Only as a career because his dad bought him a radio show when he was younger by being his

1901
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:02,656
First

1902
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:03,424
Sponsor

1903
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,448
I'm giving him the

1904
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:06,496
Perception of being self-made

1905
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:09,312
Building up all this stuff

1906
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:11,872
And now he has an Empire that's built on fake pills

1907
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:13,408
Feel like there is

1908
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:14,688
Pretty similar

1909
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:16,224
Trajectory between the two of them

1910
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,272
Which I can understand Alex Jones

1911
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:24,160
Sort of seeing and relating to and becoming enamored with

1912
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:25,184
Time

1913
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:26,464
Alex in the

1914
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:28,512
Has said that Trump is

1915
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:29,536
Con man

1916
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:33,120
He said the team is a frontman working source of on the East Coast

1917
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:34,400
Mobbed up

1918
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:36,704
He doesn't think that you're a self-made

1919
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:40,288
Know that stuff that you said already on his show

1920
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:41,568
Within the last couple months

1921
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:42,336
What's before this

1922
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:43,872
Complete

1923
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:45,408
Doubling back

1924
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:46,944
Contradicting

1925
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:47,968
Things he said

1926
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:48,736
In the past

1927
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:50,784
And to me that is an indication

1928
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:51,808
Alex has

1929
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:53,344
Something has changed

1930
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:58,720
It's not just I'm not going to talk s*** about Trump anymore it's I'm going to lie

1931
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:00,768
Where is I said what I asked

1932
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:01,792
Actually thought

1933
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,168
Maybe

1934
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:07,936
It is just

1935
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:08,960
What's the fact that

1936
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:10,496
That's been repeated some

1937
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:11,776
Possible

1938
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:14,080
Like Alex is a varied suggest

1939
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:15,616
Edible hypnotizable Young

1940
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:17,152
That's true

1941
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:18,176
That was

1942
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:19,968
That's what it was

1943
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:20,736
Was put into

1944
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:21,504
Every piece

1945
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:23,552
Every single thing

1946
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:26,880
Even if it's over even if it's like a CNN thing it's like

1947
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:31,488
Trump is a self-made billionaire and all of this very good business

1948
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:33,280
Which is the narrative that they

1949
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:36,608
Pushing yeah that's true

1950
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:39,168
Is because they want a good businessman in the White House

1951
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:41,472
I was just curious

1952
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:42,752
Repeat it over and over again

1953
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:44,032
From

1954
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:44,800
Does like bright

1955
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:52,480
I may be a pro Russia

1956
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:54,272
Dumb

1957
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:56,576
So maybe

1958
01:36:58,368 --> 01:36:59,904
He can only hold

1959
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:01,696
Austin amount of information

1960
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,048
Tough Enough

1961
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:07,328
You just push the old out

1962
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:11,168
It's possible I don't know I have my assertion you have yours

1963
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:13,216
We'll see what bear is out over the course of

1964
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:17,312
You know I'm yours is an anyway what we learn

1965
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:19,360
2 days from now

1966
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,432
But

1967
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:26,016
Cuz it doesn't matter Alex just lies about

1968
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:26,784
Cole

1969
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,344
He says that every

1970
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,904
Do you see those buildings belong there scrubbers

1971
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:32,928
Everything is getting

1972
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:39,328
Scrub like as if they're taking all of the

1973
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:43,936
Yeah

1974
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:44,704
Can you put in 50

1975
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,752
She sent through the cycle

1976
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:49,056
If you look into it at all

1977
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:50,592
Clean Coal stuff is a myth

1978
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:52,128
All of the attempt

1979
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:53,152
Soap making Clean Coal

1980
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:55,968
Power plants are wildly over budget

1981
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:56,992
Take much longer

1982
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:58,016
To create

1983
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:59,040
But it is not as

1984
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:01,600
The idea that every plant

1985
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:02,624
Thought cool plant

1986
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:06,976
Burning clean and everything

1987
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:08,512
It's right

1988
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:09,536
Alex

1989
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:10,560
Have to know that's not

1990
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:13,120
Nicotine is good for you

1991
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,240
Play good point or Mike Pence

1992
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:20,032
God

1993
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:23,360
So this next we have we have gone back to when they wanted to go back

1994
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:25,408
I don't think anybody likes it

1995
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:26,432
Alex Jones

1996
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:28,224
The end of the show

1997
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:28,992
On the 22nd

1998
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:30,528
Get a call from a guy

1999
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:33,600
A roller coaster with a

2000
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:37,696
Ending of the call he starts pointing out

2001
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:38,976
Some very true thing

2002
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:40,256
Such as

2003
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:42,560
Donald Trump's connection with jeffry Epps

2004
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:45,376
Noted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein

2005
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:47,680
Also talked about

2006
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:49,728
The real estate

2007
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:51,264
The organization that

2008
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,824
Is clearly involved with Trump and Russian mob

2009
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:56,384
Right and also the setting

2010
01:38:57,408 --> 01:39:00,224
Then the call takes a weird turn and I can no longer support

2011
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:07,136
Cereal

2012
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:09,952
Thank you there's an old expression

2013
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:14,560
Be careful of what you pray for you might just get it I think that's what we're heading for with Trump

2014
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:19,680
You can judge a man by Jericho by the company he keeps I'm sure you would agree with that

2015
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:20,448
And

2016
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:25,056
Jeffrey Epstein I'm sure your listeners know who this man is he's a convicted

2017
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,104
Sex offender

2018
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:28,896
Kept company with the likes of Donald

2019
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:29,920
Trump Bill Clinton

2020
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:33,248
Alan dershowitz

2021
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:35,552
An aircraft called the Lolita Express

2022
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:37,600
727 all around the world

2023
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:40,416
Implicated

2024
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:43,488
And it's ekstrand child sex ring slavery

2025
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:47,840
Investigation

2026
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:55,264
Donald Trump business partner the gentleman at a Consortium with bayrock Group LLC a property

2027
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:59,360
Griffith parking with the Trump organization to build a Soho Hotel condominium

2028
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:01,408
Trump Tower in Florida

2029
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:02,688
He was arrested by turkey

2030
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:03,968
YouTube down

2031
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,272
Honor in helicopters

2032
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:07,296
Anna yacht

2033
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:10,368
In the Mediterranean and found underage workers on board

2034
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:13,184
So these are the types of people that Donald Trump

2035
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:16,256
Rubbing elbows with so high I don't endorse

2036
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:18,304
By the Ron Paul

2037
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,328
Rand Paul

2038
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:20,864
Any politician

2039
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:23,424
I think they're all corrupt to to the

2040
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:24,448
To the eyeball

2041
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:25,472
Alright

2042
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:30,848
So I didn't quite like that last part as much

2043
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,128
I'm still here

2044
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:33,664
Here is where it takes

2045
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:34,688
Turn

2046
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:35,456
This is

2047
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:36,224
Jarring

2048
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:38,016
Forest people

2049
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:39,808
Trying to

2050
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:41,856
Judge your character Alex

2051
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:43,904
With mainstream media like

2052
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:46,720
Salon and and mainstream media

2053
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:47,488
Really think

01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:54,656
What I refer to is dying as Jew media

2056
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:57,472
And the same thing with politics

2057
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:58,240
You looking

2058
01:40:58,496 --> 01:40:59,008
Politics

2059
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:00,544
U.s. Congress

2060
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:05,408
It's primarily run by the American Israel a political action committee

2061
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:06,944
Butler

2062
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,480

Detroit Technologies concern

2064
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:14,368
Boeing has an uninterruptible autopilot switch on their crap with me

2065
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:15,648
It makes me think about

2066
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:17,696
911

2067
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:24,096
Both those aircraft

2068
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:28,448
Jewish Mafia That's this leftist

2069
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:33,824
Amerifactors

2070
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:36,128
But shark

2071
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:40,224
Are the Big 4 lobbies Implanon

2072
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:54,560
This is why

2073
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:56,352
People like David Duke

2074
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:59,680
And people who are anti-Semitic

2075
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:02,240
Count Alex Jones

2076
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:03,776
This guy just said

2077
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:05,824
These attacks against you

2078
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,872
I Am Salon in these places

2079
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:09,664
Are just a Zionist

2080
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:15,296
And Alex doesn't push back on that at all

2081
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:21,952
Mafias

2082
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:26,816
There is no difference

2083
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:27,840
Between

2084
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:29,632
Forces of anti-semitism

2085
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:30,912
Alex Jones

2086
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:32,704
Wow

2087
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:35,264
I don't like.

2088
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:36,800
Because of the

2089
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:41,408
Another valid point

2090
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:43,200
The f******

01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:44,992
Weirdo a******

2092
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:47,808
ABC medical oriented

2093
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:50,880
Jeffrey Epstein

2094
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:54,720
They had a history together

2095
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:03,168
I'd like you can't get Alex now only talk about the bill

2096
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:04,960
Whenever he talks about apps

2097
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:11,360
Clinton completely forgetting about that being a piece of

2098
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:15,712
Been talking about bayrock and Soho hotel and Felix Sater

2099
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:17,504
These are legitimate

2100
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:18,272
Pieces

2101
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,344
And I think will become

2102
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,392
A very ugly investigation

2103
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:24,416
Don't become public

2104
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:27,232
Near future

2105
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:29,792
Alex with himself was talking about earlier

2106
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:33,376
Just like

2107
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:41,568
Entirely by blaming

2108
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:42,592
Jews for everything

2109
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:46,688
Really what he believes 22 Thunder

2110
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:47,456
A different Banner

2111
01:43:48,224 --> 01:43:50,272
We're going to skip the 23rd

2112
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:51,552
Cuz I just don't care

2113
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:58,208
David Knight report he's out on the field

2114
01:43:58,464 --> 01:43:59,232
Covering the Pope

2115
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:03,328
And then the 23rd is largely just there's a lot of

2116
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:06,400
Please just railing on the pope saying he's a devil

2117
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:09,984
And all this

2118
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:13,824
He fakes crying at one point for the plight of the poor people

2119
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,360
In the world which is really it

2120
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:17,920
It's pretty funny but not necessary to go over

2121
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:20,480
Get along interview with Peter Schiff

2122
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:22,272
The Economist

2123
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:24,832
Whose dad is in prison for not paying taxes

2124
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:25,600
Never pay tax

2125
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:29,696
They talked about how about his dad

2126
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:30,464
The political prison

2127
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:33,536
And they never bring up the fact that you didn't

2128
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:35,072
On millions of dollars

2129
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:38,400
And that

2130
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:39,936
He got a lot of other people arrest

2131
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:41,728
I said because he told them to do the same thing

2132
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:46,848
Copying

2133
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:48,384
Constitutional

2134
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:50,432
If you hollow tips

2135
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:52,480
Isaac human I feel bad

2136
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:54,016
For eyes

2137
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:55,040
Peter Schiff

2138
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:57,600
And having to deal with his dad being sick

2139
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:59,392
In prison that is a human

2140
01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:00,672
Thing that is very sad

2141
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:02,208
At the same time

2142
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:04,768
Excuse him going on Alex Jones Show

2143
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:07,328
And using his dad sickness in prison

2144
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:08,096
And

2145
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:08,864
Clear crime

2146
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:11,424
Their propaganda

2147
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:12,960
Is he trying to get money

2148
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:14,240
No

2149
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:15,776
He's trying to get the

2150
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:16,544
Presents

2151
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,336
System investigated

2152
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:23,456
He's trying to cause all kinds of like who did

2153
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:26,272
Couple times

2154
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:28,832
Tell if he's joking about breaking

2155
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:30,624
I can't quite tell

2156
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:31,904
It's a fine line

2157
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:36,512
Beyond

2158
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:39,584
The California drought is a false flag while he does want to put them

2159
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:40,352
I'm into a private

2160
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:41,888
That's the

2161
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:42,656
He doesn't like

2162
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:47,776
Let me know

2163
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:49,056
We're in line with his

2164
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:52,384
You just crossed over

2165
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:53,408
Missing the California

2166
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:59,808
Because they're using other weapons

2167
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:03,904
I also

2168
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:05,440
There's some talk about other weapons

2169
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:07,488
Alex Jones

2170
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:10,304
Two things that are wild one is Mel Gibson

2171
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:11,328
Was that up

2172
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:13,376
Because

2173
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:17,472
How to get setup

2174
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:22,080
Somebody up for an anti-semitic rant

2175
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:24,384
That's after being pulled over for drunk driving

2176
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:34,880
Okay but the reason is because he drinks anti-semite

2177
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:37,696
The reason that they'd set him up as cuz he's critical of the Vatican

2178
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:39,232
All right that's why

2179
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:40,768
Engage with that

2180
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:45,376
The Germany was the victim in World War I

2181
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,168
Which

2182
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:48,448
If you're talking about like

2183
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:50,240
Just a mainstream population

2184
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:51,008
Maybe

2185
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:53,056
But if you're talking about the country as a whole

2186
01:46:53,312 --> 01:46:53,824
And the government

2187
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:54,848
Nothing much

2188
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:57,152
That's not good

2189
01:46:57,408 --> 01:46:58,432
Don't smell good

2190
01:46:58,688 --> 01:46:59,200
I don't like that

2191
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:03,552
He's a very short step away from being Holocaust

2192
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:06,880
No we already went over in the last episode

2193
01:47:09,696 --> 01:47:11,488
B******* right there

2194
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:13,024
Yeah that's bad enough

2195
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:18,144
So

2196
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:20,192
That's all

2197
01:47:20,448 --> 01:47:23,008
Family do have another Field Report with Dakari Jackson

2198
01:47:28,384 --> 01:47:30,944
It would be so boring

2199
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:39,392
They pieced together cuz they're the other person

2200
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:53,216
Take me to

2201
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:56,800
My phone glad you raised $2000000 for this Alex you're doing great work

2202
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:58,848
So we get onto the 24th

2203
01:47:59,104 --> 01:48:02,432
And I want to know what there

2204
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:04,224
Do they have separate

2205
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:09,600
They are they camping I want them

2206
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:13,696
Easy Rider but the most boring version of

2207
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:19,840
Do I wanted

2208
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:20,864
Give you a treat

2209
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:23,168
Because a lot of this is not very pleasant

2210
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:25,984
And so this next clip is my gift

2211
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:26,752
Do you

2212
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:27,520
Is one of the

2213
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:31,872
Few times that Indies rebroadcast episodes I'm able to get access to

2214
01:48:32,128 --> 01:48:38,272
They keep him some karaoke

2215
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:47,744
Fortune

2216
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,352
The globalist want inverted power over people

2217
01:48:59,008 --> 01:49:05,152
Guitar

2218
01:49:26,912 --> 01:49:28,448
As well

2219
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:47,648
Father stop it right now I apologize

2220
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:48,928
Love love

2221
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:56,352
We're not doing a good enough job pointing out how often he apologizes whatever he does anything fun

2222
01:49:58,144 --> 01:49:59,936
I'm sorry I was interesting for a minute

2223
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:04,544
Just great and I want to be totally clear

2224
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:07,872
Turn up the audio that was the person on the board

2225
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:10,432
Studio

2226
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:12,736
The parkway is not talking

2227
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:17,088
Is in the song

2228
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:23,232
I'm telling you this week is all Pope

2229
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:24,768
Is all anti-popes.

2230
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:27,328
That's mostly what he's into

2231
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:31,168
He talked about how the pope came

2232
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:33,216
A young hispanic girl came up

2233
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:34,496
The pope and gave him a letter

2234
01:50:37,824 --> 01:50:38,336
Urgent

2235
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:40,128
Clemency about

2236
01:50:42,176 --> 01:50:44,224
Obviously it's probably a photo op

2237
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:46,528
Even

2238
01:50:46,784 --> 01:50:47,808
We don't think the

2239
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:49,088
Necessarily that is

2240
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:50,368
A genuine moment

2241
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,672
Beautiful

2242
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:55,232
And I don't think it's something nefarious

2243
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:57,792
The globalist

2244
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:02,144
Open borders

2245
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,960
Pope is in on it or what have you

2246
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:08,032
It's interesting to note that he prefers the

2247
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:09,568
The Nazi play

2248
01:51:15,968 --> 01:51:21,088
And they argue that the only reason that he got out and we got this Pope Francis in

2249
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:21,856
Is because

2250
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:23,648
Pedophile blackmail

2251
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:26,976
Sebastian

2252
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:28,000
Sagarika is going to be the

2253
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:28,768
The next Pope after

2254
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:33,632
Did the cool Pope I would assume so gently Nazi lineage

2255
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:34,912
Beyonce

2256
01:51:35,168 --> 01:51:36,448
He talks about how Edward Snowden

2257
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:37,472
Sekiro and Trump

2258
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:43,360
Is wrong about I appreciate that I withhold judgment generally agree

2259
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:47,200
You also talk about hubby kid who came to school

2260
01:51:47,712 --> 01:51:50,784
Remember that

2261
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:54,624
Is a false flag by man

2262
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:55,904
It wasn't a bomb

2263
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:57,696
I knew it wasn't

2264
01:51:57,952 --> 01:52:03,840
But he made it look like a bomb so the government but he made it look like a bomb so that the police

2265
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:05,120
Would have to get involved

2266
01:52:05,376 --> 01:52:10,240
I meant to become this PR stunt that people could

2267
01:52:10,496 --> 01:52:11,776
With this publicity

2268
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:13,312
Stop

2269
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:17,152
It's bad plan and it's a long way to go

2270
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:17,920
Easier ways

2271
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:19,712
To demonize the anti-immigrant

2272
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:21,504
Such as by using their

2273
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:22,272
Finding words

2274
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:23,808
Yeah I also

2275
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:25,088
Alex Jones

2276
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:25,856
Claims

2277
01:52:26,112 --> 01:52:26,880
But he's going

2278
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:28,416
On the show

2279
01:52:34,048 --> 01:52:36,096
We talked about it all the time and I'm going to lay it out

2280
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:36,864
Do you have a guess

2281
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:38,656
After the end of the show named Wiggins

2282
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:44,032
And because it is the lamest f****** interview I've ever

2283
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:46,336
Is all the doctors no sources

2284
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:48,384
I've stopped there's just vague mention

2285
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:49,408
The chemtrails

2286
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:52,480
It's already discussed course

2287
01:52:52,736 --> 01:52:54,272
Right

2288
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:56,064
When he's like

2289
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:57,856
I'm going to prove it

2290
01:52:58,112 --> 01:52:59,392
And then does nothing

2291
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:02,720
He claimed the global weather weapons

2292
01:53:05,536 --> 01:53:07,840
Beer and the Destroyer

2293
01:53:08,864 --> 01:53:11,936
We were fighting beetle

2294
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:17,824
Mix up Alex Jones bullshittin someone else's

2295
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:24,224
But that's Robert know that wasn't even Robert

2296
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:26,016
Source

2297
01:53:26,272 --> 01:53:28,064
Notize Vietnam vet

2298
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:30,112
So now wait we get to this

2299
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:33,440
Of his

2300
01:53:33,696 --> 01:53:34,464
Attacking the Pope

2301
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:36,768
Has an interview with Leo zagami

2302
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:40,352
Visit range time I believe

2303
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:42,144
First time he's actually been on

2304
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:45,216
Right are we talked about him before because of

2305
01:53:45,472 --> 01:53:45,984
I don't know why we

2306
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:46,752
Talk about him

2307
01:53:47,008 --> 01:53:49,568
Some other

2308
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:55,200
Do that

2309
01:53:55,712 --> 01:53:56,736
But that's in present day

2310
01:53:57,248 --> 01:53:58,272
That's in 2070

2311
01:53:58,784 --> 01:53:59,296
Oh that's

2312
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:00,064
727

2313
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:01,344
Yeah so this is

2314
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:06,720
It was where my brain was having a disc

2315
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:09,536
Difficult time

2316
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:10,304
Enforcement

2317
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:12,864
Why

2318
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:18,240
We need our continent that is that Alex Jones is wrong in both Time Low

2319
01:54:18,496 --> 01:54:19,776
This is why h.g. Wells had some

2320
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:20,800
Struggles later on

2321
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:23,360
Science fiction is just the fantasies

2322
01:54:24,384 --> 01:54:26,176
Anyway

2323
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:28,224
Captain Alex Jones quote

2324
01:54:29,504 --> 01:54:30,016
Fantastic

2325
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:32,576
Shakespeare

2326
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:38,208
Leo zagami on

2327
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:41,280
Quote

2328
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:43,072
Is really difficult

2329
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:46,400
And that is what he saying everything that he has

2330
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:47,424
Everything he knows

2331
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:48,448
Is document

2332
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:51,520
He isn't Vatican Insider

2333
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:54,336
As we can get these documents that are very difficult

2334
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:55,360
Which is very Canby

2335
01:54:56,128 --> 01:54:56,640
Wait

2336
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:57,664
They are

2337
01:54:59,200 --> 01:54:59,712
Have them

2338
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:05,088
Okay

2339
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:06,880
Such an Insider

2340
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:09,184
Play this clip

2341
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:10,720
Leo zagami

2342
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:12,512
Beginnings

2343
01:55:13,024 --> 01:55:15,072
Of his waking up to the truth

2344
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:17,632
Am I believe if you listen carefully

2345
01:55:17,888 --> 01:55:20,704
You'll see that maybe he's not on the level

2346
01:55:21,472 --> 01:55:26,336
And maybe Alex Jones just believe people who agree with what he believes in and have an axe

2347
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:27,616
I think

2348
01:55:27,872 --> 01:55:31,968
But there's something there's a little credibility that Leo zagami gets because there's

2349
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:35,552
Tell us about yourself how you woke up

2350
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:36,320
Then

2351
01:55:36,832 --> 01:55:38,880
Are they getting stronger

2352
01:55:39,136 --> 01:55:40,416
Who runs the Vatican

2353
01:55:44,512 --> 01:55:50,656
Probably one of the reasons why India 2000-2001 ex3200

2354
01:55:50,912 --> 01:55:52,960
Because

2355
01:55:53,216 --> 01:55:59,360
The network of masonic Network and other secret societies

2356
01:55:59,616 --> 01:56:05,760
When we saw the Bohemian Grove

2357
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:16,512
Are facing some of the masses dead and telling them I mean

2358
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:25,984
Inspiration that you gave me

2359
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:32,384
At one point it reality of what I had.

2360
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:36,736
Secret society that I was involved in and I decided that it no longer wanted

2361
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:41,088
Especially when I discovered the secret

2362
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:45,696
So

2363
01:56:48,256 --> 01:56:48,768
Stereotypical

2364
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:49,536
Look

2365
01:56:50,048 --> 01:56:52,352
Grill covers

2366
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:55,424
I didn't mean for it to be back but whatever

2367
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:57,728
Leo zagami

2368
01:56:57,984 --> 01:57:02,336
Cool backstory he's flushed out on like Project Camelot interviews

2369
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:03,616
And his own biography

2370
01:57:04,128 --> 01:57:07,200
Is it he was a high-ranking member of the Illuminati

2371
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:09,760
He was apart of the real

2372
01:57:10,016 --> 01:57:11,552
Powerful Illuminati

2373
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:13,856
And on Alex Jones Show

2374
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:17,952
He's saying 2000-2001 I started listening to you Alec

2375
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:24,352
I saw your b*******.

2376
01:57:26,144 --> 01:57:28,448
What the f***

2377
01:57:33,056 --> 01:57:33,568
Are they keeping

2378
01:57:33,824 --> 01:57:35,360
Step away from music I mean

2379
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:38,432
The problem people get slippery

2380
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:42,272
Compartmentalize

2381
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:52,768
I mean he's lying about

2382
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:54,816
He's definitely lying about Alex

2383
01:57:55,328 --> 01:58:01,472
I think he's bothering them up a little bit if you realize where I can

2384
01:58:01,728 --> 01:58:07,872
My book sales and stuff like that realize how many of his guests

2385
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:09,664
Opportunistic assholes were using

2386
01:58:14,528 --> 01:58:15,296
Any of his position

2387
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:17,856
You are the reason I woke up

2388
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:19,904
Use agami

2389
01:58:23,744 --> 01:58:25,280
He said to Alex about what he

2390
01:58:25,536 --> 01:58:26,048
That is a

2391
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:27,328
Cursory Wicked

2392
01:58:28,096 --> 01:58:28,608
Absolutely

2393
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:34,240
Yeah like oh I know that you started a little bit before then I saw on the

2394
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:35,776
The purse biography page

2395
01:58:36,032 --> 01:58:37,312
Cute came to problem

2396
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:38,848
It's because of the Bohemian Grove

2397
01:58:39,104 --> 01:58:40,384
Done

2398
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:41,152
Now I can just

2399
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:42,176
Roll from

2400
01:58:42,432 --> 01:58:46,528
Can I deposit

2401
01:58:46,784 --> 01:58:48,832
Alex did on him

2402
01:58:49,344 --> 01:58:53,440
With that entirely possible that Leo zagami the human

2403
01:58:55,744 --> 01:58:56,256
And Italy

2404
01:58:56,768 --> 01:58:57,280
I did see

2405
01:58:57,536 --> 01:58:58,816
Alex Jones documentary

2406
01:58:59,072 --> 01:58:59,584
2000

2407
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:00,608
Started

2408
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:01,376
To become weird

2409
01:59:02,912 --> 01:59:04,192
Concocted this backstory

2410
01:59:04,448 --> 01:59:07,776
That he was a high-ranking Illuminati member

2411
01:59:08,032 --> 01:59:09,568
To gain credibility Within

2412
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:11,872
The worldview that Alex had exposed

2413
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:14,688
Alright burgeoning internet

2414
01:59:14,944 --> 01:59:15,712
A community of

2415
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:17,504
Distrustful weirdos

2416
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:21,088
Conspiracy theory possible that he could have found out

2417
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:25,952
That time and that this entire backstory of being a Vatican Insider and all this

2418
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:26,976
Is just

2419
01:59:27,232 --> 01:59:27,744
The react

2420
01:59:28,256 --> 01:59:29,280
Seeing Alex Jones

2421
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:33,632
Is it possible for us to know but

2422
01:59:33,888 --> 01:59:35,424
That is a story

2423
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:36,192
I think fit

2424
01:59:36,448 --> 01:59:37,472
The Occam's razor

2425
01:59:38,752 --> 01:59:40,800
Announce matter of

2426
01:59:41,056 --> 01:59:42,080
Of timing light

2427
01:59:42,336 --> 01:59:43,104
Is he

2428
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:45,152
That he finds out about Alex Jones

2429
01:59:45,408 --> 01:59:46,176
In order to go on

2430
01:59:46,432 --> 01:59:47,200
The show and talks

2431
01:59:48,736 --> 01:59:50,016
His entire story out of what

2432
01:59:50,272 --> 01:59:51,040
He thought he saw

2433
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:51,808
In the Box

2434
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:54,880
Generated

2435
01:59:55,136 --> 01:59:56,672
Like what you just hallucinating

2436
01:59:57,184 --> 01:59:58,464
I will tell you that

2437
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:00,256
Completely out and outline

2438
02:00:00,512 --> 02:00:02,304
I will tell you what I don't believe

2439
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:03,072
Is possible

2440
02:00:04,608 --> 02:00:05,120
He just said

2441
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:06,656
I don't think

2442
02:00:06,912 --> 02:00:07,424
Take that spot

2443
02:00:07,936 --> 02:00:09,216
Course not but be that as it may

2444
02:00:11,008 --> 02:00:11,520
Next Club Jordan

2445
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:13,312
Is

2446
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:16,640
More evidence that

2447
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:17,664
Alex Jones

2448
02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:18,944
Into Putin

2449
02:00:25,088 --> 02:00:31,232
Best friends

2450
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:46,336
I was on there

2451
02:00:46,592 --> 02:00:48,384
The directors of Art

2452
02:00:50,944 --> 02:00:53,504
People

2453
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:59,904
And that the Russian government actually watches the show

2454
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:06,560
They don't need me I'm just promoting

2455
02:01:06,816 --> 02:01:10,912
What's the weather

2456
02:01:11,168 --> 02:01:16,544
But Alex doesn't understand the idea of like cultivation of assets

2457
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:18,848
Instaflex

2458
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:23,200
Right out of the Russian spy Play Books

2459
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:30,624
Michael Savage podcast

2460
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:43,936
Call me manipulating him in order to

2461
02:01:44,192 --> 02:01:44,704
People

2462
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:45,984
The Russian propaganda

2463
02:01:47,776 --> 02:01:52,128
List of logical conclusion with with

2464
02:01:52,384 --> 02:01:52,896
Yeah of course

2465
02:01:54,176 --> 02:01:54,688
It's not

2466
02:01:54,944 --> 02:01:56,480
That they're trying to butter him up

2467
02:01:59,296 --> 02:02:01,856
I try to butter you up

2468
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:06,208
He didn't

2469
02:02:06,464 --> 02:02:07,744
Interfering in the election

2470
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,304
And so obviously

2471
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:13,120
Can imagine

2472
02:02:13,376 --> 02:02:13,888
Disco's on

2473
02:02:14,912 --> 02:02:20,544

Every time I came here

2480
02:02:44,864 --> 02:02:51,008
Out of Russian television

2481
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:02,784
Orthodox Christian by underground

2482
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:09,184
I think she's got a Christian them or is that Kiara bubble

2483
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:12,768
Mysterious ways what the f***

2484

I look at Russian and it's becoming looking Russian news

2485
02:03:17,632 --> 02:03:18,400
Was becoming a lot like

2486
02:03:18,656 --> 02:03:20,192
Infowars is not a statement I like to

2487
02:03:20,448 --> 02:03:24,032
To hear all this stuff from Russian

2488
02:03:24,544 --> 02:03:25,824
Official Outlet

2489
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:28,640
Glorify poodle

2490
02:03:28,896 --> 02:03:29,920
The secret Christian

2491
02:03:30,176 --> 02:03:31,968
Are you trying to defend Christian dumb

2492
02:03:33,248 --> 02:03:34,016
This is insane

2493
02:03:34,528 --> 02:03:35,808
This is totally nuts

2494
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:37,344
Alex believe

2495
02:03:38,624 --> 02:03:39,392
Well they said

2496
02:03:40,672 --> 02:03:45,280
You're on the level to Alex

2497
02:03:46,048 --> 02:03:46,560
Just whatever it is

2498
02:03:46,816 --> 02:03:47,328
Did you say

2499
02:03:47,584 --> 02:03:48,864
He's a mix of

2500
02:03:49,376 --> 02:03:52,960
Idiotic child and age

2501
02:03:53,216 --> 02:03:54,240
Complete Nutter Narcissus

2502
02:03:54,752 --> 02:03:55,776
So he'll believe

2503
02:03:57,568 --> 02:03:58,080
Makes him look

2504
02:03:58,336 --> 02:04:00,384
We should flatter him and see if he'll Retreat us

2505
02:04:07,552 --> 02:04:09,088
Regurgitation of Russian propaganda

2506
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:10,368
So Alex

2507
02:04:10,624 --> 02:04:12,672
Rails about people saying

2508
02:04:12,928 --> 02:04:17,024
He's a Russian

2509
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:17,792
People are talking about

2510
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:18,816
That's just

2511
02:04:19,072 --> 02:04:20,864
Out-and-out Pro Putin Russia

2512
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:21,632
Propaganda

2513
02:04:22,912 --> 02:04:23,424
Reality

2514
02:04:23,936 --> 02:04:24,960
Now we're done with the

2515
02:04:25,216 --> 02:04:25,728
24th

2516
02:04:26,496 --> 02:04:27,008
24th

2517
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:29,056
We move on to

2518
02:04:29,312 --> 02:04:29,824
September 20th

2519
02:04:30,592 --> 02:04:33,152
When I believe Alex Jones ever made episode

2520
02:04:33,408 --> 02:04:33,920
Begins

2521
02:04:34,176 --> 02:04:34,688
In earnest

2522
02:04:35,456 --> 02:04:36,992
And I think what kicked it off

2523
02:04:37,504 --> 02:04:40,320
Is it on the 25th it was announced that John Boehner with stepping

2524
02:04:41,088 --> 02:04:42,112
As the speaker

2525
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:43,392
Saltz

2526
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:44,160
Alex

2527
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:45,952
Alex

2528
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:46,720
Alex

2529
02:04:47,744 --> 02:04:49,024
Defeated John Boehner

2530
02:04:49,536 --> 02:04:50,048
Single

2531
02:04:50,304 --> 02:04:54,144
Because a couple months back he had a guy named Walter Jones

2532
02:04:54,656 --> 02:04:55,680
Who is the member

2533
02:04:56,192 --> 02:04:57,472
A congress who was trying to

2534
02:04:57,728 --> 02:04:58,496
To vacate the chair

2535
02:04:59,008 --> 02:05:00,032
I'm trying to get John Boehner

2536
02:05:00,288 --> 02:05:00,800
Route

2537
02:05:01,056 --> 02:05:04,384
Alex had him on the show didn't go Alex takes response

2538
02:05:06,688 --> 02:05:07,456
He is becoming

2539
02:05:08,224 --> 02:05:09,760
A little bit into his power

2540
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:11,296
He's starting to think the

2541
02:05:11,552 --> 02:05:12,064
He has

2542
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:14,368
There's delusions of grandeur that are going on

2543
02:05:14,624 --> 02:05:18,208
Not recognizing that I think John Boehner probably smell was in the air

2544
02:05:18,464 --> 02:05:19,232
I realize you can make

2545
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:21,280
Millions of dollars as a trucking Lobby

2546
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:24,352
Stress

2547
02:05:24,608 --> 02:05:25,632
Trump storm

2548
02:05:25,888 --> 02:05:29,216
Smart if you really look at the people who have come out of this the best

2549
02:05:29,728 --> 02:05:30,496
Boehner is up there

2550
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:33,824
Cuz no one hates

2551
02:05:35,872 --> 02:05:40,480
Yeah

2552
02:05:40,736 --> 02:05:43,040
Orange monster for a worse

2553
02:05:43,296 --> 02:05:47,136
Dayton's and incredibly smart move if all you're doing is looking out for

2554
02:05:47,392 --> 02:05:48,672
Prophet and self-preservation

2555
02:05:48,928 --> 02:05:49,440
To have left

2556
02:05:51,744 --> 02:05:52,256
He left

2557
02:05:53,536 --> 02:05:54,048
Pictures that ass

2558
02:05:54,304 --> 02:05:55,584
He was getting pressure

2559
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:56,864
From Walter Jones

2560
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:59,424
And his Cadre of weirdos within the house

2561
02:05:59,936 --> 02:06:02,496
Pushing it

2562
02:06:03,008 --> 02:06:03,776
On the

2563
02:06:04,032 --> 02:06:06,592
On the Liberty program that isn't

2564
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:07,872
Did they made it happen

2565
02:06:08,128 --> 02:06:08,640
Which is

2566
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:10,432
A little bit Wild

2567
02:06:10,688 --> 02:06:11,200
But

2568
02:06:12,992 --> 02:06:15,552
What actually is motivating it even

2569
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:16,320
More

2570
02:06:16,832 --> 02:06:17,600
Is this

2571
02:06:18,112 --> 02:06:18,880
Have gotten a tip for

2572
02:06:19,136 --> 02:06:19,648
From somebody

2573
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:21,696
That I don't believe it's credible

2574
02:06:22,464 --> 02:06:23,744
Feeding into his

2575
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:25,024
Victim mentality

2576
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:27,072
As well as his sort of Messiah,

2577
02:06:28,096 --> 02:06:29,120
And I'll let him spell it out

2578
02:06:30,144 --> 02:06:34,240
I caught myself this morning

2579
02:06:35,008 --> 02:06:37,824
Enthusiastic

2580
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:40,640
And proud of myself and satisfied

2581
02:06:41,152 --> 02:06:42,432
2 degrees

2582
02:06:42,944 --> 02:06:44,480
That I have never been

2583
02:06:45,248 --> 02:06:47,552
I want to stop right there persona

2584
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:50,880
Explain what happens when you act

2585
02:06:57,792 --> 02:07:00,352
Do I look like a bag of trash

2586
02:07:00,608 --> 02:07:04,448
But I ride my bike for an hour and I go look at myself in the mirror cover

2587
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:05,984
I'm doing it

2588
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:10,592
That's usually what happens when you don't exercise and you exercise

2589
02:07:12,640 --> 02:07:14,176
It's something bigger he's figured it out

2590
02:07:14,432 --> 02:07:15,200
I felt

2591
02:07:17,504 --> 02:07:18,528
Show me

2592
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:20,832
Doughboy

2593
02:07:23,392 --> 02:07:24,672
That my conscience

2594
02:07:26,208 --> 02:07:29,280
Was giving me a type of energy I've never felt

2595
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:30,304
In my life

2596
02:07:31,584 --> 02:07:33,376
Is that something the conscience

2597
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:39,008
Last year

2598
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:42,848
Fpi white-collar crime task force

2599
02:07:50,528 --> 02:07:53,856
15 hours a day to find out somewhere to put me in prison

2600
02:07:59,232 --> 02:07:59,744
Away

2601
02:08:00,512 --> 02:08:02,304
Yeah there's no way

2602
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:03,328
Even if

2603
02:08:03,584 --> 02:08:04,864
Obama was can

2604
02:08:07,168 --> 02:08:07,936
There's no way

2605
02:08:08,448 --> 02:08:10,240
They're paying the salary of

2606
02:08:13,056 --> 02:08:16,640
Around the Clock overtime 15 hours a day

2607
02:08:16,896 --> 02:08:18,944
Years trying to bring down before work

2608
02:08:19,968 --> 02:08:25,600
Just give us a couple Grand a month and we'll do it

2609
02:08:27,392 --> 02:08:33,024
Disseminated what he's actually saying that will take him

2610
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:34,560
You think

2611
02:08:35,072 --> 02:08:36,608
He's going to bring himself down

2612
02:08:36,864 --> 02:08:37,376
Everyone

2613
02:08:37,632 --> 02:08:39,936
Everyone knows that Obama wouldn't even f******

2614
02:08:41,728 --> 02:08:43,008
He was a fly on the wall

2615
02:08:44,032 --> 02:08:45,824
So crazy but this is the delusion

2616
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:48,128
This is the manic episode coming out

2617
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:50,176
Someone told him

2618
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:51,968
And he's decided that this guy's credit

2619
02:08:52,736 --> 02:08:54,272
The same way that Leo zagami

2620
02:08:54,784 --> 02:08:57,088
Tell him all this s*** about the Pope in Saigon well

2621
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:59,392
You're on the same page as me I must be right

2622
02:08:59,904 --> 02:09:02,208
Or call or calls in and tell them something becomes gospel

2623
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:04,768
Well you can measure Yourself by the enemies that

2624
02:09:05,024 --> 02:09:05,536
Do you have any

2625
02:09:05,792 --> 02:09:06,816
The president

2626
02:09:07,328 --> 02:09:07,840
Is

2627
02:09:08,096 --> 02:09:08,864
Spending

2628
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:12,704
All of those people all of that man hour

2629
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:14,496
To you that gives you that

2630
02:09:15,264 --> 02:09:16,032
CG

2631
02:09:16,288 --> 02:09:20,128
Is another one of those things

2632
02:09:20,384 --> 02:09:21,152
Listen to his own Legend

2633
02:09:22,432 --> 02:09:24,992
Him feel good so he'll believe

2634
02:09:25,248 --> 02:09:26,784
Communicated on to his audience

2635
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:27,552
Europe

2636
02:09:28,064 --> 02:09:31,136
You're a part of this really dangerous movement

2637
02:09:32,672 --> 02:09:33,184
Call

2638
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:35,232
Like a proud boy

2639
02:09:35,488 --> 02:09:37,024
So he goes on

2640
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:38,560
This is like

2641
02:09:39,072 --> 02:09:40,352
This is delusion

2642
02:09:40,864 --> 02:09:45,216
Launching TV network

2643
02:09:52,384 --> 02:09:52,896
But

2644
02:09:53,664 --> 02:09:58,528
Sing about my forebears

2645
02:09:59,296 --> 02:10:02,368
Thinking about my ancestors in England

2646
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:03,648
I just

2647
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:07,488
Really gut in my spirit understood

2648
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,024
Prostaff

2649
02:10:09,792 --> 02:10:10,816
To their ranks

2650
02:10:12,608 --> 02:10:14,144
That's the most valuable thing in the world

2651
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:17,984
Houses are

2652
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:23,616
Is your Caribbean beaches that the final equation

2653
02:10:23,872 --> 02:10:25,408
You standing up for what's right

2654
02:10:27,968 --> 02:10:29,504
And it is

2655
02:10:30,528 --> 02:10:32,064
Upholding your family name

2656
02:10:33,344 --> 02:10:34,368
Alright whatever

2657
02:10:34,624 --> 02:10:37,184
Like he really thinks he's beginning this hero's journey

2658
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:38,976
He thinks that he is like

2659
02:10:39,744 --> 02:10:41,280
He's wielding Excalibur

2660
02:10:41,536 --> 02:10:44,352
Going on this adventure climbing the stairs to Legend

2661
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:45,888
That's

2662
02:10:46,144 --> 02:10:46,656
Crazy

2663
02:10:47,424 --> 02:10:48,960
Well that's what everybody feels like when they

2664
02:10:49,216 --> 02:10:49,728
They start their own in

2665
02:10:50,752 --> 02:10:53,056
Episode

2666
02:10:53,312 --> 02:10:54,848
We started our own independent

2667
02:10:55,104 --> 02:10:57,408
TV network I think I know exactly how it feel

2668
02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:01,504
Like that I would feel overwhelmed with details

2669
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:03,296
I would feel very nervous

2670
02:11:06,368 --> 02:11:07,392
This is the same thing

2671
02:11:07,648 --> 02:11:08,672
Set a couple months back

2672
02:11:08,928 --> 02:11:11,744
Alex Jones when he had that night long

2673
02:11:13,536 --> 02:11:15,328
Oh yeah that's right

2674
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:17,376
Where we can sort of get a sense

2675
02:11:19,168 --> 02:11:19,680
Goes off

2676
02:11:20,192 --> 02:11:21,216
Reading get these

2677
02:11:21,472 --> 02:11:22,240
Sort of

2678
02:11:22,496 --> 02:11:26,592
It's not exact science and we're diagnosing him and his doctors or is it

2679
02:11:26,848 --> 02:11:27,360
Any Africa

2680
02:11:30,176 --> 02:11:30,944
Discreet

2681
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:32,736
Changes in his brains

2682
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:34,784
And this is

2683
02:11:35,296 --> 02:11:35,808
Hallmark

2684
02:11:36,064 --> 02:11:37,856
This delusions of grandeur

2685
02:11:38,112 --> 02:11:38,624
Pops up

2686
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:39,392
About

2687
02:11:39,648 --> 02:11:40,416
Around

2688
02:11:40,672 --> 02:11:45,280
As best I can tell every 40 days when he was in Europe

2689
02:11:45,536 --> 02:11:49,120
Imma see what happens about 40 days

2690
02:11:51,424 --> 02:11:52,704
When is correct and if so

2691
02:11:53,472 --> 02:11:57,056
If he doesn't have an episode with Ann

2692
02:11:57,312 --> 02:11:58,848
You know about a month or so we know he's pregnant

2693
02:11:59,872 --> 02:12:03,456
Or we just have to calibrate our

2694
02:12:03,712 --> 02:12:06,016
Really comes into the equation

2695
02:12:06,528 --> 02:12:07,552
But

2696
02:12:08,576 --> 02:12:10,880
I'm telling you this is Manish it real hard

2697
02:12:11,904 --> 02:12:13,184
It's bills into this mess

2698
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:13,952
Text Cliff witch

2699
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:19,328
I think Alex Jones is trying out a new red or like rhetorical Style

2700
02:12:19,584 --> 02:12:21,120
A new manner of speaking

2701
02:12:21,376 --> 02:12:22,144
Did I think

2702
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:23,424
Associate

2703
02:12:23,936 --> 02:12:25,984
I would say probably associated with Malcolm X

2704
02:12:26,496 --> 02:12:30,336
I would say that he's probably trying to mirror revolutionary speakers

2705
02:12:31,616 --> 02:12:33,408
Work

2706
02:12:33,664 --> 02:12:34,944
It just doesn't work

2707
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:36,224
YouTube

2708
02:12:39,552 --> 02:12:41,344
Cross the threshold

2709
02:12:41,856 --> 02:12:43,136
Bilderberg

2710
02:12:43,904 --> 02:12:45,696
In 2016

2711
02:12:46,976 --> 02:12:48,000
Richard Holbrooke

2712
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:49,792
When I did it

2713
02:12:50,048 --> 02:12:51,072
I could feel

2714
02:12:51,328 --> 02:12:52,864
I was passing a line

2715
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:53,888
Another level

2716
02:12:55,168 --> 02:12:57,472
Opportunity for freedom

2717
02:12:57,728 --> 02:12:59,008
I love it

2718
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:01,312
I passed other lines as well

2719
02:13:06,432 --> 02:13:07,712
It'll take years to grow

2720
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:14,624
Is only assigned them to remind them

2721
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:16,672
The mint it only reminds them

2722
02:13:18,976 --> 02:13:20,512
And empowered individual

2723
02:13:20,768 --> 02:13:22,048
And I want to bother

2724
02:13:27,168 --> 02:13:29,472
Is the fifth to God but he's also directly quoting

2725
02:13:29,728 --> 02:13:30,240
Himself from Waco

2726
02:13:33,824 --> 02:13:34,592
That is a

2727
02:13:34,848 --> 02:13:35,872
Lime for lime

2728
02:13:36,128 --> 02:13:39,200
His speech in Waking Life

2729
02:13:39,456 --> 02:13:40,480
His past self

2730
02:13:40,736 --> 02:13:42,016
Coming out in his presence

2731
02:13:42,528 --> 02:13:44,320
Which is super weird cuz they're very

2732
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:51,488
We don't cower in fear to the system they can't stand man

2733
02:13:51,744 --> 02:13:55,328
And so what's going on

2734
02:13:55,584 --> 02:14:01,728
Talk about it your coward

2735
02:14:01,984 --> 02:14:05,056
Because oh my gosh

2736
02:14:23,744 --> 02:14:29,888
Peaceful

2737
02:14:34,496 --> 02:14:35,520
Liver cancer

2738
02:14:36,032 --> 02:14:37,312
Cancer of the

2739
02:14:37,568 --> 02:14:42,432
1000%

2740
02:14:43,712 --> 02:14:47,296
Shut off

2741
02:14:47,552 --> 02:14:48,576
Destroyed our culture

2742
02:14:49,344 --> 02:14:51,136
On the news again

2743
02:14:56,256 --> 02:14:59,072
Starbucks

2744
02:15:00,608 --> 02:15:04,192
Libra

2745
02:15:05,984 --> 02:15:09,312
What's a speech pattern

2746
02:15:09,568 --> 02:15:15,712
Alex

2747
02:15:15,968 --> 02:15:18,784
Imagining himself

2748
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:22,624
Delusional

2749
02:15:23,136 --> 02:15:25,440
And he's fighting just complete misused

2750
02:15:25,696 --> 02:15:26,208
Statistics

2751
02:15:28,256 --> 02:15:30,048
Misinterpreting articles

2752
02:15:30,304 --> 02:15:31,328
Mainlining pedophilia

2753
02:15:31,584 --> 02:15:33,120
Everything is a lie

2754
02:15:33,376 --> 02:15:34,400
They've already came for us

2755
02:15:34,656 --> 02:15:37,216
In my bizarre conception where I twist

2756
02:15:38,752 --> 02:15:39,520
So bizarre

2757
02:15:39,776 --> 02:15:40,544
But I love it

2758
02:15:41,056 --> 02:15:43,360
Like in terms of me being an Alex Jones research

2759
02:15:44,128 --> 02:15:44,896
And like

2760
02:15:45,152 --> 02:15:47,200
I love the little things that are interest

2761
02:15:47,968 --> 02:15:48,736
And when Alex Jones

2762
02:15:48,992 --> 02:15:49,504
Ellipsis

2763
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:50,272
Speech pattern like

2764
02:15:51,296 --> 02:15:51,808
That's crazy

2765
02:15:52,576 --> 02:15:53,600
Cuz I've been listening

2766
02:15:53,856 --> 02:15:54,368
2

2767
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:55,392
So much

2768
02:15:55,904 --> 02:15:56,416
Alex Jones

2769
02:15:56,672 --> 02:16:00,512
Yeah never thought

2770
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:02,304
Never talk

2771
02:16:03,328 --> 02:16:04,352
Using these tricks

2772
02:16:04,608 --> 02:16:06,144
Petition

2773
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:09,728
It's almost like Chris Rock like coming back

2774
02:16:09,984 --> 02:16:11,776
This thesis statement

2775
02:16:14,336 --> 02:16:17,152
It's a really powerful

2776
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:23,296
Also is really important

2777
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:25,344
Like that response

2778
02:16:25,856 --> 02:16:30,720
Usually requires

2779
02:16:30,976 --> 02:16:31,744
Some

2780
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:32,768
Preacher

2781
02:16:33,024 --> 02:16:34,048
That repetition

2782
02:16:34,304 --> 02:16:35,072
Allows for people

2783
02:16:37,376 --> 02:16:38,656
Using it as a thesis statement

2784
02:16:38,912 --> 02:16:40,704
Repeat it allows you to reset

2785
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:41,984
But after everybody left

2786
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:44,800
Remind people

2787
02:16:45,056 --> 02:16:50,688
The joke is about what the bigger chunk is about

2788
02:16:50,944 --> 02:16:52,992
Studio

2789
02:16:53,504 --> 02:16:55,552
If you had a caller on the line be better

2790
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:04,512
I think they would be

2791
02:17:09,632 --> 02:17:12,960
Beer do I apologize

2792
02:17:13,216 --> 02:17:16,800
Stalin

2793
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:20,896
Pattern is

2794
02:17:22,688 --> 02:17:23,968
Emotional rather than

2795
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:25,248
Kind of calculated

2796
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:27,552
I think so I think it's

2797
02:17:27,808 --> 02:17:28,832
The spirit got good to him

2798
02:17:29,856 --> 02:17:31,136
Chucktown

2799
02:17:31,392 --> 02:17:34,976
BFDI crashed out

2800
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:40,864
Yeah I've been researching it for two years all this b******* I think that is a lot of that like

2801
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:44,192
The exercise that morning

2802
02:17:44,448 --> 02:17:49,568
So you know you got the testosterone flowing

2803
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:52,640
The dopamine receptor

2804
02:17:52,896 --> 02:17:53,408
Pictures of kicking

2805
02:17:54,944 --> 02:17:58,016
He's at you

2806
02:17:59,296 --> 02:18:00,576
Struggle for me to listen to this

2807
02:18:03,136 --> 02:18:05,952
I recognized so much of myself there and it's like

2808
02:18:07,744 --> 02:18:08,256
Call Yu-Mi

2809
02:18:09,792 --> 02:18:11,072
I know it's

2810
02:18:11,584 --> 02:18:14,912
When you look at him as a human there are things that you're forced to

2811
02:18:15,168 --> 02:18:15,936
Sympathize with

2812
02:18:16,448 --> 02:18:19,520
Did you may not want to put any of his

2813
02:18:19,776 --> 02:18:20,288
Weis

2814
02:18:20,544 --> 02:18:21,312
Or his

2815
02:18:22,848 --> 02:18:24,384
His beliefs that are b*******

2816
02:18:26,688 --> 02:18:28,992
Through all of my manic episodes I have never won

2817
02:18:31,552 --> 02:18:35,648
Vaccines cause autism or Rewritten the Civil War

2818
02:18:35,904 --> 02:18:36,672
The thing about

2819
02:18:36,928 --> 02:18:37,440
Him

2820
02:18:37,696 --> 02:18:38,720
Especially in that little

2821
02:18:41,024 --> 02:18:42,304
He is dehumanizing

2822
02:18:44,096 --> 02:18:46,144
Like they came for us like autism

2823
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:48,704
Punishment like autism is

2824
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:51,520
Like people are still people in the

2825
02:18:51,776 --> 02:18:53,312
Vast majority of them

2826
02:18:58,176 --> 02:18:58,688
They're wonderful

2827
02:19:00,736 --> 02:19:01,504
He hasn't really

2828
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:03,552
Cryptid sort of belief about

2829
02:19:04,064 --> 02:19:05,088
Soft skills and

2830
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:05,856
What have you

2831
02:19:06,112 --> 02:19:08,416
It's not worth it

2832
02:19:08,672 --> 02:19:09,184
Stella

2833
02:19:10,208 --> 02:19:13,024
It's not worth getting into about it

2834
02:19:14,304 --> 02:19:15,072
Just be here all day

2835
02:19:15,328 --> 02:19:17,376
Don't talk about everything

2836
02:19:17,632 --> 02:19:19,936
But be that as it may

2837
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:23,008
Thanks Walter Jones

2838
02:19:25,056 --> 02:19:26,848
Before that he plays

2839
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:28,640
John Boehner speech

2840
02:19:30,176 --> 02:19:32,224
Eagles live to CNN ordo

2841
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:34,272
Discovering

2842
02:19:35,808 --> 02:19:38,112
Does a little bit of a mystery science theater

2843
02:19:38,368 --> 02:19:38,880
Along with it

2844
02:19:40,672 --> 02:19:41,440
That I think is

2845
02:19:42,208 --> 02:19:44,768
Because if you remember.

2846
02:19:45,024 --> 02:19:46,048
Recent

2847
02:19:47,072 --> 02:19:47,584

2848
02:19:48,352 --> 02:19:54,496
Everything

2849
02:19:54,752 --> 02:19:57,056

Kneading

2852
02:20:05,760 --> 02:20:10,112
Awesome sauce

2853
02:20:10,624 --> 02:20:12,672
Oh boy I'm turning into Donald Trump here

Disabled

2858
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:20,352
But

2859
02:20:20,608 --> 02:20:21,632
That is a fly trap

2860
02:20:21,888 --> 02:20:22,400
Mission

2861
02:20:22,912 --> 02:20:23,680

Camelot Morris

2866
02:20:29,312 --> 02:20:30,848
Birches

2867
02:20:32,128 --> 02:20:34,176
We know the inevitable outcome of what happened

2868
02:20:36,992 --> 02:20:37,760
Alex is ego

2869
02:20:38,272 --> 02:20:42,112
So here's another paranoid fantasy videos about

2870
02:20:42,368 --> 02:20:44,928
The government

2871
02:20:45,184 --> 02:20:45,696
Monica cell

2872
02:20:53,888 --> 02:20:55,680
About half of them were completely out of

2873
02:20:56,704 --> 02:20:59,520
Pinterest

2874
02:21:03,360 --> 02:21:04,896
Iraq

2875
02:21:05,408 --> 02:21:10,784
The prosecutor

2876
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:15,648
No criminal record

2877
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:23,328
I couldn't sing

2878
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:25,376
El Amor De Mana

2879
02:21:25,632 --> 02:21:27,680
Sacrifice children or something

2880
02:21:42,528 --> 02:21:43,040
Everything

2881
02:21:48,416 --> 02:21:50,976
Multiple sources

2882
02:22:05,312 --> 02:22:05,824
I don't know

2883
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:07,872
They've got a

2884
02:22:12,480 --> 02:22:13,248
So what

2885
02:22:14,272 --> 02:22:15,040
I'm not afraid

2886
02:22:38,848 --> 02:22:40,128
Friendship

2887
02:22:45,504 --> 02:22:47,040

02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:53,952
They become so much more he's fantasizing that it's going to be another Waco

2890
02:22:54,208 --> 02:22:55,232
Yeah

2891
02:22:55,488 --> 02:22:57,024

2892
02:22:57,280 --> 02:22:57,792
SWAT team

2893
02:22:58,048 --> 02:22:59,328
Of course

2894
02:22:59,584 --> 02:23:04,704
I need for the government last time

2895
02:23:09,824 --> 02:23:13,920
Because he knows that his audience is also very Pro

2896
02:23:14,176 --> 02:23:14,688
Branch Davidian

2897
02:23:14,944 --> 02:23:16,736

Also on the show

2899
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:20,832
Essentially

2900
02:23:21,088 --> 02:23:22,368
He knows that he's

2901
02:23:22,624 --> 02:23:23,904
Leading an anti-government

2902
02:23:24,160 --> 02:23:28,512
Nike comparison to know what I'm doing

2903
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:30,560
George Washington

2904
02:23:30,816 --> 02:23:31,328
Was doing

2905
02:23:31,584 --> 02:23:32,096
Differ

2906
02:23:32,352 --> 02:23:33,120
That sort of things

2907
02:23:34,144 --> 02:23:34,912
Oh boy

2908
02:23:35,168 --> 02:23:35,680
Oh boy

2909
02:23:36,192 --> 02:23:37,216
They're leading a revolution

2910
02:23:41,056 --> 02:23:41,568
That's f***** up

2911
02:23:42,336 --> 02:23:44,128
I think those researchers

2912
02:23:48,736 --> 02:23:54,368
Yep I'm here on inciting violence we can take off early this Friday

2913
02:23:54,624 --> 02:23:58,976

2915
02:24:02,816 --> 02:24:04,608
Episode that's where our

2916
02:24:04,864 --> 02:24:06,400
Third of an owl with this if stuff goes

2917
02:24:06,656 --> 02:24:10,240
I've been remiss in pointing out that every day that we've been covering

2918
02:24:14,336 --> 02:24:15,104
Alex Jones

2919
02:24:15,616 --> 02:24:17,408
So much wild s*** about the Pope

2920
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:18,688
He is making

2921
02:24:18,944 --> 02:24:21,248
Every show the focal point of it is

2922
02:24:21,504 --> 02:24:22,528
Hope is a globalist

2923
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:24,832
He is a demon and

2924
02:24:25,088 --> 02:24:27,904
He claims based on Lord monckton research

2925
02:24:34,048 --> 02:24:35,328
The pope gets his way

2926
02:24:35,584 --> 02:24:37,632
I'm a put in these carbon taxes which

2927
02:24:38,144 --> 02:24:38,656
Nonsense

2928
02:24:39,936 --> 02:24:40,704
The Pope

2929
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:43,520
Is successful a billion people will die

2930
02:24:44,288 --> 02:24:46,080
Based on Lord mountains analysis

2931
02:24:46,336 --> 02:24:47,360
Do like I do believe

2932
02:24:47,872 --> 02:24:48,384
Any of these

2933
02:24:48,896 --> 02:24:50,176
Any of the Little parts

2934
02:24:50,432 --> 02:24:50,944
RMS

2935
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:53,248
Can you bring it into a hole is a huge

2936
02:24:53,504 --> 02:24:54,016
If they

2937
02:24:55,808 --> 02:24:56,832
If they implemented

2938
02:24:57,088 --> 02:24:57,600
Carpenter

2939
02:24:58,112 --> 02:24:58,624
Sprite

2940
02:24:58,880 --> 02:24:59,904
A billion people

2941
02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:02,208
That's some Big Mac

2942
02:25:02,464 --> 02:25:03,744
Lord monckton is good at math

2943
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:05,536
May have carried a one

2944
02:25:05,792 --> 02:25:06,304
Hear the Lord

2945
02:25:06,560 --> 02:25:11,424
Mariah Carey 21 wrong my point is that Alex Jones is for a week been sitting on the Pope

2946
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:13,216

2947
02:25:13,472 --> 02:25:18,336
Is it just is it just for like shock or just like

2948
02:25:18,848 --> 02:25:19,872
To talk about

2949
02:25:20,128 --> 02:25:23,456
Hotel

2950
02:25:26,272 --> 02:25:32,416
It's cuz they can't possibly care that much about the f****** fault because the pope has said that we have an obligation to care for the poor

2951
02:25:32,928 --> 02:25:34,720
And the nothing pisses off

2952
02:25:34,976 --> 02:25:37,792
People more than that fleeing

2953
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:39,328
Certain

2954
02:25:39,584 --> 02:25:41,376
We have an obligation to help them

2955
02:25:42,400 --> 02:25:43,168
He has ads

2956
02:25:43,424 --> 02:25:43,936
Vacated

2957
02:25:44,192 --> 02:25:46,240
Four positions like

2958
02:25:47,264 --> 02:25:49,824
He believes in One World Government open borders

2959
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:51,616
All this stuff

2960
02:25:52,128 --> 02:25:53,664
A focal head of globalism

2961
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:54,944
He's like a globalist

2962
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:55,712
God

2963
02:25:56,736 --> 02:25:58,016
Conception

2964
02:25:58,272 --> 02:26:00,576
Everything back to

2965
02:26:00,832 --> 02:26:02,624
To the pope like all of his narrative

2966
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:03,904
Can all be thrown

2967
02:26:04,672 --> 02:26:05,440
Somewhat

2968
02:26:05,696 --> 02:26:06,976
On the

2969
02:26:07,232 --> 02:26:08,512
Actual true

2970
02:26:08,768 --> 02:26:10,304
History of child abuse

2971
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:11,072
That exist

2972
02:26:11,328 --> 02:26:12,096
Within the Vatican

2973
02:26:14,144 --> 02:26:15,168
And Leo zagami

2974
02:26:15,424 --> 02:26:16,192
Of course

2975
02:26:16,448 --> 02:26:18,752
It says that that is the case

2976
02:26:19,008 --> 02:26:21,312
Has become installed at Pope

2977
02:26:21,568 --> 02:26:22,592
Because he has pet

2978
02:26:22,848 --> 02:26:26,432
A pedophile blackmail on everybody

2979
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:28,736
Listen to this clip

2980
02:26:29,248 --> 02:26:31,296
From September twenty

2981
02:26:31,552 --> 02:26:32,320
Let's for Sunday

2982
02:26:33,088 --> 02:26:35,904
The rest of the Sunday show is unknowable

2983
02:26:36,416 --> 02:26:37,696
It's a bunch of

2984
02:26:38,208 --> 02:26:38,976
How to talk about Lord locked

2985
02:26:39,488 --> 02:26:41,024
David Jackson

2986
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:42,048
Make a little pop-up

2987
02:26:42,304 --> 02:26:42,816
Appearance

2988
02:26:43,072 --> 02:26:44,096
And

2989
02:26:45,376 --> 02:26:46,912
World

2990
02:26:47,168 --> 02:26:50,240
Tallest tree might as well be quite frankly

2991
02:26:50,752 --> 02:26:54,848
Might as well be David analysis on the road

2992
02:26:55,360 --> 02:26:56,128
Alex Jones

2993
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:57,664
Talks about George sir

2994
02:26:58,176 --> 02:27:00,480
About how I

2995
02:27:00,992 --> 02:27:03,552
Hey everyone says you know he would have been killed by the Nazis

2996
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:04,832
I like hey

2997
02:27:05,344 --> 02:27:07,904
If I were in that position I actually pulled the trigger man

2998
02:27:08,416 --> 02:27:10,208
I'd like to be very unfair

2999
02:27:10,464 --> 02:27:13,280
Even even that is recognizing

3000
02:27:15,584 --> 02:27:16,352
During the Holocaust

3001
02:27:17,632 --> 02:27:18,656
George Soros

3002
02:27:18,912 --> 02:27:20,192
Had no ability

3003
02:27:20,448 --> 02:27:21,728
To Buck the cyst

3004
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:23,776
At all Alex Jones

3005
02:27:24,032 --> 02:27:24,544
Hypnotizing

3006
02:27:25,312 --> 02:27:27,616
And he's still lying about what George Soros

3007
02:27:27,872 --> 02:27:31,456
Did cuz he still saying that he rounded up Jews and stuff like that would

3008
02:27:31,968 --> 02:27:32,736
Absolutely didn't

3009
02:27:33,248 --> 02:27:34,272
He bases all this on the

3010
02:27:34,528 --> 02:27:36,832
60 Minutes interview that has nothing to do

3011
02:27:37,856 --> 02:27:38,368
It's all bulshit

3012
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:40,672
But I think it's particularly

3013
02:27:40,928 --> 02:27:42,464
Disgusting did he recognize

3014
02:27:44,256 --> 02:27:45,280
George Soros

3015
02:27:45,536 --> 02:27:46,560
To do anything out of line

3016
02:27:47,072 --> 02:27:48,608
P****

3017
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:49,888
I would have

3018
02:27:50,400 --> 02:27:51,168
Yeah alright

3019
02:27:51,424 --> 02:27:52,192
You're a liar

3020
02:27:52,448 --> 02:27:52,960
First of all

3021
02:27:53,216 --> 02:27:53,728
A second ball

3022
02:27:54,752 --> 02:27:57,056
How dare you insult someone's decision

3023
02:27:57,312 --> 02:27:58,848
If that kind of a situation

3024
02:27:59,104 --> 02:28:00,896
The only way you can do that is if you

3025
02:28:01,152 --> 02:28:02,688
Trying to deny the Holocaust

3026
02:28:02,944 --> 02:28:05,504
And it was mostly about Jews didn't pay rent

3027
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:06,272
Yeah

3028
02:28:06,528 --> 02:28:07,808
That's really the only way you can do that

3029
02:28:09,344 --> 02:28:10,368
The f****** horrible person

3030
02:28:11,392 --> 02:28:11,904
Anyway

3031
02:28:12,416 --> 02:28:13,184
This clip

3032
02:28:13,440 --> 02:28:14,208
From the show

3033
02:28:14,464 --> 02:28:16,256
Is an interview with a guy named

3034
02:28:16,512 --> 02:28:17,280
Joe Bannister

3035
02:28:19,584 --> 02:28:22,912
Alex presents him as a guy who the Government tried to shut down

3036
02:28:24,192 --> 02:28:27,008
I don't know his whole history I don't really care it's not important

3037
02:28:27,264 --> 02:28:28,288
2 what's going on

3038
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:30,080
The two of them have an interview

3039
02:28:30,336 --> 02:28:30,848
And

3040
02:28:32,128 --> 02:28:32,640
The pope comes

3041
02:28:33,664 --> 02:28:34,688
Joe Bannister

3042
02:28:34,944 --> 02:28:35,968
Pretty decent argument

3043
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:37,504
A pretty decent position

3044
02:28:38,016 --> 02:28:38,784
Imallexx make

3045
02:28:39,296 --> 02:28:40,576
Incredibly startling admission

3046
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,048
Born

3047
02:28:51,584 --> 02:28:57,728
It's not about these other matters

3048
02:28:57,984 --> 02:29:00,288
Call Prudential

3049
02:29:01,824 --> 02:29:02,592
To determine

3050
02:29:04,896 --> 02:29:06,944
And the most

3051
02:29:10,272 --> 02:29:16,416
Maybe the media

3052
02:29:16,672 --> 02:29:22,816
Overall

3053
02:29:24,352 --> 02:29:28,704
He just straight-up admitted he doesn't know anything about the Pope

3054
02:29:29,216 --> 02:29:33,824
All he knows is stories that he's read and as we've clearly

3055
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:36,640
He has a f****** bad media diet

3056
02:29:36,896 --> 02:29:39,712
He reads stories on Breitbart zerohedge

3057
02:29:39,968 --> 02:29:42,272
And pro-russian propaganda site

3058
02:29:42,528 --> 02:29:43,552
That are critical of the

3059
02:29:43,808 --> 02:29:46,368
The pope and these One World Government stamp

3060
02:29:47,904 --> 02:29:49,184
I'm shiting on the Pope

3061
02:29:49,440 --> 02:29:50,464
Culminate

3062
02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:51,488
With him being like

3063
02:29:51,744 --> 02:29:53,792
Well maybe the media taking about a contact

3064
02:29:54,048 --> 02:29:59,936
Text you f****** do f****** a****** you're the worst

3065
02:30:00,192 --> 02:30:01,216
Hey better-late-than-never

3066
02:30:06,592 --> 02:30:10,432
Fight

3067
02:30:10,688 --> 02:30:12,992
So terrible

3068
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:14,528
So if you think

3069
02:30:17,344 --> 02:30:17,856
You're wrong

3070
02:30:19,648 --> 02:30:22,720
Because that was Sunday and now our last day the investigation

3071
02:30:22,976 --> 02:30:23,488
The 28th

3072
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:25,536
Choices back on his b*******

3073
02:30:25,792 --> 02:30:28,096
Adventure

3074
02:30:28,352 --> 02:30:29,376
Because he has found

3075
02:30:29,632 --> 02:30:35,776
A kernel of something he can get mad at

3076
02:30:36,032 --> 02:30:36,544
A show on Monday

3077
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:49,344
Failed on the cross

3078
02:30:54,208 --> 02:30:56,256
Forgive us of our sins the ultimate

3079
02:30:56,512 --> 02:31:00,608
Is Sean an echo

3080
02:31:01,120 --> 02:31:03,424
Abraham about to sacrifice his son

3081
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:05,472
But God following through on

3082
02:31:05,728 --> 02:31:10,848
Let's roll grandloves Taylor

3083
02:31:19,296 --> 02:31:22,368
Motorola

3084
02:31:23,904 --> 02:31:25,696
Produce fruit

3085
02:31:25,952 --> 02:31:28,256
Kevin Coronavirus

3086
02:31:28,768 --> 02:31:31,840
Primo's Akatsuki

3087
02:31:32,096 --> 02:31:33,376
Jesus Christ

3088
02:31:36,192 --> 02:31:37,472
Humanly speaking

3089
02:31:54,880 --> 02:31:56,160
So

3090
02:31:56,416 --> 02:31:56,928
So

3091
02:31:57,696 --> 02:31:58,208
So dumb

3092
02:31:58,720 --> 02:31:59,232
So dumb

3093
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:00,768
What are you saying

3094
02:32:01,024 --> 02:32:02,560
Is on a human level

3095
02:32:03,072 --> 02:32:03,584
He failed

3096
02:32:04,096 --> 02:32:04,864
That's Def

3097
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:05,888
Death is a failure

3098
02:32:11,776 --> 02:32:14,848
Exactly

3099
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:19,456
The or whatever

3100
02:32:20,992 --> 02:32:21,504
Guys

3101
02:32:22,528 --> 02:32:24,576
I thought this was going to end up different

3102
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:27,392
But like

3103
02:32:27,904 --> 02:32:29,696
It's the point that the pope is trying

3104
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:31,232
Super opt

3105
02:32:32,256 --> 02:32:33,024
His

3106
02:32:33,536 --> 02:32:36,096
Often times we get discouraged by not seeing

3107
02:32:36,352 --> 02:32:38,400
The results of our actions

3108
02:32:38,656 --> 02:32:39,168
The human plane

3109
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:40,448
Anne Wheaton

3110
02:32:40,704 --> 02:32:42,240
Like the times of Our Lives

3111
02:32:42,496 --> 02:32:43,520
You may not see that

3112
02:32:43,776 --> 02:32:46,336
Cross is a failure on human terms

3113
02:32:46,848 --> 02:32:47,360
But it's not

3114
02:32:48,128 --> 02:32:48,640
In general

3115
02:32:48,896 --> 02:32:49,664
Exactly

3116
02:32:49,920 --> 02:32:51,712
Everyone f****** knows that's what he saying

3117
02:32:52,224 --> 02:32:52,736
But

3118
02:32:54,016 --> 02:32:54,528
This

3119
02:32:54,784 --> 02:32:55,296
Is

3120
02:32:55,808 --> 02:32:56,320
Crucial

3121
02:32:57,088 --> 02:32:58,112
Alex has this

3122
02:32:59,392 --> 02:33:02,976
Believe that

3123
02:33:03,488 --> 02:33:05,024
It was the greatest

3124
02:33:06,304 --> 02:33:07,840
And it's full quote is very

3125
02:33:08,352 --> 02:33:09,376
Yeah do you get it

3126
02:33:10,144 --> 02:33:10,912
Uwiteka

3127
02:33:11,168 --> 02:33:13,472
Is the term that use or Jesuit Oregon

3128
02:33:14,240 --> 02:33:16,544
Hillary says she runs her life according to

3129
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:18,336
Georgetown

3130
02:33:20,128 --> 02:33:24,736
Where you could get what he saying that Christ physically was killed but

3131
02:33:25,504 --> 02:33:26,528
Twisted

3132
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:28,576
Double meaning

3133
02:33:29,344 --> 02:33:29,856
This

3134
02:33:30,368 --> 02:33:31,392
Is the underpinning

3135
02:33:31,648 --> 02:33:32,928
Of the entire world

3136
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:33,952
Alex Jones

3137
02:33:34,208 --> 02:33:34,720
The spouses

3138
02:33:35,744 --> 02:33:36,768
There's double meaning

3139
02:33:37,024 --> 02:33:37,536
Everything

3140
02:33:38,304 --> 02:33:39,328
I'm not stupid

3141
02:33:39,584 --> 02:33:41,376
And misinterpreting clear statements

3142
02:33:41,632 --> 02:33:42,144
The people make

3143
02:33:42,656 --> 02:33:43,936
They're using doubles

3144
02:33:44,704 --> 02:33:46,752
So that's why he can go to

3145
02:33:47,008 --> 02:33:48,288
John Pierre

3146
02:33:48,544 --> 02:33:49,824
Book about a cosigner

3147
02:33:50,336 --> 02:33:51,104
Any can say

3148
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:52,896
He's using doublespeak

3149
02:33:53,152 --> 02:33:55,456
You think that they're putting stuff in the water

3150
02:33:55,712 --> 02:33:56,480
Not in the text

3151
02:33:56,736 --> 02:33:57,248
At all

3152
02:33:57,504 --> 02:33:59,296
That is not what

3153
02:33:59,808 --> 02:34:00,576
Because Alex Jones

3154
02:34:01,088 --> 02:34:01,600
Conception

3155
02:34:01,856 --> 02:34:03,392
The Deep

3156
02:34:03,648 --> 02:34:04,416
Is the double talk

3157
02:34:04,672 --> 02:34:05,952
Everything is cold

3158
02:34:06,976 --> 02:34:13,120
He can just say that anybody is asserting either what they're saying or the opposite of what they're saying or something in-between

3159
02:34:13,376 --> 02:34:15,168
You can just make up meaning for anything

3160
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:16,704
Yeah this is the problem

3161
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:20,544
Little big problems the big problem I like it when words mean

3162
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:24,896
Stuff like that

3163
02:34:25,152 --> 02:34:25,920
Purple Penguin

3164
02:34:26,176 --> 02:34:29,248
No no

3165
02:34:29,504 --> 02:34:33,856
To when he says they're trying to outlaw mother and father met

3166
02:34:34,112 --> 02:34:34,880
Boy and girl

3167
02:34:35,392 --> 02:34:36,672
There is no evidence of that

3168
02:34:36,928 --> 02:34:39,232
There's nothing in any story

3169
02:34:39,488 --> 02:34:40,000
That is

3170
02:34:40,256 --> 02:34:41,280
Has any credibility

3171
02:34:41,792 --> 02:34:43,584
That that is what people want

3172
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:44,608
But because he

3173
02:34:44,864 --> 02:34:46,144
The double-talk

3174
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:48,960
He sees the doublespeak the people are doing

3175
02:34:49,216 --> 02:34:49,984
You can see

3176
02:34:50,496 --> 02:34:52,288
Transgender Advocate saying

3177
02:34:52,544 --> 02:34:54,848
Hey let's not jump to things that don't need to be gendered

3178
02:34:59,712 --> 02:35:01,504
Doublespeak that I see

3179
02:35:02,016 --> 02:35:03,552
It's like no dude your brains in

3180
02:35:04,320 --> 02:35:05,856
You have your f***** up

3181
02:35:06,368 --> 02:35:07,904
You see things that aren't there

3182
02:35:08,160 --> 02:35:08,928
You're fighting ghosts

3183
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:12,512
There's a globalist cabal that you've imagined in your head

3184
02:35:12,768 --> 02:35:14,560
Bulshit you read when you were

3185
02:35:14,816 --> 02:35:15,840
The f****** too young under

3186
02:35:16,096 --> 02:35:17,632
Understand how the world works

3187
02:35:17,888 --> 02:35:24,032
And your functioning often is a forty-year-old man you've created a system wherein oh everything doesn't

3188
02:35:24,288 --> 02:35:26,848
Mean what it means means whatever I want it to mean

3189
02:35:27,104 --> 02:35:30,688
And you're making billions of dollars f****** lying to people about it you should

3190
02:35:30,944 --> 02:35:32,224
Ashamed of yourself

3191
02:35:32,736 --> 02:35:33,248
Anyway

3192
02:35:41,184 --> 02:35:42,464
Sit here and breathe and then I think

3193
02:35:43,232 --> 02:35:49,376
It feels so good at this what Dan feels like when I go yell

3194
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:58,080
Control

3195
02:35:59,360 --> 02:36:01,152
I f*** it I know that's what he'd

3196
02:36:01,664 --> 02:36:06,272
Service of demonizing

3197
02:36:06,528 --> 02:36:07,552
A already

3198
02:36:07,808 --> 02:36:11,904
On the display.

3199
02:36:12,160 --> 02:36:13,184
It's so

3200
02:36:13,952 --> 02:36:14,720
So manipulative

3201
02:36:16,256 --> 02:36:17,792
It is right back to

3202
02:36:18,048 --> 02:36:18,560
Projection

3203
02:36:19,584 --> 02:36:20,096
You are

3204
02:36:20,352 --> 02:36:21,376
You are mad at him

3205
02:36:21,632 --> 02:36:27,776
Because you live in a world where that's what you do so if you do that obviously

3206
02:36:28,032 --> 02:36:29,056
The people you are fighting against

3207
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:34,688
Same level of

3208
02:36:34,944 --> 02:36:35,968
Hopelessness in like

3209
02:36:36,224 --> 02:36:38,016
How do you speak to somebody

3210
02:36:40,576 --> 02:36:42,112
You don't hopefully you educate

3211
02:36:43,904 --> 02:36:49,280
Who is you like

3212
02:36:49,536 --> 02:36:51,072
Take us to Publix

3213
02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:53,632
Smart

3214
02:36:54,912 --> 02:36:57,472
Those are things that aren't

3215
02:36:57,728 --> 02:37:01,312
Really well handled by the result orientated

3216
02:37:01,824 --> 02:37:02,336
Standardized

3217
02:37:02,592 --> 02:37:04,128
Testing oriented Public School

3218
02:37:04,384 --> 02:37:04,896
But I think

3219
02:37:05,152 --> 02:37:07,968
If you gave people a handle on logic Young

3220
02:37:08,224 --> 02:37:09,760
It would really enable them

3221
02:37:10,016 --> 02:37:11,296
To understand arguments

3222
02:37:11,552 --> 02:37:13,344
It would really help them

3223
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:14,112
Decipherable

3224
02:37:22,048 --> 02:37:23,328
That is not what they wanted

3225
02:37:24,864 --> 02:37:25,888
What we should do is

3226
02:37:28,704 --> 02:37:29,728
We should look

3227
02:37:29,984 --> 02:37:31,520
We should Outlaw mothers and fathers

3228
02:37:32,032 --> 02:37:33,312
Cuz they're the root cause

3229
02:37:33,568 --> 02:37:37,408
Like if Alex Jones didn't have a mother or father we wouldn't have Alex Jones

3230
02:37:37,664 --> 02:37:43,808
Finally rich

3231
02:37:44,064 --> 02:37:47,392
I don't even like genders I don't get rid of mother and father

3232
02:37:47,648 --> 02:37:49,440
Parents

3233
02:37:49,696 --> 02:37:55,840
And I think we should let the children at 5

3234
02:37:56,096 --> 02:37:56,608
Really this is what

3235
02:37:57,120 --> 02:37:57,888
Pittsburgh perfect

3236
02:37:59,168 --> 02:37:59,936
I mean earrings

3237
02:38:00,192 --> 02:38:02,752
Satirical

3238
02:38:03,008 --> 02:38:03,520
Alex Jones

3239
02:38:03,776 --> 02:38:05,824
Is just to do what Alex Jones is afraid

3240
02:38:06,080 --> 02:38:08,896
Absolutely not no

3241
02:38:10,944 --> 02:38:13,760
The other thing the reason I included a rhetoric

3242
02:38:14,016 --> 02:38:14,528
Back in there

3243
02:38:14,784 --> 02:38:16,832
With what I want them to be

3244
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:19,392
Is it was a part of classical education

3245
02:38:20,416 --> 02:38:21,696
Rhetorical devices

3246
02:38:22,208 --> 02:38:24,256
Skills abilities

3247
02:38:24,512 --> 02:38:26,048
It's something that people should study

3248
02:38:26,304 --> 02:38:27,072
Because

3249
02:38:27,328 --> 02:38:28,864
It enables you to tell

3250
02:38:29,120 --> 02:38:30,144
Much like when we

3251
02:38:30,912 --> 02:38:31,424
Fury

3252
02:38:31,680 --> 02:38:33,216
Obviously able to tell

3253
02:38:33,472 --> 02:38:35,264
Two things on this episode based on studying

3254
02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:36,032
Rhetoric

3255
02:38:36,288 --> 02:38:36,800
1

3256
02:38:37,056 --> 02:38:38,592
Whatever Alex jump does one of those

3257
02:38:38,848 --> 02:38:40,896
Right

3258
02:38:42,176 --> 02:38:42,688
Second

3259
02:38:45,248 --> 02:38:48,320
Impression you can tell that something's going on

3260
02:38:48,832 --> 02:38:51,648
You can tell that he's full of s*** and probably in a weird

3261
02:38:51,904 --> 02:38:53,440
Because you know his rhetoric

3262
02:38:53,952 --> 02:38:54,464
You know the

3263
02:38:54,720 --> 02:38:56,000
The tools that he employed

3264
02:38:56,512 --> 02:38:57,280
Help students

3265
02:38:57,792 --> 02:38:59,328
In primary education

3266
02:39:01,376 --> 02:39:04,448
You'd be much more able to see a politician to be like

3267
02:39:05,728 --> 02:39:06,752
I know what you're doing

3268
02:39:07,008 --> 02:39:07,776
Your

3269
02:39:08,032 --> 02:39:08,800
What about it

3270
02:39:09,056 --> 02:39:11,360
Or your other

3271
02:39:11,616 --> 02:39:13,152
Standard trick

3272
02:39:13,408 --> 02:39:14,688
The democratic-republican

3273
02:39:16,736 --> 02:39:19,040
It's exactly what you're saying the people who knows

3274
02:39:19,552 --> 02:39:20,576
Who are top

3275
02:39:21,344 --> 02:39:22,880
Are using it against people who

3276
02:39:23,136 --> 02:39:26,208
Right that's why you that's what it is

3277
02:39:26,464 --> 02:39:29,280
The worst problem people in the world are people who took the bait class

3278
02:39:33,376 --> 02:39:35,424
Essentially hypnotize people with their language

3279
02:39:35,680 --> 02:39:38,752
Do you like neuro-linguistic programming type trick

3280
02:39:39,008 --> 02:39:40,288
And then on top of that just

3281
02:39:41,824 --> 02:39:43,104
It's do so many

3282
02:39:44,128 --> 02:39:44,640
Two arguments

3283
02:39:44,896 --> 02:39:47,200
Like if you're if you get into an argument

3284
02:39:47,456 --> 02:39:49,248
With someone like a Paul Joseph Watson

3285
02:39:49,504 --> 02:39:50,528
Or and Alex Jones

3286
02:39:50,784 --> 02:39:51,296
They have

3287
02:39:51,552 --> 02:39:53,088
So many tricks at their disposal

3288
02:39:53,344 --> 02:39:54,880
If you confront them with

3289
02:39:55,136 --> 02:39:56,416
Hey you think

3290
02:39:57,440 --> 02:40:00,768
Everybody saying two things when they're saying

3291
02:40:01,024 --> 02:40:03,328
Which one you want to believe is what they mean

3292
02:40:03,584 --> 02:40:04,096
And you can

3293
02:40:04,352 --> 02:40:05,376
Bring up examples

3294
02:40:05,888 --> 02:40:07,680
Forgot to turn it on to like what

3295
02:40:08,192 --> 02:40:11,008
Yeah exactly

3296
02:40:11,520 --> 02:40:13,312
And if you want rest and rhetoric and logic

3297
02:40:13,568 --> 02:40:15,104
There are ways that you can

3298
02:40:15,360 --> 02:40:16,384
Shut that s*** down

3299
02:40:16,640 --> 02:40:22,272
Or at least recognized

3300
02:40:22,528 --> 02:40:23,296
Something else

3301
02:40:23,552 --> 02:40:25,344
Education is obviously the

3302
02:40:26,624 --> 02:40:28,160
Now

3303
02:40:28,416 --> 02:40:29,184
Isn't too

3304
02:40:29,440 --> 02:40:30,464
Stop Alex Jones

3305
02:40:30,976 --> 02:40:32,000
To stop you being

3306
02:40:35,584 --> 02:40:36,352
Yeah cernovich

3307
02:40:36,864 --> 02:40:37,888
SOB X all the map

3308
02:40:41,728 --> 02:40:42,496
To deceive you

3309
02:40:43,008 --> 02:40:44,544
If you know how to do

3310
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:45,312
Deceive people

3311
02:40:45,824 --> 02:40:46,848
You're going to be better at

3312
02:40:47,104 --> 02:40:47,872
Something it out

3313
02:40:48,896 --> 02:40:51,200
Like be clear all of the

3314
02:40:52,224 --> 02:40:54,016
A problem now

3315
02:40:54,272 --> 02:40:55,808
Word problems

3316
02:40:56,576 --> 02:41:00,416
Like Jekyll sobiech wasn't really in the mainstream no one really knew who he was

3317
02:41:00,672 --> 02:41:02,976
Or anything like that five years ago

3318
02:41:03,232 --> 02:41:03,744
He is a mess

3319
02:41:05,792 --> 02:41:08,864
Cernovich was involved with gamergate stuff and s*** like that but

3320
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:10,400
Before that he wasn't really

3321
02:41:10,656 --> 02:41:12,192
A notable prominent problem

3322
02:41:12,704 --> 02:41:14,752
25 years from now there's going to be other a******

3323
02:41:15,520 --> 02:41:16,544
And if you jump

3324
02:41:16,800 --> 02:41:17,568
Use the

3325
02:41:18,080 --> 02:41:20,640
I'm awareness you can have about Alex

3326
02:41:20,896 --> 02:41:21,920
Mike cernovich

3327
02:41:22,176 --> 02:41:26,272
The next time around you won't be tricked by his b*******

3328
02:41:26,528 --> 02:41:28,064
Whoever the next version of rags

3329
02:41:28,576 --> 02:41:29,856
And that is what I would hope to

3330
02:41:30,112 --> 02:41:30,624
To see in the world

3331
02:41:30,880 --> 02:41:31,392
And I don't

3332
02:41:31,648 --> 02:41:32,160
Think we're going to

3333
02:41:36,256 --> 02:41:37,792
Yeah

3334
02:41:38,048 --> 02:41:39,328
Probably

3335
02:41:39,584 --> 02:41:41,888
That's really what it is

3336
02:41:43,680 --> 02:41:45,984
Eclipse we have cover

3337
02:41:46,496 --> 02:41:49,056
And I will say that they're just good

3338
02:41:49,824 --> 02:41:52,640
With the exception of the last one which is an update on Trump

3339
02:41:52,896 --> 02:41:56,480
But here is Alex Jones respond

3340
02:41:56,992 --> 02:41:57,504
Space news

3341
02:41:57,760 --> 02:41:58,528
Excellent

3342
02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:02,880
Spaceman we have Mastiff

3343
02:42:06,208 --> 02:42:08,000
On Mars during the summer

3344
02:42:09,280 --> 02:42:10,560
Mars and extremely happy

3345
02:42:11,328 --> 02:42:11,840
What

3346
02:42:12,096 --> 02:42:15,168
Mars is extremely happy

3347
02:42:15,424 --> 02:42:17,472
No

3348
02:42:17,728 --> 02:42:18,752
That's why I

3349
02:42:19,008 --> 02:42:19,520
Right

3350
02:42:19,776 --> 02:42:20,288
Make them work

3351
02:42:20,544 --> 02:42:21,824
Slaves on Mars

3352
02:42:22,080 --> 02:42:22,592
Brinkley

3353
02:42:23,104 --> 02:42:24,384
You know what I

3354
02:42:25,664 --> 02:42:26,176
2 habits

3355
02:42:28,480 --> 02:42:32,320
What is the main problem

3356
02:42:32,576 --> 02:42:35,392
With this idea that

3357
02:42:35,904 --> 02:42:37,184
That Mars is habitable

3358
02:42:37,696 --> 02:42:39,488
Why is there's not really much

3359
02:42:42,304 --> 02:42:45,376
It really was a problem

3360
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:53,824
I think even if you have to have s*** to work with

3361
02:42:54,080 --> 02:42:54,848
A content

3362
02:42:55,104 --> 02:42:56,384
And on Mars

3363
02:42:56,640 --> 02:42:57,152
Is oxygen

3364
02:42:57,408 --> 02:42:57,920
.1

3365
02:42:58,176 --> 02:42:58,688
34C

3366
02:42:58,944 --> 02:43:00,480
Enough

3367
02:43:00,736 --> 02:43:04,064
That doesn't seem like enough it's really pretty much all carbon dioxide

3368
02:43:04,320 --> 02:43:05,344
Richard Kill Everybody

3369
02:43:07,904 --> 02:43:09,696
But now that's how it works

3370
02:43:13,280 --> 02:43:14,304
I breathe air

3371
02:43:14,560 --> 02:43:16,608
You bring a couple of plants with you to Mars

3372
02:43:16,864 --> 02:43:18,912
You're good that's actually automatic

3373
02:43:19,168 --> 02:43:21,472
Scale not a terrible idea

3374
02:43:21,728 --> 02:43:23,264
That terraforming

3375
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:29,664
What's wrong there is water there is a history of flowing Waters like millions of years ago

3376
02:43:32,736 --> 02:43:35,808
So dumb but he's really dumb stuff about space

3377
02:43:36,832 --> 02:43:37,856
Here is another one

3378
02:43:38,368 --> 02:43:39,648
This is Alex Jones

3379
02:43:40,416 --> 02:43:42,976
Accidentally walking movie was it Mission to Mars

3380
02:43:43,232 --> 02:43:47,584
Don Cheadle go to space

3381
02:43:48,096 --> 02:43:50,144
And Gary Sinise joins the Martian

3382
02:43:50,400 --> 02:43:51,168
It's a whole thing

3383
02:43:51,424 --> 02:43:52,448
I don't remember left

3384
02:43:52,704 --> 02:43:57,056
Signals behind for us to follow I don't remember but I do know that Syfy is just

3385
02:43:57,312 --> 02:43:57,824
The dreams of May

3386
02:43:59,616 --> 02:44:00,128
So

3387
02:44:03,456 --> 02:44:07,296
The nightmares are creative

3388
02:44:07,552 --> 02:44:09,344
Astral projection

3389
02:44:09,600 --> 02:44:12,160
That's good

3390
02:44:12,416 --> 02:44:12,928
Alex Jones

3391
02:44:13,184 --> 02:44:16,768
Accidentally walked into my backyard and I miss you

3392
02:44:17,024 --> 02:44:19,840
I'm going to tell him to get out of that backyard here in a second

3393
02:44:20,352 --> 02:44:23,424
Mars atmosphere

3394
02:44:25,984 --> 02:44:27,008
Amazing

3395
02:44:29,568 --> 02:44:32,384
Oceans

3396
02:44:33,920 --> 02:44:35,200
Bostitch atmosphere

3397
02:44:43,392 --> 02:44:49,536
There was a connection to Mars

3398
02:44:49,792 --> 02:44:54,656
Atmosphere

3399
02:44:54,912 --> 02:44:56,192
Now it's coming true

3400
02:44:56,448 --> 02:45:02,592
The Ancients said it now it's coming through 90

3401
02:45:03,360 --> 02:45:04,128
That's not inflate

3402
02:45:05,664 --> 02:45:06,432
Barth look

3403
02:45:06,688 --> 02:45:09,504
Atlantis lost its atmosphere

3404
02:45:13,344 --> 02:45:15,136
And then Mars lost its atmosphere

3405
02:45:15,904 --> 02:45:17,440
Simultaneously I don't know

3406
02:45:17,696 --> 02:45:18,720
Listen here's the day

3407
02:45:18,976 --> 02:45:22,816
What is the deal little bit in the past

3408
02:45:27,168 --> 02:45:30,496
Plato talks about it and tomatoes and critias the two dialogues

3409
02:45:30,752 --> 02:45:33,056
It doesn't say anything about f****** Mars at all

3410
02:45:33,568 --> 02:45:34,080
It's that

3411
02:45:35,360 --> 02:45:36,128
Made up by Alex

3412
02:45:37,152 --> 02:45:39,968
. I'll get to that in a second

3413
02:45:40,480 --> 02:45:42,016
Jesus Christ

3414
02:45:42,272 --> 02:45:43,296
Pseudoscience

3415
02:45:44,320 --> 02:45:46,624
Edgar Cayce types

3416
02:45:46,880 --> 02:45:51,488
Ragozzino's if he's like all

3417
02:45:56,352 --> 02:45:57,632
On Atlantis and Mars

3418
02:45:57,888 --> 02:46:01,984
If you did that are going to be like oh s*** you're into new AG bulshit

3419
02:46:02,752 --> 02:46:03,775
Instead he claims

3420
02:46:04,031 --> 02:46:07,103
That what those were saying is what Plato was saying

3421
02:46:07,359 --> 02:46:10,687
Is there an error

3422
02:46:10,943 --> 02:46:12,223
Variety

3423
02:46:13,247 --> 02:46:16,063
DIY playdough

3424
02:46:16,319 --> 02:46:17,599
I have to do with Poseidon

3425
02:46:18,111 --> 02:46:21,439
Poseidon was the king of Atlantis and his offspring

3426
02:46:21,695 --> 02:46:26,559
Where the reason about Mars and Play-Doh

3427
02:46:27,071 --> 02:46:31,167
You are talking wrong because they're speaking more about the guy

3428
02:46:31,423 --> 02:46:34,495
Mars the Roman

3429
02:46:34,751 --> 02:46:37,823
Deliberately confusing

3430
02:46:39,359 --> 02:46:39,871
No

3431
02:46:40,127 --> 02:46:43,711
What are you doing is using like some of this very

3432
02:46:44,223 --> 02:46:45,759
Very dubious

3433
02:46:46,271 --> 02:46:47,295
Type of

3434
02:46:47,551 --> 02:46:49,087
These channels materials

3435
02:46:49,343 --> 02:46:50,367
Some stuff like that from

3436
02:46:50,623 --> 02:46:51,135
The people like it

3437
02:46:51,391 --> 02:46:53,951
Talking about past lives on Atlantis

3438
02:46:54,463 --> 02:46:55,999
The build-up the robots

3439
02:46:56,255 --> 02:46:57,791
List of the Mars narrative

3440
02:46:58,047 --> 02:46:59,583
Find Atlanta

3441
02:46:59,839 --> 02:47:00,351
Excuse me

3442
02:47:00,607 --> 02:47:01,375
But also

3443
02:47:01,631 --> 02:47:02,399
What are you doing

3444
02:47:02,911 --> 02:47:04,191
Is he bringing an ancient alien

3445
02:47:04,959 --> 02:47:09,823
He's bringing in these Erich von daniken bulshit

3446
02:47:10,079 --> 02:47:12,383
Bringing in stuff to do with like

3447
02:47:12,639 --> 02:47:13,151
The emerald

3448
02:47:13,407 --> 02:47:14,175
Tablets of Thoth

3449
02:47:14,943 --> 02:47:16,735
What's the Emerald Tablet

3450
02:47:16,991 --> 02:47:23,135
We'd be here for another f****** hour to the bottom of the emerald

3451
02:47:23,391 --> 02:47:24,159
Tablets of Thoth

3452
02:47:24,671 --> 02:47:30,303
Entire episode on V pseudoscientific nonsense

3453
02:47:30,559 --> 02:47:36,703
Weird spirituality another project

3454
02:47:39,775 --> 02:47:41,055
Dave

3455
02:47:41,567 --> 02:47:42,079
There's this

3456
02:47:42,335 --> 02:47:43,615
Pseudo spiritualist

3457
02:47:43,871 --> 02:47:46,687
Belief in Atlanta that has to do with

3458
02:47:46,943 --> 02:47:48,479
There's a planet

3459
02:47:48,735 --> 02:47:50,527
It's called various different thing

3460
02:47:50,783 --> 02:47:52,575
Malbec is one of the things it's called

3461
02:47:53,087 --> 02:47:55,903
They were Martinez

3462
02:47:56,159 --> 02:47:58,207
Never martians aliens on this planet

3463
02:47:58,463 --> 02:47:59,999
And they ended up blowing up the planet

3464
02:48:00,255 --> 02:48:01,279
I'm killing everybody on it

3465
02:48:01,535 --> 02:48:02,303
Cuz I got to in

3466
02:48:02,559 --> 02:48:04,351
In the

3467
02:48:04,607 --> 02:48:06,399
Tinkering at the created Atomic weapons

3468
02:48:06,655 --> 02:48:09,727
And they blew up the entire planet

3469
02:48:09,983 --> 02:48:13,055
Basically so

3470
02:48:13,311 --> 02:48:17,151
Souls needed somewhere else to reincarnate cuz they do work out there, Cadet

3471
02:48:17,407 --> 02:48:19,967
And what have you and so there was negotiating

3472
02:48:20,223 --> 02:48:21,247
This isn't the Halo Wars

3473
02:48:29,695 --> 02:48:31,743
So there is a planetary

3474
02:48:33,279 --> 02:48:39,167
I don't even f****** know that we're allowed to reincarnate on Earth

3475
02:48:41,471 --> 02:48:44,031
Even even vacant compromise

3476
02:48:44,287 --> 02:48:49,151
Allowed illegal immigrants into her

3477
02:48:49,407 --> 02:48:55,295
This is a far better world so they reincarnate on lemuria to work out their karmic debt

3478
02:48:59,135 --> 02:49:02,463
Atlanta

3479
02:49:02,719 --> 02:49:07,327
Blowing up Atlanta

3480
02:49:07,583 --> 02:49:09,119
We're here in modern-day

3481
02:49:09,631 --> 02:49:15,263
Here's the problem we've created I haven't blown up any

3482
02:49:15,519 --> 02:49:16,543
But we've dropped

3483
02:49:16,799 --> 02:49:18,847
Even destroyed

3484
02:49:24,223 --> 02:49:25,503
It was destroyed by

3485
02:49:26,527 --> 02:49:28,063
Gears

3486
02:49:28,319 --> 02:49:29,343
Nuclear weapons

3487
02:49:29,599 --> 02:49:32,159
He was the reason that I've ever seen the movie Atlanta

3488
02:49:32,671 --> 02:49:33,183
You know it

3489
02:49:33,439 --> 02:49:34,207
Easy for them to do

3490
02:49:34,975 --> 02:49:37,791
Thanks

3491
02:49:38,047 --> 02:49:40,351
Together that's fair

3492
02:49:41,119 --> 02:49:44,191
Wall of light that's as legitimate

3493
02:49:45,215 --> 02:49:46,495
Actor first version

3494
02:49:46,751 --> 02:49:50,591
As I tell you these things people believe that are not

3495
02:49:51,103 --> 02:49:53,919
I need to make clear that I know that Alex Jones

3496
02:49:54,175 --> 02:49:55,455
Have to be aware of some of

3497
02:49:55,967 --> 02:49:56,991
This is where it's coming

3498
02:49:57,247 --> 02:49:59,551
Cuz the idea that there was a Connect

3499
02:49:59,807 --> 02:50:00,575
Do with outer space

3500
02:50:00,831 --> 02:50:01,343
And

3501
02:50:01,855 --> 02:50:02,879
Is all from

3502
02:50:03,647 --> 02:50:04,927
It has nothing to do with Play-Doh

3503
02:50:05,183 --> 02:50:06,975
Play-Doh didn't talk about that s*** at all

3504
02:50:07,487 --> 02:50:09,535
So he's getting that from a source

3505
02:50:09,791 --> 02:50:11,839
Distance to be in line with the

3506
02:50:12,095 --> 02:50:15,167
Von daniken other guy's name

3507
02:50:16,703 --> 02:50:17,983
Now the other guy

3508
02:50:18,495 --> 02:50:19,519
Yeah maybe

3509
02:50:20,543 --> 02:50:21,823
He just watched an episode of

3510
02:50:24,383 --> 02:50:26,175
Entirely possible

3511
02:50:26,431 --> 02:50:28,223
Talks about the Atlantean Legend

3512
02:50:28,735 --> 02:50:30,271
He always talks about how

3513
02:50:30,527 --> 02:50:31,295
We're getting to this

3514
02:50:33,087 --> 02:50:35,647
And that is the idea

3515
02:50:36,415 --> 02:50:38,207
Created nuclear weapons and blew itself up

3516
02:50:38,463 --> 02:50:42,047
Which comes from this pseudo scientifical pseudo-spiritual list

3517
02:50:42,559 --> 02:50:44,095
Theosophist branch

3518
02:50:44,351 --> 02:50:44,863
Of nonce

3519
02:50:45,631 --> 02:50:47,935
If you actually a really just going off of

3520
02:50:48,191 --> 02:50:48,703
Play-Doh which is

3521
02:50:49,215 --> 02:50:50,495
Respected source

3522
02:50:53,055 --> 02:50:55,103
Whatever you talk about Atlantis is very unspecific

3523
02:50:55,615 --> 02:50:56,639
But he talks about it

3524
02:50:56,895 --> 02:50:58,431
Like the destruction of Atlantis was

3525
02:50:58,687 --> 02:50:59,199
Punishment

3526
02:50:59,455 --> 02:51:01,247
Have God because they were too warlike

3527
02:51:01,759 --> 02:51:03,295
They went around they destroy

3528
02:51:03,551 --> 02:51:04,575
Respected world

3529
02:51:04,831 --> 02:51:05,343
They f***** with

3530
02:51:06,367 --> 02:51:06,879
Too much

3531
02:51:07,135 --> 02:51:08,671
So they got destroyed by the Gods

3532
02:51:08,927 --> 02:51:09,695
Because they became too

3533
02:51:09,951 --> 02:51:13,279
Too decadent it wasn't that they created nuclear weapons and Industry

3534
02:51:13,791 --> 02:51:14,559
Texas

3535
02:51:15,071 --> 02:51:15,583
Play Arabia

3536
02:51:15,839 --> 02:51:17,119
Of the metaphor of Atlanta

3537
02:51:17,631 --> 02:51:18,655
From

3538
02:51:18,911 --> 02:51:20,191
Bulshit sources

3539
02:51:25,311 --> 02:51:26,335
Of course I love it

3540
02:51:26,591 --> 02:51:27,615
Cuz he's so dumb

3541
02:51:28,383 --> 02:51:29,919
I need to not be talkin about it

3542
02:51:31,455 --> 02:51:32,735
Bother

3543
02:51:32,991 --> 02:51:34,271
F****** batalon

3544
02:51:35,551 --> 02:51:37,343
Whatever whatever one's that you want

3545
02:51:37,599 --> 02:51:38,623
Right

3546
02:51:38,879 --> 02:51:40,415
Assault

3547
02:51:40,927 --> 02:51:43,231
But I just don't like

3548
02:51:43,487 --> 02:51:44,767
That's Gomorrah

3549
02:51:47,583 --> 02:51:48,607
Mine

3550
02:51:49,119 --> 02:51:51,167

But I know you love

3556
02:52:01,663 --> 02:52:02,943
Alexander's Bay class

3557
02:52:04,223 --> 02:52:04,735
This

3558
02:52:05,247 --> 02:52:05,759
Is

3559
02:52:06,527 --> 02:52:07,295
You getting

3560
02:52:08,063 --> 02:52:10,111
You know it's it's not be careful what you wish for

3561
02:52:10,879 --> 02:52:11,647
Biggest beaches

3562
02:52:11,903 --> 02:52:13,695
Too much of his life

3563
02:52:13,951 --> 02:52:14,975
Negative Ghost

3564
02:52:15,231 --> 02:52:18,815
Big Lots

3565
02:52:19,071 --> 02:52:22,143
So here we got this is the worst fake laugh I've ever heard

3566
02:52:28,543 --> 02:52:32,639
And I just love this orwellian article out of Los Angeles Times only come back

3567
02:52:33,663 --> 02:52:37,503
What are your for Israel against

3568
02:52:37,759 --> 02:52:40,831
You want to know how they saw it they say bases you're a demonstrator

3569
02:52:41,343 --> 02:52:42,367
They're going to shoot you

3570
02:52:42,879 --> 02:52:46,207
Don't worry it's caliber

3571
02:52:58,239 --> 02:52:59,775
It disintegrates

3572
02:53:00,031 --> 02:53:00,799
And opens up

3573
02:53:02,335 --> 02:53:05,151
They wanted to kill more people in a more people

3574
02:53:05,407 --> 02:53:10,783
In Vietnam

3575
02:53:11,039 --> 02:53:14,111
Hyper velocity round breaks up when I get to bone

3576
02:53:15,391 --> 02:53:17,951
Invasive fragmentation kinetic weapon

3577
02:53:29,215 --> 02:53:32,287
From a Ruger range rifle is okay

3578
02:53:39,711 --> 02:53:45,343
Prime that's so hilarious

3579
02:53:45,599 --> 02:53:51,743
Oh my gosh that is the funniest thing I've ever heard in my life

3580
02:53:51,999 --> 02:53:54,815
Around but don't worry it's small

3581
02:53:56,095 --> 02:53:57,375
I'm sorry

3582
02:53:57,631 --> 02:53:59,167
Imma stop right there you better

3583
02:54:00,703 --> 02:54:01,471
That's crazy

3584
02:54:05,055 --> 02:54:05,823
He thinks it's

3585
02:54:06,079 --> 02:54:08,639
So funny

3586
02:54:10,431 --> 02:54:12,735
That's not real

3587
02:54:12,991 --> 02:54:19,135
He's like he's really Hamming it up and putting his head over his eyes and like that

3588
02:54:19,391 --> 02:54:19,903
Terrible but

3589
02:54:20,159 --> 02:54:21,695
The idea that you would want

3590
02:54:21,951 --> 02:54:22,463
Presented

3591
02:54:22,719 --> 02:54:23,743
He thinks that it's so funny

3592
02:54:23,999 --> 02:54:25,791
Is bizarre even on its own

3593
02:54:26,047 --> 02:54:28,607
That is the funniest thing you've ever heard

3594
02:54:28,863 --> 02:54:29,887
Is incredibly f***** up

3595
02:54:30,655 --> 02:54:36,799
Ammunition of course that's hilarious

3596
02:54:41,151 --> 02:54:41,919
So you could have gone

3597
02:54:42,175 --> 02:54:42,687
A little bit

3598
02:54:44,223 --> 02:54:44,991
Energy word 3 hours

3599
02:54:45,503 --> 02:54:47,039
Podcast

3600
02:54:48,319 --> 02:54:54,463
The funkiest

3601
02:54:55,487 --> 02:54:56,767
I wonder what his real laugh sound

3602
02:54:57,535 --> 02:54:59,839
Is it like Fran Drescher Real

3603
02:55:00,095 --> 02:55:04,447
I really

3604
02:55:04,959 --> 02:55:06,495
I really don't think that he has a

3605
02:55:07,519 --> 02:55:09,055
Leopard

3606
02:55:10,591 --> 02:55:11,103
Big crush on her and

3607
02:55:11,359 --> 02:55:11,871
I'm glad that you

3608
02:55:12,895 --> 02:55:15,455
You did not need the real that it reveal that information at all

3609
02:55:16,223 --> 02:55:16,991
Do the very attractive lady

3610
02:55:17,247 --> 02:55:18,527
Anyway

3611
02:55:20,575 --> 02:55:21,087
This

3612
02:55:21,599 --> 02:55:25,183
This investigation like

3613
02:55:25,439 --> 02:55:28,511
Is Donald Trump

3614
02:55:28,767 --> 02:55:30,047
Came into Alex Jones is

3615
02:55:30,303 --> 02:55:31,071
Sphere

3616
02:55:34,399 --> 02:55:35,935
So I'm

3617
02:55:37,215 --> 02:55:37,727
A cliffhanger

3618
02:55:38,239 --> 02:55:39,263
Not really

3619
02:55:39,775 --> 02:55:40,287
He brings up

3620
02:55:41,055 --> 02:55:44,127
Trump says something or news breaks on the 28th

3621
02:55:44,639 --> 02:55:45,407
That is relevant

3622
02:55:45,663 --> 02:55:46,431
The trumps campaign

3623
02:55:46,687 --> 02:55:47,967
I am Alex Jones

3624
02:55:50,015 --> 02:55:50,783
Unless you

3625
02:55:51,039 --> 02:55:51,807
Make of this what you

3626
02:55:52,319 --> 02:55:54,879
I let Jesus Take the Wheel

3627
02:55:57,439 --> 02:56:00,767
What really makes

3628
02:56:47,615 --> 02:56:49,151
General Electric Google

3629
02:56:49,919 --> 02:56:50,431
Apple

3630
02:56:51,199 --> 02:56:53,503
Lockheed Martin

3631
02:56:57,087 --> 02:56:58,623
Maybe the power over the planet

3632
02:57:00,415 --> 02:57:01,951
So you can play

3633
02:57:02,975 --> 02:57:05,023
You are going to send that money

3634
02:57:05,279 --> 02:57:08,863
You took that money out of the country

3635
02:57:09,119 --> 02:57:10,143
Three important points

3636
02:57:10,655 --> 02:57:11,167
1

3637
02:57:11,423 --> 02:57:11,935
He saying

3638
02:57:12,191 --> 02:57:13,215
America built

3639
02:57:13,727 --> 02:57:14,751
Which is very similar to

3640
02:57:15,007 --> 02:57:15,775
You didn't build your business

3641
02:57:16,287 --> 02:57:21,151
Which is something he's very mad at Obama for saying

3642
02:57:23,455 --> 02:57:26,527
I forgot what the one of them

3643
02:57:27,039 --> 02:57:30,111
But grossly mischaracterizing

3644
02:57:30,367 --> 02:57:30,879
Trump's tax

3645
02:57:32,159 --> 02:57:33,439
It was nothing like

3646
02:57:35,487 --> 02:57:36,255
Nouveau riche

3647
02:57:36,511 --> 02:57:38,047
Is not just

3648
02:57:38,559 --> 02:57:39,327
Rich people

3649
02:57:39,583 --> 02:57:42,399
Like

3650
02:57:47,775 --> 02:57:53,919
When you became rich

3651
02:57:54,175 --> 02:57:56,223
Then the other thing that I think

3652
02:57:57,503 --> 02:57:58,271
F****** idiot

3653
02:57:59,039 --> 02:58:00,575
Or he's willfully lie

3654
02:58:01,343 --> 02:58:01,855
Because

3655
02:58:02,367 --> 02:58:03,135
You know who runs

3656
02:58:03,391 --> 02:58:04,927
A multinational corporation

3657
02:58:05,183 --> 02:58:06,719
Based in America

3658
02:58:06,975 --> 02:58:09,535
Wait what

3659
02:58:10,559 --> 02:58:13,631
They still allow him to do that he's running for president

3660
02:58:13,887 --> 02:58:17,471
We don't want any kind of conflict of interest

3661
02:58:19,263 --> 02:58:23,615
It's the laws will kick it and we will know that he doesn't have

3662
02:58:23,871 --> 02:58:25,151
Owego

3663
02:58:30,015 --> 02:58:31,551
Can't possibly think

3664
02:58:31,807 --> 02:58:33,087
Donald Trump is

3665
02:58:33,343 --> 02:58:34,111
So selfless

3666
02:58:34,623 --> 02:58:36,415
But he's going to create

3667
02:58:36,671 --> 02:58:40,767
Burden for companies very similar to the one that

3668
02:58:41,279 --> 02:58:42,815
That's what he said he was going to do

3669
02:58:43,071 --> 02:58:44,095
That's so crazy

3670
02:58:44,351 --> 02:58:46,399
Look that's so stupid

3671
02:58:46,655 --> 02:58:48,703
Said that they

3672
02:58:48,959 --> 02:58:49,471
You believe them

3673
02:58:49,727 --> 02:58:51,775
Bright

3674
02:58:52,031 --> 02:58:53,311
Cost himself money as

3675
02:58:53,823 --> 02:58:58,431
He has been known to do his entire lab salute

3676
02:58:58,687 --> 02:58:59,711
How do I

3677
02:59:00,479 --> 02:59:02,015
Give more of my wife

3678
02:59:02,271 --> 02:59:03,551
How do I make

3679
02:59:03,807 --> 02:59:06,111
I am not the only person take

3680
02:59:06,879 --> 02:59:08,415
He used his own

3681
02:59:08,671 --> 02:59:09,439
Charities money

3682
02:59:09,951 --> 02:59:11,487
To pay for his son's enrollment

3683
02:59:11,743 --> 02:59:12,511
In the boy scout

3684
02:59:13,023 --> 02:59:14,815
Yeah that's f****** with you

3685
02:59:15,071 --> 02:59:16,095
No it's done

3686
02:59:16,351 --> 02:59:18,911
Used his own Charities money

3687
02:59:19,167 --> 02:59:20,703
Trump to play golf

3688
02:59:20,959 --> 02:59:21,727
Right

3689
02:59:21,983 --> 02:59:28,127
It's not someone that's not the act of someone who's going to help us clean wants to

3690
02:59:29,407 --> 02:59:32,223
Is Dan that's okay

3691
02:59:39,647 --> 02:59:42,463
Also contradicts

3692
02:59:42,719 --> 02:59:43,743
Things that

3693
02:59:43,999 --> 02:59:44,511
Cuz that about Trump

3694
02:59:44,767 --> 02:59:45,279
The past

3695
02:59:46,047 --> 02:59:47,327
It absolutely does

3696
02:59:47,583 --> 02:59:49,887
Like you use characterization of Donald Trump

3697
02:59:50,143 --> 02:59:51,167
Has become

3698
02:59:51,679 --> 02:59:52,959
Something very positive

3699
02:59:53,727 --> 02:59:54,239
As opposed

3700
02:59:54,495 --> 02:59:56,543
To this guy's a scumbag

3701
02:59:56,799 --> 02:59:59,615
He's a predator

3702
02:59:59,871 --> 03:00:00,639
I don't trust

3703
03:00:00,895 --> 03:00:01,407
Yeah

3704
03:00:01,663 --> 03:00:03,711
And then here's this dumb s***

3705
03:00:04,991 --> 03:00:06,527
Well I of course I trust him

3706
03:00:06,783 --> 03:00:08,831
Tacitly Trussville course

3707
03:00:09,599 --> 03:00:10,367
Unbelievable

3708
03:00:10,879 --> 03:00:12,927
Stupid believe it

3709
03:00:13,439 --> 03:00:14,719
He got a s*** ton of money from the money

3710
03:00:15,231 --> 03:00:19,583
It's possible Clipper playing we're going to leave it

3711
03:00:19,839 --> 03:00:22,143
Here until the next phase of the investigation

3712
03:00:22,399 --> 03:00:25,215
Even after that.

3713
03:00:25,471 --> 03:00:27,519
I don't I'm not endorsing

3714
03:00:28,031 --> 03:00:30,079
That he is still in the same place

3715
03:00:30,847 --> 03:00:33,151
There is no foundational Prague

3716
03:00:33,919 --> 03:00:35,967
No but we're seeing it happened so slowly

3717
03:00:36,223 --> 03:00:36,991
Disappoint

3718
03:00:37,247 --> 03:00:38,271
There's no

3719
03:00:38,783 --> 03:00:41,343
It seems like it's just a buildup of him hearing things

3720
03:00:41,599 --> 03:00:42,111
He's repeatedly

3721
03:00:42,623 --> 03:00:43,135
Adidas

3722
03:00:44,159 --> 03:00:45,951
Can Only Hold one ideas have the

3723
03:00:50,303 --> 03:00:53,631
Yeah and that is what

3724
03:00:54,655 --> 03:00:59,263
Man Rodger Stones got to show up soon right out I don't know when it is

3725
03:01:00,543 --> 03:01:01,055
Anyway

3726
03:01:01,823 --> 03:01:04,127
This is been interesting Road

3727
03:01:04,383 --> 03:01:08,991
We gone down it's been fun but you'd like more fun you can find it

3728
03:01:09,247 --> 03:01:10,271
Knowledge fight.com

3729
03:01:10,783 --> 03:01:12,575
Let me see

3730
03:01:12,831 --> 03:01:14,879
I forgot to say this

3731
03:01:15,135 --> 03:01:15,647
I forgot

3732
03:01:15,903 --> 03:01:19,487
The beginning of the show and I just want to give an explanation for why we've been in the past

3733
03:01:19,743 --> 03:01:20,255
For so long

3734
03:01:21,535 --> 03:01:23,839
Not great that I'm doing 3 hours into the

3735
03:01:24,095 --> 03:01:28,447
Maybe want to hear this

3736
03:01:28,703 --> 03:01:29,215
At the end

3737
03:01:29,471 --> 03:01:35,615
I will have said turn it off

3738
03:01:37,407 --> 03:01:38,431
Couple days

3739
03:01:38,943 --> 03:01:40,223
Thursday

3740
03:01:40,479 --> 03:01:40,991
Studio

3741
03:01:41,247 --> 03:01:44,063
And even before that he was just trolling he's just trolling people

3742
03:01:44,319 --> 03:01:45,599
He's doing this like

3743
03:01:45,855 --> 03:01:47,135
People keep posting that he's

3744
03:01:50,207 --> 03:01:51,231
Stuff like that

3745
03:01:51,743 --> 03:01:52,767
And that's just him trying

3746
03:01:53,023 --> 03:01:55,071
To get more attention in the same vein as the

3747
03:01:55,327 --> 03:01:57,375
We love our Somali Song Contest

3748
03:01:59,167 --> 03:01:59,679
Debate

3749
03:02:00,191 --> 03:02:00,959
Grab this bait

3750
03:02:01,215 --> 03:02:02,239
I'm a real you in

3751
03:02:02,495 --> 03:02:04,543
They have the dick size thing it's a joke

3752
03:02:04,799 --> 03:02:06,335
People come and hear the truth from

3753
03:02:07,871 --> 03:02:08,895
That way but it's still not

3754
03:02:09,151 --> 03:02:10,431
He still ends up making

3755
03:02:10,687 --> 03:02:12,223
A lot of money off ad Revenue in

3756
03:02:12,479 --> 03:02:12,991
It like that

3757
03:02:13,247 --> 03:02:15,551
So don't fall for it it's super boring

3758
03:02:15,807 --> 03:02:17,599
And then at the end of last week

3759
03:02:17,855 --> 03:02:19,135
I got the app

3760
03:02:19,903 --> 03:02:22,207
Much like his argument that

3761
03:02:22,463 --> 03:02:22,975
He got

3762
03:02:27,071 --> 03:02:30,143
Maybe he did have some source

3763
03:02:30,399 --> 03:02:31,679
I told him that it was going to go down

3764
03:02:32,191 --> 03:02:32,703
Is that

3765
03:02:34,239 --> 03:02:34,751
He's been banging

3766
03:02:35,263 --> 03:02:36,031
If possible

3767
03:02:36,287 --> 03:02:37,311
But I'm not interested in

3768
03:02:37,567 --> 03:02:38,335
Scoops like that

3769
03:02:38,591 --> 03:02:40,895
That's not exciting

3770
03:02:41,407 --> 03:02:42,943
I don't give a s*** about stuff like that

3771
03:02:43,455 --> 03:02:44,223
I don't care

3772
03:02:44,479 --> 03:02:45,247
If you have

3773
03:02:45,503 --> 03:02:46,527
Keep inhaling priebus

3774
03:02:48,063 --> 03:02:51,903
It's not like he is some sort of inside information he thinks he's a globalist holdover

3775
03:02:54,975 --> 03:02:57,279
To the fact that he gets fires are good

3776
03:02:57,535 --> 03:03:02,143
Write him saying we called it earlier this week it doesn't really mean it

3777
03:03:02,655 --> 03:03:05,727
You called out like four months ago to

3778
03:03:05,983 --> 03:03:07,775
He said he'll be out by the end of the

3779
03:03:08,031 --> 03:03:14,175
