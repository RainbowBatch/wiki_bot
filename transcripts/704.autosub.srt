00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important I'm sweating

00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for its knowledge B

00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
What's fight.com

00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,072
Alex Jones

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,656
Jordan

8
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:18,592
Damn do you know what my brights

9
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:24,992
And I went and played tennis earlier this afternoon wonderful

10
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,112
Good-o

11
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:36,512
Blasted until that I was like well I'm going to take a little sit-down I could see that I feel like she

12
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:40,096
Probably is a person who has about a million talents

13
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,632
That like you just don't

14
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,912
Expect 100%

15
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:47,264
Every everything you accidentally click and go to it like a knife throwing

16
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,544
In place

17
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,944
That I know I threw knives for awhile whenever I was in college and you like what

18
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,224
That's what she called

19
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,504
Texts being good at skill

20
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,576
I know I

21
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:06,976
I think we were pretty if we were on a pretty even-keeled better way of bragging

22
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,000
Where she was just

23
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,656
So just teasing you like it wasn't even hard

24
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,680
Well

25
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:21,056
As many people know I have started to grow some plants

26
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,360
And

27
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,432
Couple of cucumbers coming up couple of seedlings

28
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,712
I also have

29
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:32,320
Some grow bags with potatoes

30
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:37,952
It needs potatoes to grow at all potatoes and general myself

31
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:42,816
I just feel like there's something weird about putting a potato on the grill

32
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:49,216
I'm expecting something very weird I was just in there

33
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:53,056
And I was looking at the soil and little buds

34
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,616
Are coming up out of the potato

35
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,896
Like out of the dirt

36
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,944
Borrowing from the Spud

37
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,248
So that's really exciting

38
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:05,088
It is fun that sometimes you can really like take a step back

39
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:05,856
NSYNC

40
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:12,256
You know I bet a long time ago somebody just threw a potato and then a bunch of potatoes grew wherever it landed

41
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,792
Like that whenever the land was

42
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,584
Was filled with

43
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,448
You threw a potato and potatoes would show up I had like a little compost

44
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:24,032
Thing going and I had a

45
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:28,896
Make a pinto bean a baby I'm not sure what it was

46
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,688
It was in

47
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,992
The sprouting

48
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,624
Whatever like garbage and it's still sprout

49
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,696
It was I was not to look just coffee grind Center

50
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,720
Like it just

51
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:46,048
It's so funny how so many plants are like I get there

52
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:49,632
It's just no way to make this grow and then their tongues where he likes

53
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,448
Yep

54
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,104
Something they also. Get away from me to is Alex Trebek

55
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,504
Segway

56
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:11,136
Are we go into part two of our examination of his

57
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:15,488
2001

58
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:20,095
Which is 9 to midnight and

59
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,167
You haven't listened to the first one go ahead and do that because

60
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:28,287
Babe this prereq it better get better

61
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:34,431
Think about it at ready for a weird ride after we left after we were done recording and I'm just like

62
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,503
In my head I really don't believe if you would

63
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
Told me

64
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,063
20 years ago if you would

65
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,855
Showed me the broadcast

66
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,903
I would not have believed it was happy

67
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:50,303
I came up to you and I was like hey Alex Jones is that the EU 111

68
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:55,423
Order to help strengthen the euro

69
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,215
Observation I guess

70
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,495
Absurd

71
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:03,359
Yeah yeah there's a lot of a lot of surprises going on

72
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
Well I'd say put first

73
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:10,783
Get into any of that

74
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,087
Text Beach Journal policy wonk

75
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,903
Next

76
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,999
Alex's Journal policy

77
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:24,095
This is

78
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
Too late

79
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:29,727
Little bit

80
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:35,359
From Arkansas

81
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:41,247
Alex

82
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:47,647
Kirby's Return to Dream Land thank you so much

83
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:52,255
That was well done

84
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,839
I'm so before we get into the episode proper I wanted

85
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,911
Just to give a little bit of apology and clarification again

86
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:05,311
I use the term Afghani to refer to a person on the last episode of night is incorrect

87
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,639
I was unaware of this about this and I appreciate the person

88
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,943
Correct me on that it just

89
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,223
I don't know why

90
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,247
I guess I

91
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,295
I had no idea it's Afghan

92
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,087
Is the term for a person

93
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,927
Afghani is monetary unit that was

94
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:27,327
He's just completely in my blind-spot I have I have heard people referred to in that way

95
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
Contacts

96
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,703
Extend places where it didn't seem like it was effective

97
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:39,103
I'm so I guess I had just assumed straight up told me I'd like

98
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:44,223
I would have told you that I swear I heard people say it on TV like a few days ago like I have no idea

99
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:50,111
I'm glad that I didn't appreciate learning more though

100
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
So I look

101
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:56,511
I decided that if I was going to do this episode here covering Alex's shows on 9/11

102
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:00,607
It'd be important not just be the only way that I experience

103
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,375
The tragedy

104
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,423
I was alive when this happened

105
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:07,007
Of course but it's been 21 years and some of the memories have faded

106
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:12,639
If you wildly incomplete for me to approach this and just rely on my own memories and Alex

107
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,431
This is bulshit

108
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:20,831
I can read documents and reports but those are a little bit sterile an unfeeling one of the unexpected things about

109
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,135
What does morning show that we covered on our last episode

110
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,719
Was that you didn't seem to have a human response to the attack

111
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,559
Though he said it was the most important day in like a century

112
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:34,399
The show didn't have a feeling that conveyed the gravity of what people were experiencing

113
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,703
He took calls and people were crafting

114
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,263
Conspiracies out of bizarre numerology

115
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,031
You got gas

116
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,311
But they are people who

117
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,639
You know work that affected or they were trying to sell gold

118
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,455
This all felt like a huge disrespect

119
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,759
To the people who were living through hell pushing there

120
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,063
Experienced to the side in order to use it

121
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,831
Good for your own purpose

122
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:57,951
And I wanted to make sure that I held onto a little bit of the severity of the subject or cover

123
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:04,351
This is a show that's meant to be funny and entertaining so it's easy to put on that facade of not taking things too

124
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,887
To seriously being like

125
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
Glib

126
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:13,567
In order to make sure I held on to some semblance of perspective as I dealt with Alex I decided it would be helpful to also watch

127
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,615
Various news outlets live coverage

128
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,151
Of the tragedy so I watch

129
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:17,919
Hours

130
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,199
An H

131
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
Live

132
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,527
CBS

133
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:27,135
Local Fox affiliate

134
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,927
Of the day

135
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,719
I am.

136
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,255
I believe you

137
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:38,143
I was telling you that I'm a bit tired

138
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:45,055
A lot of that was during the day

139
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:51,455
I think I'll just do 911 a couple times because there's different channels

140
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:59,135
Part of it was I wanted to get a sense of like the information space that Alex would have been living in but he got on air

141
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,415
At 9 p.m.

142
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,975
Innocence of

143
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,511
How the media was

144
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,279
Covering it

145
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,839
You're so much of Alex's entire point

146
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,911
Anything is drawing Broad

147
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,959
Conclusions from how he feels

148
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,287
The media is doing other people's report

149
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,591
Choose the keeses

150
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:24,479
Imagined or not right media and pretends that there's a directives and marching order at the globalist

151
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:28,063
I'm so something that I felt would be kind of important was it

152
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,623
Experiencing a bit of that and luckily

153
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,903
You can find

154
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,975
Pretty much full coverage videos on YouTube

155
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,535
Pretty well-documented day

156
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,863
YouTube channel that has a lot of very important days

157
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:45,727
Like just straight news coverage

158
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,031
Check out so I watch too much of that

159
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:53,407
Some of that will inform some of the stuff that we get into today but I'll give you the CliffsNotes version

160
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,431
Version of this

161
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,991
I want to show is really bad

162
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:58,783
Terrible

163
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:04,927
We rightly criticised the media for a lot of sensationalism and there are tons of other problems with the big Networks

164
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,231
For the most part

165
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,535
And I am not

166
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:15,935
Does they seem to handle a lot of coverage fairly well

167
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:17,983
3D

168
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,007
Impressed

169
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031
Bye

170
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:20,799
The coverage

171
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,335
As events were unfolding

172
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,919
Yeah there was a there was a respect for what was happening

173
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:29,759
There was a restraint in leaping to conclusions

174
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:34,623
Like the CBS was the first one I watched

175
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,671
And they took forever to eat

176
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,207
Even admit that it wasn't

177
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
An

178
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,303
Right you know they had a real resistance to

179
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:48,703
Using terminology around terrorism picture weave there's not enough inform

180
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,983
Formation coming in

181
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:55,615
We know this is a tragedy but we don't know who's really found

182
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
It didn't

183
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:01,759
But with how I remembered how the stories are told

184
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,295
About 9/11 was that

185
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,087
There really wasn't

186
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,111
A like

187
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,927
Hard finger pointed at bin Laden

188
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
Intel

189
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,231
Quite a bit later

190
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,535
It was it was it was fun things

191
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:18,399
No I mean in the evening there was sort of a consensus coming around that like

192
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
It's probably him

193
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,983
This is a good suspect

194
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,263
Read the story that

195
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,799
We tell is that like

196
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,871
Immediately they said it was Osama bin

197
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,407
America isn't the case

198
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:36,063
Oh no the Palestinian group that took responsibility for it initially conversation

199
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
Is this

200
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,903
Credible taking responsibility

201
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,439
And then

202
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:46,047
Brought up as a possible person because

203
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
He attacked

204
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:53,215
Predict the future

205
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,567
The possibility of State actors

206
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,127
More of a conversation about possibilities

207
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,687
I was I was kind of surprised

208
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:06,015
Experience at cuz I thought I'd go back into be like so much better

209
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:11,391
Talk like straight out

210
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:18,047
Yeah baby. Super

211
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
But I really had

212
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,375
I thought of in the past but I don't

213
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,447
Like my memory of it I didn't

214
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,263
Remember people even throwing around like

215
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,663
Here's who did it at all for awhile like for at least a couple of days or so for me is just people were like

216
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
Wow that was f***** up

217
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:39,295
Terror you know like the whole thing they've they didn't actively put a name on it

218
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
For a while

219
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:43,647
Yeah and I think that a large amount of

220
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,439
The coverage

221
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,463
Instead you fine

222
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,767
That I was watching

223
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,583
More with a human end of it

224
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,351
Then

225
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,399
The who did this

226
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:58,751
Although as the day went on certainly there was some conversation of

227
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,775
Who did this in

228
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,079
People made were

229
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:08,735
I didn't see as much racism

230
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,503
Violin

231
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,903
Got a lot of people for blood

232
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,511
Remember happening right away at there was a former Secretary of State who was on CNN

233
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,791
I got my boo who it was

234
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
Eagle bird

235
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,351
And

236
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,631
He was like

237
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
Look

238
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,727
We got to kill somebody

239
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,775
Whether we can prove they were directly

240
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:35,103
Connected or not we got to go and kill somebody

241
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,895
Oh boy

242
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,199
That was what's funny about Alex

243
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,991
Saying we got a Newcomb

244
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:46,879
I'm at earlier episode is that I do remember being briefly a fairly mainstream thought

245
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,463
People would like Bandy about like okay so what do we do

246
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,743
Do we nuke him

247
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,279
What's that kind of thing

248
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,863
It's a visceral reaction that you have

249
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,167
Like a punch that's coming

250
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:04,031
Interesting was that that was part of Alex

251
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,823
Response as well

252
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,199
He likes to pretend that he's above that kind of not be that emotional response

253
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,735
Centerpiece and he doesn't

254
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,039
1 expand

255
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,831
Nuking some f****** country

256
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:20,415
If you can't possibly be in paperback even if you

257
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:26,559
You proved that their government did 911 you're just going to kill someone

258
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:30,143
I mean essentially you're declaring war on the earth not on

259
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,679
Enough

260
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,215
Yeah and

261
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,007
So here we are

262
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,127
That's where we'll be more along the way I Kira

263
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,015
But here it we start Alex's evening show and familiar tone

264
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,575
Alright ladies

265
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,111
It is 9/11

266
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,135
911

267
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
September 11th

268
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,695
1001

269
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
Ambli

270
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
Numbered days isn't it

271
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:57,791
Amply

272
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,631
Allowed

273
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,167
Throughout the

274
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,959
Early morning

275
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,727
Hours

276
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,287
I have

277
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,823
Been one of those lone voice

278
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,847
Job fair warning

279
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
You about Deborah

280
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
Sponsored

281
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
Terrorism

282
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,735
So there's again like in Iran

283
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,295
Immediately show and that's

284
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,623
Bizarre

285
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:27,999
I was already I was prepared for it I was like I know right at the gate he's going to be like look at how right I was

286
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:32,095
It's it seems like one of the most important things that he wants

287
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,863
Distress

288
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,911
And to me

289
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
That seems

290
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,983
I am a prophet of Doom

291
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:42,079
Follow me for I have predicted what has befallen us

292
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,383
So Alex has been watching

293
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,943
In some of the local and national news

294
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,223
And he has

295
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
Some word

296
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,783
I have the latest

297
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,831
Information and then I went

298
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,391
Away from

299
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
The collapse World Trade

300
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,951
I'd centers an world

301
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
7

302
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,023
A total of 5

303
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
Instead of collapse

304
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
Totaled

305
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,839
Burn to the ground

306
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
Collapse

307
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,399
Rump Shaker

308
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,423
Leaving local

309
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
Rock song for that

310
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,983
Wrong song

311
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,591
Fours and

312
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,151
Baltimore Sun new book

313
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,967
Us tariff

314
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:25,343
Casually listen to dead people in u.s. newspaper

315
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
Indignation

316
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,487
Information your calls coming up

317
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:37,375
The local and national news outlets are used to demolish to build

318
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,911
That is just made up

319
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:43,263
I'm not sure if it's accurate to say that five buildings had fallen

320
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,847
Partially because I just don't know what the definitions were using our

321
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:53,247
World Trade Center 12 and 7 definitely fully collapse

322
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,551
Building 3 4 5 and 6

323
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:01,439
But also non World Trade Center complex buildings that were destroyed in the attack

324
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,999
And it seems difficult to precisely quantify that

325
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,303
For instance the Saint Nicholas

326
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,607
Greek Orthodox church was destroyed by Falling

327
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,375
Debris

328
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
I don't know

329
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,215
Discounted in Alex's

330
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
Piano Factory

331
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,055
It's a particular

332
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:22,431
But I just don't think it's five buildings as an accurate count regardless of how you define

333
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:29,855
I know that Alex seems to also the still not know the name of operation Northwoods

334
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,391
Or want to say it

335
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
Or something

336
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
Strange there is a key

337
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
Consistent

338
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,023
Use of that name

339
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:41,119
Where is now it's a buzz world

340
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,655
He loves operation

341
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,215
Not on 9/11

342
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,287
Well I mean that is the most respect

343
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,991
Yeah that's about as good as we're going to get from babe I'm assuming

344
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,039
Yeah

345
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,879
So there's some things that Alex is just wrong about your butt again

346
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:06,207
I think there's a number things that he's wrong about that are

347
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,487
Totally acceptable

348
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,255
I'm very understanding

349
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,559
At least five

350
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,095
Towers are down

351
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,887
Two of them the

352
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,679
Fourth largest building

353
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,959
On the planet

354
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,263
Upwards of 20,000

355
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,055
People are dead at least

356
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,895
Those cowards held

357
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,431
50000 people

358
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:29,503
Got a lot of them haven't gotten to work yet they're on the

359
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,807
He's posted 851 that purse

360
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,575
Passenger

361
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,599
Whiners

362
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,391
Smashed into the South Tower

363
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:41,023
His number is higher than a lot of the numbers that were being thrown around and other news outlets but

364
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,863
I understand that feeling and I understand that sense of

365
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,887
Like I said

366
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,655
You know

367
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,471
You look at something like that you can't imagine it

368
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,495
Killing a million

369
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:56,895
It is like it was a bit like seeing Godzilla knock down a toy

370
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,711
Power and then being like there were only a few thousand dead near like

371
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:03,295
I mean I know that's a tragedy that's horrific

372
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,087
I really thought the entire f******

373
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,879
Area was going to be

374
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:10,719
What grounds do you see the videos of people running

375
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,023
From the debris cloud

376
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,583
The way that the debris cloud like

377
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:21,471
Enveloped them exactly it's it's it's unthinkable

378
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
That

379
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,263
You know you wouldn't

380
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,543
Assume

381
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,079
20000

382
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,383
For sure

383
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,663
Is like 20,000

384
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,431
At least

385
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,735
That's a little bit stronger

386
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,015
Yeah but I get it

387
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,319
I don't feel like

388
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,135
I want I wanted to include something like this and

389
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,951
Whenever

390
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,487
Wrong about but he's right

391
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:49,887
To be wrong numbers he probably shouldn't have thrown around that number that high and definitely shouldn't have

392
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,935
Confirmed at least but

393
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:57,311
If you to see if you would ask me I've been like Basher 20 30 40 that sounds right

394
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,359
You know I'm not here to nitpick

395
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,687
Alex I'm not here to be like haha you got this wrong

396
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,711
Because I could

397
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,015
With that

398
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,319
But I would much rather spend my time on stuff like this

399
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,391
I'm in the towers began to collapse

400
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,183
I have one of the designers

401
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,975
Chicago Tribune

402
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,999
Chang this is

403
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
Impossible

404
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:21,119
I've been trying to get ahold of General bitton Parton all night with his

405
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
This phone has been busy

406
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,655
Perpetually

407
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,727
We actually had a structural engineer on the

408
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,007
The show today

409
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,615
That is not how buildings go down

410
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:39,295
You can see here already that Alex is claiming that he had a structural engineer on his show this morning who said it was a demolition went in

411
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,343
A friend of his on

412
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,719
Who'd studied some Engineering in college but now working in a financial sector job

413
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:53,119
The way Alex is seeking to solidify this talking point is for the perception to be that the guests he had on was a purse

414
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,423
Work professionally as a structural engineer

415
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:59,007
Because of that perception strengthens the illusion of his claim

416
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:03,103
Where is presenting his guests accurately would reveal how flimsy is s*** is

417
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,175
Also this article in the Chicago Tribune

418
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,479
You can find it it has the headline

419
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,759
Engineer shock

420
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,039
Spy Towers collapse

421
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:16,159
And nowhere in the article does this supposed co-designer claimed the way that the Builder

422
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
Wings collapse

423
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
Was

424
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,768
That's a claim that Alex's inventing from thin air

425
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,536
Just adding

426
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,840
The article discusses how less Roberts

427
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,400
Send one of the structural engineers of the Trade Center

428
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:29,728
Hey given to talk in Frankfurt Germany a week before the attacks

429
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,008
And it brought up the Builder

430
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,824
That the buildings were designed to withstand an impact

431
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,360
From a 707 jet

432
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:40,480
This is likely an accurate statement but it's being published in the Tribune not as a direct quote

433
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:45,856
They're actually quoting an engineer named Joseph Burns who was at the conference relaying Roberts

434
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
Sims words

435
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,672
The article literally says quote

436
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,256
Burnsed Robertson did not elaborate on the remark

437
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:58,400
The buildings were designed to withstand a crash from smaller planes like a personal plane or even up to a 707

438
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,448
But the Jets on 9/11 were

439
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,472
Bigger and Mater

440
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,264
I think one of the real

441
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,592
Alex is doing this is because he's not very creative

442
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,872
This this game is a

443
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,640
Creative

444
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:12,480
We can see in present-day every single mass shooting is basically the same

445
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,016
They want your guns

446
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,808
Who's the guys on psych meds

447
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,832
Incel

448
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,368
There's basically just bullet point

449
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:21,696
City applies to each new shooting regardless of the actual details

450
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
Have the real situation

451
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,864
He did the controlled demolition secret bombs in the building

452
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,656
Conspiracy with Oklahoma City

453
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:34,752
And he has another situation where buildings were destroyed that he needs

454
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,520
To turn into a

455
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,288
Conspiracy

456
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:39,360
It only seems natural that he would do the same thing over a

457
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,408
It's so much easier

458
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,712
You're for him particularly because

459
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,760
Whenever you making any kind of

460
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,784
You may need to just say

461
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,832
Like they did in OKC

462
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:52,672
And Guardians is prime to lend whatever Alex is saying more credibility

463
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,488
Looking at Alex's Behavior here on 911

464
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,024
And I really don't feel like

465
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,328
He's doing anything different from what he always does

466
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:04,704
He's got a conspiracy archetype that he's working with and he's applying it to the current Hot Topic

467
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:09,312
He has a guest whose expertise of being exaggerated in order to bolster their claims

468
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,384
He's got headlines that don't say what he

469
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,152
Sports they do

470
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,944
It's kind of dark but

471
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,224
I mean I don't really get the

472
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,504
The sense that this is much

473
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,040
More than another day at the office

474
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,320
Just for him

475
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:28,512
I mean I am assuming that in two or three days his friend is going to be the top structural engineer in New York City

476
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:33,120
The most prestige one of the most prestigious the financial sector

477
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,144
I know what he

478
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,216
Why can't I see the trick that he's doing

479
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,544
Already in this episode and it's not that

480
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,104
What he's doing is he's going to try and create

481
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,384
A bifurcated identity

482
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:51,040
Okay so he'll have his friend who was a financial analyst who was there was a first-hand account

483
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,576
Another

484
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,392
Reply will also be a structural engineer but it's not he

485
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,928
His friend it's his other friend

486
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,976
Implied that they're two different guys

487
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:03,072
Structural engineer and also I had a friend right

488
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,352
First hand account

489
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:09,216
So that that's a smooth way to do it then you never name that structural engineer

490
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,800
I need outside point out that he is actually a financial advisor

491
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,848
Who may be undergrad

492
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:21,248
It's like when somebody is an expert on MSNBC and then a few years later they show up on Fox Business with

493
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,528
Completely different special

494
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,552
What are you

495
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,880
Here we see

496
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,904
I mean look

497
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,184
This is just

498
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,464
I had to

499
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,536
Sit with this clip

500
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,072
Yeah it really frustrated

501
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,656
And I was actually the local KLBJ radio

502
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,776
When I get another structural engineer on from Texas A&M who did part of the analysis

503
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,872
Back in 1993 for the First World Trade Center bombing

504
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,408
China Fish wouldn't happen

505
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,480
And then the host City yeah

506
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:57,856
I was watching local news this morning right one and happened and then about 20 minutes later

507
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,928
30 minutes later when the first Tower collapse

508
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,464
The reporters were panicking

509
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,024
Explosion on the bottom floor

510
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,096
And the sounds were picked up by the audio.

511
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:13,216
Hyperspin machine is in overdrive just like in Oklahoma City telling us

512
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:17,312
The truck bomb outside blows out columns further back and blast them off

513
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,616
Wing Lee at the bottom making rebar

514
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,384
Concrete

515
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,408
Disappear

516
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,992
So you can see from that clip what I mean by the OKC stuff

517
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:31,392
Alex wants to wrap up his talking points and references to OKC so in order to even address any of his

518
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:36,512
It feels like you have to completely re-litigate all of his conspiracies about the Murrah building bombing

519
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,536
Before you do so

520
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:40,096
And you don't have to do the

521
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,400
This is a distraction tactic

522
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,680
Alex is employing

523
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:46,496
And it's totally okay to just ignore it for now

524
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:51,104
It's not relevant to the question of whether or not bombs took down the World Trade Center to talk about his

525
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,128
His ideas about

526
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:52,896
Oklahoma City

527
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,504
I want to track this story here that Alex is telling an illustrate to help with

528
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,576
Prophetic the level of sourcing he's using is to make the

529
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,344
This point

530
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:05,952
Alex was listening to a local show on KLBJ where the host said that

531
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:09,024
He had watched an unspecified local news show

532
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,352
Where they were saying there was a

533
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:17,728
Floor of the World Trade Center that was caught on the audio tape and now they're scrambling cuz there's a cover-up

534
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,776
Cuz it got caught to the sound oh no

535
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,568
This is useless

536
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,872
Even if you wanted to check on the

537
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,408
Let's claim what would you do

538
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,200
Sereno the Jeff Ward

539
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,480
What is the KLBJ host

540
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,552
TV station was he watching

541
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:38,208
Pretty much every local news station be running National coverage since so many of them are NBC or ABC or

542
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,000
CBS affiliates

543
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,560
Like I watched a fair amount of the news coverage

544
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:45,632
To me at all

545
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,680
But because of the vagueness of his claim

546
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:51,520
No matter what I say Alex could just Retreat to the claim that I just did

547
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,592
Watch the right videos it must have been on another Channel

548
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,152
I can definitely say that reporters

549
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,944
We're freaks out when the Builder

550
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:06,368
That was because two giant skyscrapers were falling and dust clouds are racing down the streets towards them and everyone was essentially run

551
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,416
For their lives having difficulty breathing

552
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,696
InstaCare

553
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,256
Here it actually is Alex's

554
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,072
One of his baby mama sees Nico

555
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,864
Who was reporting live

556
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,888
From

557
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,424
New York

558
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:22,240
And she had actually taken up shelter in a school

559
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,288
Running from the building

560
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,056
Things falling

561
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,592
Mika Brzezinski

562
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,384
Is downtown Macon

563
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,624
Hi Mika Brzezinski reporting from

564
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,024
PS 89 it's at it near the scene of the collapse of what we believe to be the

565
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,560
Number one of the World Trade

566
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:50,656
Center CBS News correspondent Byron Pitts we were coordinating our

567
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,936
Cruise-in

568
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:55,776
Crowd of people near the corner of Murray Avenue and the West Side Highway

569
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,336
When the collapse occurred and literally

570
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,104
Looms

571
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,872
Smoke

572
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:03,200
And gases as the collapse happened I'm sure you're seeing in the video

573
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,016
Began to roll or way and that is when the

574
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,808
The crowd went wild people just

575
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,832
Began to run

576
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,624
Our live truck shutdown

577
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,208
Crews were running reporters were running people running in the cops

578
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,864
Literally were just waving their arms saying go go go we are inside the school right now actually inside a small

579
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,632
Ballroom

580
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:27,520
Trying to stay clear of the crowds that are trying to get out of the way and also the evacuation of this school

581
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:33,152
School officials here are trying to get everybody out of the building in an orderly fashion as as quickly as possible

582
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,176
But again there is

583
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,712
So much confusion out on the

584
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,248
It is literally

585
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,832
Chaos out there we've got a short timeline here

586
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,624
School right now

587
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:43,904
Is

588
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,464
Is now putting on the intercom

589
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,232
Where kids

590
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,000
Need to go

591
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,048
To assemble W classes

592
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,352
Your chamber street they're trying to organize

593
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,120
The closet

594
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,656
These kids out of here safely is

595
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,960
Possible right now we're dealing with

596
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,728
The air

597
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,496
Because of the plumes

598
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,800
Smoke and gases Byron 2019 a weedeater

599
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:01,568
To move quickly

600
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,848
Because the

601
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,152
Smoke that was rolling our way in the debris is well

602
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,176
It's very thick and it

603
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,200
Could be very dangerous

604
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,504
It was already a chaotic situation

605
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,272
Before

606
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,808
The collapse happened in this is

607
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,832
Just piling up

608
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:16,416
More dangerous damage on top of what was already a very chaotic

609
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,440
Situation

610
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:23,840
I'm not sure any other reporters were too concerned with the b******* games Alex plays considering many of them were huddling in a class

611
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,912
Kids are trying to figure out how to reunite with their families

612
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,216
And everyone was worried about poison air

613
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,008
I don't feel like

614
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
This is

615
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,800
Alex being

616
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,944
Now I'm going to go ahead and say that yeah

617
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,504
Listens pretty bad

618
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,808
The previous clip

619
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,832
20000

620
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,112
Doesn't look so bad

621
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,648
Comparison to this

622
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,952
Makes things look real f*****-up

623
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:53,792
The part about the engineer from Texas A&M presents the same

624
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,840
Problem is Alex's other sourcing issue

625
00:29:56,608 --> 00:30:00,192
The details provided cannot possibly be sufficient to trace down this claim

626
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:06,336
I went to the Texas A&M Structural Engineering Department website and they have 15 faculty members listed

627
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,408
But you can see how we're no closer to knowing

628
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:13,248
I could go through all of these professors resumes and find nothing

629
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:17,344
Think I dwell what if the person I was talking about his retired or died

630
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,208
Hey guess what there are multiple reports and official reports that have been made

631
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,744
About

632
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,560
The 1993 World Trade Center bombing

633
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:29,376
I can go and find them and

634
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,168
I have so many of them

635
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,192
They don't have

636
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:34,240
Professor from Texas A&M

637
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:38,848
I just didn't find the right report you really dropped the ball on this one dad

638
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:44,736
There a lot of built-in loopholes to the to the details that Alex rattles often protected from

639
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,296
Attempts to make people proven naked

640
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:50,112
Like that no Texas A&M professor said that

641
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,160
Sore that the local news clip

642
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,208
He claims he heard a local radio host

643
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,000
Talk about doesn't exist

644
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,816
And he does that because he couldn't do anything else

645
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:02,656
He has to force you to do something impossible to prove him wrong

646
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:05,472
Because if you were forced to establish and defend his own claim

647
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,008
He will fail every time

648
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
And if you

649
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:12,896
If you get him to stay on that he'll be like but what about the Oklahoma City bombing

650
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:16,736
And that will try and get you to start arguing about the OKC bombing

651
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:19,808
So then you're already forgetting what you were supposed to be arguing about

652
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,088
Which was 9/11 the first

653
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:25,184
Once once you're not allowed to

654
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:30,560
He just pulled this tract

655
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:34,912
Balls everywhere just like anything shiny to get you away from the point

656
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:37,728
I think this is a good example of that

657
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,752
You're watching

658
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,776
My mind

659
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,056
Control unfold

660
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:46,944
Whether the government was involved in it or the European Union as they roll out the

661
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,968
The Euro this parts

662
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:48,992
Ashley Gold back

663
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,296
Trading above $2

664
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:55,904
Osama bin Laden

665
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,952
The 80s

666
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,720
Why is fam

667
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,488
Still bill

668
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,768
Are military bases in

669
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,304
Saudi Arabia

670
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,328
Weiser family

671
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,352
The Border

672
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,632
Satellite

673
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:11,008
I want to know why we didn't take Saddam out at 1991

674
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:11,776
50 miles

675
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,056
Downtown Baghdad

676
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:19,456
What is reached the phase of Alex's reporting where he asks a bunch of distracting questions that he knows the answer to

677
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,016
Yep GIF under been locked because he was fighting

678
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,576
The Communist enemy that you wanted people to fight

679
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,368
The bin Laden family get a lot of

680
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:29,440
Construction contract because they're not terrorists

681
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,976
And they run a really big

682
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,768
Construction Enterprise

683
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:39,168
Terrorism is not like it runs in the family I hear color

684
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,960
Sleeping with the Iridium satellite thing it

685
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:44,800
It's just people who are doing business who happen to be related to a terrorist and aren't

686
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,336
First themselves

687
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:50,688
In order to claim that this is nefarious or any of the stuff is nefarious

688
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,736
You need to provide some information other than

689
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,784
Say it like

690
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:59,648
I mean it's like I want to know why they let Osama bin Laden

691
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,976
I need to know why that man was allowed to go to college

692
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,168
You can't

693
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:15,008
Also as for why they didn't kill Saddam

694
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:18,848
You got me I don't really have an answer.

695
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,872
Honestly

696
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:26,272
Why you say probably a strategic reason of some sort maybe I don't know sometimes it's like who they decide to take a shower

697
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,808
Giada and who they don't is

698
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,832
Is not as

699
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,624
It doesn't make any sense

700
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:34,976
You know we're going to try and kill it we're going to try and kill this this leader

701
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:35,744
But this guy

702
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,536
We're not going to do that

703
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:41,376
I'm not sure what's a calculus went into that

704
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,936
So I guess if we want to get distracted

705
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:50,592
A good way for out I cannot talk about 9/11 on 9/11

706
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,640
Who do we kill list

707
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,200
Keep coming back

708
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,224
To this because it's

709
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,760
Seems bizarre to me

710
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,576
Alex seems to have no idea

711
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,672
Anything about operation Northwoods except

712
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,208
A blurb

713
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:12,352
From this Baltimore Sun article

714
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,376
That includes

715
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,400
Mentioned

716
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,680
Operation Northwood

717
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,984

00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,776
This is from the

00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,496
Blank Cuba

733
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,544
Create a pretext for Invasion the Oscar

734
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,384
For your new book about the National Security

735
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,688
How do I support that spilt bag

736
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,224
Adele

737
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,504
No but I don't support

738
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,528
Becoming Fidel.

739
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,296
Fightful

740
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,344
And the main headline is

741
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,416
Secret

742
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,184
Human race

743
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,952
Pretext

744
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,536
New York Times

745
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:16,864
She seems to think the name is Cuban Invasion pretext

746
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:22,496
It does seem that that's what he said called I think he's misreading

747
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,128
What what appears to be a book review maybe that was in The Baltimore Sun

748
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,200
Of a book that he totally read half of already

749
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:31,968
Already

750
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:38,368
Promise he doesn't have really any handle on much of the details outside of what would be in that book review

751
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,416
It does seem suspicious doesn't it does

752
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,952
Especially considering

753
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,720
That

754
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,560
You know you're supposed to be this person who

755
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:50,400
Would consider a document like that one of the most important things

756
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,936
Absolutely

757
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:54,240
Furthering your cause of spreading

758
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,264
Totally

759
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:58,592
You should probably know that thing inside and outside backwards forwards

760
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:06,272
I don't get the sense that he does pretty sure he has no idea what the name is because earlier it's like maybe he forgot or he

761
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:09,088
Pull it right away this is hours later

762
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:15,488
You should I mean you could have even looked at you could have read the article in the between tribe organized organized

763
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:21,632
He does hit the surface level of Northwoods

764
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,400
Really hard

765
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,728
Casualty list

766
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,496
That means blister

767
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,264
Dead people

768
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,824
A US newspaper

769
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,128
Bridgewood Plaza helpful wave of indignation

770
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,712
MMA in Memphis

771
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,296
We can pick a passenger ship we can blow up airliners

772
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,344
We can attack one tana Mobay in the Marine

773
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,136
They're using Army dressed up

774
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,464
Cuban

775
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,792
I mean they're here in this article

776
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,816
Quotes from the documents

777
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:53,376
Confirm wanting a blow-up airliner

778
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,192
Now it was signed on to

779
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:58,240
The Joint Chiefs of Staff

780
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,288
The Secretary of Defense

781
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,312
And Kennedy

782
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,616
Despite all his evil

783
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,408
God bless his soul

784
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,944
No way

785
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,248
CIA

786
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,320
Don't remember if

787
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,112
Yeah that's a funny story

788
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:16,160
We've talked about operator

789
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:18,976
Operation Northwoods a bit in the past and you know it

790
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,256
Not without

791
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,280
Describe

792
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,584
Staff

793
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,144
Not an actual

794
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,680
Attacker people

795
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
These will be fake

796
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,288
Pretend

797
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,568
People not actual dead

798
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:42,016
Got Diane really did a lot for Kennedy I think if he had lived he would be remembered as a realshit president but dying

799
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,040
Billy gave him a lot of

800
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,320
A lot of good Buzz

801
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,856
Really

802
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,136
It leads

803
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,672
People to

804
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:53,280
Come up with reasons for his death and a lot of them end up

805
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,656
Assassination of a president obviously would have to be pinned on the bad guy

806
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:04,032
So how many must be the good guy someone killed him

807
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:07,872
He was one of the Assassin was a good guy and he saved the world

808
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:12,736
I mean never even condemned we never even address that possibility

809
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:16,832
Get me Doctor Strange

810
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,368
So

811
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:20,160
This show my man

812
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,488
This is a real

813
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,024
Is it no

814
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,816
And I warned you on here

815
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,840
This show is not a game

816
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,168
This is not entertainment this is information

817
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:35,264
And I warned you over and over and over

818
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,288
Forget to call washing

819
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:42,176
And we know you're behind the terror

820
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,480
I do have to tell you how often do grocery store today

821
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,528
This morning right what happened

822
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,320
Get something

823
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,088
Everybody a noun

824
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,136
Alex we know you're right the government blew it

825
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,696
Maybe the EU doing

826
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,584
Wow

827
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,888
What a time at that grocery store

828
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,544
Everyone's like I have Alex alright hero of 911

829
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:14,688
Autocorrect might be the EU

830
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:21,344
Sharkboy be too crazy even for f****** nuts you nothing

831
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,648
Oh my God

832
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,416
Alex

833
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:27,744
This is too hard of a swing for 2001

834
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,512
Two Hearted

835
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:32,352
I don't not popular enough for

836
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:36,448
The f****** abuse of saying

837
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:40,288
If you had called your Senators more

838
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,824
911 wooden

839
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,592
Have happened

840
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,920
There is a little bit of an undertone of that

841
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,456
There is an undertone of that

842
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:50,272
Yeah everybody had listened to me harder

843
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,552
This wouldn't have happened

844
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:56,160
I think it's one reading of that there's another reason the kind of goes like we tried our best

845
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:59,232
You know like no matter how many people called

846
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:05,632
You know you can have a clear conscience because you could

847
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,424
Possible but it ain't no being generous

848
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:13,824
I'm going to lean more towards the ungenerous interpretation

849
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,896
What's about to happen is unthinkably offer

850
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,432
You have to

851
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:23,296
Are you at the dispenza events this week so far to the generous

852
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:26,368
In order to understand how bad this is

853
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:30,976
And whatever ill feelings you might have about dinner at 4

854
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:34,048
Blaming his audience are not calling

855
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,328
They are

856
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,888
A pittance compared to what's about to happen

857
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,704
Caught wind of

858
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,728
The fact that

859
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,288
The people onboard hitbox

860
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,080
Steve

861
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:50,176
And solution is the same solution that he has for everything

862
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,968
I'm somebody

863
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,576
Arm the pilots

864
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,368
Windows exploding Air Marshal ball

865
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,648
Any of us can buy

866
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,184
It'll go through about an inch

867
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,208
Something but nothing more

868
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:08,608
And put an armored bulkhead door on those aircraft and I'm hearing these guys

869
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,192
Supposedly

870
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,216
Planes of paper

871
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,496
The box cutters

872
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,312
He pulled a box cutter on me and.

873
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,384
Mommy I take them away and broken

874
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,920
Don't brag about how

875
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,944
Mister tough guy but

876
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,760
Sounds pretty rough

877
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:31,136
So they can obviously this machismo this I would f*** this guy up chair

878
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,160
That's to be expected

879
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,464
She has a real Macho problem

880
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,768
But where this takes him

881
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,560
I think is

882
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:42,656
The angle that he's taking with this in his neck

883
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,936
Clip

884
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,472
I was I was disgusted

885
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,824
I just walked over and grab it maybe I'm stupid

886
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,895
School

887
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:53,919
Tackle

888
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,223
You got piles in a Plane full of people

889
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,783
They supposedly have box cutters how do we know this

890
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,855
The former Clinton administration people was on board

891
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,647
Wife

892
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,927
Longboard at aircraft

893
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:05,951
Call Pomona

894
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:06,975
Phone to cell phone

895
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:14,143
And you believe that do on a plane with man enough

896
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,727
Complain to somebody got a box

897
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,287
Are you believe that they would fly A10

898
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,847
The 500 miles an hour that thing was moving

899
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,639
Pothos planes into that building

900
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,919
I got a bridge I want

901
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,687
Want to sell you

902
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,991
Score we're getting there is punk

903
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,551
I can't believe that you had hundreds of

904
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,831
Sheep on those planes

905
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,879
He probably shut around me

906
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:38,719
You can't kill me with it go ahead and cut me I'm coming in

907
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,255
Maybe a double-edged

908
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,791
Stiletto style dagger

909
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,327
Patty more deadly the person

910
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,703
Any man would do that any

911
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,727
Woman would do that

912
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:56,383
So there's a lot of uncertainty in terms of the details of exactly how these hijackings white so I'm not going to dip too far in

913
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:59,455
Into that pool but there's something I think it's important to point out

914
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:06,111
On the evening of 9/11 Alex is getting on his nationally syndicated radio show and arguing that the people who

915
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,671
Who died on those hijacked planes were cowards

916
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,439
And not big

917
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,975
Strong boys like him

918
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,255
That's completely disgusting

919
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,047
Years

920
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,071
Years

921
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,863
Years after this

922
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,143
After 9/11

923
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,679
More than a decade

924
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:24,543
Mark Wahlberg would say the same thing and still people be like that

925
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:30,943
F****** awful I think monster

926
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:31,967
I'm not

927
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:38,367
Really caught up on all of Mark Wahlberg's comments but my understanding is just that it wouldn't have happened if he was there

928
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:44,255
I don't know why but somehow that's kind of okay because that's not

929
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:50,655
Impugning the people who are on board as much as it is elevating yourself which people were

930
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,447
Rightly criticizing him for

931
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,495
Sure Alex is doing both

932
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,799
Alex is elevating himself

933
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,591
I'm calling everybody else coward

934
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:04,223
Are not man or woman enough to do what is human nature

935
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,759
Right on the day

936
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,063
Day of their

937
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,391
Find this gross I don't know how to

938
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,415
I don't know how to live

939
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,695
Did I lie

940
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,767
I've never been in a hijacking

941
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:19,839
Situation but I think I can imagine some scenarios where you would

942
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:22,911
Think it was a good idea to attack the terrorists who taken over

943
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,679
For the plane

944
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:28,031
For one thing it's unlikely that you'd think they were going to crash the plane into a building

945
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:33,663
A lot of hijackings are done to hold hostages for financial gains or to spread political messages

946
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:38,271
And I can see thinking that you might survive the ordeal like they might just landed

947
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:41,087
Cuba if you have a knowledge of

948
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:44,159
Playing the history overtime you're like

949
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,463
S*** there were actually a lot of hijacking

950
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:52,863
Kings for a while and everybody lived

951
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,655
Pizza Heist type of

952
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,679
Hijacking

953
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,727
Used to make the situation worse

954
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,007
By trying to fight back

955
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,799
You could be increasing

956
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,079
That the plane crashes

957
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,127
And you or someone else is killed

958
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:04,895
Right now

959
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,431
In hindsight

960
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:09,503
It's easy to see how the people on those planes were essentially do

961
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:13,855
But it seems so unfair and disrespectful to take this kind of tone

962
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:17,183
Particularly less than 24 hours after the attacks

963
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,719
Alex's soul

964
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:24,351
Gross it's the it's that impulse though that they all have the people who are like this tragedy happen

965
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,631
Can give somebody a gun there

966
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:28,703
You do give a teacher a gun in school like all of those thing

967
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:35,359
It's because what they're really doing is expressing their fantasy of give me a gun let me go back in time end

968
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,383
That situation

969
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,431
So I can personally be a hero

970
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:43,039
Right because I know everything that would have happened so I can be the winner there

971
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:49,439
There is a bit of that there's absolute is it self-aggrandizement if you are saying give teachers a gun to protect

972
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,975
Students you are saying

973
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:51,743
I could

974
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,279
Protect everybody if I had a gun

975
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,815
That's what you're really saying

976
00:45:55,327 --> 00:46:01,471
And that's what he's saying right there I can print I can fight off a tie Jacker I can fight off a terrorist I can do it all just

977
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,495
Just put me in there

978
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,287
I find it less

979
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,311
Abhorrent

980
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:08,127
To say I could do these things

981
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,663
It may be right

982
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,711
It's maybe an expression of narcissism

983
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,247
It's maybe wrong

984
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:16,831
It's definitely not the time for it to the negative

985
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,855
No

986
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,927
But I there is something different about it being

987
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,463
Presented as

988
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,231
I don't believe

989
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,023
This story because

990
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,303
Any human

991
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,399
Who isn't a complete pile of s*** coward

992
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:33,471
I would have taken over the plane from the hijackers

993
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,519
I find that to be a

994
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:36,287
Like

995
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:39,871
It's A Bridge Too Far Man been played are here for you

996
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,407
Maybe he was just thinking

997
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,175
That's a hopeful

998
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,455
Yeah

999
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:47,039
Let's get a look at them under oath let's see what he says

1000
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,575
That would take some calls

1001
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,367
And one guy

1002
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,135
Michaels in

1003
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,671
And now it's wants his take

1004
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,719
But unfortunately he does not give the right to

1005
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,535
Trying

1006
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:01,631
That's juices take a little bit to the right place

1007
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,167
Kim in Virginia

1008
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,191
You think happened here today

1009
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,567
Well your gut level from all the others we brought

1010
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,335
Here

1011
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,871
Down here before the Sabbath

1012
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,639
Predicting it

1013
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,431
And all the others we've been collating

1014
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:18,527
Oh well

1015
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,319
It could be

1016
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:24,671
People have probably had most of the

1017
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,951
Money and

1018
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,255
Probably around

1019
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,583
Yeah but who stands to gain from the

1020
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:36,703
Something where is senior sales here and we really Hotel

1021
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:37,727
Who stands against

1022
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:42,591
Washington the market sorority and floating on Friday and Monday

1023
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,871
They were already talking about

1024
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:44,895
Spending Trading

1025
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,199
But even more than wife

1026
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,991
There is a fissure in the New World Order

1027
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,015
Reported by our

1028
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,039
Scholarship

1029
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,319
Fisher

1030
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:54,367
Dr. Coleman dr. Kaufman

1031
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,391
Dr. Monty

1032
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,927
General pardon

1033
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,207
We're talkin about

1034
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:02,303
Doing right now

1035
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,327
Stores and Banks

1036
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,351
Yeah man

1037
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:08,447
He's really pushing the EU did 911 on 9/11

1038
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:14,847
He's pretending that he's getting this analysis from hold these people I mean he is not getting it

1039
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,943
He said multiple times on the show he can't get ahold of Bret Hart

1040
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:22,527
He's perpetually busy

1041
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:28,415
So now you telling us that this guy is giving him information that there's a fissure in the globalist camp

1042
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:30,975
And that is led to the EU

1043
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:36,351
911 I would say

1044
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,631
First of all f*** you

1045
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:40,191
A letter first second

1046
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:45,055
Why should I have any faith you're dumb dumb friends have any idea if the

1047
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,615
Globalists are getting along I mean

1048
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:54,015
Because they do they give us weekly or globalist us

1049
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:56,575
There's a Maxim magazine but just for Global

1050
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,855
Haha

1051
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:04,767
I think this is dumb but it is really funny to see Alex

1052
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,167
This guy to say eat

1053
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:13,471
He's really into the EU

1054
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,263
So we're watching the destruction ladies

1055
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,799
I don't know who did it

1056
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,615
Was it Ben Laden acting alone

1057
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,175
20% chance

1058
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,455
What is this government

1059
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,015
30% chance

1060
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:30,111
Didn't you seems 98q and her operatives

1061
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,135
Shakopee

1062
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,415
Or Brian control subjects

1063
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,695
50%

1064
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,999
That's my analysis

1065
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,535
Frankly I've never been wrong

1066
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,327
I wish I was wrong everyday

1067
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,911
Congratulations your wishes with gray

1068
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,191
Every single day

1069
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:44,959
You have

1070
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:49,055
You do not need a genie

1071
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:54,175
Earlier in the day 98% chances are government

1072
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:56,479
The globalists right in our government

1073
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:59,295
So Alex earlier in the day

1074
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,063
His buddy

1075
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,391
Who was Aiden at our nearby

1076
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:06,719
Witness the attack

1077
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:08,255
Maybe he had him on

1078
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,303
And it blossomed

1079
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,143
Into a

1080
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:17,471
I am so just for good measure Alex has him back on

1081
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,007
So the EU did the

1082
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,031
Controlled demolition

1083
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:32,831
I don't know what I don't know why your pictures

1084
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,855
So Jim is back

1085
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:37,439
Alex has new bomb evidence for him to sign off on

1086
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,463
Now

1087
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,487
Jimmy

1088
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,535
You have a degree in engineering

1089
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:44,607
And without me even prompting you and your wife called me

1090
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,399
Here at home

1091
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:49,471
We got the interview of that post on the website right now

1092
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,263
And said that

1093
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:53,055
Let me know Alex Jimmy was there

1094
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,591
And then

1095
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,127
She gave me her cell phone number we got

1096
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:57,919
You were literally walking

1097
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,199
Charred bodies

1098
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,735
They were piling up

1099
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,063
You

1100

Punjabi rapper

1102
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,439
Scene

1103
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,999
Now I'm hearing all local and National radio

1104
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,535
And we've heard reports

1105
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,839
This morning it was a reporter out front is one building

1106
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,119
Another one

1107
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:17,887
Smoking

1108
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,935
The first one

1109
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,239
You'd explode in the bottom

1110
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:24,031
Airporter jumper cover

1111
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:27,359
The structural engineer who designed

1112
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,895
The building is

1113
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,431
Chicago Tribune

1114
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:34,271
Just out on infowars.com of the viewers Phylicia

1115
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,295
Would like to see that

1116
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,599
Shangri-La

1117
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,623
He designed it

1118
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,671
How to take out the 777

1119
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:43,999
What time is it

1120
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,839
Time does chop't

1121
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,119
The top of the building off

1122
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,167
Strong building

1123
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,959
Instead you see a perfect

1124
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:53,727
Falling

1125
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,519
Nnn

1126
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,799
As the top

1127
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,615
How what were your,

1128
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,151
Agreed

1129
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:04,991
Person is structural engineering

1130
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:05,759
Play one of my

1131
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,527
Colleagues

1132
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,063
Who's also a

1133
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,599
Construction engineering

1134
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:11,135
Weave

1135
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:11,903
Weave

1136
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,951
Watch the time in both of our,

1137
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:15,743
The building

1138
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:17,791
Chick-fil-A

1139
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:18,815
Eminem

1140
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,167
Straight down

1141
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:24,447
Which

1142
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:27,007
Is very hard thing to accomplish

1143
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,543
Structural steel building

1144
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,079
Because the

1145
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:30,847
Steelton

1146
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:38,015
So we listen to the morning show and at no point during those interviews was Jim walking through burning corpses that were

1147
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:38,783
Piling up

1148
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:44,927
That's a disgusting grotesque and exploitative image that Alex is painting and he should be ashamed

1149
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:45,951
That was his instinct

1150
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:46,975
To do something

1151
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:50,559
But in this clip you can see the larger game that Alex

1152
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,327
Who's playing

1153
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:56,191
He's got his Structural Engineering expert back on so we can lay out this new bombing evidence

1154
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,775
Billy Gilmour. Loaded endorsement of the

1155
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:00,543
Conspiracy

1156
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:02,079
Ideas

1157
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:06,431
You can tell so clearly how Alex is listing this stuff off for gym

1158
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,711
I'm as if to explain

1159
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:08,735
For him

1160
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:09,759
What he want

1161
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,295
What's Jim to say in response

1162
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,063
Yeah

1163
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:16,159
I went to essentially trying to exploit his family friend here and he's doing it

1164
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:19,231
Using intentional misrepresentation to sources

1165
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,535
A meaningless references to things

1166
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:24,607
He claims to have heard a local radio guy say

1167
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,887
How about a local news

1168
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:28,447
Allegedly saw

1169
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,727
It's

1170
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,263
Yeah I mean this is

1171
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,287
The way you talk

1172
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,591
Is like this is the type of coaching

1173
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,359
Can you do off

1174
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:41,759
Are Nares sounds natural when they actually sent you the s*** that you want them to or it's like in an interrogation

1175
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:48,159
Gation room if I was in the room with him I be like

1176
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:51,743
The lawyer

1177
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:55,839
You're not under arrest you're good you're good

1178
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:58,143
So I mentioned

1179
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:00,191
That there was a little bit of

1180
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:02,495
A repeated thing about

1181
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,799
The idea that bodies were burning

1182
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:05,823
Inflaming and

1183
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:09,407
People jumping on fire in

1184
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:12,735
He's still on that tip

1185
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,015
And I think that there's something

1186
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,063
Admirable

1187
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,111
Knowing nothing else about Jim Wright

1188
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,135
Inmate

1189
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:21,183
He does try and moderate this a little bit

1190
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,463
Germany

1191
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,231
Nobody

1192
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,279
The people coming out of the building

1193
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,095
Weavile

1194
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,887
Exaggeration

1195
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,495
Building but we we did

1196
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,823
He is at least

1197
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,871
Trying to not play along with the plan

1198
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,663
Was Alex's s*** Betty's

1199
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:42,687
Clearly

1200
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:44,223
The exploited

1201
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,295
This kind of

1202
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,319
Feeling of like

1203
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:50,623
But maybe this guy isn't so bad

1204
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,927
A part of it comes from this clip

1205
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:55,231
Anything else you'd like to

1206
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:56,255
Add

1207
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:57,535
Samurai

1208
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:01,119
People that are building

1209
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:04,959
It's better trap

1210
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,567
Alright Jimmy Ryan I really

1211
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,847
We appreciate you joining us

1212
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:17,503
That's the first time that that kind of concern has been voiced and Alex's response

1213
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:21,599
Okay fine moving on dickwad way to get me nothing like

1214
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,367
Look at

1215
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:24,415
Look at what's being said

1216
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:27,743
Jim is pointing out that some people are still too

1217
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:32,095
That's an awareness that Alex's listeners wouldn't have

1218
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:37,215
He's not reported on anything like that on the

1219
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:39,263
The circumstances on the ground the

1220
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:41,055
The human tragedy

1221
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,335
B b

1222
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,127
Because it's not important

1223
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,663
No and it's not his

1224
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:52,063
Movie it's not as movie of the person walking through dead bodies in the flames in the wreckage and there are no serve

1225
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:55,391
Survivors because if there are no survivors you don't have to worry about

1226
00:55:55,903 --> 00:56:02,047
Helping people that years of to worry about Klaus Schwab well I won't know about another twenty years you got

1227
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,863
What is the big bad guy in the world

1228
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,655
Start saving and helping people in

1229
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:11,519
Well or at least have to explain why they are not concerned

1230
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:13,823
So six more calls

1231
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,127
And he gets a guy who

1232
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,687
Brings up an idea that Alex will take two

1233
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:21,759
Quite a bit and I'll be sure and that is

1234
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:22,527
No

1235
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:23,807
Planes remote

1236
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:26,879
Control

1237
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,671
Complicated

1238
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,719
And I just wonder what the chance

1239
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,535
You know there's a technology

1240
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,327
Aircraft

1241
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,631
Operate totally on electronics

1242
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:45,055
It's funny you bring that up

1243
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:46,079
Jim

1244
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,103
Arjon

1245
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:47,871
That's okay

1246
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:51,967
Did you see on my website the fox say

1247
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,015
Television piece about the

1248
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,295
Second

1249
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,135
The X-Files talk show

1250
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:05,279
Text control of an airplane

1251
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:08,095
My computer and tries to crash

1252
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,119
Kid in the world

1253
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,655
Trade

1254
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:12,447
Spinner

1255
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,727
Ketchup's like

1256
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:16,287
Governor keating's brother white writing that book final

1257
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,055
Aldehyde

1258
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:20,127
3 years before the Oklahoma City bombing

1259
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,175
Where he mentions mister

1260
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:22,943
McVay

1261
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:24,735
And Liang burpee

1262
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,551
Federal Building

1263
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,855
They like to brag don't they

1264
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:31,391
Yes the other Technologies

1265
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,671
Is there the satellite

1266
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:33,439
Turn place

1267
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,767
To look the lone gunmen episode doesn't prove s*** but

1268
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:42,655
It's the kind of evidence that Alex really loves blows people's mind what

1269
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:49,311
And that book bag you could have easily put in the mix

1270
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,079
Tails after the fact

1271
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,103
Publix

1272
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:54,175
Three years prior that's all Oklahoma City

1273
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,223
Conspiracy Lord antrax

1274
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:56,991
To pretend it is

1275
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,015
Hello tushy

1276
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:00,575
Basically

1277
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,343
Nothing

1278
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,391
Right it's exciting that nothing

1279
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,671
Yeah

1280
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:05,439
So you didn't

1281
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,463
Pieces of nothing

1282
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,255
It is a little bit of

1283
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:11,583
Like proving 911 was fake by

1284
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,631
Pointing to a Mandela effect

1285
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:16,447
Of the Berenstain Bears you know and they're like

1286
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:22,847
See I got to be honest I'm convinced yet and I mean well it's if it's spelled differently then then I guess you're right

1287
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:24,895
Samantha

1288
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:26,687
Blue my mind

1289
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:27,455
Tonka

1290
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,991
I could not have been prepared

1291
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:31,551
I told you we had wide open

1292
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:34,623
We're about to go back to John

1293
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,391
Kingsville

1294
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:36,927
Whitening

1295
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:37,951
Missouri Cindy

1296
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:38,719
In West Virginia

1297
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:40,511
Perry Oklahoma darilyn

1298
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,047
Texas and other

1299
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,119
But coming up in the Box

1300
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,143
510 minutes

1301
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,495
The song it was in the world

1302
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,263
Financial

1303
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,799
Center right next door to the world

1304
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:55,359
Expect

1305
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,383
Gas is my

1306
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,151
Friend

1307
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:57,919
Joe Rogan

1308
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:58,943
What

1309
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:01,503
Call Robert

1310
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:07,903
No-No No-No No-No No-No No-No No-No

1311
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,439
Do not tell me

1312
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:15,583
That Joe Rogan was on Alex Jones Show on 911 9911

1313
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:24,799
Okay I need more

1314
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:27,615
Showing up

1315
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:33,247
I guess it's kind of different because Richard Belzer was on but they the Boston bombing

1316
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:39,647
But that was just a coincidence he was there and then he decided to stick around cuz there was a bombing happen

1317
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:44,511
Is Rogan coming on because there was a bombing and he wants

1318
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,815
Talk about it

1319
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:49,375
Why do that why do we why isn't isn't known

1320
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:56,031
What is he talking about it I feel like I've talked about his friendship with the night of 9/11

1321
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,687
No

1322
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:09,087
You always remember where you were on the evening of 9/11

1323
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:13,183
Why is this I wasn't ready for that

1324
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,463
LPR

1325
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:17,023
I was expecting literally any I was like

1326
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:23,423
Ready for the Newton I was ready for anybody but I can't believe it

1327
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:27,007
1 Rogan to Newsradio Rogan

1328
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:31,615
Now this is a few years after that it is a fact

1329
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:33,663
This is yelling at people

1330
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:35,199
Rogan

1331
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,479
I don't know the

1332
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:37,759
I don't know

1333
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:38,527
Do you make this up

1334
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:41,087
I tried to refuse I believe

1335
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:47,743
You have gone back in time and forced me to mend together if I could manifest by our life

1336
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,535
I would not do that

1337
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,303
Please don't

1338
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:54,399
Alexandra has basically convinced himself of his own

1339
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,167
Conspiracy

1340
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:00,543
I'll get on the phone

1341
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,847
Today was recalled

1342
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,127
Interrupt your son in Senate

1343
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:05,919
And avoid

1344
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,455
Concerned about what happened

1345
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:10,015
Hear from us right now more than ever

1346
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:12,575
And are you letting them know that you smell a rat

1347
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,391
I don't know what I thought about the building

1348
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:18,719
Obviously

1349
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,023
Structural engineer

1350
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:27,167
It sure did

1351
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:29,727
Yeah

1352
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:30,495
Because of shape

1353
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,287
The Columns at the bay

1354
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:37,663
So none of that's real I mean right had a friend of his who knows a little bit about engineering

1355
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:41,503
Amateur engineer which is not

1356
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,551
Sure I mean unless he's a train

1357
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:44,831
Model train guy

1358
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:48,927
You could probably build

1359
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,463
Maybe so

1360
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,743
Yeah you got that

1361
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:58,143
Congratulations that's not much to go on Chicago

1362
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,167
Great

1363
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,447
Well it's confirmed

1364
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:03,263
There's nothing here

1365
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,055
There's literally nothing

1366
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:07,103
But it's loud nothing

1367
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:10,687
And it's interesting nothing like the lone gunmen

1368
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:12,479
Beyond the thought

1369
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:14,271
The impulse

1370
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:16,319
That a human being would have

1371
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:17,343
2

1372
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,135
Think after her

1373
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:22,207
Hours after two planes

1374
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:24,255
Took down the World Trade Center

1375
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:26,047
20,000-plus people are dead

1376
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,071
You call

1377
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,863
Lindsey Graham

1378
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,399
To tell him

1379
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:33,471
That there were charges on the bottom of the building

1380
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:40,127
Because I misread or I didn't read a Chicago Tribune article

1381
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,687
And then Alex says

1382
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,735
They need that now more than ever

1383
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:46,527
Yes

1384
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:47,551
Right now

1385
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:52,671
That is the first thing that are exactly

1386
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:54,719
They'll never do anything about it

1387
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:55,999
If it weren't for this guy

1388
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:58,303
So Alex is just misusing

1389
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,839
Sources and s***

1390
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:00,607
But

1391
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,887
It's also intention

1392
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:06,751
Large passenger plane medium size

1393
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:12,127
World Trade Center

1394
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:14,687
Designer

1395
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:16,223
How the towers

1396
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:18,015
Is saying

1397
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:19,295
Is impossible what happened

1398
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:20,319
Only shape

1399
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:22,111
The bottom could cause that

1400
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,391
That's what he said

1401
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,159
Kevin boots

1402
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:26,463
My brother-in-law

1403
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:28,511
Do I know

1404
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,279
Very well

1405
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,303
Who is it

1406
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,327
Investment guide

1407
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,351
That works in a pint

1408
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,375
Towers of it explode

1409
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,423
He was an eyewitness

1410
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,191
Several hundred yards

1411
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,239
Countdown

1412
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:40,031
How we got the Pentagon

1413
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:40,799
Attack

1414
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:45,919
You simply would not act like this if you were a sincere person acting with honest motive

1415
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:48,223
If your goal was to deliver the facts

1416
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:50,015
Or even the facts as

1417
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,039
Do you see them

1418
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:54,367
You would not mess around and fake your sources like this

1419
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:58,719
This isn't sloppiness this can only really be the product of intentional deception

1420
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:03,583
Giant manipulations that Alex is trying to pull off in that clip

1421
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:06,911
The first is the way he discusses the Chicago Tribune article

1422
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:13,567
The engineers who designed the World Trade Center didn't say that this was impossible but now Alex is saying that and

1423
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:17,151
In language that makes it sound like this Source included them saying

1424
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:19,455
That only shaped charges could do this

1425
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:25,343
This includes that as an extension of his sentence where he's relaying the alleged comments from this engineer

1426
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,367
Anyone listening

1427
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,671
Would obviously think this was Alex

1428
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,951
Continuing to convey

1429
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:30,975
What was

1430
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:32,511
In this Tribune article

1431
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:35,327
In reality it's just Alex making s*** up

1432
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,119
If you read it

1433
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:43,775
Then there would be quotation marks around a certain spot right and then it would be a, and then his editorializing would continue

1434
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:44,799
But if you're listening

1435
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:47,871
Intuit you don't know where those care quotes are everywhere you go

1436
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,919
This isn't something he's doing on accident

1437
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:52,991
It's to make his s*** talk appear like it's reporting

1438
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:58,111
The second thing is that Alex is doing is the

1439
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,415
He's characterizing his interview with Jim Wright

1440
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:04,255
You can see in that 40-second clip he mentions talking to Jim

1441
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,023
Twice

1442
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:08,095
But he's trying to make it seem like he's mentions are about to differ

1443
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,119
People that he's interview

1444
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:14,495
What Mansion is a family friend who was a first-hand witness the other is a

1445
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:15,519
Structural engineer

1446
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:19,103
If you were just trying to recap for anyone to and again

1447
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:19,871
You wouldn't

1448
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,151
Resent things this way

1449
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:27,807
He mentioned the structural engineer that he had all been lies about the Tribune article that talks about his friend who is an investment banker

1450
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:28,831
First-hand Witness

1451
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:35,743
The two characterizations of Jim's interview are separated because Alex is hoping to disconnect these ideas

1452
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:39,071
In his listeners mind in order to make the narrative stick

1453
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:39,839
Easier

1454
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:43,423
The first-hand witness Jim Wright news an investment banker

1455
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,447
Current trend of Alex's

1456
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:48,799
Should be something interesting that happened on the show but ultimately it should be forgot

1457
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,847
All Alex wants the audience

1458
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:57,247
Remember is that there was a seemingly very knowledgeable structural engineer

1459
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,783
11

1460
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,087
Who said that the building had to have had explosion

1461
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:02,623
There's no way would fall

1462
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:05,951
Alex does this kind of s*** all the time

1463
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:09,023
In his deposition for the Texas Sandy Hook case

1464
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:12,351
There was a particularly good illustration of this same behavior

1465
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,399
Mister Jones before we break

1466
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,679
I'm asked you about your

1467
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,703
Your statement about what

1468
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:20,799
How big

1469
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:26,687
Then you said that

1470
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,479
School investigation

1471
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,271
Who were the who

1472
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:34,879
Another group

1473
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,231
Southern jobs

1474
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:45,631
Anthony said that in addition to those two

1475
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:46,911
That

1476
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,191
School safety Expo

1477
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:49,727
Who was that

1478
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,567
Righttime in all of these

1479
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:00,735
This is one of Alex's very common tactic

1480
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:04,831
6 World take one piece of information obscure it and then multiply it into a bunch of different

1481
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:05,599
Places

1482
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,927
Pieces of information to create the appearance

1483
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:11,743
30th so much more evidence than he actually does

1484
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:17,631
His deposition just said that Wolfgang halbig it been threatened it would

1485
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:18,399
Seem like

1486
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:23,007
A very specific incident that relates to one person who is also harassing victim

1487
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:23,775
Family member

1488
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:28,383
Alex is rhetorical magic the Specter of staple

1489
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:30,431
Lewis School investigation expert

1490
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:33,759
Am school safety experts that have been threatened

1491
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:34,527
The appearance of a

1492
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:37,087
Giant coordinated effort to intimidate

1493
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:40,159
The people who would be in a position to challenge the official narrative

1494
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:41,695
Of what happened at Sandy Hook

1495
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:42,975
This is an effect

1496
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:45,791
Tool to use because if you are paying close attention or you

1497
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:46,559
If you haven't listened

1498
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:48,095
Somebody episode where berries things

1499
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:49,631
Are alleged to have happened

1500
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:52,191
You may just passively accept it outside

1501
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:54,239
Katana details that he's working off of

1502
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:56,031
Well that's definitely not the case

1503
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,311
You assume

1504
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:02,943
That he has this structural engineer professional Defenders the first

1505
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:06,015
Are the same person and he's not a structural engineer

1506
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:11,647
It helps it helps that you're listening to it on the radio otherwise you would have to like if you were seeing this in real life

1507
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:13,951
His friend would be wearing a nice suit

1508
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,487
Investment banker salary

1509
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:18,815
And then Structural Engineering his friends would go behind the curtain

1510
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:20,351
Put a little cap on a must

1511
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,631
Fashion be like

1512
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,911
Dear friend

1513
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:25,471
Yeah on the other radio you get away with that a lot easier

1514
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:31,871
Write in pencil like in the same way that Alex wants this to appear like there's a number of things

1515
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:34,175
Not just Wolfgang halbig wine

1516
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:35,199
Brightright

1517
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:39,807
It's that appeared because the actual reality sucks and it doesn't work for him

1518
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:43,135
The actual reality of his interview with Jim right also doesn

1519
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:43,903
Work

1520
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:46,207
And so he has to obscure it and create

1521
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,767
Multiple tendrils that he can use for different

1522
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:49,535
Things

1523
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:52,351
Out of it and that's something that he does a bit

1524
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:55,423
And that's really difficult

1525
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,447
The trace down

1526
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,727
One of the

1527
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:00,287
It's one of the tactics but he uses that it's

1528
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,823
It's

1529
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:03,103
It requires

1530
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:06,175
Having listened to a ton of his s***

1531
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:11,807
That's where this is coming from

1532
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:13,087
Kind of self-contained

1533
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,111
To some extent

1534
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:16,415
You know like he's referencing this thing to happen

1535
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:18,975
Earlier the day we listen to that episode

1536
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:20,255
And so like that help

1537
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,303
Make that

1538
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,863
Crackdown easier

1539
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:25,887
We think they're like

1540
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:28,191
I'll never be able to know what the fuc

1541
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:32,287
He's talking about you know this is one of the things that I think is probably the most

1542
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:39,199
Common and may be useful tool of media literacy at all is just understanding what people

1543
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,223
People are saying when they say

1544
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:45,343
You know like you read any number of different things about any number of different things

1545
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:48,671
And they're quoting experts and the people who are they're quoting

1546
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,487
Don't trust

1547
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:52,767
Pope

1548
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:58,143
Conditionally truck

1549
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,423
But not whenever Alex

1550
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,471
So expert

1551
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:04,287
Pixelmon

1552
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:07,359
News radio station

1553
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:12,991
You do the space episode one time he was well he did destroy ever

1554
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:15,039
Joe girelli

1555
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:21,183
Pokemon

Joe Rogan

1557
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:26,303
Alex

1558
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:28,095
Here to go to the Hollywood

1559
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:28,863
Perspective

1560
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:30,143
Good body knows all about

1561
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,679
Joe Rogan

1562
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:35,263
Popular

1563
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,287
Ascend Decatur

1564
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:38,847
Host of Fear

1565
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,151
Scott's number one rated

1566
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,175
Show on

1567
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:43,967
Anodyne

1568
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:50,879
I'm just really excited about how

1569
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:53,695
Hey Alex

1570
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:54,463
What's going on man

1571
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,999
I don't want to sound like a dick

1572
01:10:56,255 --> 01:11:02,399
Because I love Newsradio and I think Rogan was great and Israel but you're kidding yourself if you said he's one of the top guys

1573
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,423
Eyes on that show

1574
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,703
It was an ensemble casts

1575
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:05,983
Fast but you're high

1576
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:09,055
If you think that he was on the varsity level of that ensemble

1577
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:13,151
Maybe I actually sat down and thought about this

1578
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:14,943
For quite a while

1579
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:16,991
Best 6 banana

1580
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,527
Yeah you think so yeah

1581
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:24,927
What's a Foley and Phil Hartman or tied for first

1582
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:29,535
Right below the 100% is amazing Envy Lake

1583
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:30,815
The clump

1584
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:31,583
Of the top

1585
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,631
The Ensemble

1586
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:35,423
Then there's the people who have

1587
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,983
Like storylines that

1588
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:43,359
Pretty consistently Vicki Lewis

1589
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:45,919
And you have Jimmy James Stephen Root

1590
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:48,735
A man underneath that you have

1591
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:51,295
Khandi Alexander

1592
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:54,111
And that's cuz Candy Alexander

1593
01:11:54,367 --> 01:12:00,511
Brutal underused shooter

1594
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:03,839
So been somewhat underused used

1595
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:10,239
Exactly the right amount cuz anymore and he would be exactly like Rogan which is annoying and really bothersome to me

1596
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:12,031
Barry Hospital

1597
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:17,407
An argument can be made that he has

1598
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,687
But

1599
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:21,247
Yeah man Stephen Root is sneak

1600
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:23,295
Watching news radio then

1601
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:25,087
I would not have thought one

1602
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:27,135
Stephen Root is going to look better

1603
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:33,535
30 years later he's going to have the career that maybe I envy the most out of anybody ever

1604
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:35,839
He's a solid at Candy's amazing

1605
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:42,495
6 memorable moments certainly one of the

1606
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:43,263
All time

1607
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:47,103
Not many Beyond.

1608
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:52,991
He's he's part of that just talked about shaft

1609
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:54,783
That is true like a

1610
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:03,743
B12 be you big strong refrigerator

1611
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:05,279
Refrigerator

1612
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:06,047
So messy

1613
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:09,119
Yes

1614
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:11,167
Somebody somewhere but

1615
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:11,935
Come on

1616
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:12,703
Hot guys

1617
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:14,495
No.

1618
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,335
I mean Phil Hartman

1619
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:23,967
If you if you even breathe without saying Phil Hartman and Newsradio in the same setting something

1620
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:27,039
If you said Andy Dick was one of the top guys

1621
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:30,879
Is on I disagree

1622
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:31,903
I disagree

1623
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,695
Matthew is featured

1624
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,463
Constant

1625
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:38,303
I understand stuff going on with Matthew

1626
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,071
Anybody

1627
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,863
Well I will admit

1628
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:47,775
The way he fell was pretty spectacular yes he knew how to fall him and Vicki Lewis

1629
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:48,799
They were

1630
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:53,151
The zaniness

1631
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:59,295
If you need that right that Dynamic the chaos episode

1632
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:00,831
That one

1633
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:03,647
The complaint box I got the complaint box

1634
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:06,719
What is the greatest episode of TV

1635
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:08,767
McCain of course absolutely

1636
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:13,631
Or the smoking

1637
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:19,007
Left news radio talk cuz we got to talk to Rogue

1638
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,567
So

1639
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:22,335
Alex

1640
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:24,895
He started out the morning show

1641
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:29,503
People to know that he predicted this Easter

1642
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:32,063
Evening show talking about how he predicted

1643
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:38,207
That is going to start off this interview with Rogan Kelly Rogen

1644
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,791
I predicted that do you know I was predicting this

1645
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:42,815
Tell me all about

1646
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:45,375
Well now you do predict that

1647
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:46,399
The government is doing

1648
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:47,167
Thanks buddy

1649
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:47,935
Let me know

1650
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:51,007
You don't believe there's people another country that they hate

1651
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:53,311
Oh I know there are but I know this

1652
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:54,335
MSNBC

1653
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:55,359
Ben Lawton

1654
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:56,383
Comes home to roost

1655
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:58,431
The CIA ties are only the beginning

1656
01:14:58,687 --> 01:14:59,711
MSNBC

1657
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:02,527
I mean he supposedly had CIA

1658
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,855
But that doesn't mean that he didn't like

1659
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:07,135
Get angry when he was work

1660
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:10,207
I hate America

1661
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,023
What's the CIA

1662
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:14,815
No I hear you now.

1663
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:16,095
They're saying it could be alright

1664
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,887
There's

1665
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:19,935
Anybody

1666
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:21,727
And my question is why

1667
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,007
Take back that night

1668
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:23,775
D91

1669
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:27,103
If I had more time to prepare this episode

1670
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:32,479
How to make a Supercut of every time Alex reads that line about Bin Laden coming home to roost

1671
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:37,087
It's been probably a hundred times he's used it and he's never actually

1672
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:39,391
Discuss the content of the article or how

1673
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:43,743
Glosses over about how about the 1993 bombing

1674
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:48,351
And optically that's as good as any evidence so whatever

1675
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:55,263
Alex throws that headline at Joe is the most common sense reply that been on may have been working with the CIA in the

1676
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:57,823
Past but to think that he's still is would be

1677
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:00,127
Alex should disagree with

1678
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:03,199
But he can't really support his own argument so he just

1679
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:05,247
Gives up on that point

1680
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:07,807
Essentially wind

1681
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:13,695
How many moves on to his next talking point about how we should have killed Saddam and taking over Baghdad in the last Gulf War

1682
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:18,559
What's going on is that says a few conversation pass as Ops

1683
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:25,983
To distract the audience from realizing that it is a dead-end and Alex has nothing

1684
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,519
To say about this article that he

1685
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,799
He's constantly bringing up

1686
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:30,079
Hibbett store

1687
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:31,359
Sweetly different subject

1688
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:37,247
This is disorienting if you're taking the conversation seriously and think there's a coherent

1689
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,271
Going on here

1690
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:41,599
I want to sing that he's been predicting this another government

1691
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:45,183
Uses these kinds of events to accrue power which Rogan agrees

1692
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:52,095
At this point in the day there's already some talk about Bin Laden being responsible going on so Alex trots out this article from 19

1693
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:52,863
98

1694
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:54,655
To demonstrate that he's correct

1695
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:56,447
Did they even if bin Laden

1696
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,215
I do still.

1697
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:59,263
Do points out that this.

1698
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,287
Prove that bin Laden

1699
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,823
Is working with the CIA

1700
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:05,407
Which is at the Crux of what Alex's suggested by bringing up that article

1701
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,455
Simon Alex completely crumbles

1702
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,479
Talking about Saddam

1703
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:12,831
This is not a normal or rational conversation or interview path

1704
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,111
Because it's neither of these

1705
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:16,415
It's an attempt to get Joe to

1706
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:18,463
Mirror Alex is talking point

1707
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:21,535
Which failed in its first attempt so Alex tried another road

1708
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:23,839
Yeah it is

1709
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:25,119
It is

1710
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:26,655
It is interesting to me

1711
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:28,959
But he didn't immediately bring up that the

1712
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:29,727
The EU did it

1713
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:32,543
Because the EU is the most likely

1714
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:34,335
50% over

1715
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,615
Both Iraq

1716
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:42,271
And the government Logan is no people at the grocery store

1717
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:44,063
Hey man I'm hearing

1718
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:50,975
Germany did it what what are you thinking the EU today or just to launch in this currency Germany

1719
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:51,999
Open coming for us

1720
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:54,559
You know

1721
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:56,863
I think that Alex's

1722
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:58,655
Baby wants to ease into it a little bit

1723
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:05,055
That you don't want to throw that it Rogan right off the bat blow his mind

1724
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:08,639
Joe Rogan I don't know maybe he thinks that Rogan will like

1725
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:10,943
Capital of

1726
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,503
Are you kidding

1727
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:15,039
I can't deal with this reality

1728
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:18,623
It is it is funny because Alex talk

1729
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:24,255
Makes you feel like he's going down in this hedge maze you know where he's turning down this corner is like well

1730
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:26,047
Nothing there something to go back around that

1731
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:29,119
I put if you listen to the totality it's more like

1732
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:31,167
We're in the Hedge maze

1733
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:36,031
And he's just creating bulshit as you go along and you're trying to get to a conversation

1734
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:38,079
And there's nowhere to go it's just amazed

1735
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:39,103
Yep

1736
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:40,127
That's about it

1737
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:44,735
So Alex wants the the Hollywood respond

1738
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,271
2 what's going on

1739
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:52,159
Apologize in advance there's a slur and here are slur coming up

1740
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:57,023
What are your friends out in Hollywood

1741
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:00,095
Tell people are freaking out I mean

1742
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:09,055
This approach

1743
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:10,079
People assume that ever

1744
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:10,847
Everybody of Middle East

1745
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:15,199
Spell racial slurs

1746
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,735
You hear it everywhere from also

1747
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,319
I've been here in camel jockey

1748
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:27,999
Stream radio

1749
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:32,351
Sad

1750
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:34,143
Lakes that border on

1751
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:37,983
Definite slurs I would say that they are

1752
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:41,311
Put Jordan terms for

1753
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:45,663
Is a great euphemism for

1754
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:46,431
F*** off work

1755
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:52,319
So Alex so yeah if you really look at the Joey's criticizing

1756
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:56,415
The media

1757
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:59,487
Perhaps more so even than a large

1758
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:01,535
Percentage of the media that I watch

1759
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:03,071
I don't

1760
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,863
There was not that much

1761
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:07,167
Awesome

1762
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:09,983
But not as much as you might expect

1763
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,519
I think we need to Newcomb

1764
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:13,055
That's what Alex said

1765
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:15,616
Immediately

1766
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:19,456
There was less of that except for that secretary

1767
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:20,480
Got to kill someone

1768
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,832
That was a outlier in math

1769
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:27,648
So you were

1770
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:30,208
You were like a why won't eat

1771
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:35,584
And if you just wait a little while we would have gotten there alright and your theory might have been

1772
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:37,120
Joe what about the

1773
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:38,400
But you run by the German

1774
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:39,168
The rolling out there

1775
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:41,216
New currency

1776
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:41,984
Globally

1777
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,032
The dollar

1778
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,056
You know everything is about

1779
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:46,592
Currency speculation

1780
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:51,968
Financial Center

1781
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:52,992
Destroy the dollar

1782
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,832
You think that this was Europe

1783
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:57,856
Attacking America

1784
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:58,624
The Destroyer

1785
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,696
I know that in Davos Switzerland

1786
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,256
They were going to be pretty

1787
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:05,536
The dollar was going down

1788
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,352
Fight going on

1789
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,144
In the news an hour

1790
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:13,472
Until we have any evidence

1791
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:15,264
Everything else is just

1792
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:16,544
Speculation

1793
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,336
Joe my point is we have to

1794
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:19,104
To ask

1795
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,128
Who is behind

1796
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,664
Responsible

1797
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:23,968
Stream media there out there

1798
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:29,600
I think that Joe is responses alright

1799
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:30,880
You know cuz there is a

1800
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:34,720
What are you talkin about clearly doesn't believe

1801
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:39,584
Clearly doesn't agree and usually polite in the pushback

1802
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,632
This is irresponsible speculation right

1803
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:45,472
I don't think that that's the tip

1804
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,544
Listen

1805
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,824
We're already

1806
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:51,872
The problem

1807
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:53,152
Is that need to be solved

1808
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:58,784
Happened way before we get to Joe giving anybody a lesson in ethics in journalism

1809
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:06,464
I'm not going to complain about that you're something that I was surprised about I mean person I was surprised that you

1810
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:09,536
Allen second I was

1811
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:11,840
Surprise that was listening to this

1812
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:12,864
I think

1813
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,144
The Joe Rogan

1814
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:15,936
At this point

1815
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:18,240
Is who he thinks he is now

1816
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:21,056
In 2001 Joe Rogan is

1817
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:23,872
He's self-perception in 2022

1818
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:25,920
Cuz he he can push back on our

1819
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:27,968
Yeah if it doesn't go well

1820
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:29,760
This interview

1821
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:31,296
Goes bad

1822
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:32,064
That's nice

1823
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,856
On 911

1824
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:34,880
That's

1825
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:36,928
Boy all the joke

1826
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:38,720
Then I won't make

1827
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:43,328
It's really surreal to know what's about to like we're about to

1828
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:46,656
To discuss and recognize that this is the evening of 9/11

1829
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:47,680
Just

1830
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:53,056
When we were doing our last episode of scenarios are so

1831
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:53,824
Big

1832
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:54,848
You know

1833
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:56,384
Vas

1834
01:22:57,408 --> 01:23:00,736
The universe is you know yet you think about the pale blue dot

1835
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:03,808
You Know Carl Sagan talking about the pale blue dot

1836
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:11,232
Carl Sagan would be like f****** no way is Joe Rogan showed up on 9/11 what the f*** are we talkin about it

1837
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,768
Shut up

1838
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:16,608
About this

1839
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:23,008
Telling everybody right now if Alex was doing his show in like

1840
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:29,408
Pearl Harbor happened as Milton Berle on to tell him like Hey,

1841
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:31,968
I'm down

1842
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:36,832
South America what is wrong with you

1843
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:37,856
Absurd

1844
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:39,904
Alex

1845
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:41,952
He's not like the,

1846
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:43,488
Companies want to kill people

1847
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:47,072
Joe pushes back on some stuff Alex

1848
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:47,840
Cuz throwing out

1849
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:48,864
It looks like

1850
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:49,888
Playing outside

1851
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:51,936
Well yeah well I'm

1852
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,752
I mean I can't say I'm glad they did it but

1853
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:56,544
Cost you a lot

1854
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:57,824
Then I guess it was the right

1855
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:01,152
I mean

1856
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:03,712
Call Giselle

1857
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:05,504
So I care about him

1858
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:07,552
You don't know

1859
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:08,832
I'll just tell you,

1860
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:14,208
Cool because socialism is what

1861
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,744
You know a lot of

1862
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:16,512
Education

1863
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:17,792
People want they want

1864
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:18,816
Share Wellness

1865
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,096
Scary

1866
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:21,376
I think it's ridiculous

1867
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:26,496
The ruthless

1868
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:27,264
Dictatorship

1869
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:32,640
In the newspaper

1870
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:33,920
Yeah well

1871
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:34,944
Yeah well

1872
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,528
I've heard that

1873
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:44,160
What was that yeah well I've heard from my own mouth many a Time

1874
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:46,208
I guess if you were hinging

1875
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:51,584
Your conspiracy and your rebuttal to my point is they called him Uncle Joe

1876
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:52,608
Well

1877
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:53,888
Okay

1878
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,704
You're On Solid Ground moving on then

1879
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,472
Yeah

1880
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:59,520
I think that Joe

1881
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:03,872
Appears to be far more capable of critical thinking is to be

1882
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:06,944
Far more able to hold his own

1883
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:11,040
He has a centered grounded position of a thought

1884
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:12,576
He's not going

1885
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:16,416
Be bullied by Alex into a being like what maybe it is the

1886
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:18,720
Bu holyshit

1887
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:25,120
I think that's the lesson we're learning don't get old everybody gets old windup sucking later on

1888
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:31,520
I'm pretty sure even back then I would assume drugs

1889
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:37,920
For thirty years is messages green maybe one of the drug

1890
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:38,944
Bugsy did did it

1891
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:43,296
We'll never know which you don't think so

1892
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:47,392
How would you judge I mean we don't know if

1893
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,928
Toad with

1894
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,208
Again

1895
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:57,120
It's not the same

1896
01:25:57,376 --> 01:26:01,472
Snorting totally awake until you like toad is not a culprit

1897
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:02,240
Here

1898
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:03,264
USA DMT

1899
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,568
Now I don't want to say that either

1900
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:07,104
Feel like he's got to have Donuts

1901
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:07,872
Honda of Lake

1902
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:11,712
Other weird things that no one's ever heard of like chemicals

1903
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:14,784
A mental chemicals and stuff

1904
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:17,344
I'm going to say it has nothing to do with drugs

1905
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:23,744
Number one drug that would cause something like this is surrounding yourself with yes-men and people like

1906
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:29,120
Alex Jones consistently reinforce your position regardless of whatever it is that you are saying

1907
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:35,520
That's leading you down to a lazy thought pattern because you never have to try that's true

1908
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:39,104
Cultivating a full of people who don't challenge

1909
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,920
You in terms of staying

1910
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:44,480
Not some kind of a critical path

1911
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:45,504
I think this is

1912
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,552
It's probably corrosive

1913
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:53,696
If you'd just done drugs and not become famous I think he would be a better person

1914
01:26:55,744 --> 01:27:01,888
If people still made him own up to hosting The Man Show

1915
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:04,704
Orbeez

1916
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,496
Boy that's weird

1917
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:08,544
Rogan

1918
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,568
Is not play

1919
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:10,848
Playing ball with Alec

1920
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:17,248
Looks really bring up something that Joe can respond to and be like

1921
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:19,296
I feel like

1922
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:22,112
Why don't know about the Communist dick

1923
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:25,440
Haters right there just some of these socialists ideas like

1924
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:32,096
Medicare Social Security I do like he's like which I think they're f****** stupid but whatever those

1925
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:38,496
Smart people does educational people does talking about like

1926
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:40,800
Whatever that is

1927
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:43,872
I was just realizing that like this is not going to work

1928
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:46,176
So I'm going to have to Blindside him

1929
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:48,736
And so he tries to with the Northwoods.

1930
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:49,504
Scaccia

1931
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:50,528
James Bamber

1932
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:52,064
Performer 2020

1933
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,344
On different Networks

1934
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,464
You have a plan

1935
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:00,256
Pretext

1936
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:02,048
Chain and not Tom Bowman

1937
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,632
This is Baltimore

1938
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:06,400
New York Times

1939
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:11,520
They wanted to quote casually listings numbers of dead in u.s. newspaper

1940
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:16,896
How they wanted to blow up passenger airliner

1941
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:19,456
Animo using Army

1942
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:20,480
Dress-up is Cuba

1943
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:21,248
As a pretext

1944
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:22,784
How Kennedy

1945
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:24,832
6 months later

1946
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:25,600
His head

1947
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:26,624
Sloppy joes

1948
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:29,184
How you responded I do your web.

1949
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:30,720
Read the stories and hear the clip

1950
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,256
Well you know I've heard

1951
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:33,280
Any million

1952
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:35,584
Number of

1953
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:36,608
Series on now

1954
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:38,656
How Kennedy was assassinated

1955
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:40,448
Now

1956
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:42,496
I suspect

1957
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:44,032
One of them out there is true

1958
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:44,800
Why I suspect

1959
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:45,824
The government probably had something

1960
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:46,592
I do with it

1961
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:47,360
As far as

1962
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:50,176
But you're not even

1963
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:53,504
The joint

1964
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,784
Just got signed on to it

1965
01:28:55,296 --> 01:29:01,440
Sandwiches already realize that Joe is clearly not in favor of declaring that the globalist Dorothy you did 9/11

1966
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,976
And I was just no argument

1967
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:05,024
Had to make that they did season

1968
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:12,192
He knows that Joe isn't a pushover in 2001 and that he has his own celebrity

1969
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:15,264
Like the other guest has had on

1970
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,032
On 911

1971
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,568
That's Tuff

1972
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:22,688
Because if he starts asking too many questions about why Alex believes the things he's saying or what

1973
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:24,224
Poopy has bass Electro Bass

1974
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:27,040
It might become clear that Alex is just make

1975
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:27,808
Shut up

1976
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,600
So Alex Goes On author

1977
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:34,208
This clip is him putting Joe in a completely unfair and unwinnable so

1978
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:34,976
Situation

1979
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:41,376
He doesn't think the government necessarily did this in question to Alex's idea about a possible motive

1980
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:44,960
Instead of arguing that point Alex throws operation

1981
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:46,240
Jojo

1982
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:49,568
Know about this document he's never read it so this conversation

1983
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:50,848
Have to happen

1984
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:52,384
Entirely on Alex's terms

1985
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,408
Or not at all

1986
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:59,808
Except so I can't have this conversation

1987
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:01,344
The latter option

1988
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:05,440
Is more responsible but also wasn't super productive in a radio interview setting

1989
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:08,256
Plus if you know Alex you know he's not going to respect

1990
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:10,048
Now you just going to have the conversation anyway

1991
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:14,400
Alex's forcing Joe to engage with something he knows nothing about which

1992
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:18,240
Supposedly proves that the government had plans approved to do it 911 back

1993
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:19,008
The 60

1994
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,056
So from an optic standpoint

1995
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:24,896
Alex is making it Jose responsibility to debunked this document

1996
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:26,432
Before they can even really begin

1997
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:28,480
To talk about the actual Madrid

1998
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:29,504
Which is impossible

1999
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:33,600
Sometimes whenever moving the goalposts isn't going to work for you

2000
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:35,904
What you have to do is switch to

2001
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:36,672
To playing highlight

2002
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:40,512
Right so you're like a football is really hard I'm not going to do that s***

2003
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:46,656
Highlight is Buddy that old Thomas Jefferson quote figuring out the answer

2004
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:48,704
That's when I change the question

2005
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,984
Has great Thomas Jefferson

2006
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:57,152
This is what I was doing is in essence the same thing he does in terms of using OKC is cover

2007
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:58,432
For the 9/11 Pompeii

2008
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:01,248
It's an attempt to force someone to complete

2009
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:05,088
Need some other task before you get to the real issue that you're supposed to be talk

2010
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:05,856
About

2011
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:11,488
It's like Alex is an NPC in a video game sending you want to fetch quest in the middle of the main mission

2012
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:13,024
What is a poorly designed game

2013
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:17,120
So you kind of know that once you finish that side quest they're just going to send you on another

2014
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:19,680
It's going to be a long time until you get to the main mix

2015
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:21,472
To take a lot of patience

2016
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:24,032
To have any actual conversation with Alex

2017
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:27,872
Who's going to keep throwing out oh no I need an amulet if we're going to

2018
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:30,176
Go into this right for right after the f***

2019
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:31,456
Write the noise

2020
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:34,272
You don't know what my Kennedy conspiracy theories

2021
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:37,344
My conspiracy theory is this

2022
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:39,392
You know

2023
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:40,672
No no it's even worse

2024
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:41,696
Oh boy

2025
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:43,488
That is disseminated

2026
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:44,512
Conspiracy theories

2027
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:45,536
Because

2028
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:48,608
They don't want people to know how easy it is to just

2029
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,632
Murder the president

2030
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:52,448
Like honestly if you look back in American history

2031
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:53,728
There's been at least

2032
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:56,032
Should have been murdered president

2033
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:57,056
That were murdered

2034
01:31:57,312 --> 01:31:59,360
That's true

2035
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:00,128
Twice

2036
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:02,176
Two guns jammed in his face

2037
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:05,760
Add blown off to Roosevelt Roosevelt

2038
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:07,296
Gone Ronald Reagan

2039
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:13,696
Out of here yeah those were those were not sophisticated plan do you do not need a sophisticated

2040
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:15,232
You can just shoot them

2041
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:16,256
There's a dude

2042
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:24,704
Obviously it's not that it is not me

2043
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,496
Complicated process

2044
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:29,568
But you can hear you can hear it in Joe's voice to he's like

2045
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:33,408
It is there so many things there so many moving Parts there's got to be a

2046
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:34,176
Complicated

2047
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:36,992
Plan behind it

2048
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:38,784
It's got to be that Ocean's 11 Heist

2049
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:43,136
And it can really just be a dude was out of those other ones were

2050
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:49,536
For what it's worth I mean even the let me there was some planning in conspiracy involved in the lake

2051
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:50,816
Assassination

2052
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:55,424
Not like all we got to get Russia involved yeah

2053
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:56,960
That is interesting

2054
01:32:57,472 --> 01:33:03,616
I mean I don't agree I don't believe your premise is actually doing interesting to think about how

2055
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:07,968
There's an expectation that that has to be the most Byzantine thing

2056
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:14,368
Thinks that it should be really really hard to assassinate the president of sell it if you look back in assassinations that worked and didn't

2057
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:19,488
All you really need is the hotspot to try and maybe the chips will fall where they may

2058
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:25,888
Well I'm going to need you to go on Rogan while we're at Austin and ask him about that.

2059
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:26,912
I think that's a good one

2060
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:28,192
So look

2061
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:29,472
Alex

2062
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:30,752
Can't handle this in

2063
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:34,848
Alex has some thoughts about Hollywood

2064
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,152
Then unfortunately Joe is in Holly

2065
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,456
What does this do for our image

2066
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:40,992
Oriented country what Acts

2067
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:45,856
I don't think Hollywood ever

2068
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:46,880
Should be in a position

2069
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:47,904
The take Antioch

2070
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:48,672
Chen's whatsoever

2071
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:49,696
Hollywood is about Eric

2072
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:50,720
Payment and making money

2073
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:52,512
In Ohio Hollywood

2074
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:53,536
Find prop things up at

2075
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:57,888
A lot of federal money

2076
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:00,192
Stop

2077
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:01,472
Are they really

2078
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:02,496
Hell yeah

2079
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:05,824
Yeah exactly

2080
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:08,896
All the free equipment

2081
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:11,456
What to do in WhatsApp

2082
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:12,736
Takeout

2083
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:14,272
Highly doubt the army

2084
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:16,064
Take out I think

2085
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,600
They do probably

2086
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:19,392
They can't have the army

2087
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:21,184
Call Terry

2088
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:21,952
You dinna

2089
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:22,720
In a poor way

2090
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:24,000
My God displayed

2091
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:26,816
But

2092
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:28,096
Give the money for them

2093
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:29,376
It's also good

2094
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:31,168
You have to realize

2095
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:34,752
Watch a movie like Pearl Harbor where

2096
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:36,800
The kids join the Navy and become Heroes

2097
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:39,104
Kid

2098
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,128
Might be just the push

2099
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,152
Did they need

2100
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:42,432
Get him into the armed service

2101
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:43,456
Yeah I created

2102
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:44,736
Glut of people 1

2103
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:45,760
Playa 14

2104
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:47,040
Where's my Top Gun

2105
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:54,208
Yeah but Alex is arguing against his own point I'm confused as to why Alex thinks

2106
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:56,512
Statistics a conversation he's having

2107
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:59,584
Crumble lady tried to make a claim Rogan is like

2108
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:05,984
Nada

2109
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:08,288
Eczema

2110
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:13,152
He's got a bag of candies at he's just throwing them at Joe Rogan like this one taste good

2111
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:14,432
Good

2112
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:16,480
Let's see if the media taste good

2113
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:18,272
And what media is there for

2114
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:21,344
Funny

2115
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,368
Altars in anyway

2116
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:28,256
Was that mean

2117
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:29,536
Tiring attract

2118
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:31,072
The people to work as news anchors

2119
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:31,840
Aura

2120
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:34,400
Using up the soundtrack or doing whatever the hell they have

2121
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:41,568
This year

2122
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:43,360
Before

2123
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:45,408
Okay blocked onto it as a point of focus

2124
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:48,480
And then suddenly

2125
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:49,504
Ucbh

2126
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:51,040
We are in Jaws

2127
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:53,600
It's all about

2128
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:55,648
Right now what it's worth

2129
01:35:57,952 --> 01:35:58,720
Is a Terrace

2130
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:00,512
And whatever is work

2131
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:01,536
That is working

2132
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:04,608
Did you just say

2133
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:07,680
Spell immediately

2134
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:11,264
Agencies

2135
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:14,848
You know any short that people get

2136
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:16,896
Ridiculous

2137
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:17,920
I know all the tea

2138
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:18,944
People behind me shows

2139
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:19,968
They don't care about

2140
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:22,272
They want ratings

2141
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:24,064
18 to 49

2142
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:28,672
That's what'll be on

2143
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:32,256
Yeah but you do Mad TV and Newsradio and host Fear Factor

2144
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:35,072
The number one show in the mansion

2145
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:35,840
Anchors

2146
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:38,144
Your face but there

2147
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:40,960
Group meetings that are now

2148
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:41,984
Publicize

2149
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:43,520
Calling for what

2150
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:46,848
You like that

2151
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:50,176
Well we know Ted Turner of the uni

2152
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:50,944
Coming come on

2153
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:53,248
Katana gives a lot of money

2154
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:55,552
What Alex's

2155
01:36:55,808 --> 01:37:00,416
Not being able to handle like what are basically simple rebuttal

2156
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:05,792
This is bad yeah this is an embarrassing show

2157
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:07,328
Lizardman going like

2158
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,888
Hey come on that doesn't make that much sense and

2159
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:17,312
To mean to Joe cuz he is the host of one of the top rated

2160
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:18,848
Did shows in the country

2161
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:19,872
Yeah

2162
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:21,152
It was a huge

2163
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:23,712
This is weird to think back on that fit like

2164
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:26,016
Yeah it was winning its time slot

2165
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:32,416
Yellow people so they would eat Bugs Bunny everybody who is Ever making fun of like all the Petro

2166
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:33,696
Rock fat is like man

2167
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:39,328
Fear Factor is way worse than that s***

2168
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:40,864
Yeah it was a phenomenon

2169
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:43,424
But yeah like

2170
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:46,752
I think that there's something really interesting going on here and that is the

2171
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:51,104
Cuz Alex can't really fight with him all that much without risking

2172
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,152
The Friendship of really famous guy

2173
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:55,200
More important than gold

2174
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:57,248
Yeah I can

2175
01:37:58,784 --> 01:37:59,552
These things out

2176
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:03,392
Vicki supposed to say

2177
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:06,720
It's like obvious way Alex has no rebuttal

2178
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:07,488
For this

2179
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:08,512
Hennything is

2180
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:13,632
His arguments are flimsy and bad person he's making up these people who

2181
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:16,448
Are controlling things and going to Bilderberg

2182
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:17,728
This stuff

2183
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:19,264
And because of that

2184
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:21,568
You just have to give up on all these points

2185
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:25,920
Keep arguing without revealing that he doesn't have a second step

2186
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:26,944
Did this argue

2187
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:30,528
Even really a first-set based on

2188
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:31,296
He doesn't have

2189
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:33,856
He doesn't have enough feet to step with

2190
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:37,184
And it's really depressing I mean first of all

2191
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:39,488
I know seeing Alex this this

2192
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:42,560
Not great

2193
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:44,352
But then seeing Joe this

2194
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:45,632
Able

2195
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:48,192
To navigate this territory and like obviously

2196
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:52,544
He didn't ruin their friendship he was able to give voice to

2197
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,848
Steve counterpoints to what Alex

2198
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:59,456
Was saying and show a little frustration while he's doing it not let Alex just

2199
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:02,528
Get away with whatever nonsense he saying

2200
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:06,624
I think maybe part of that Dynamic is videos on Alex's show

2201
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:07,392
Yeah

2202
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:09,440
If he's on his own show

2203
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:10,720
Do you want salad

2204
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:11,488
Stupid

2205
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:17,632
Don't get crazy I get it out

2206
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:18,400
Really benefit

2207
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:21,472
From Alex's

2208
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:23,776
Oh man

2209
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:26,592
I just don't know how you live

2210
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:31,712
Today we're talking about it was 9/11

2211
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:32,480
Correct

2212
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:35,040
This is happening on that day

2213
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:41,696
I don't know what that was that for a little bit

2214
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:43,744
Are working today

2215
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:45,280
Is such

2216
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:46,816
Nothing to say

2217
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:49,120
On 911

2218
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:54,752
It's really weird because it's also in the context of that like why is everyone talking about shark attacks

2219
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:59,360
Yeah it's a media it's applications for whatever

2220
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:04,480
Wow that's a little different when there was Wyatt's tiny bit

2221
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:08,320
Well I mean I feel like there would be a real you'd have to be

2222
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:11,904
Really bizarrely disconnected from how humans work

2223
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:18,304
In order to be like why is it talking about terrorist attacks today yeah that would have to be insane that would be an insane thing to do

2224
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:22,912
Well Tara said text her what's driving money now is that understand

2225
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:24,448
Critical of

2226
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,008
People talking about sharks

2227
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:31,104
I agree we kill more sharks and they kill us and they're better this one's different

2228
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,128
Different Berry dip

2229
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,920
So Alex really

2230
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:35,456
If he knew what he was doing it all

2231
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:36,480
He would just

2232
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:41,344
Bail on talking about anything that has to do with the media or the entertainment industry

2233
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:42,368
But he can't

2234
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:45,184
For you the Roll-Up.

2235
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:48,000
Message Department ride

2236
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:49,280

Scripture Law and Order in order

2244
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:02,592
New one

2245
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:03,616
Why Law and Order

2246
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,920
How about you

2247
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:07,456
Can you do with keeping people in line

2248
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:10,528
You know

2249
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:11,552
Proceeding for the judge

2250
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:12,320
Shabazz

2251
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:13,344
Violation

2252
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:15,904
I didn't write it

2253
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,464
Would be more than happy to read it but

2254
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:21,536
Do I read it

2255
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:23,840
People who run television

2256
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:24,864
Illinois Lottery

2257
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:25,888
Who run

2258
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:28,960
I know the guy who invented

2259
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:30,240
Who Wants to Marry a multi

2260
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:33,056
Chamillionaire and all these other crazy shows are on television

2261
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:35,872
And despite what people think of the motor

2262
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:37,408
Funny shows on

2263
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:38,944
For you know what

2264
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,736
Logic randeree velour

Reason

2266
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:43,296
For evil reasons rather

2267
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:44,064
These people

2268
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:50,720
Why would ABC have anything to say about Law and Order being How It Was Written

2269
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:57,888
On ABC ABC is trying to

2270
01:41:58,144 --> 01:42:03,520
Law & Order got a scoop on their NBC Rivals right about how they're letting

2271
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:06,592
The government right there shows 8w

2272
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:08,384
Good thinking about making Dick Wolf

2273
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:09,920
The Attorney General

2274
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:11,200
What he's what

2275
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:17,600
What Rogan is not allowing for is the possibility that the government was writing the scripts because W had a pretty

2276
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:20,416
Particular things that he liked Law and Order to do you know

2277
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:21,440
10

2278
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:27,072
Listen we find out now everyday more of what the queen is doing extra judicially

2279
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:33,472
Jesus said he's influencing laws and s*** they're getting away with murdering animals on their ships doing all that white

2280
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:38,336
I couldn't W be like Hey listen I want the next storyline for Law and Order to be I think that's

2281
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:39,616
A reasonable thought

2282
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:43,968
You're thinking it's the doj is making requests

2283
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:47,808
Taylor entertainment for the president

2284
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:54,208
Is do it being a nefarious just 100% a man going like

2285
01:42:54,464 --> 01:43:00,608
Law & Order the headline sound

2286
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:04,960
More entertaining headlight cover

2287
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:09,056
More power for less important ship you're not wrong

2288
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:11,616
But yeah Jose I buy in that s***

2289
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:13,920
Alex

2290
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:16,736
Drawn to this topic

2291
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:18,272
But he should avoid it I just

2292
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:19,296
Stop

2293
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:25,696
Evil

Girl putting

2295
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:35,424
You know this is a guy walking by watch

2296
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:36,192
The network

2297
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,496
In a grander scale

2298
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:41,312
It's variety shows

2299
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:42,336
Reality shows

2300
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:43,616
Whatever it is

2301
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:51,040
Detergent

2302
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:54,624
Charlie's crazy notion

2303
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:56,160
Did the government

2304
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:57,184
Do you know what using

2305
01:43:58,464 --> 01:43:58,976
Is ridiculous

2306
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:00,256
I'm here

2307
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:02,048
Deep inside the media

2308
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:05,632
I Fear Factor

2309
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:08,448
Okay but I'm telling you

2310
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:12,800
I don't necessarily believe them

2311
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:19,456
I have the new stories here

2312
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:20,480
Maryland

2313
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:21,248
TV tonight

2314
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,040
Jamie to give up our Liberty

2315
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:25,600
We should give up our liberties

2316
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:26,368
TV tonight

2317
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:35,328
The little bit I thought jarring because Alex needed to retreat to safer territory for him

2318
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:41,728
Cuz I'm buying it has expertise and he's in those World Geography

2319
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:44,288
If you being self-deprecating even with like

2320
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:48,128
I know that that's my job that's why I have a show

2321
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:49,664
Like it's interesting

2322
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:52,992
Tell people they want to watch me yell at people

2323
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:54,528
Atlantic help sell Prada

2324
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:57,600
He's not disillusioned about like totally

2325
01:44:57,856 --> 01:45:00,672
Crass materialism

2326
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:03,232
Explanation of what team

2327
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:07,328
I hosted clubs for years that my job is to sell drink

2328
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:11,168
And so

2329
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:11,936
Like

2330
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:12,960
Alex

2331
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:13,728
Handle

2332
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:15,520
He doesn't have enough

2333
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:16,800
To go on

2334
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:23,200
We transition over to safer territory which is like Avatar

2335
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:25,248
Are you on CNN

2336
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:31,648
Again we're in this situation where I can point that out and Alex can tell you like almost been on another Channel and we're back where

2337
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:32,416
Where we started

2338
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:36,512
It doesn't really matter though because this was just something Alex throughout the

2339
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:37,280
The change of the sub

2340
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:41,888
Realized he was losing this government controls the media stuff

2341
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:43,168
And yeah

2342
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:44,448
Who at whatever

2343
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:48,288
Yeah Alex really isn't used to his quote-unquote experts

2344
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:52,384
Using their expertise

2345
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:53,152
Combat him

2346
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:55,968
He doesn't appreciate he's like never know you're not supposed to act

2347
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:56,736
Actually be an ex

2348
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:57,504
I'm just calling

01:45:58,016 --> 01:45:59,552

About manipulating

2356
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:15,168
Perception

2357
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:16,448
Why are they so outraged

2358
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:17,472
Play against the shack

2359
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:18,496
Paddling Michigan

2360

Perfect

2370
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:37,952
You know why

2371

A Hard Day's Work

2372

Have a beer

2373
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:45,632
Fair enough

01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:56,384
We talkin about that's no example

2379
01:46:56,896 --> 01:47:03,040
You know how they're all day Outta control control with a second amendment hatred

2380
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:08,672
Everytime I look at the TV I feel like they don't like the Second Amendment

2381
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:10,464
Whenever there isn't

2382
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:16,864
Two guns on screen Married With Children

2383
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:19,680
Problem in less than 30 minutes via some sort of

2384
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:21,728
Communication as opposed to a gunshot

2385
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:24,032
Sandwiches losing ever

2386
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:27,616
Circles around him with

2387
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:29,920
Minimal effort

2388
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:31,968
Really don't have to work that hard

2389
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:37,600
No it's Alex really needs to basically discredit Joe by giving him a

2390
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:38,624
Terrier motive

2391
01:47:39,392 --> 01:47:40,416
All I can say to all them

2392
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:42,720
Smart guy

2393
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:43,488
The New World Order

2394
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:44,768
You're doing very well

2395
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:46,048
Call sister

2396
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:47,584
You know your show

2397
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,120
Compared to all the

2398
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:51,168
People drive to watch

2399
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:55,776
This system

2400
01:47:57,056 --> 01:48:02,944
So there is this idea that he's within the system that you have to say what you have to

2401
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:08,320
To say to keep your corporate overlords happy globalist

2402
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:11,136
Hollywood System

2403
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:13,440
Agreeing with me a hundred percent

2404
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:14,720
That's really not fair

2405
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:17,024
Why even have the conversation then

2406
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,304
Like what's the point

2407
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:24,704
What makes the roadrunner and Wile E coyote relationship interesting is that the Roadrunner is very very

2408
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:25,472
Very fast

2409
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:26,240
So

2410
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:29,824
The coyotes attempts to attack at our

2411
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:30,848
Scaled

2412
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:32,128
Correctly

2413
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:35,456
And that's the darkover complication is what makes the problem is right

2414
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:38,272
You wouldn't watch the show if it was the Wylie Coyote

2415
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:39,296
Versus turtle

2416
01:48:40,064 --> 01:48:41,600
I'm Turtle wasn't moving very fast

2417
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:43,904
And Wylie Coyote still blew himself up

2418
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:45,184
You know you could just

2419
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:46,208
Step over

2420
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:47,232
And grab the turn

2421
01:48:48,256 --> 01:48:51,840
You don't have to paint a whole extra Road on a

2422
01:48:52,096 --> 01:48:57,216
Brick wall you know you can just I would say that that Dynamic is part of why this isn't Elektra

2423
01:48:57,472 --> 01:49:00,800
Radio

2424
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:03,872
For me in a way that a lot of these interviews are

2425
01:49:04,128 --> 01:49:06,176
Because you see Joe

2426
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:08,224
Being His Highest self

2427
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:09,248
Yeah sort of

2428
01:49:09,504 --> 01:49:15,648
I don't actually know if I can back that up there may be a better version of him somewhere

2429
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:22,560
Represent yourself on Infowars

2430
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:27,680
This is V best way to do it and if you're going to represent yourself as Joe Rogan

2431
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:32,800
This is a good representation of him compared to every other version of him we've seen

2432
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:36,640
Very very Joe Rogan e as opposed to more Alex Jones

2433
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:41,760
So Alex just is going to just do whatever you can

2434
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:42,528
Nonsense

2435
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:45,088
What we're walking a very slippery slope

2436
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:46,112
With trying

2437
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:47,136
Protect ourselves

2438
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:49,696
And you know trying to make sure the government

2439
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:50,464
Take personal

2440
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,048
Joe I agree with you

2441
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:57,632
East Germany

2442
01:49:58,144 --> 01:49:58,912
Reese's go in I have

2443
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:01,216
The photos of the video from the LA Times

2444
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:01,984
They're firing

2445
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:06,592
I mean that is not America

2446
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:08,384
Uniforms in Black

2447
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:11,200
Do you watch her

2448
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:13,504
They were driving

2449
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:17,088
Germany

2450
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:18,112
No this happened

2451
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:20,672
Lost Laura about it

2452
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:23,232
The guy's house burning down

2453
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:24,512
Capc

2454
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:25,280
The shootout

2455
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:27,328
Well I mean what are you saying

2456
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:28,864
Military coup

2457
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:30,656
No the police

2458
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:31,680
Jelly Time

2459
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:32,704
4

2460
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:33,472
Black

2461
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:34,496
Discriminate

2462
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:35,264
Reese's

2463
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:37,824
To go

2464
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:38,848
They're in the neighborhood

2465
01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:39,616
Shooting up the wrong

2466
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:40,384
Townhouses going

2467
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:43,712
And then tried to frame

2468
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:44,992
This guy they killed with

2469
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:49,344
Well I I didn't read that I don't know what that stories about but

2470
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:51,136
What does that have to do with

2471
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:52,928
You know the government taking away our liberties by

2472
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:53,696
By blowing up

2473
01:50:55,488 --> 01:50:57,792
Chocolate candy

2474
01:50:58,048 --> 01:50:59,072
When you do

2475
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:00,608
The Black Eyed Peas

2476
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:08,800
I'm not totally sure what this has to do with the larger topic or what that response even was but it makes sense confused by Al

2477
01:51:09,056 --> 01:51:10,592
Alex throwing this new story Into The Mix

2478
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:12,384
Cuz it's the total non sequitur

2479
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:14,176
Alex is also lying

2480
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:16,480
About that situation that occurred in Santa Clarita

2481
01:51:17,248 --> 01:51:19,808
Please arrive to search the home of a guy named James

2482
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:20,576
Alan Beck

2483
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:24,672
Who was a felon that the authorities had learned from Neighbors who were worried

2484
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:27,744
That he was

2485
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:28,768
He can't do

2486
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:33,120
And there were some reports that he was going around impersonating a police officer

2487
01:51:33,376 --> 01:51:34,400
From my way time

2488
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:36,192
Deputy

2489
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:39,264
Also nicknamed Jake Kardashian

2490
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:41,824
Was among scores of officers

2491
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:42,848
To flock to the scene

2492
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:45,920
He was shot and killed within minutes of arriving

2493
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:52,064
Alex's Dojo that the police shot their own officer and then frame back which was reported in the LA Times which is

2494
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:53,344
Absolutely

2495
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:58,208
And it's a necessary lie because if Alex discussed the situation at its real form

2496
01:51:58,464 --> 01:52:01,536
He wouldn't be so black-and-white and would become much harder for Alex

2497
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:02,560
To use for stalking

2498
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:08,448
Black open fire on the officers and killed the sheriff's deputy police returning fire

2499
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:11,264
They were a bit unprepared for this turn of events

2500
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:14,336
And shot a number of rounds into the adjoining house

2501
01:52:14,592 --> 01:52:15,104
So no one was

2502
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:19,712
People whose house was shot in a suit and they were awarded $200,000

2503
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:22,016
Daliso get some restitution

2504
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:23,552
Through it all

2505
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:25,344
Text continued shooting

2506
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:26,112
Probably

2507
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:27,392
Thousands of rounds

2508
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:32,768
He had a huge cache of weapons firing at news helicopters it was just a huge mess

2509
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:39,680
He shot at people for hours until the police tried to shoot a tear gas canister in which may have started

2510
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:40,448
The fire

2511
01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:41,984
While the fire burned Beck

2512
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:44,800
Continue firing his guns until the roof

2513
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:45,824
Wow

2514
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:47,872
Well there's criticism that can be made

2515
01:52:48,128 --> 01:52:49,664
Of the police and ATF

2516
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:51,968
Response absolutely they

2517
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:52,736
Preparedness

2518
01:52:53,504 --> 01:52:54,016
Vibrate

2519
01:52:54,272 --> 01:52:56,320
There probably is a sub license

2520
01:52:56,576 --> 01:52:57,856
Things to be learned in the post action

2521
01:52:58,112 --> 01:52:59,136
For sure

2522
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:00,160
But because of

2523
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:06,560
Who does Baseline similarity that the situation has to Waco conspiracy theorists latched onto the event is being the same thing all

2524
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:13,984
He got a fair amount of news coverage but really wasn't that big of a story outside of this extreme right-wing media Circle

2525
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:14,752
Alex

2526
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:18,592
It's mostly just because they used it as a reminiscent thing of Waco

2527
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:24,736
And that's why Joe has no idea what he's talking about but seems like a giant

2528
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:25,760
I can see that discrepancy

2529
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:31,136
So I said some positive things about Joe but

2530
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:37,536
Time for that to go away I just don't necessarily agree with

2531
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:38,816
His perspective

2532
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:43,936
And we find out Iraq

2533
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:44,704
What should we do

2534
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:50,592
Absolutely positively without a doubt

2535
01:53:54,176 --> 01:53:55,200
I'm all for

2536
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:56,480
Reading the world

2537
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:58,272
Food and the United States

2538
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:02,368
We can prove Beyond A Reasonable Doubt

2539
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:13,376
Joe do you want to stay with us

2540
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:15,168
What

2541
01:54:15,936 --> 01:54:16,448
So

2542
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:19,008
I think that obviously

2543
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:20,544
I get where he's coming from

2544
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,848
He also earlier

2545
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:25,664
Describe people being kind of warmonger eat

2546
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:28,224
I don't know

2547
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:30,528
I understand the

2548
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:34,880
Feeling that there is a need for war based on a terrorist attack like

2549
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:35,648
Like that

2550
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:38,720
I understand I particularly that evening

2551
01:54:38,976 --> 01:54:39,488
I get it

2552
01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:42,048
I don't know if I agree

2553
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:44,352
Fully because I don't think

2554
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:45,376
Solve the

2555
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:48,448
And you end up killing a ton more people

2556
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:53,312
Civilians now if I understand correctly it's not

2557
01:54:53,568 --> 01:54:57,920
It doesn't seem productive are you trying to say that so far up to this point

2558
01:54:58,176 --> 01:55:00,480
War does not seem to have self problems

2559
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:01,760
I would say

2560
01:55:02,272 --> 01:55:02,784
War

2561
01:55:03,552 --> 01:55:09,696
What is it good for even one step further then might you even be saying that for

2562
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:16,352
It is war itself that led to Osama Bin Laden to committing these terrorist acts in the first place

2563
01:55:16,608 --> 01:55:19,680
Thereby meaning that if we were to start another War only

2564
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:26,080
Guaranteeing that yet another Osama Bin Laden several years will come by and blow up something else are you saying that maybe this is a

2565
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:31,968
Recycled that happens over and over and over again that people stupid is like Joe Rogan and

2566
01:55:32,224 --> 01:55:32,736
Good God

2567
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:34,016
Did something like that

2568
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:38,624
What is a good

2569
01:55:39,136 --> 01:55:39,648
Absolutely nothing

2570
01:55:40,416 --> 01:55:43,488
Say it again

2571
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:44,512
So

2572
01:55:47,072 --> 01:55:49,632
JoJo you wasn't listening to Alex's show earlier

2573
01:55:49,888 --> 01:55:50,400
Because he

2574
01:55:50,656 --> 01:55:53,216
Critique something that I likes did earlier

2575
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:54,496
Boy

2576
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:57,824
I didn't know they were doing this and like

2577
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:01,408
I'm sure you've heard that gel that

2578
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:02,688
People call them

2579
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:03,712
Cell phones

2580
01:56:04,224 --> 01:56:04,736
Hijacking

2581
01:56:04,992 --> 01:56:06,528
Box cutter coming

2582
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:07,552
And now my comment

2583
01:56:09,344 --> 01:56:09,856
People like

2584
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:12,416
Fight

2585
01:56:14,976 --> 01:56:16,256
Kennedy Airport

2586
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:19,072
These pastors

2587
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:21,888
Security

2588
01:56:22,144 --> 01:56:23,936
Tell them hey we're going to crash in the World Trade Center

2589
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:25,728
Joe I mean

2590
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:28,544
The courage of the

2591
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:29,312
People on board

2592
01:56:30,592 --> 01:56:32,128
Situation like that

2593
01:56:32,384 --> 01:56:38,528
So you could judge

2594
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:39,552
All of Joe Rogan

2595
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:45,184
Criticisms about the media in response to Alex saying that the media is doing something

2596
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:48,768
Are criticisms of Alex's memes

2597
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:52,864
Far more extreme versions of it than Joseph probably seeing other place

2598
01:56:53,888 --> 01:56:55,680
Mentioning

2599
01:56:56,704 --> 01:56:57,472
Like Alex

2600
01:56:58,240 --> 01:56:59,008
Is

2601
01:56:59,264 --> 01:57:02,336
Definitely advocating for bombing a rockmore

2602
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:06,432
Then early that's conversation that's come up a lot more

2603
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:10,016
Hear that he has at this point on other anywhere else

2604
01:57:10,272 --> 01:57:16,416
Nobody else is even talking about Iraq yet well I mean included

2605
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:22,816
I can hear you got to kill somebody I don't think anybody was on the Nations tip

2606
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:24,096
Like let's have let's

2607
01:57:24,352 --> 01:57:30,496
Let's throw this on a f****** government it's weird it's weird to have Alex eventually become this guy

2608
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:31,264
Who's like

2609
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:33,056
Anti Iraq War

2610
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:37,152
I know that become such a piece of his identity and he's

2611
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:37,920
Really

2612
01:57:38,176 --> 01:57:38,944
Very much

2613
01:57:39,456 --> 01:57:39,968
Like

2614
01:57:40,224 --> 01:57:42,784
Maybe that's the garage if they did it

2615
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:44,320
It does appear that the only

2616
01:57:44,576 --> 01:57:45,856
Only thing stopping Alex

2617
01:57:46,112 --> 01:57:49,952
From being the cause of all the things he complains about is that

2618
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:52,256
He wasn't there to make the decision like

2619
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:54,560
If he was there too

2620
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:57,888
Complain about the Iraq War he was there to make the decision he would have bombed them

2621
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:04,544
He can't complain about this if he was there to make the decision he would have done that well complain about the power grid because if he was there

2622
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:10,432
Well I think you would have bombed Iraq if he could prove that they did it

2623
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:15,296
But proving things means nothing to Alex are we go so I think

2624
01:58:15,552 --> 01:58:20,416
If you were in a position of power he could very easily prove whatever you wanted to prove

2625
01:58:20,672 --> 01:58:21,184
If it was

2626
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:22,720
Speedy and towards whatever you want

2627
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:24,768
Man that is almost

2628
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:27,072
Word-for-word what someone did

2629
01:58:28,096 --> 01:58:32,192
So Joe doesn't want to see the UN

2630
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:34,752
Take over the US courts

2631
01:58:35,776 --> 01:58:36,800
The great sure

2632
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:38,080
Also Joe's

2633
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:40,128
Dewar's are bad

2634
01:58:40,384 --> 01:58:41,408
BJ's credit

2635
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:42,688
He doesn't seem like the concert

2636
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:47,552
They're going to take whoever it is a from a Bin Laden or whoever it is

2637
01:58:47,808 --> 01:58:52,928
They're going to put them under the international criminal court and all the people in the United States of America are going to say

2638
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:54,464
Oh isn't this wonderful

2639
01:58:54,976 --> 01:58:59,072
Now I've got a couple other 10 the criminal court is not allowed jewelry

2640
01:58:59,328 --> 01:59:00,352
You can't face your accuser

2641
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:01,376
Double jeopardy

2642
01:59:02,144 --> 01:59:02,912
Install

2643
01:59:03,168 --> 01:59:04,448
30 years lot of trial

2644
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:05,472
Do you support

2645
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:09,568
Well I'm out

2646
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:10,848
Support you know any

2647
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:13,664
I don't support the Constitution

2648
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:17,760
People

2649
01:59:25,696 --> 01:59:26,464
2%

2650
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:27,488
Tax

2651
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:33,632
Conceive the getting that high

2652
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:35,168
There's a lot of things

2653
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:36,704
They're in our constitution

2654
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:40,288
People

2655
01:59:42,336 --> 01:59:43,360
We need a rule of law and

2656
01:59:43,616 --> 01:59:44,128
Republic

2657
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:47,200
That tax thing isn't what I would have gone with as an example but the

2658
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:48,480
The point stands

2659
01:59:48,736 --> 01:59:51,040
I mean you could have gone with slaves

2660
01:59:51,808 --> 01:59:54,368
Sherp

2661
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:59,232
There's a recognition that the constitution is an imperfect document

2662
01:59:59,488 --> 02:00:00,512
That's for boating

2663
02:00:02,048 --> 02:00:04,096
Very very weird ears

2664
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:06,144
You know what the Constitution.

2665
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:07,680
Yeah that is

2666
02:00:07,936 --> 02:00:08,448
Yeah

2667
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:10,496
So this next clip Jordan

2668
02:00:10,752 --> 02:00:11,520
Yeah it's a bit

2669
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:17,408
This is a three-minute clip that's not good

2670
02:00:18,688 --> 02:00:19,200
They get into it

2671
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:21,504
Interested

2672
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:22,784
I got to say

2673
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:24,576
I admire Rogan

2674
02:00:24,832 --> 02:00:26,112
For being able to

2675
02:00:26,368 --> 02:00:27,648
To have this conversation

2676
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:33,280
I do not admire him for doing it on 911 really am struggling again with this

2677
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:34,816
Okay I'm fine I'm

2678
02:00:35,072 --> 02:00:41,216
I'm just I'm removing the fact that it's 9:11 on the day from my you should try I can engage with this as

2679
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:44,544
With the understanding to get through it otherwise

2680
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:45,568
We're having a spirit

2681
02:00:45,824 --> 02:00:46,592
Debate tonight

2682
02:00:46,848 --> 02:00:47,360
Joe is not

2683
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:48,384
Depending a new world order

2684
02:00:48,896 --> 02:00:49,408

A lot of discharge

2690
02:01:04,768 --> 02:01:06,048
You do yourself a disservice

2691
02:01:06,304 --> 02:01:08,608
You're absolutely positive about that

2692
02:01:10,144 --> 02:01:12,704
I think by saying that you know the answer to everything

2693
02:01:13,216 --> 02:01:15,008
You make the whole notion ridiculous

2694
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:23,712
Aggressive

2695
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:29,856
Is a lot of disinformation by our own government by the media

2696
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:31,648
Answer to okay

So you're telling me I'm doing a disservice and it's not true

2737
02:02:55,104 --> 02:02:56,384

02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:15,072
When you have proof

2745
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:21,984
I think everybody admires that I think it's a fantastic

2746
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:23,008
When I think

2747
02:03:24,544 --> 02:03:27,872
Is when I think you use something is based on speculation

2748
02:03:28,128 --> 02:03:29,152
You to use something that

2749
02:03:29,408 --> 02:03:30,176
May or may not be

2750
02:03:30,432 --> 02:03:31,200
Beetroot you stated

2751
02:03:31,456 --> 02:03:32,736
Absolute

2752
02:03:33,248 --> 02:03:34,784
But any intelligent person listening

2753
02:03:38,368 --> 02:03:40,672
It's all booked this is a pretty

2754
02:03:41,184 --> 02:03:41,952
Gay evening

2755
02:03:42,208 --> 02:03:43,232
Critique of Alex

2756
02:03:43,744 --> 02:03:46,304
I also think it's too generous

2757
02:03:46,816 --> 02:03:52,192
Yeah that that like I think you take things that are speculative and you act like

2758
02:03:52,448 --> 02:03:53,216
You're convinced of

2759
02:03:53,728 --> 02:03:54,752
Yeah that is

2760
02:03:55,008 --> 02:03:55,776
A pretty

2761
02:03:56,032 --> 02:03:56,544
Deep cut

2762
02:03:57,056 --> 02:03:57,568
Because I

2763
02:03:57,824 --> 02:03:58,592
Think it's very active

2764
02:03:58,848 --> 02:03:59,616
It's 100

2765
02:03:59,872 --> 02:04:05,248
But the problem that I have is when you limited to speculation

2766
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:08,832
And things that you are fully convinced of because he's

2767
02:04:09,088 --> 02:04:12,416
Bring up lying and making things I was going to say

2768
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:13,184
Joe

2769
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:17,024
Who is is doing him a disservice

2770
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:17,792
Because

2771
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:20,096
He's not acknowledging Alex's

2772
02:04:20,352 --> 02:04:21,120
Greatest Talent

2773
02:04:21,376 --> 02:04:24,960
Which is lying on command about anything anytime

2774
02:04:25,216 --> 02:04:25,984
For no reason

2775
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:29,824
Or whatever he's rattling off a bus

2776
02:04:30,336 --> 02:04:30,848
Topix

2777
02:04:32,896 --> 02:04:39,040
Absolutely all over the place early

2778
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:40,576
Organize them a debunked

2779
02:04:40,832 --> 02:04:43,648
Do the things you do this for me in order to

2780
02:04:43,904 --> 02:04:45,952
Substantiate your claim

2781
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:46,976
That he

2782
02:04:47,488 --> 02:04:48,768
Is convinced

2783
02:04:49,024 --> 02:04:54,656
Things that are fully proven or whatever

2784
02:04:54,912 --> 02:04:55,680
But he's thrown out

2785
02:04:55,936 --> 02:04:56,448
It's like

2786
02:04:56,704 --> 02:04:57,472
Alright man

2787
02:04:57,984 --> 02:04:58,496
Buena Vista

2788
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:00,288
It's it's child

2789
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:02,336
It's a way of arguing that

2790
02:05:02,592 --> 02:05:03,104
Is like

2791
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:07,968
It is the way that people who don't want to do homework argue

2792
02:05:08,736 --> 02:05:09,760
In a group project

2793
02:05:10,016 --> 02:05:12,576
Where you're the person who does all the work you know

2794
02:05:13,344 --> 02:05:14,624
It's like

2795
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:18,208
Everything that they do is just saying a bunch of s*** at you

2796
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:21,024
And you're like God damn it now I have to learn about this

2797
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:25,376
Now I have to learn about that have to learn about this not to learn about this man

2798
02:05:25,888 --> 02:05:26,912
And he's not learning

2799
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:27,680
Anyting

2800
02:05:28,192 --> 02:05:28,960
It's all on you

2801
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:30,752
So Alex

2802
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:32,544
Brings up like some of the

2803
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:33,568
Books

2804
02:05:33,824 --> 02:05:36,896
And what have you and broken is really convinced

2805
02:05:37,152 --> 02:05:40,736
Book sources cuz I look sometimes

2806
02:05:40,992 --> 02:05:41,760
Dumb

2807
02:05:42,016 --> 02:05:44,832
I've read more than one who brings up one Dumb Book

2808
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:46,624
Behold the pale white horse

2809
02:05:48,416 --> 02:05:48,928
Information

2810
02:05:50,720 --> 02:05:55,328
The government's having alien bases on the Dark Side of the Moon

2811
02:05:59,936 --> 02:06:01,472
There's a lot of books like

2812
02:06:04,032 --> 02:06:04,800
70% of our land

2813
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:06,336
October 8th

2814
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:07,360
2000

2815
02:06:07,872 --> 02:06:08,384
They took over 7

2816
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:10,176
United States land mass

2817
02:06:10,688 --> 02:06:11,200
Yes

2818
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:14,528
In what way where how did it take over

2819
02:06:14,784 --> 02:06:16,320
Infowars.com

2820
02:06:16,576 --> 02:06:17,088
Interview

2821
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:20,416
Congressman Ron Paul they signed over the country to the UN sir

2822
02:06:30,144 --> 02:06:31,424
And the national bar

2823
02:06:32,192 --> 02:06:32,960
Chicago

2824
02:06:33,216 --> 02:06:33,728
Tribune agrees

2825
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:35,008
Okay

2826
02:06:35,264 --> 02:06:41,408
That's why it's so unfair to have a conversation like this with somebody on a radio show

2827
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:47,808
She's not at all talking to you at all not even a little bit hear what you have to say is a meaningless what he's doing is

2828
02:06:48,064 --> 02:06:50,624
Posturing for the listeners fostering and then at the

2829
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:52,928
But he's being a very unsuccessful

2830
02:06:53,184 --> 02:06:54,720
If you're paying attention

2831
02:06:55,488 --> 02:07:01,632
He's also just trying to throw you off absolutely throwing out these things all over the

2832
02:07:01,888 --> 02:07:02,912
Play

2833
02:07:03,168 --> 02:07:05,728
Possibly have any idea what he's talking about

2834
02:07:05,984 --> 02:07:06,752
2 + t.r.u.

2835
02:07:07,264 --> 02:07:10,080
You look less grounded in the criticisms that you're my

2836
02:07:11,104 --> 02:07:11,616
If you are Rogan

2837
02:07:11,872 --> 02:07:15,968
It's basically like you're having an argument with someone you're talking about I don't know

2838
02:07:16,224 --> 02:07:22,368
Interest rates and then there are actually little people

2839
02:07:25,696 --> 02:07:26,208
What

2840
02:07:26,976 --> 02:07:27,488
Sure

2841
02:07:27,744 --> 02:07:31,584
Did you know the UN has 70 70 70% of Americas

2842
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:33,888
Fine

2843
02:07:34,144 --> 02:07:40,288
No they are getting rid of juries

2844
02:07:40,544 --> 02:07:43,104
Yes I only no response

2845
02:07:44,384 --> 02:07:47,200
SoJO tries to just reprimand Alex for like

2846
02:07:47,456 --> 02:07:50,528
Being an a****** well his inability to accept that there are things

2847
02:07:50,784 --> 02:07:51,296
He doesn't know

2848
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:53,088
He does have that ability

2849
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:55,904
I meant Alex does with you expect

2850
02:07:56,416 --> 02:07:57,696
The e x like a little baby

2851
02:07:58,720 --> 02:07:59,232
We didn't

2852
02:08:00,768 --> 02:08:03,072
That's why this is happening regardless

2853
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:08,192
We don't know who it is

2854
02:08:09,472 --> 02:08:10,752
All we all heard it was

2855
02:08:15,872 --> 02:08:17,152
Initial reports they were looking

2856
02:08:17,408 --> 02:08:18,944
For Islamic fundamentalist Terror

2857
02:08:19,456 --> 02:08:22,272
Oklahoma Joe's

2858
02:08:26,112 --> 02:08:26,624
Everything

2859
02:08:29,696 --> 02:08:30,976
You even said yourself

2860
02:08:32,768 --> 02:08:36,352
Stock market

2861
02:08:39,168 --> 02:08:39,936
So we don't know yet

2862
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:45,312
Map directions

2863
02:08:46,592 --> 02:08:50,688
I guess I don't know anything I'll just

2864
02:08:55,808 --> 02:08:59,392
We don't know who

2865
02:09:00,928 --> 02:09:01,952
But she's going

2866
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:04,000
Hi Samantha you and I never gonna be alright

2867
02:09:04,512 --> 02:09:06,048
F*** you Jesus Christ

2868
02:09:06,304 --> 02:09:06,816
Iceman

2869
02:09:07,072 --> 02:09:10,144
Not saying that

2870
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:11,424
What does the worst

2871
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:12,704
The worst person

2872
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:13,472
Listen to talk to

2873
02:09:13,984 --> 02:09:17,312
Just the worst sojo's making a fine point and bring

2874
02:09:17,568 --> 02:09:18,592
Backup do you like

2875
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:24,224
Why do you sing the terrorist attack is the result was not punishing other terrorists in the past

2876
02:09:24,736 --> 02:09:27,552
When first of all you think all of those past terrorist events are fake

2877
02:09:27,808 --> 02:09:29,088
Exactly

2878
02:09:29,344 --> 02:09:32,672
Maybe you did this to Despicable I speak to roll up a gyro correct

2879
02:09:32,928 --> 02:09:39,072
What the f*** are you talking about you're on your way there if you don't know things and that's okay today

2880
02:09:40,352 --> 02:09:46,496
Let's give up our freedom

2881
02:09:46,752 --> 02:09:47,264
How about that

2882
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:52,896
What I want to do is never come back here again

2883
02:09:53,152 --> 02:09:59,296
That's great what a prick only Joe it's Dave mad at Alex prayers everyday since 9/11

2884
02:10:02,112 --> 02:10:02,880
Call Josh

2885
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:04,928
Sneakers

2886
02:10:05,184 --> 02:10:05,696
That was

2887
02:10:05,952 --> 02:10:08,256
Jose 9/11

2888
02:10:08,512 --> 02:10:09,792
There was an opportunity

2889
02:10:10,048 --> 02:10:11,328
SoJO leaves

2890
02:10:11,584 --> 02:10:17,728
Don't leave on terrible terms another still fully expect but there's definitely between

2891
02:10:19,264 --> 02:10:20,800
Did not see eye-to-eye

2892
02:10:21,312 --> 02:10:26,944
Emotional day but apparently heard neither of these guys is it is

2893
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:30,016
Grogan was given definitely a good bit of

2894
02:10:30,272 --> 02:10:31,552
Recognition of the

2895
02:10:31,808 --> 02:10:33,856
The loss of the tragedy I may not have

2896
02:10:34,112 --> 02:10:35,136
Got those clips

2897
02:10:35,392 --> 02:10:35,904
As much

2898
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:37,952
I think it's more interesting bit

2899
02:10:38,208 --> 02:10:42,560
Did they have this fight tonight 11th 911

2900
02:10:43,584 --> 02:10:44,096
I just

2901
02:10:44,352 --> 02:10:44,864
Don't

2902
02:10:45,376 --> 02:10:46,144
Understand

2903
02:10:47,168 --> 02:10:52,288
Everytime I come back to the thought like oh then you know what we do and have done for a long time

2904
02:10:52,544 --> 02:10:53,312
Surprise

2905
02:10:54,336 --> 02:10:57,152
Joe Rogan and Alex Jones got into a fight on 9/11

2906
02:10:57,664 --> 02:10:58,176
Surprise

2907
02:10:58,432 --> 02:11:00,736
You know how we've done this thing for five years

2908
02:11:01,248 --> 02:11:04,832
And the only thing that I could say that would really make you go

2909
02:11:05,088 --> 02:11:07,392
That's probably not ever possible

2910
02:11:07,904 --> 02:11:09,184
Is Joe Rogan and

2911
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:15,328
Alex Jones got into a fight on 911 I think that's one of the one of the wonders of

2912
02:11:15,584 --> 02:11:17,376
This of this

2913
02:11:17,632 --> 02:11:21,728
Space space whatever it is that Alex's doing it's like

2914
02:11:22,496 --> 02:11:28,640
You can do 700 episodes of this and still be like what

2915
02:11:29,152 --> 02:11:29,920
No

2916
02:11:30,432 --> 02:11:31,200
No

2917
02:11:31,456 --> 02:11:32,480
I want to scream

2918
02:11:32,736 --> 02:11:33,248
So

2919
02:11:33,504 --> 02:11:34,016
Predictably

2920
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:36,576
Yes and now I have access to take

2921
02:11:36,832 --> 02:11:39,136
Control at Meredith

2922
02:11:39,392 --> 02:11:40,672
You know I sit there and I watched

2923
02:11:40,928 --> 02:11:42,208
And it's the same thing with our

2924
02:11:43,232 --> 02:11:43,744
Neurotic

2925
02:11:45,536 --> 02:11:46,304
Military

2926
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:47,072
Bought a good day

2927
02:11:48,608 --> 02:11:49,632
Number one TV host

2928
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:50,912
Play just can't

2929
02:11:51,168 --> 02:11:52,192
Can't face the system

2930
02:11:52,704 --> 02:11:54,240
Dinner with Joanne steps

2931
02:11:56,032 --> 02:11:56,544
Take later

2932
02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:57,312
Hosting live right now

2933
02:12:00,384 --> 02:12:01,152
Website

2934
02:12:03,456 --> 02:12:06,784
I know you don't totally believe all the

2935
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:08,576
Come on tell me

2936
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:13,696
He just he agrees with a lot of them

2937
02:12:13,952 --> 02:12:14,976
Play just can't go all the way I'm at

2938
02:12:15,232 --> 02:12:15,744
A problem

2939
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:17,280
Damn and you just can't face

2940
02:12:18,048 --> 02:12:19,072
It's not man enough

2941
02:12:20,352 --> 02:12:21,888
Two-faced things the way that I do

2942
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:23,168
What could you buy

2943
02:12:23,424 --> 02:12:24,192
Possibly get

2944
02:12:24,448 --> 02:12:25,216
Out of a relationship

2945
02:12:25,472 --> 02:12:27,008
Ship with a person like Alex

2946
02:12:27,264 --> 02:12:28,032
That justifies

2947
02:12:29,312 --> 02:12:30,592
Everything that he's done

2948
02:12:30,848 --> 02:12:33,920
I mean look I used in college

2949
02:12:34,176 --> 02:12:36,480
I used to hang out with some people that maybe

2950
02:12:36,992 --> 02:12:39,552
They were a little bit annoying but they usually had weed

2951
02:12:41,344 --> 02:12:41,856
Maybe that's what

2952
02:12:42,112 --> 02:12:45,696
What's going on you didn't have that they came to you for

2953
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:47,744
And then you were like

2954
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,024
You're my best friend

2955
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:51,840
Yeah I don't know I mean

2956
02:12:52,096 --> 02:12:52,608
What is

2957
02:12:52,864 --> 02:12:53,376
Like

2958
02:12:53,632 --> 02:12:54,144
Imagine

2959
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:55,680
The Alex is like

2960
02:12:56,192 --> 02:12:58,496
In like interpersonally so generous

2961
02:12:58,752 --> 02:12:59,776
And caring

2962
02:13:00,032 --> 02:13:00,544
And like

2963
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:06,176
Gives you the perfect birthday gift every year like I can't imagine what it is that would

2964
02:13:06,432 --> 02:13:07,712
Make somebody

2965
02:13:08,224 --> 02:13:12,064
What's up with this s*** if Alex had like

2966
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:14,624
Pulled him from the bottom of a lake

2967
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:15,648
While he was

2968
02:13:15,904 --> 02:13:16,416
Drowning

2969
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:23,584
I would say you get a couple of years out of the actuary

2970
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:27,168
6 1/2 year old Lake

2971
02:13:27,424 --> 02:13:29,216
25 years of friendship

2972
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:31,264
What happened

2973
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:37,664
I think Joe probably stopped listening after he got off

2974
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:41,504
Didn't hear Alex talkingshit

2975
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:42,784
Cannot listen to Al

2976
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:46,624
Blissfully unaware of anything that Alex does for a living

2977
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:49,184
Must be that has to be almost I think

2978
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:50,464
Baby there's a contract

2979
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:53,792
They signed Bowman Alex started doing the show

2980
02:13:54,048 --> 02:13:55,072
Don't ever listen

2981
02:13:55,328 --> 02:14:01,216
Don't ask me any questions about it and work day Joe our relationship is successful because you have just created an

2982
02:14:01,472 --> 02:14:07,616
Image of what I do in your head face reality

2983
02:14:07,872 --> 02:14:08,896
You imagine if

2984
02:14:09,152 --> 02:14:12,736
Alex had come back with Joe you do yourself a disservice

2985
02:14:12,992 --> 02:14:16,832
Creating the people around you

2986
02:14:17,088 --> 02:14:18,624
Giving them a higher sense of

2987
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:22,720
Value towards yourself and generosity from their spirit

2988
02:14:22,976 --> 02:14:29,120
Yeah who's doing a disservice now a******

2989
02:14:29,376 --> 02:14:31,168
To threaten to cut you like a pig

2990
02:14:31,424 --> 02:14:37,568
Phoenix children

2991
02:14:38,848 --> 02:14:44,736
We're going to have a psychically abusive or 25 years

2992
02:14:46,272 --> 02:14:47,040
Crazy

2993
02:14:47,552 --> 02:14:48,576
Very sad

2994
02:14:48,832 --> 02:14:50,624
Alex more calls

2995
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:56,512
Used about that Rogan appearance

2996
02:15:00,864 --> 02:15:02,144
Call Kevin Booth my body and talk

2997
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:03,936
Call man said I want to come on this guy's

2998
02:15:04,448 --> 02:15:04,960
Number one

2999
02:15:05,216 --> 02:15:05,728
What's on television

3000
02:15:08,288 --> 02:15:09,056
I say we're friends

3001
02:15:10,592 --> 02:15:11,360
Jojo

3002
02:15:11,616 --> 02:15:12,128
The show

3003
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:13,664
He just can't believe all

3004
02:15:14,688 --> 02:15:15,456
He believes a lot of

3005
02:15:17,504 --> 02:15:18,528
The best killed

3006
02:15:18,784 --> 02:15:19,296
Kennedy

3007
02:15:19,808 --> 02:15:21,856
Stuff like that you just can't go all the way

3008
02:15:22,112 --> 02:15:22,880
He doesn't want to admit that

3009
02:15:23,392 --> 02:15:23,904
Picturesque

3010
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:24,928
Hollywood Life

3011
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:28,000
Jeopardy he's a coward he doesn't want to give up the

3012
02:15:28,256 --> 02:15:30,816
Trappings of Fame in the glitz and glamour of

3013
02:15:31,072 --> 02:15:32,096
Hollywood

3014
02:15:32,352 --> 02:15:34,400
If you wants to hold on to that

3015
02:15:35,424 --> 02:15:35,936
What

3016
02:15:36,192 --> 02:15:36,960
I mean

3017
02:15:37,216 --> 02:15:39,776
Angels mine

3018
02:15:40,544 --> 02:15:41,568
Does he think

3019
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:43,360
That Alex

3020
02:15:43,616 --> 02:15:47,200
Is criticizing him in the same way that Joe is criticizing

3021
02:15:47,456 --> 02:15:47,968
Alex

3022
02:15:48,224 --> 02:15:49,248
When he says

3023
02:15:49,504 --> 02:15:51,040
Your pie

3024
02:15:51,552 --> 02:15:53,856
Relying on conjecture and b*******

3025
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:55,904
Like this Jose

3026
02:15:56,160 --> 02:15:57,440
Take that is like a legitimate

3027
02:15:57,696 --> 02:15:58,976
Criticism

3028
02:15:59,488 --> 02:16:01,792
Cuz that's a f****** dirty insults

3029
02:16:02,048 --> 02:16:04,352
Horrible a personal attack on you

3030
02:16:04,608 --> 02:16:06,656
Essentially it's saying your character is such

3031
02:16:06,912 --> 02:16:08,192
What's that you value

3032
02:16:08,448 --> 02:16:10,496
Material and selfish

3033
02:16:10,752 --> 02:16:15,616
Pleasures over saving the world

3034
02:16:15,872 --> 02:16:19,968
Joe's a nice guy but he's a rich prick like that's what you're saying

3035
02:16:20,224 --> 02:16:23,296
How is that not a defensive thing to hear

3036
02:16:23,552 --> 02:16:25,856
He knows a lot of stuff

3037
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:29,440
Amy probably has a suspicion that

3038
02:16:29,696 --> 02:16:31,744
What I'm saying is totally true

3039
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:32,512
But

3040
02:16:32,768 --> 02:16:34,048
I mean Tiffany even then

3041
02:16:34,304 --> 02:16:35,328
You're reading your

3042
02:16:35,584 --> 02:16:37,376
In your conspiracies

3043
02:16:37,888 --> 02:16:39,680
The top executives

3044
02:16:39,936 --> 02:16:46,080
Are the people doing the thing and we know that Joe Knows those people now you are saying that he

3045
02:16:46,336 --> 02:16:51,968
He's too much of a coward to stand up to them why aren't you just taking the step and going

3046
02:16:52,224 --> 02:16:56,576
He's part of the system he doesn't listen to all because he'll talk to her

3047
02:16:56,832 --> 02:17:02,976
Years he'll be right there almost ready

3048
02:17:03,232 --> 02:17:09,376
Over the over the board and save the devil

3049
02:17:10,144 --> 02:17:12,192
Running things and we have to have a holy war

3050
02:17:12,704 --> 02:17:15,264
So we have one last clip here and

3051
02:17:16,288 --> 02:17:18,336
I think this is a good example of Alex

3052
02:17:18,592 --> 02:17:19,104
Doing eggs

3053
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:20,896
Exactly what Joe criticized

3054
02:17:21,152 --> 02:17:21,664
10-4

3055
02:17:22,688 --> 02:17:23,968
Dodge do we have Liberty

3056
02:17:24,992 --> 02:17:25,504
Society

3057
02:17:26,016 --> 02:17:27,552
Now we're not about to give it all up

3058
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:31,392
We're going to strike back whoever did it

3059
02:17:31,648 --> 02:17:33,440
Hello as I think we know who did it don't we

3060
02:17:34,976 --> 02:17:36,000
The New World Order

3061
02:17:40,864 --> 02:17:42,400
I think we know who did it

3062
02:17:42,656 --> 02:17:47,008
98% certain it's the New World Order EU Iran Iraq

3063
02:17:47,264 --> 02:17:51,360
Whatever Germany

3064
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:56,992
One-hundred-percent certain it's the new world order

3065
02:17:57,504 --> 02:17:58,016
Wild

3066
02:17:58,528 --> 02:18:00,576
So what a day

3067
02:18:00,832 --> 02:18:01,344
Wow

3068
02:18:01,600 --> 02:18:02,112
What

3069
02:18:02,624 --> 02:18:03,136
F******

3070
02:18:03,648 --> 02:18:05,952
I don't think there's any way you could

3071
02:18:06,208 --> 02:18:07,488
Necessarily expect

3072
02:18:09,024 --> 02:18:09,536
I think

3073
02:18:09,792 --> 02:18:10,816
Content-wise

3074
02:18:11,072 --> 02:18:12,864
The morning show was

3075
02:18:13,376 --> 02:18:13,888
Wacky

3076
02:18:14,144 --> 02:18:15,680
Yeah and all over the place

3077
02:18:17,216 --> 02:18:17,984
I meant this

3078
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:20,544
Was something

3079
02:18:21,824 --> 02:18:22,336
I just

3080
02:18:23,360 --> 02:18:24,128
You know

3081
02:18:25,664 --> 02:18:26,944
You can take

3082
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:27,712
The day off

3083
02:18:28,224 --> 02:18:30,272
Can't you take the evening off you already did a show

3084
02:18:30,528 --> 02:18:32,576
You can do it yeah you can just

3085
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:34,624
You can just say no

3086
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:36,160
Do you have a choice

3087
02:18:36,416 --> 02:18:39,232
There's no need for you to do another 3 hours if

3088
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,816
An hour plus of it is going to be arguing with

3089
02:18:43,072 --> 02:18:43,840
Joe Rogan

3090
02:18:46,912 --> 02:18:50,496
This is disrespectful

3091
02:18:52,544 --> 02:18:58,176
This is disrespectful it really is happened by myself if they made this like

3092
02:18:58,432 --> 02:19:04,576
10 years later as a hey what would it be like if we did a show on 9/11

3093
02:19:04,832 --> 02:19:05,856
Disrespectful things

3094
02:19:06,112 --> 02:19:07,904
To do

3095
02:19:08,928 --> 02:19:12,512
Oh man go Boston go New York that's what it's

3096
02:19:12,768 --> 02:19:16,864
Jesus Christ I mean the Mind reels and

3097
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:22,240
I really have anything to say I think he's episodes speak for themselves

3098
02:19:22,496 --> 02:19:26,592
I think that like as much criticism as you may give the media which is deserved

3099
02:19:26,848 --> 02:19:28,384
A lot of it is very deserve for sure

3100
02:19:29,408 --> 02:19:31,200
Nobody did a worse job than Alex

3101
02:19:31,712 --> 02:19:32,224
Alex

3102
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:33,248
Completely with

3103
02:19:33,504 --> 02:19:34,784
Lyft on every count

3104
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:35,808
I wish

3105
02:19:36,064 --> 02:19:37,344
He's 9/11 coverage

3106
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:38,624
This sucked

3107
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:40,416
It was disrespectful it was

3108
02:19:40,672 --> 02:19:41,440
Was disgusting

3109
02:19:41,696 --> 02:19:42,720
The way he focused

3110
02:19:42,976 --> 02:19:44,512
Largely on the

3111
02:19:44,768 --> 02:19:46,560
Grotesque images of Bernie

3112
02:19:46,816 --> 02:19:48,096
Bodies and people jumping

3113
02:19:48,352 --> 02:19:49,376
And himself

3114
02:19:49,888 --> 02:19:50,400
On the way

3115
02:19:51,936 --> 02:19:52,960
Essentially called

3116
02:19:53,216 --> 02:19:56,032
The people who died in the plains coward or not taking back over

3117
02:19:56,288 --> 02:19:58,336
Jesus I'd just abhorrent

3118
02:19:58,592 --> 02:19:59,872
Behavior All Around

3119
02:20:00,896 --> 02:20:01,408
The

3120
02:20:02,176 --> 02:20:03,200
Value I think

3121
02:20:03,456 --> 02:20:03,968
Think of Watch

3122
02:20:04,224 --> 02:20:05,760
This and seeing this

3123
02:20:06,272 --> 02:20:08,064
He's but you do see a very

3124
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:10,624
Concrete example of the beginning of that

3125
02:20:11,648 --> 02:20:14,464
The bombs in the building narrative you see what it's based on

3126
02:20:14,976 --> 02:20:16,000
You see it the friend

3127
02:20:16,256 --> 02:20:19,584
Who becomes a world-class structural engineer

3128
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:22,656
Ucv Chicago

3129
02:20:22,912 --> 02:20:24,960
Tribune article that's being lied about it

3130
02:20:25,216 --> 02:20:26,240
You see this

3131
02:20:27,520 --> 02:20:33,408
Apocryphal local news story that he heard a local radio host talking about right

3132
02:20:33,664 --> 02:20:34,944
Then in you see these

3133
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:37,760
Pieces these disparate pieces coming together

3134
02:20:38,016 --> 02:20:40,832
That you know five years later are going

3135
02:20:41,088 --> 02:20:42,112
To be presented

3136
02:20:42,368 --> 02:20:43,904
Not as what they are

3137
02:20:45,184 --> 02:20:45,696
Like

3138
02:20:45,952 --> 02:20:46,976
The world's top

3139
02:20:47,232 --> 02:20:50,304
Structural engineer came on and gave me an

3140
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:52,096
A schematic

3141
02:20:52,608 --> 02:20:56,448
A breakdown with all of the equations about how this was impossible

3142
02:20:56,704 --> 02:20:59,008
They did that Chemical Testing

3143
02:20:59,264 --> 02:21:00,544
You know all of this in

3144
02:21:01,056 --> 02:21:01,568
Yeah it's

3145
02:21:01,824 --> 02:21:02,336
It's going to

3146
02:21:05,408 --> 02:21:07,712
Use what Alex's conspiracies are

3147
02:21:07,968 --> 02:21:08,480
Core

3148
02:21:08,992 --> 02:21:10,016
This is what they are

3149
02:21:11,296 --> 02:21:12,832
It was all there in the beginning

3150
02:21:14,112 --> 02:21:15,392
There wasn't anything there to begin

3151
02:21:16,928 --> 02:21:17,440
It's

3152
02:21:17,696 --> 02:21:18,208
A whim

3153
02:21:19,744 --> 02:21:20,768
Yeah the most

3154
02:21:21,024 --> 02:21:23,328
Real thing is probably Alex and Joe fighting

3155
02:21:23,584 --> 02:21:24,352
I mean yeah

3156
02:21:24,608 --> 02:21:29,984
Yeah that's the only thing that it felt like Alex actually gave a genuine s*** about

3157
02:21:30,752 --> 02:21:31,776
Being threatened

3158
02:21:33,312 --> 02:21:37,664
Reality

3159
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:38,688
Yeah I was not being

3160
02:21:38,944 --> 02:21:39,968
The person who's who's the

3161
02:21:40,224 --> 02:21:42,016
The smartest person on the on the show

3162
02:21:42,528 --> 02:21:43,552
Wow

3163
02:21:43,808 --> 02:21:46,368
Jordan yes Dan this is been a ride

3164
02:21:47,392 --> 02:21:49,696
F****** rollercoaster my friend

3165
02:21:49,952 --> 02:21:56,096
But will be back indeed we will for another episode at a later date

3166
02:22:02,752 --> 02:22:03,776
Cameo I'm Leo I

3167
02:22:04,032 --> 02:22:04,800

3168
02:22:05,056 --> 02:22:05,568
I'm

3169
02:22:05,824 --> 02:22:06,592
Dairy

3170
02:22:07,616 --> 02:22:08,384
Brownfield

3171
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:09,920
That's it Brownfield

3172
02:22:11,456 --> 02:22:12,224
What the sex robot

3173
02:22:12,736 --> 02:22:14,784
Holding

3174
02:22:16,832 --> 02:22:20,416
