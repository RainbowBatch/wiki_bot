00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,279
You talk about escapees from a lunatic asylum

193
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
People a

194
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,751
More insane for elevator

195
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,567
That's just a few of them know

196
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,871
Almost all of them

197
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
Where

198
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:28,575
It was yesterday in Austin

199
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:34,975
So Alex and Owen Shroyer went out to a Bernie rally and I lost into bullhorn and try and cause a scene

200
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:39,839
Mission in life zombies

201
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,887
In their third of business mission

202
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:48,287
And statement and yellow people

203
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
Alchemy into bull horns

204
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,663
Really just a sad look for Infowars

205
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:59,551
The first thing I want to say is that there's a proximately a two-and-a-half-hour video of Owen at the rally actually talk

206
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
Okay

207
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,879
Treating him with respect and answering question

208
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,903
Coherently

209
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,999
All of that is not in the video that Infowars really

210
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
It's not

211
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,559
They just ignored all that released

212
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,863
The four-minute video people yelling at Owen and making

213
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,423
Can faces at his camera clearly f****** with him

214
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,727
The video of people calmly talk

215
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,799
Owen undermines The Narrative it enforces trying to push

216
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
Matt is at all the

217
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,151
People at this Bernie rally a raving lunatic to Pista pants

218
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,967
Anyway the big news is that one of Owens

219
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,735
Security guards

220
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,295
Was attacked by the horrible evil violin Bernie's

221
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:35,391
Supporters project Veritas videos want to put Alex and his friends

222
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,463
In a gulag

223
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
And what act

224
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,279
Actually happened is way way different

225
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,559
Then what Alex is saying

226
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,655
In the video there's a middle-aged woman yelling We Love You A Towing

227
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,215
Prior to the incident

228
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,543
Trying to get the security guard

229
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,895
And even get through them to hug Owen which I guess you might call a salt

230
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,991
They wanted to try and pull that the padlock for the talk show

231
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,295
Shroyer to attempt to pole

232
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:08,671
Destroyer destroyed by a nice little

233
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:15,071
Expressing his love any younger man walks up and appears to be taking a bit of a more confrontational pose towards Owen it is

234
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,375
Security guards but he's not attacking anyone or anything

235
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,679
As far as the video shows at this

236
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,959
Point unprovoked

237
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,775
Owen Shroyer hits this guy in the face with his bullhorn

238
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
You just clock

239
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,335
The guy with the bullhorn

240
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,151
The problem is that Owen at a security guard

241
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,967
Standing in between him and this guy he just hit with a bullhorn

242
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,271
Do you need to reach over the security guard

243
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,831
Approved intense there

244
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:41,183
Is bringing the bullhorn back to a neutral position

245
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,975
He also hits his own

246
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,023
Security guard in the face with a bullhorn

247
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:50,399
It legitimately clear as day from the video which I posted on their website

248
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,191
Even showing it in slow motion

249
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,751
That the only strike that occurred with Owen hitting

250
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,543
Two people in the face with a bullhorn

251
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,591
Seemingly completely on Prop

252
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:02,687
Alright Infowars has been showing the security guards face which was bloody

253
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,247
And using it as proof of the violent left and how could

254
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,551
Conservice can't go out to public without getting attacked

255
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
Mayfield

256
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,903
Point out that the only thing that hit that dude's face was Owen Shroyer bullhorn

257
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,207
And he never would have been hurt if I want head

258
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,767
The guy who is the other guy in the face

259
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
Seemingly unprovoked

260
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,887
The worst-rated in 1984 territory we are watching

261
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,679
The thing happen and Alec

262
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
Alexa saying that the

263
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,727
The opposite happened yes

264
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,007
While we're watching

265
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,799
It seems that way

266
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,383
Thanks wrote an article on Gateway pundit with the headline quote

267
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,991
Infowars crewmember attacked and left bloodied by crazed leftist at Bernie rally

268
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,831
Is Owen a crazed leftist Madison to hospital with stitches

269
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,391
The article embedded a tweet

270
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:49,791
Samoan saying quote unhinged Bernie supporters drew blood on my security tonight at the Bernie rally

271
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:54,143
If people are radical and violent their everything they claim to be against

272
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:58,239
No matter the article about him being hit in the face by Owen weirdly

273
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,543
Really feel like this isn't fair I've been looking

274
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,359
For other angles of this video but I haven't been able to find any

275
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,639
And based on what I can

276
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,199
Can see this really looks like a case of assault

277
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:11,807
Guy accidentally hitting his own security guard in the face then blaming the guy he assaulted

278
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,575
For hitting his

279
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
Security guard

280
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
It's super clear from the video that

281
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,951
The guy made no contact with the security guys face

282
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
At all

283
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,583
And this is why they're not going to press charges against that dude this is one that will never ever happen

284
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,935
Because the exonerating evidence is clearly posted are banned. Video for the world to see

285
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,751
Alright anybody to go look at that video it's

286
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,519
Very clear

287
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,567
It's in slow-mo

288
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,871
Not fair you can

289
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,431
Rubberized telling you before the show that I was

290
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:43,295
Exhausted by towards one of the reasons why I'm feeling

291
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,367
Because it's clear if you watch the video that this is

292
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,391
Is the situation where

293
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,415
It's it's

294
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:54,815
Insane to see Owen take his bullhorn and hit a guy in the face with it and then then plead like

295
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,375
That can't be

296
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
Flies

297
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,007
And someone someone like Cassandra Fairbanks will write an article with their position on it

298
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,591
And and a bloodied face and it'll be attached to

299
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
This is what the crazy

300
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,151
Leftist to do it

301
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
It's it's

302
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,711
Exhausting because it works

303
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,735
It works

304
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,527
There's nothing you can really do about it

305
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,319
The video that just bruised it is there

306
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,111
It's it's there for the sea

307
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,391
Right

308
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,719
How how do you

309
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,767
Combat reality

310
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
Viad

311
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,607
I don't understand it

312
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,399
I just don't understand

313
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,679
Can say that it's tough

314
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,215
It's very tough

315
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,799
Nightmarish the idea that you are showing the video

316
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,103
Proving that what you are saying is false

317
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:43,967
As proof that you are telling the truth and I don't hold you accountable

318
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:49,855
Gaslighting

319
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,671
Yeah I wondered about that a Wonder

320
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
I think they'd like

321
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:57,791
At a certain point it might not be worth it to press charges just goes oh and hit him

322
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,071
Because then

323
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,983
I think it's like be more trouble than it's worth once you become like they have video this guy and

324
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,519
They're blaming him for

325
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,567
Assaulting the security guard

326
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,615
At a certain point that you're being used

327
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
To tarnish

328
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
A bunch of other

329
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
People

330
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,199
It seems I don't know

331
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:21,599
I don't know what I would do and I don't know I don't know if that guy bumped into the security guard before Owen hit him and

332
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,903
Becomes a murky

333
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,439
Spider-Man with a bullhorn

334
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,719
D.va

335
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,023
You definitely can see that if you want to look at it

336
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,559
So

337
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
This is bulshit

338
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,607
Yeah but

339
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,631
There's other b*******

340
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,167
Surprising

341
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:41,823
And now I just got words I was 30 seconds late getting on air from art pick national food supplier

342
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:47,711
I warned everybody it wasn't again like I told you that if you want the 14 days now it's 3 weeks

343
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,247
Liberate everybody else is sold out

Food

345
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,439
Three weeks to deliver now no

346
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,231
I would say that a good

347
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,255
Third of this

348
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,535
Entire episode is selling

349
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,815
Yeah almost

350
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,839
The third of it is

351
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,399
Just talking about how everybody's got to buy this food

352
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,447
You know what it's got eight

353
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,727
If prices are going to go up

354
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:13,311
Everybody's got to get this it's it's a disgraceful

355
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,359
Three hour-long infomercial

356
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,383
For food

357
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,943
It's disrupted to periodically for other top

358
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
Jesus

Jim Bakker episode

360
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,087
That's the other reason that this is very exhausting

361
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,623
Because this episode listening

362
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,903
Intuit with so much

363

Weird I get to its aggressive

371
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,727
That's not good

372
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,799
I think part of that is probably because he's seeing a return on it

373
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,079
You seeing that it's working

374
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,383
And so keep pushing hard on the point that

375
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,687
He should try the Jim Bakker have a Christmas

376
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,967
Easton proud of him with

377
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,247
Just as survival food

378
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,623
So Alex is at the market is taking

379
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,183
And Alex is really mad that

380
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,975
Are these people

381
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,023
There who are saying

382
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,607
This is good or something

383
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,935
The dams are cheering for the mark iPhone

384
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,055
Licking her lips

385
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
Hoping for this

386
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,407
This year

387
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:28,319
GDP growth that this Administration been talking about that for years he's are all things that down

388
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,087
You can run

389
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,183
And they go on for another 10 minutes

390
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,463
Talkin about

391
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,231
Talk about

392
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,815
If you're a Democrat watching that

393
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,095
I hope the economy crash

394
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,119
Get rid of trump

395
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
Yes

396
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,215
That's not what that guy said

397
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:51,359
Anyways it's also 30 more dollars for a giant bucket of food just so you know I hate these heartless two M's

398
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,687
It is an increase of $35 now for another bucket

399
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,783
I'm so sorry any credibility with his audience

400
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,831
But he said if that clip is it being a

401
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,415
TV host licking their lips about the economy going down because it'll hurt truck

402
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,951
But on the actual Clippers

403
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:09,279
You think I'm making a very straightforward assessment that I think is indisputable

404
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,119
Trump has made the economy a centerpiece of his claims that he's a good president

405
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,215
If you call him he takes a downturn or fails to reach the levels Trump promise

406
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,031
Who's the Democratic candidate could use that in a campaign

407
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:24,127
How dare someone point that out at a time like this Dan

408
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:27,967
Where's the celebrating of the economy dropping it's not there at all

409
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,991
He was over

410
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,783
Rejoice you can hear this voice

411
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,087
In the face by a bull horn

412
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,463
He must really hate with Trump himself said about the real estate

413
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,231
A crash

414
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:43,327
Prior to the crash she was interviewed for an audiobook in 2006 where he was asked

415
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:47,935
Quote there's a lot of talk would you have no doubt heard to about a so-called real estate bubble what's

416
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,215
Your take on that pessimism

417
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,007
Trump replied quotes

418
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,311
Well first of all I sort of hope that happen

419
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,871
Because then people like me would go in and buy

420
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,687
You know when you're in a good cash position when I'm at a good

421
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,967
Cash position today

422
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,271
Then people like me would go in and buy like crazy

423
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:06,879
That sounds way more like a guy who's rooting for a market to collapse in the clip that Alex

424
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,439
Just played

425
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,719
Commentator though is it

426
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
The commentator was

427
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,559
Just discussing the potential weak point for Trump in the next election

428
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,351
Did Trump was explicitly saying that the

429
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,399
The bursting of a real-estate bubble be good

430
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,703
Because he could personally make money off of

431
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,495
He was also holding a sign above his head

432
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:26,335
But that I am a psychopath I am a psychopath

433
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,895
Anyway none of this matters because this side of trump

434
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,199
Is the stuff that Alex obviously knows about the Paw

435
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,223
Pretends he doesn't

436
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,759
Because he's committed to prison

437
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,039
The good guy

438
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:39,903
This is exactly the stuff he'll start becoming a magically aware of as soon as it's time for Trump

439
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,719
Turn heel how fast you

440
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,511
He's informed of these pass

441
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:48,607
Transgression

442
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:54,751
Quick it'll be out Deluge of secret information omigod Governor Trump has mob ties

443
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,055
I didn't definitely say that

444
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,079
2015

445
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:58,847
Oh my God

446
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,615
Did you know the truck

447
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,895
Supported redlining

448
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,479
Alex wouldn't complain about

449
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,759
So the issue is

450
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
Stayed like

451
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
Damn

452
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,319
Want the market

453
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,343
Collab

454
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,135
Because Democrats

455
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:11,903
Don't work

456
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,231
There are no democratic

457
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,559
Does not work

458
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,911
Are government employees show

459
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,191
Free market economy

460
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:29,311
Turn people against the Nationals Trump they'll do it in a heartbeat

461
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,175
Planned

462
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,711
By us University

463
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,271
That was adopted by the Democrats back in the 80s

464
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:43,903
The economy with welfare

465
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,439
And with people having

466
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,791
Comfort the right fit Donuts

467
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,119
That's a real thing

468
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,655
I on the airplane with you

469
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,079
So we discussed cloward and Piven in the past and it's not with Alex

470
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:02,847
Describing

471
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,383
It's not really a

472
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,175
Plan as much as it is an analysis

473
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:09,759
These two professors are making the argument that financial hardship was

474
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,527
Far worse

475
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,551
In our country than this

476
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,831
Statistics were able to capture

477
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,623
Another lot of the American public

478
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,903
We're suffering through things

479
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,928
Even though really

480
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,952
Was available

481
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:23,328
Part of what allows our system to continue the way it has the illusion that most people are doing okay

482
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,888
And one thing that would shatter that illusion is a

483
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:30,752
Everyone in this country was eligible for social welfare programs collected on what they were eligible

484
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,520
Beaufort

485
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:36,384
This would lead to an overloading of the welfare system and from that with the scope of the real problem

486
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,408
Clear to see

487
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,224
The government will be inclined to finally eliminate poverty by

488
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,016
Instituting a guaranteed income for

489
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:47,648
This plan was obviously not adopted by the Democratic Party in the 80s

490
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,184
1966

491
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,744
And we don't have anything resembling guaranteed income

492
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,096
A candidate who is running on Ubi Andrew Yang is already dropped out of the race

493
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:00,704
Alex doesn't understand cloward and Piven but he knows the name and he knows that his audience

494
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,032
Not going to look into it enough to recognize that he's just making s*** up

495
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,824
As far as I can tell I was there

496
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,872
She's making up the claim the Democrats don't work

497
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,664
I'll be interested to see where he's getting that

498
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,944
Because it from everything I can

499
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,992
Until it's completely fabricated stat

500
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:17,856
He's just pulling out of his ass you haven't seen the Rasmussen polls 98% of Democrats

501
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,392
Don't worry professor

502
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:24,512
The other 2%

503
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:30,912
I don't know if you've ever spent your time watching videos of pelicans are cruising images of pelicans but I have and I was at 8

504
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:37,312
Unrelated lately unrelated

505
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,104
They are mean birds

506
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,152
Invite a bunch of pictures of them biting

507
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:41,920
Can kids have

508
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,688
Princeton

509
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,016
Their booty and they do not like people much

510
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,296
It was legitimately note

511
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:51,136
Would ever be used as a support animal

512
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,952
Challenge that somebody takes upon themselves just like I bet

513
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,720
I bet

514
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:57,024
I will bet you $1,000 that I can

515
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:00,352
Bring me to comfort Alex Gentlemen's Agreement

516
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,936
Fair I do think that it's possible that you can have

517
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:08,288
Like an emotional support Pelican or something like that in your house right like

518
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,824
A plane get the f*** out of here

519
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:14,944
This seems to be a meme that went around and right-wing circles in 2019 making fun of the snowflake

520
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,992
Somewhat

521
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,784
Apocryphal story about someone trying

522
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,320
Need to claim a pelican as an emotion

523
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:23,392
Child support animal but I can find no evidence that actually happened

524
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,672
But I can't find a tweet

525
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,952
From Adam Carolla making

526
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:26,976
In front of the idea

527
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,536
As far as I can tell it was a fake story those used

528
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,328
The laughter's Attica

529
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,096
Control

530
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,144
Alex is only bringing this up because of

531
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,424
The end of January

532
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,704
The Department of Transportation

533
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,264
Supposed to do rule that would strictly limit emotional

534
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,288
Call support animals

535
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,824
That are allowed on planes Beast

536
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
Specifically

537
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,384
Specially trained dogs

538
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:48,992
I checked in with the rules on various Airlines and up to that point no one allowed Pelicans

539
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,064
American Airlines has clear rules on their website with

540
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,136
Cats and dogs being allowed with some pretty strict

541
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:55,904
Wrentham place

542
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,696
Trained mini horses

543
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,744
Can be permitted as well

544
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,280
Kind of have to assume that

545
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:06,144
I almost never happened by the rule quote

546
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,680
Animal must be able to fit

547
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,496
At your feet under your seat or in your lap

548
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,544
You're very very small horse

549
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,384
Smaller horse than we have so far been discovered

550
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:22,016
Delta has a list of animals that are specifically restricted as sport animals that includes rodents

551
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,576
Insects reptiles birds anything with hooves

552
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,856
Basically everything

553
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,136
Accept cats or dogs

554
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,160
Southwest

555
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,720
Explicit and it only allowing quotes small vac

556
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,488
Vaccinated to mess

557
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,768
The cats and dogs

558
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,560
Inappropriate pet carrier

559
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,840
In the aircraft cabin

560
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,656
No one has a support Pelican on planes

561
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,192
And the Department of Transportation

562
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:43,520
New rule recommendation is aimed at targeting people they believe or trying

563
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,544
Magpul a scam

564
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,360
By claiming their dog or cat is an emotional support animal

565
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,152
In the skirting the fee they could

566
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,176
They would have to

567
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,712
To pay to travel with their pet

568
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:55,296
That's what they're doing to try to crack down on financial ship

569
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:58,880
Do the leftist snowflakes running support pelican

570
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:02,208
Because of cloward-piven ridiculous this is

571
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:02,976
Diculous

572
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:06,304
What kind of show

573
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,912
Hughes had really gotten his airline off the ground we would have been able to have Spruce keys

574
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,192
On all of our play

575
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,472
Whenever we soda

576
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,080
And it's a failure of being Birds

577
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,360
Very much

578
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,384
My aunt had

579
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,152
Geese

580
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,944
Terrorized me when we go visit

581
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,528
Is very very much time

582
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,832
Couple

583
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,624
Feels like a lot cuz I remember

584
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:34,464
Through a child's mind the feeder of the

585
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,768
So I think there's a hundred but there's probably like

586
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,048
Pet Sounds

587
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,328
I wouldn't have

588
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:42,144
Just cuz it sounds like a disease oh my aunt has geese

589
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
Sorry

590
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:45,984
Through it

591
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,080
So we get to talkin about the coronavirus situation a little bit and

592
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,872
What what

593
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,896
I mean you just got

594
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,176
All this is just

595
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,736
Conspiracy

596
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,272
Coronavirus

597
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,552
Define vaccine

598
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,880
Don't worry Bill and Melinda Gates already have one patented am ready

599
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,976
North Carolina University gave it to the Tricom

600
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,328
Smoking Gun

601
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,864
Knox

602
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,144
You had that out

603
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,680
Mama did that

604
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,448
I thought years ago

605
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,264
When it gets released

606
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:24,128
You don't know who to blame but really

607
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,408
Completely lost with this

608
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,200
Conspiracy theory now that there's a smoke

609
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:27,968
Vanguard

610
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,992
Yeah this is Austin

611
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:32,576
The rail because now he can't prove it anywhere else I would like you

612
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,600
Have to now

613
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,880
Keep in mind

614
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,184
That we've proven right

615
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,720
Aspect

616
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,256
You want to go with it

617
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,584
Anna gotta be like that has to be a part of your narrative

618
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,168
It's and it's definitely less wiggle ability

619
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,288
We're definitely on the de Crescendo if we're if we're on the the reason behind it is

620
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,080
They don't want you to know where it's

621
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,616
Coming from for some reason

622
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,920
Right

623
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,480
You want you got the you got the proof

624
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,528
It's a bit it's a bit lame

625
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,648
The issue to is that like we're seeing these these

626
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:13,792
Assertive flare-ups happening in countries like Italy right and it's not showing to be

627
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,096
That have the fatality rate

628
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,888
That you would be afraid of

629
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,912
Right

630
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,728
It's fine

631
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,264
It's good that you know we have

632
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,336
The coronavirus popping up other places

633
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,616
It certainly

634
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,408
Seeming to indicate they like

635
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,176
Okay

636
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:33,248
We're looking at a fatality rate that is

637
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,272
Very

638
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,040
Low

639
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:35,808
And

640
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,648
People who are having people who are in those demographics

641
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,696
Sitar are dying or people who are

642
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,488
Elderly or my pre-existing

643
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,768
Conditions which is what you would

644
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,536
Expect

645
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,816
It's not

646
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,608
The worst news pause

647
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,144
Right and

648
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,936
So Alex kind of knows that

649
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,472
Doesn't tell anybody that

650
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,776
But you need to prepare for that eventuality

651
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,056
And so here's how he does that

652
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,104
I don't believe this one

653
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,920
Test for a future

654
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,968
Population of n

655
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:10,624
What would be the Omega

656
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,648
Guadalajara

657
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,416
A decade

658
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,464
After that another match color

659
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,768
That I believe will kill about 7 billion people

660
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,560
Why has no-one left

661
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,608
Why

662
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,144
Melinda Gates plan is 5

663
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,544
Because I read it in the Georgia guidestone needs is correct

664
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,848
F*** you

665
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,384
I believe the neck

666
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,968
When it's a three-stage

667
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:39,552
Behind on top of everything

668
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,880
So we got at least 20-30 years before we even have to worry about right

669
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,672
This is escape hatch

670
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:48,768
Yeah this is how you get out of there when it ends up not being the

671
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,584
Civilizational level collapse where we end up at

672
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,192
Current situation where over for Humanity lone survivors

673
00:28:56,704 --> 00:29:02,848
So that's coming it down the road 10 years 20 years down the road or whatever

674
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,872
It'll turn out that the

675
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:09,504
Next one is the beta testing this one was the alpha test that's how you know Alex isn't seriously

676
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:13,344
So are some other conspiracies that are what kind of moron

677
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
Linguist

678
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,392
Basis

679
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,440
I guess about the Coronavirus

680
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,208
Zendaya

681
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
This is dumb

682
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,536
Tokyo Olympics

683
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,608
Covid-19

684
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,888
No longer though

685
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,192
Coronavirus United States

686
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,568
So what we got going on here is the Alex believes that the globalist changed the name of the Coronavirus

687
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,896
Wuhan out of it which is just something he's repeating from Mike Adam

688
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:40,480
Here's Mike back on February 16th informing Alex

689
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,504
This Dreadful

690
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,272
Conspiracy

691
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,320
The real play here is that China now wants to

692
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,600
Courtney's infection

693
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,696
Doesn't get the blame for the global pandemic

694
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,488
Have no question

695
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,768
No doubt China

696
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,328
Taiwan

697
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,352
To Hawaii

698
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,144
To Malaysia Singapore Japan

699
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,752
So the China doesn't get the blame the already convinced the who2 change the name of the virus away from

700
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,800
From the Ohana monia Coronavirus

701
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,336
To covid-19

702
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,920
How to rewrite history

703
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,040
Even the CDC

704
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:15,808
Control

705
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,600
In China

706
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,624
To control itself

707
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,696
Getting to a very dangerous biological weapons

708
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,512
So to put it simply to help Rangers very

709
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,120
All you have to do is look back on the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003

710
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:38,080
Severe acute respiratory syndrome syndrome which is caused by a virus called SARS

711
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,616
Govt where the CRV

712
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,384
Coronavirus

713
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,176
Despite the name

714
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,736
Anywhere in it everyone still knows that it originated

715
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,040
In China how they rewrote history

716
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:47,808
It's from SARS

717
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:51,648
Outbreak they were 251 cases in Canada

718
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:58,048
Bad 238 and Singapore Bunch all over the place outbreaks outside of what everyone still understand

719
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,096
Dance of the outbreak originated in China

720
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,144
No one's rewriting that history based on

721
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,264
Sun shining up being in the name created the Stars by 12

722
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:13,408
Underlying assumption that Mike is making their that no serious person would ever make

723
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:18,784
Mike is acting like a public public health workers are looking to assign blame for this

724
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:24,416
Blame is such a strange word to use in a situation like the one we're in it should really tell you that Mike is not a health Ranger

725
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,440
You're our science rain

726
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,488
He's a propaganda narrative Ranger

727
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,304
Blame is the word you use when you're telling a story

728
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,328
Not when you're looking

729
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,888
That dealing with an outbreak it naturally

730
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,936
Not the naturally-occurring health situation

731
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:42,592
These dudes of drifted so far past the point where they believe it is a bioweapon that there's having casual conversations about China

732
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,640
Exporting the virus to other countries they don't get the

733
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,432
The blame for a bioweapon

734
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,064
It's at the point where a coherent conversation between whatever they think is going on and someone is dealing with reality

735
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,112
He's just impossible and that's the goal

736
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,136
Yeah

737
00:31:55,648 --> 00:32:00,000
They are hitting Us in the face with a bullhorn right now and telling us metaphorically

738
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:03,584
Yeah also the virus was never called the Wuhan pneumonia Coronavirus

739
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,656
People colloquially called at the like a Wuhan

740
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,680
Coronavirus

741
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,216
Just because the city of Wuhan

742
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,264
It was a distinguishing marker about the outbreak

743
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,384
But the actual temporary name that scientist gave it was 2019-ncov

744
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,152
To Mark the year

745
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,432
Here and ncov

746
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,968
Coronavirus

747
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:26,624
World Health organisation guideline specifically discouraged name and conditions are outbreaks after people places or profession

748
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:31,744
Because of the stigmatizing effect that can have on things completely unrelated to the actual disease

749
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,048
They made it official policy on 25th

750
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:34,816
Because of

751
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,864
Things like how people slaughtered pigs

752
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,424
It disrupted pork Imports for no reason

753
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,472
After that 2009 outbreak

754
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,752
It was called the swine flu

755
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:46,592
People make assumptions based on names and it's best to do whatever you can to make

756
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:49,152
That response more difficult for people to make

757
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:53,760
Actual scientist whenever call this virus to Wuhan coronavirus in any official way

758
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,576
And given the Mike Adams pretends that he's an expert on this stuff and

759
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,600
Basically a doctor

760
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,648
It's basic stuff

761
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,928
Then.

762
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,560
As we all know his story

763
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,120
When the mob chooses escape goat

764
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,936
It works out well for everyone involved

765
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:17,312
And there is never been any historical situation where the mob has chosen the scapegoat

766
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,592
Almost it Rand

767
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,152
Ramping a violin

768
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,552
Yeah you want to avoid the he's

769
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,624
So Alex said talk some more s***

770
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:32,928
Talkingshit

771
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:36,000
But now the numbers are coming out we know that it is indeed

772
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,792
Killing healthy young people

773
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,096
What is killing a high number of those

774
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:46,752
So I have no idea where Alex is getting this information from the young people healthy young people are dying

775
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,800
From the coronavirus literally everything

776
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:49,568
Define suggest

777
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,848
Is not the case

778
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,640
Is it really big clay Metallica

779
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,712
Cuz Megamix it's almost all other sources I can find her pretty clear at the

780
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,248
The vast majority of fatalities

781
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:00,064
Better being seen or among elderly people and people with pre-existing

782
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,088
Conditions

783
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:03,136
I would call on him beside his Source name some

784
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:05,184
Some specifics who are these young people

785
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,232
I suspect he doesn't have any sources of

786
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:10,048
Which is why he never brings any of them up he's just talkingshit

787
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,096
So we get to talk about Italy

788
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,400
Here in this next clip and there's actually a really in

789
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,680
Interesting

790
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,984
The way in which Alex is wrong

791
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,752
About

792
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:21,568
The cases in Italy

793
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:26,432
Everyone everyone is dead they're all you have your number

794
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,736
You know how many survived

795
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,808
Right cuz that's a lie

796
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,344
Anyways

797
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,368
Coming out to play

798
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
Tricom

799
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,232
A beginning a swell

800
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,536
You can't believe a word

801
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,864
What comes out of Tricom mouth ago

802
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,264
Funny sponsors a lot of folks do

803
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,288
You listen

804
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,664
But they're all out of food right

805
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,736
Actually most of them are my bakery

806
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:04,576
Conservative

807
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:09,184
So we talked about specific information about the cases of Coronavirus

808
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,584
Better popping up in Italy at the time of preparedness episode they're not readily available so I can't really comment on what's going on there the source

809
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,120
Roosevelt how these things happen

810
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:21,728
The coming days will bring with them much more detail about that sort of stuff and that point

811
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:25,312
The one that happens we can have a full conversation about if it'll be irresponsible

812
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,384
For now though it what address Alex

813
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,664
Has claimed the Italy shows at

814
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,480
The virus is much more deadly than the Chinese government was saying

815
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,760
Chinese Li

816
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:40,672
Innocent is asserting that the Chinese covered up the fatality rate of the virus and now they're a bunch of people in Italy getting a receipt

817
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,208
Proof that there was a cover-up

818
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:43,744
Actually

819
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,512
The opposite

820
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:50,912
It makes sense to maintain some skepticism toward the information coming out of China so you can't really blame a person for doing that

821
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,704
However Alex is not just step

822
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:53,984
He's wrong

823
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,544
According to an article from February 25th

824
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,568
Open Forbes quote

825
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,640
Haley surprise blowout of the new coronavirus shows that

826
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:03,712
Despite the country's bursting into the seat over the last few days

827
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:06,016
Their mortality rate is similar to China

828
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,808
This is actually good news

829
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,112
If it turns out to be true in other

830
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,416
Countries where Public Health Data is more trustworthy

831
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:16,256
Then one can assume the China is not entirely under estimating the mortality

832
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,328
The latest figures from Italy

833
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,888
Had the mortality rate in approximately 2.6

834
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,704
Which is south of China's claim rate of about

835
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,728
3.4 /

836
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,800
So what this flare-up in Italy actually tends to Devin

837
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,592
Is it there's a decent chance that

838
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,872
China is not putting out

839
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,640
False numbers

840
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,664
Since we now.

841
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,712
Statistics from a country that has a better track record

842
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,992
Transparency

843
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,528
International cooperation

844
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,088
There's actually a fairly optimistic sign

845
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:43,136
Well the Alex's painting is

846
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:47,488
The opposite of right well the Italians didn't add the casualties from

847
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:53,888
Venison there because I heard that somebody got the coronavirus in Venice and they just sank it they was going

848
00:36:54,144 --> 00:37:00,288
Already going under anyway so they just think the whole thing of baby

849
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,056
Woodforest by Alex

850
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,848
But the case isn't Italy demonstrate the

851
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,152
The China was lying about the mortality rate of the virus

852
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,688
He's either making that up

853
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:09,760
Or he doesn't understand the numbers or anything about the situation

854
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,832
And this is not a surprise he can be all of those at the

855
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:13,600
The same time

856
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,136
Yeah you better cut the fun

857
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:18,208
He's dumb and wrong and lying

858
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:24,608
But you also see how it all is just to serve to a food plug at the end he's just getting into a food plot

859
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,400
Constant

860
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,192
So incessant

861
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,240
On this episode to the point where

862
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:34,336
Give me a couple times when I was repairing this episode that I almost like I'm done

863
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,104
Yeah John Wick

864
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,640
I don't even want it

865
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,736
Commercial when he comes back

866
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,552
Well I got a call during the break and

867
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,368
And they said okay

868
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:49,184
He was locked in a auntie 23 weeks

869
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,232
But

870
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,536
Voicemail

871
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,240
DC what's going on

872
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:07,616
What you're seeing is basically my Patriot Supply reaching the point where they can

873
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,896
Can't handle any more orders

874
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,176
That makes sense

875
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,736
They hire temporary you know they can hire temporary

876
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,784
Staff to satisfy their increase labor demand

877
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,064
The packaging and fulfillment

878
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:19,136
They are willing to build a new Factory or plant

879
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,160
To increase the out

880
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:26,304
Their existing facilities are at the maximum output and to increase that number didn't need to put in a long-term investor

881
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,840
My in additional facility

882
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,888
And they're not going to do that because they know this is a

883
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,168
The temporary situation

884
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:34,240
Which now basically maximize their profit from

885
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:38,080
So the only other possibility here they're trying to pretend there's an actual food

886
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,616
And that is

887
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,384
Just isn't the k

888
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,480
The effect of them selling this narrative is there trying to cause panic in the audience

889
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,296
At the beginning of the show Alex that it's now 3 weeks

890
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,856
Good food in less than an hour later it's

891
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:50,880
4 weeks

892
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,696
This is the sort of behavior you would engage in if you're trying to

893
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,720
Cause a panic

894
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,256
Not if you're trying to operate

895
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,024
Ethical ad

896
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:01,888
I think of the way Alex old is nanosilver was disgraceful and potentially illegal

897
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:08,288
But I honestly think the Strategies employed here for the survival food is a lot worse exploitation of

898
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,080
Beers that he himself is created

899
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,384
It's the definition of parasitic

900
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,176
Yeah and not just that

901
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:14,944
But the sales tax

902
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,480
They're getting so

903
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:19,552
Like he's literally doing the used car salesman like

904
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,624
I called my boss and I said I can

905
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,160
Can take it down for three weeks

906
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:24,928
Right now

907
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,720
You got to do it right now though

908
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:29,536
Yeah I don't know what my boss is going to say tomorrow he's crazy

909
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,864
It's not like you put a clock

910
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:38,496
My God he's not resorting to that sort of QVC tax

911
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,824
Give Me 2 hours

912
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,128
People that get in their orders

913
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:44,896
Wow

914
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,688
And freeway

915
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,712
Wow

916
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,016
Long. There they want to make sure that you're happy

917
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:55,904
If you order now in the next 2 hours if you get 3 weeks delivery but after that I can't guarantee anything

918
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,696
Ridiculous

919
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,256
I feel like

920
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,048
Mcgurk just sitting for

921
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:02,816
Sorts

922
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,096
Stewart's

923
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,144
Story

924
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,168
Weird

925
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,704
I guess it works

926
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,472
Knives

927
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,520
He's nice they're so sharp

928
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,848
So Alex has Mike Adams come in because

929
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,616
You got to

930
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:20,992
He's been proven right about everything is how Alex introduces

931
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,296
No

932
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:28,672
Ontarget in trip

933
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:31,488
Tweaks on Coronavirus

934
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,512
Is that on

935
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:36,096
It's over for human survivors

936
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,728
I guess dance around that

937
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,752
Theme

938
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,312
And also talked about how this Market

939
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,592
It drop

940
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,616
This is all just

941
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,640
Justin attack on Christ

942
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,736
Coronavirus cases

943
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:54,784
Dinosaur

944
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,552
Search

945
00:40:56,576 --> 00:41:00,672
You know what this is this is the answer to nationalism

946
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:05,792
This is the answer to a good economy in the west and shine his face

947
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:10,400
Take that people rebelling inside and without in Taiwan

948
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,472
Today

949
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,240
Sport

950
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,312
But you in 3 weeks ago was saying shoot

951
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,336
People at checkpoint

952
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,408
Batman

953
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,992
Maybe we should stop

954
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:25,760
Flights

955
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,552
From the cities in China

956
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,232
Logic right there

957
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,280
None of that is real

958
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,048
None

959
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:45,472
The only way that we can is the reason that Society is it better is because of

960
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:47,008
The Bad actors like this

961
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:52,384
Stop f****** following these guys that have an actual reasonable cover

962
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,759
Wind up anything and everything being a goddamn conspiracy to take down Trump

963
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:06,975
Projected narcissism that's just every single thing in the world exists solely as an attack on me

964
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:07,743
Me and my people

965
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,535
And it's just I'm

966
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,815
It's no way to live in

967
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:14,399
It's the mindset that it's impossible to really

968
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,447
Get out you can't really

969
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:20,287
Debated either like there's no there's no really convincing

970
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,823
That mindset of

971
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,127
Seeing outside itself without like

972
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,663
Individual work

973
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:29,247
Being done like people really working on themselves and recognizing like

974
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,039
Oh not everything involves

975
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:31,807
Yeah

976
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:34,367
Not everything is about like some sort of a

977
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:38,207
Cloak and Dagger cabal trying to attack my interest

978
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:41,023
That sometimes happens the one who hit a guy with

979
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:44,095
The bullhorn

980
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,375
So make it

981
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,679
Sitting here in a blue conversation and like

982
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,703
Dude they're just

983
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,239
Nothing

984
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,263
Nothing

985
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,543
Is real

986
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,847
CDC says there now

987
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,639
53 cases in the United States

988
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,455
We have reliable information that

989
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:05,855
The total number of inbred where

990
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:12,511
So I went checked news.com read some of the Articles they posted and there's literally no supporter citation given for claims

991
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,047
That the CDC is covering up

992
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,607
1000 cases of coronavirus in the United States

993
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:22,751
It's important to understand that when people like Alex or Mike Adams claim that they have information on a good authority from

994
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,775
High-level source

995
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:24,799
They're making it up

996
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,615
They pretend to be journalists so they know that

997
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:32,223
You know take a really serious reason for a court to compel them to ever reveal the source

998
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,271
So they're completely free to make things happen

999
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:36,575
The tribute that the unnamed sources whenever they please

1000
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:43,743
The fact that they operate like this goes a long way towards explaining why they always gal about the New York Times and other journalistic outlets

1001
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,791
Using sources under the condition of anonymity

1002
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:49,887
Because they just make up fake sources they assumed everybody else doesn't

1003
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:53,215
The only way I mean can you imagine what would

1004
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,495
What would it require

1005
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,287
To actually go find somebody

1006
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,079
Who has any kind of Expo

1007
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,383
Talk to that baby talk

1008
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,687
Cross-reference that with another source to

1009
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,967
Verify the information

1010
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:07,295
That's impossible Dan so everyone must be busy man

1011
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,927
Springs to sit in and he yelled at by globalist then

1012
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,951
Dreaming Dan

1013
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:17,279
Anyway I can find no evidence of the CDC is covering up a thousand cases

1014
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,047
The Coronavirus

1015
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:20,351
As always is just my cucking s***

1016
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,911
As he continues to do.

1017
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,191
The Who

1018
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,471
Is a front

1019
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,751
Search for communist China

1020
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,775
Who is

1021
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,567
Traded and taken over by the cops

1022
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,127
For China

1023
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,687
Percent of admission of people there to invest

1024
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,455
Castigate China

1025
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,991
At all they came out with was

1026
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:40,063
Positive stories about what a great job China is doing

1027
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,879
Maybe they're doing the great job again

1028
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,415
There is a part of it that is

1029
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:48,767
Yes some stuff that China is doing is essential towards

1030
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:51,071
Global Response

1031
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,607
That right

1032
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,399
What is the pr thing

1033
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:57,727
That we discussed on a past episode the idea of like

1034
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,055
If the World Health Organization comes out and it's like

1035
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:06,175
Nitpicks everything than China is doing in responses they jeopardize the possibility

1036
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:09,503
Full cooperation and that is a big

1037
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,783
I think that is a big issue

1038
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,319
Alex and Mike Jones

1039
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,343
Mygov

1040
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,879
Alex and Mike Adams

1041
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:21,023
Throw around all they want all this talk about how they've been infiltrated by Communists in their front for China

1042
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,559
And they can have fun with that

1043
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,095
But the reality is if

1044
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:27,423
They operated the World Health Organization operating

1045
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,215
In a way that Mike

1046
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:32,287
And Alex wanted them to the situation would be so much

1047
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,311
Yeah

1048
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,847
The most likely be so much more

1049
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,895
And not just that but it doesn't make any sense

1050
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:37,919
China stamp

1051
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,199
Because if you want good

1052
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:39,967
CPR

1053
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,991
If you're China

1054
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,783
You do a good job

1055
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:45,599
Like this is going now that this is becoming

1056
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,903
So Global that everybody is going to have

1057
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,183
How to deal with it in some fashion

1058
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:52,767
The only thing that makes sense for China to come out of this in

1059
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:53,535
In a positive light

1060
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,583
Is for them to have done everything

1061
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,351
Impossible

1062
00:45:56,607 --> 00:46:00,703
As well as they possibly could anything less than that and the world will be like

1063
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:03,263
We can never trust you again you are

1064
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:06,591
If this is a virus doesn't even like a political thing this is

1065
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,871
Is just let live

1066
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:08,895
We like living

1067
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:13,247
Yeah and there'll be always be debates about

1068
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,551
You know whether certain measures were the right

1069
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:18,111
To do and that is definitely

1070
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,671
Something for another time

1071
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,975
For after the

1072
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:27,839
The. Containment

1073
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,631
Appropriate IV like

1074
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:32,959
Is walking down a city the best way to drive this right

1075
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:35,263
Now is not the time for that debate

1076
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,847
Or complaints about about you

1077
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,431
So Alex

1078
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,223
Ghost break and comes back

1079
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,015
He's just got a weird

1080
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:46,783
Thought

1081
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:49,087
I just I disagree with this fundamental

1082
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:54,463
Knowledge is knowing how to fix the carburetor on a roof of house rats

1083
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:59,327
What is

1084
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,679
Data

1085
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:07,519
Have enough experience in another connection to God

1086
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,871
Didn't know three that weren't like radar

1087
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:12,895
WhatsApp

1088
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,735
I know you're all saying as well

1089
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,015
A million points

1090
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,039
It's indescribable

1091
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,319
Got level

1092
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:24,671
It's really just a conscious level 100 times more powerful than conscious

1093
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:25,695
There's a spirit

1094
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,743
But as well

1095
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:32,351
So if you understand what he's saying he's basically making the argument that knowledge is knowing things

1096
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,887
Wings and wisdom is

1097
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,911
Connecting things

1098
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:35,935
Because you feel like

1099
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:42,591
That's not done that's a really that's a really bad way

1100
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,383
King Solomon made back

1101
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,431
Clear in the Proverbs when he said

1102
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,479
Knowledge is kicking ass

1103
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:51,039
And wisdom is knowing when to go

1104
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:54,367
Kickass baby let's do this I'm not a square

1105
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:57,183
In at like the sense that I'm going to be like a intuition

1106
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,487
Is total b******* ready thing like that

1107
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,559
But you was a really great moment for me and my I took a logic

1108
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,583
Classes in college

1109
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,631
Pictures of bunch of

1110
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,935
Logic

1111
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,471
I always felt

1112
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:14,847
I was I was drawn to philosophy but I really didn't like a lot of

1113
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,383
The elements of how like

1114
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:19,455
I can have a good argument for or against something and

1115
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:22,271
A lot of times it's pretty arbitrary which

1116
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:25,343
Debate minutes

1117
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,135
Incontrovertible

1118
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,695
Rules for how sentences work

1119
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:32,511
Mathematical are you have not been hit by a bull horn

1120
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,535
Well

1121
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,839
I don't know how large it relates to that but

1122
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:36,607
It-it's

1123
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,143
It's mathematical inform

1124
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,191
You can diagram

1125
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,471
Things

1126
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:44,287
Things out and one day in my area

1127
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,591
I don't know if it was maybe my second or third semester

1128
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:49,407
The class Professor named dr. Wyrick

1129
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:51,199
And he's just fantastic

1130
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,735
Berry Drive

1131
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:53,503
Very funny

1132
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:55,295
But also like really good at

1133
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,575
Elucidate

1134
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,343
Spider point

1135
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,367
Picture of

1136
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:00,671
How sentences work how you break down

1137
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,463
He arrived here discernment

1138
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,487
Certainly

1139
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,279
Smelling

1140
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,047
Contradiction

1141
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:06,815
Wings and Things

1142
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,607
Is very very formative

1143
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,143
Stretching classes I took

1144
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,423
Wow with his dude

1145
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:15,007
One day we're going over some of the homework problems

1146
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,287
Discussing things

1147
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:20,895
Someone else in the class was like I think that this argument is invalid

1148
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,175
I feel like it is

1149
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,711
But I'm going through it

1150
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,991
And it looks like it's valid

1151
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:28,575
And so Professor Wyrick got up and he was diagram and get on the board

1152
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:31,647
And do you know went through all of it.

1153
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,183
And showed that it was

1154
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:36,255
Valid and as he was finishing up with the conclusion

1155
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,279
Like in SO2

1156
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,047
To sum up

1157
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,095
Sometimes you must have not

1158
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,887
Distrust your intuition

1159
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:45,471
There was this interesting moment where you're in a formal logic

1160
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:48,543
Class and this guy is diagramming descendants

1161
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,871
The same time for the lesson that

1162
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,919
It's derived from it is sometimes

1163
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:57,759
Your intuition is guiding you in the right direction

1164
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:58,527
Roof

1165
00:49:58,783 --> 00:49:59,295
No

1166
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,855
Exactly but I'm not a square inch

1167
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,647
The only thing I hate your guts

1168
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,695
You got to always wrong

1169
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:07,743
Replace that but it's a place that

1170
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,767
Is merge

1171
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:09,535
With

1172
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,327
Proof for it

1173
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,887
Your your higher brain or whatever

1174
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:16,703
What Alex is doing is creating a dichotomy

1175
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,983
Between your brain

1176
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,263
And wisdom

1177
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:24,383
Discernment wisdom or whatever and that's a shield that he hides behind in order to make s*** on you

1178
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,175
That's what he uses this for

1179
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,735
1000 different data points up can

1180
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,015
Connecting through the fog

1181
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:32,575
This is you making s*** up that's all that's going

1182
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:36,159
Yeah that's he's like if your professor is if the student had been like

1183
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:39,487
I feel like this is invalid in your professor was like

1184
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,767
You did all the work

1185
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:41,791
You needed to do

1186
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:46,911
Tell it to the world get a radio show tell them that what you said is true it doesn't matter don't

1187
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:49,471
1,000-point

1188
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:54,591
It would be some of that

1189
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:57,919
Anyway

1190
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:04,319
Is that you still got Mike Adams on hold but he decides he's going to complain a little bit more about what happened to Owen at that

1191
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,343
Did Bernie rally

1192
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,415
And I only play this because Alex add the detailed

1193
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,439
I think his body

1194
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:10,975
Came over and

1195
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,023
Oh and and split

1196
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:14,559
I wanted to see

1197
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,327
Security Guys

1198
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,119
Was great guide

1199
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:20,191
Lucerne us now has lost her military to Patriot

1200
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,007
What

1201
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:30,431
An internet

1202
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:35,295
Compass.com

1203
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:38,879
When I get in close

1204
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,159
On you

1205
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,695
And they usually

1206
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,231
I'm not doing it

1207
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:45,023
The men walk over and they go

1208
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:55,519
And and neither

1209
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,823
And I can be a New York I mean in Austin

1210
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,615
People want to date

1211
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:10,879
Incense but it's all a complete but I do like the idea that

1212
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:13,951
Alex thinks everyone wants

1213
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,511
I look like

1214
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,303
I look like a salt Cube

1215
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,887
This is a man who needs help

1216
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:25,471
Yeah you know I when I walk down the street people

1217
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,007
Just try and lick me it's just

1218
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:29,311
You know a lot of people have to be with a lot of aspects

1219
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,615
The fame that maybe no paparazzi

1220
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:38,015
I get licked a lot of people on Fox News.

1221
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:41,855
Students about some of Bernie's policies

1222
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,415
Alexander comes in for a remote neither

1223
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,695
My big problem is it

1224
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,487
Followers want to lick me

1225
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:48,767
They're all about.

1226
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:50,559
Next thing you know it's

1227
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:55,679
I'm looking forward to Amy Klobuchar bringing that up in the debates off.

1228
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:59,007
So I we get back to Mike Adams and his

1229
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,311
Nonsense about

1230
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,103
About China and the Coronavirus

1231
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,895
Iucu like a really

1232
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,687
Through the fog

1233
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:08,479
What kind of reaction from Alex and

1234
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,247
In this club

1235
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:14,367
I saw a haunting video last night you probably won't be able to find it was in

1236
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,135
Chinese

1237
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:17,183
The guy with a pool

1238
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,463
Wuhan

1239
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:20,511
All the apartment buildings at night

1240
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,279
In the background

1241
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:22,815
The Scream

1242
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:25,887
The Haunting blood-curdling screams from

1243
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,167
People that mental

1244
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,215
I want to see in their mind

1245
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,519
I will yeah we've got the link

1246
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:38,175
I have no idea exactly what video Mike was talking about but I suspected it's one that's been circulating since at least January 28th

1247
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:40,735
When was covered by the South China Morning Post

1248
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,527
It's exactly what Mike is

1249
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,295
Describing

1250
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:45,343
It's large buildings in Wuhan at night

1251
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,183
When you can hear screaming and yelling that sounds pretty off-putting without translation

1252
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:53,279
However with subtitles you learned with people are yelling or words of encourage

1253
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,303
Matter their fellow citizen

1254
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,119
They're yelling quotes

1255
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:57,887
Stay strong

1256
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,423
Keep it up Wuhan

1257
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:03,007
Essentially rallying the people to keep morale high in a difficult situation

1258
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,287
Right

1259
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,055
These people are saying

1260
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,591
He's claimed on multiple occasions

1261
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:09,407
Speak Chinese so you shouldn't even need subtitles

1262
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:14,015
My suspicion is that he absolutely doesn't know what that video shows but also recognizes

1263
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:15,551
Power is a propaganda tool

1264
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:16,831
And so does Alex

1265
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:20,159
That's why he gets super excited about the video and he wants to see it

1266
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:20,927
It's not out of

1267
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,463
Concern for people or caring about the

1268
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,231
Situation

1269
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,255
Casinos you can use it

1270
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,303
Does Arizona consider buying a ship

1271
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,071
That's

1272
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,351
The game man

1273
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,375
That's

1274
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:32,703
I I I did not have too much problem trusting my intuition

1275
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,727
I'm guessing that

1276
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,263
Maybe they weren't on the up-and-up

1277
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:36,799
That was Mike

1278
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:40,895
I don't know if it's another video that makes talking about but this is like this fits

1279
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:42,431
Exactly what he's talkin to

1280
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,223
Some I don't know

1281
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,759
Mike

1282
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,527
Yeah

1283
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,319
Jake's bad video

1284
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:51,135
Any connects it with Alex's raving

1285
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,159
It's about the Bernie rally

1286
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,463
To create a whole new narrative

1287
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,231
To scare people

1288
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:56,511
You just you just nailed it

1289
00:54:57,023 --> 00:55:00,607
When you take these deranged lunatic violent leftist who are already

1290
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,631
Mentally ill

1291
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:02,655
I'm either already

1292
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:05,215
Quarantine to that

1293
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:06,495
What's going to happen

1294
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:09,567
To their state of mental health what are they then willing

1295
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:13,407
To do in terms of violence or looting or murder or killing a rape

1296
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,431
Pedophilia

1297
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,967
Things that they do

1298
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,015
Everyday basis anyway

1299
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:21,855
The coronavirus doesn't matter

1300
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:24,159
So we got these crazy leftist

1301
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:26,207
Like the ones at the Bernie rally

1302
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:28,511
For the quarantine on the situation

1303
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:34,655
I watch Society the road to call the cops and report an assault on reality

1304
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,679
This show is

1305
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,703
F****** insane

1306
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:37,727
Yeah and hey

1307
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,775
It gets even worse for real cuz guess what

1308
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:40,799
Mike Adams is host

1309
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:43,103
Sing the whole time that Alex is gone for seapak

1310
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,175
Really he's not doing it alone or no

1311
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,199
Is it Rodger Stone

1312
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:50,015
It's not hosting the show

1313
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:53,087
Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and Friday

1314
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,671
With Allen T zombie popping enliven seapak

1315
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:58,719
Allen key Allen key

1316
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,023
What

1317
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:03,583
I don't know that I've ever heard David Quezada

1318
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:07,935
Alan Keyes is going to be co-hosting in 41

1319
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:08,959
Relay

1320
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:10,495
Okay

1321
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:14,847
I don't know that he had gone this far

1322
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:18,687
A lot of the mighty have fallen pretty hard

1323
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,967
It's truth one time

1324
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:21,503
In junior high

1325
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,039
We had to select

1326
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,575
Yeah I believe it was an Alexa

1327
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:30,975
2 year

1328
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:35,839
There were like six of us in class and we each had to do like a speech

1329
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:42,239
I like in the Persona of one of the presidential candidates

1330
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:47,103
I wonder if I didn't know any of this position

1331
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:50,687
So I just decided that I would say that I like he's wasn't

1332
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:54,783
Get school uniform school uniforms

1333
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:58,623
Who provided the system of justice.

1334
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:05,279
So microcosm that is everything that's wrong with America Colombia if his Junior High

1335
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,559
Allen key

1336
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,655
Infowars

1337
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:16,287
See what the health Ranger

1338
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:19,871
Everything was preparation for this

1339
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:25,247
Although unfortunately I never did learn what Allen Keys positions were I didn't think they were

1340
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:28,063
So anyway Alex complains more now about

1341
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:32,671
Does Bernie rally that he went to

1342
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,207
You got to see it

1343
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:36,511
A large percentage of women

1344
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:37,535
Their pants

1345
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:41,631
Something in these weird leftist things is they like to

1346
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:44,191
Disgusting man

1347
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:45,215
Don't you

1348
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:46,239
Hiring

1349
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:50,591
Have somebody who's famously allegedly

1350
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,615
I don't know I just

1351
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:53,151
It's such a weird

1352
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:53,919
Attack

1353
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,479
Bernie supporters pee themselves

1354
00:57:56,991 --> 00:58:02,879
Done and how could you vote for a candidate how could you vote for a candidate whose supporters urinate on themselves

1355
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,927
Pleasurably so weird

1356
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:08,511
To build this up is like some sort of Otherworldly

1357
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,303
Crazy people think

1358
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,911
I think largely that's because Alex understands that a lot of his audiences never going to

1359
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,191
Engage with or

1360
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:19,263
Has any occasion to be out of Bernie rally

1361
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:21,055
And so they'll just believe these

1362
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:21,823
Oh aren't they

1363
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:26,943
Know everybody

1364
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:32,319
It would be really disappointing if you have to all these images in your head

1365
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:35,135
No one's trying to lick me

1366
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,439
I say I say no what

1367
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:41,023
So anyway Alex says

1368
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:43,839
Since more stuff about this route it's just it's nonsense

1369
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,399
Gas station bathroom

1370
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:47,679
And those

1371
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,727
Goodness in the mental illness and it was just like

1372
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:53,055
Mentally ill person it's disturbing in the grocery store line

1373
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:56,895
Want to kill you

1374
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,575
Mike Adams he said

1375
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:06,879
Kill the general public

1376
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:07,903
Figured out

1377
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,695
Coronavirus

1378
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,743
I talked to my favorites

1379
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:13,023
Oh no

1380
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,327
Whole food place

1381
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:19,167
Episode I just want to grab every one of these people buy

1382
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:19,935
The shoulders

1383
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,263
God dammit

1384
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:29,919
I don't I don't know man never at the actual rally

1385
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:32,991
Around the outskirts bothering

1386
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:36,063
Also his imagery about 25,000

1387
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,087
People who have shipped

1388
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,623
Wanting to kill him is

1389
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:40,415
Being a little overly dramatic ice

1390
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:43,999
Also Bernie's campaign put be attended to that Rally in Austin

1391
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,279
12700

1392
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,815
So Alex is just making s*** up

1393
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:47,583
About that too

1394
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:48,863
Alex is a liar

1395
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:49,631
About everything

1396
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,423
Because those lies are useful to him

1397
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,447
To use the drives

1398
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,471
Salesforce products

1399
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,263
The whole game

1400
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:57,055
Honestly I think

1401
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:00,127
That's one of the reasons I found this episode so frustrating Calissa

1402
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:00,895
Who is like

1403
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,175
It's very simple

1404
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:05,759
Yeah I like a lot of the stuff is very much like it's not interesting to me like

1405
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:08,575
The things that they gave me the most Joy or things like

1406
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:09,855
Service pelican

1407
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,135
Right right right

1408
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,671
Right cuz I do want a service

1409
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:16,511
Appreciate being called a long list of

1410
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,535
Criminal names

1411
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:20,095
Including any number of sex

1412
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:22,399
Describes just so an a******

1413
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,167
Can sell food

1414
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,447
I don't appreciate that

1415
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,215
On a person

1416
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:31,359
Especially especially when the PS2 resistance of the entire Bernie rally

1417
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,383
Coverage

1418
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,151
Which is

1419
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:36,991
About Owen hitting a guy with a bullhorn and claiming that the

1420
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:39,039
We get back to you bad.

1421
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:43,391
Ezzz I got left

1422
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:45,951
Pretty eyes

1423
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:46,719
City

1424
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,839
City

1425
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:56,191
You don't you don't see that dude punched

1426
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:56,959
The security guard in

1427
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,983
The footage

1428
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,007
To be as far as I

1429
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:01,567
I can tell unless there's some other angle of this that

1430
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:02,847
Is would like

1431
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:06,175
Magically shows that I don't believe you

1432
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,967
Because the video that they do have

1433
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:08,735
Does

1434
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:09,759
Showing

1435
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:12,319
Hitting the guy with the bullhorn

1436
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:15,391
Over his security guard

1437
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:17,183
Bullhorn back and that's

1438
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:19,487
The security guards head goes back

1439
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:21,023
Here's what your

1440
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,559
Write a w******

1441
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:26,399
To the left I would like as a brutal treatment of this

1442
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,423
And to the left

1443
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,703
So

1444
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:30,239
Alex now has

1445
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,263
Joel skousen

1446
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:34,079
Because we know

1447
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:40,735
He is an alarmist he was an anti-communist holdover Cold War dead-ender type

1448
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,271
Vagina and all that have

1449
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,831
And then also he did this

1450
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:46,111
Vickery location

1451
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,647
Film with Alex

1452
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,695
He's a bug-out guy

1453
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,231
Real trapper

1454
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:53,023
Kind of situation

1455
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:57,119
I am sure of course he's okay he's a perfect has to have on this sort of that

1456
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:57,887
Episode

1457
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:58,911
Indian Theory

1458
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,703
It's very clear from the

1459
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:03,519
Idemo how ping

1460
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,151
We were planning on using chemical weapons to depopulate America

1461
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,455
If I bought long sad even with

1462
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:16,319
Nuclear's pre-emptive strike on Military

1463
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:19,135
They were blackmailed into submission so that they can

1464
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:26,559
What apps do you know the economy have the other things with the US provide

1465
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,863
Without destroying the infrastructure

1466
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,423
With Blackman

1467
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,007
There their they're

1468
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,079
That's right

1469
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:40,127
So basically skousen Theory

1470
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:44,223
Is that the Chinese were creating this bioweapon in order

1471
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:45,247
To buy

1472
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,807
Steal the America

1473
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,087
And

1474
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:49,855
They got out

1475
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:51,391
Or something he's not really clear on the

1476
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:54,463
But realize blackmail could work on that high of a

1477
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:57,791
The scale is blackmail one or two guys and then you get

1478
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,327
Yeah that works

1479
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:01,119
Also I don't know what article he's talking

1480
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,911
I'm about there and honestly I don't care

1481
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:09,311
Know that decades-old article that proves that I tried to find it I have no f****** idea is just a cold war

1482
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:11,871
Keep the vibe alive

1483
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,151
Great

1484
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,687
Hey where's McCarthy with

1485
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:17,759
So skousen and Alex are talking about

1486
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,551
Some rangy issues

1487
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:21,087
Did they touch on some other

1488
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,879
Economy liquor

1489
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:24,671
Because the market going down

1490
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:26,463
Alex tries to suggest

1491
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,231
The Trump

1492
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:27,999
Have co-opted

1493
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:31,327
And I use he's reeling it back in

1494
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:37,727
It's thousand shut that s*** down hard

1495
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,775
At least Master planners have done

1496
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:44,127
Control

1497
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,687
No he's not in control

1498
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:50,271
Independence

1499
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,343
Understand a lot about economics

1500
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:58,463
Do do do I like

1501
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:01,535
Startlingly after now is this from

1502
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:05,375
I will give him that

1503
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:09,215
So he does not like Trump all that much he wishes the Trump new thing

1504
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:11,263
But he doesn't it would be nice

1505
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,567
This sort of lying is it like tapas

1506
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,591
Is very dumb

1507
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:19,199
Yeah you says a lot of things yet we should like and that's great but he's

1508
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:20,479
How to disappoint

1509
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:21,247
Because

1510
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:22,015
You stupid

1511
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,063
Alex has to put up with

1512
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,623
A lot of his other friends are gone now

1513
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:31,231
Thousand will answer his calls

1514
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:33,535
Discredit

1515
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:35,839
He doesn't pull punches with Alex when I was like

1516
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:38,143
Trumpsc

1517
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:40,447
Stupid

1518
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,471
He is a moron

1519
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,239
Yes

1520
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:46,079
So like I mentioned at the beginning of the show Alex is going to be gone for the rest of the week

1521
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:48,383
Cuz he's going to seapac

1522
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,663
Which I should actually

1523
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:50,431
Correct

1524
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:51,711
He's going to

1525
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:52,735
Fringe event

1526
01:04:54,783 --> 01:05:00,927
You know whenever there's WrestleMania there will be like sideshows that other emotions are coming put on Joe

1527
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,719
This is kind of like that but

1528
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,023
C-pack

1529
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:09,119

1530
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,655

1531
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,751
Amazon event

1532
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:17,311

National tile.

1539
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:30,623
This event that Alex is speaking it is organized by national file which is run by his employee Tom pepper

1540
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:32,415
The list of speakers were set to

1541
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:34,975
Complain about being kicked off social media include Alex

1542
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:37,535

Brilliant orator actually add 12 that live

1549
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:53,663
Reached for comment about their event I would assume National file would say

1550
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:59,807
I want to be back on Facebook

1551
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,599
When you consider who made the

1552
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:06,719
The cut at this year's c-pack and realize that these people are too dumb to be given to speaking slot

1553
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:07,743
It's impressive

1554
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,535
This year's you back as well

1555
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,559

Give me the list of really embarrassing people to have be your Marquis speaker

1569
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:49,727
There's an even among that crew of Creeps and Weirdos Alex and his associates are too foul to be let in

1570
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:52,031
They're really the margins of the margin

1571
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:54,847
It really does feel like it's only a matter of time before they

1572
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:59,967
Forced to accept the reality that the Trump movement or whatever that s*** is does not want them

1573
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:01,247
They want except

1574
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:03,807
Acceptable tone down con men like Glenn Beck

1575
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,855
They don't want self-aggrandizing lunatic

1576
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:08,927
Alex will make everything about themselves

1577
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:10,463
And honestly can't be trusted

1578
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,279
Turn on hue

1579
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:17,887
You can hear it in the way that our talks about his going to these events

1580
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:19,679
Sexy back he's just trying to get

1581
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,447
Attention

1582
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,215
And you know what

1583
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:22,495
Not going to work

1584
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:26,591
Is it this is actually a really bad Road for Alex go down

1585
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:30,175
Unless he's trying to leave to like a crisis point

1586
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:32,991
Or he has to turn on Trump

1587
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,527
To work out in any way

1588
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,575
I don't I don't know what the Imagine

1589
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:40,159
He's going to put do his event mendyke Don Jr is going to show up at the eye

1590
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:43,231
Alex I've been meaning to tell you I loved you all along or

1591
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:46,303
Actually I could see that happening honestly

1592
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:51,423
Yeah that I've said that out loud. Junior might show up

1593
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,215
What level of

1594
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:53,983
Deluge

1595
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:55,775
Is he in his private

1596
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:58,079
Thoughts as far as what is he

1597
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,103
He think is really

1598
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,127
Audible

1599
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:04,735
Act like you are I would say person

1600
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:06,015
Currently there's no way that

1601
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,295
He can believe that he

1602
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,063
He's getting back on

1603
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,111
Twitter

1604
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:10,879
Not going

1605
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,159
Doesn't seem like it

1606
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:16,511
But I could also see him somehow deluding himself into believing that

1607
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,791
If only he did that

1608
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:20,607
Or if I said that

1609
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,911
But the right guy

1610
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,959
What's to think like if this then that

1611
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:26,751
Certainly

1612
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,287
I don't know it's an interesting

1613
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:30,335
Thought the about like his personal

1614
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:31,615
Internal thoughts

1615
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:35,199
Because like we have this situation with the Bernie rally where everyone's trying to lick him

1616
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,039
And you know that that's nonsense coming out of his mouth

1617
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:41,855
But then you think about it it's like what's more

1618
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:42,623
Private

1619
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:43,903
Drum to your private thoughts

1620
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:45,695
Memes

1621
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:48,255
Bernie rally yesterday

1622
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,559
I don't have a lot of nightmares

1623
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,375
Bernie rally last night

1624
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:55,423
20000 30,000 people out of

1625
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,703
12700

1626
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:58,495
They

1627
01:08:59,007 --> 01:08:59,775
All look like

1628
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:03,103
They all had green tea

1629
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,127
They all had

1630
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,151
A lot of them had pain

1631
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:11,807
And they're almost all green tea was very very

1632
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:21,535
We stayed outside the perimeter

1633
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:22,815
Walmart

1634
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:24,351
People in the police did nothing

1635
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,399
Owen Shroyer hit

1636
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,167
That security guard

1637
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,703
With a bullhorn

1638
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:29,727
It appears like

1639
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,519
Alex were not doing

1640
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,311
But it gave him nightmares

1641
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:35,359
Alex and I had nightmares of green teeth

1642
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,895
Piss pants

1643
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:43,295
Socialist hit me in the face with a

1644
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,087
You got to be afraid of that

1645
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,879
Yep so

1646
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,927
You might have forgotten cuz Alex

1647
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:49,951
Is going off on this

1648
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,511
Standard a little bit but

1649
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:55,071
I'm still on hold

1650
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:56,095
Just got

1651
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:58,399
Jamaican on hold while he Rambles about nothing

1652
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:01,983
So he wants Joel to come in fly into Studio

1653
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,775
And post you post

1654
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,055
I would even be there

1655
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:06,335
Use hose by yourself

1656
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:08,639
Because people need to know about bugging out

1657
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:09,663
Please come here

1658
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:16,063
Without me

1659
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:25,279
But at family from East Texas

1660
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:28,607
We've been here turn into

1661
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,375
Dumps out

1662
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:31,679
Almeda Groesbeck

1663
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:32,447
Check

1664
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,007
I've really got to

1665
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:37,823
3 years to move

1666
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:39,871
Myself and whoever wants to do with the crew

1667
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:55,743
It makes me feel like a worm that the other people are so much weaker than I am

1668
01:10:56,255 --> 01:11:01,119
I just morgrave did before

1669
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:03,935
I agree

1670
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:04,959
You agree

1671
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,751
You agree

1672
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:11,615
Can't defeat the Satanist until God comes back to be back in time

1673
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:14,175
Get the f*** out Austin

1674
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,223
Is the whole point

1675
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:18,783
But you can't defeat the sickness until God comes back

1676
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:22,623
I remember I don't know I don't know what the point is I remember reading the book of Revelation

1677
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:29,023
I do think this is an interesting thing for Alex so, he talks a lot of s*** about it leaving Austin I know James ever going to do

1678
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:32,607
Do that he got an armored ridout's that he's bringing the Infowars staff

1679
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:38,239
Still sure about the rest of his life in post-apocalyptic sewing

1680
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,007
Shroyer

1681
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:41,567
Constant fear of bullhorn

1682
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:45,407
I don't think that's ever going to happen probably because

1683
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:47,711
Austin did awesome city to live in

1684
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:54,111
It's the same reason why all these dicks Living Like New York and l.a. complain about Coastal Elites

1685
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:56,927
America I love

1686
01:11:57,183 --> 01:12:02,047
Love living in Manhattan

1687
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:05,631
Fly over there I have a pen

1688
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:12,031
I'm going to have to go to Martha's Vineyard for a couple weeks to recover from how exhausted I am very exhausting

1689
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:14,335
Mentality that you see

1690
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,103
Rhetorical

1691
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:16,639
Thanks

1692
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:23,039
But it is interesting that Alex is like I want you to come in and get cuz we need to talk about bugging out there talk about

1693
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:23,807
Strategic

1694
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:26,367
Eight stops himself in the middle

1695
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:32,255
The name of the documentary that they have already made about this very topic you have already done they've already

1696
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:38,911
What are you coming to do the thing we've already done that's available for free online

1697
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:41,983
Just play the video like a substitute

1698
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,287
I think you realize that as you was talkin

1699
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:45,567
So

1700
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:46,591
We got the health Ranger

1701
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:47,871
My God

1702
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:49,151
S*******

1703
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,431
Complete

1704
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:51,711
Joel skousen

1705
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:52,991
HD comedy

1706
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:55,807
S*** mostly a s*** head

1707
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:56,831
Is

1708
01:12:57,343 --> 01:13:01,951
Has enough ball bearings in his head to know the Trump doesn't know anything about the economy which is refreshing

1709
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,743
We've had Alex

1710
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:05,791
Beer in downtown

1711
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:06,815
Atmos

1712
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:08,095
Host of the show selling food

1713
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,887
And now we get something

1714
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,423
Disappointing

1715
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:17,823
Quieter Lance a few days ago when the major Israel

1716
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:18,847
Daily newspapers

1717
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:21,407
Has a white

1718
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:22,687
White nationalist

1719
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,479
Praising the

1720
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:26,527
The fact that he was being deplatformed off the internet

1721
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:37,535
007 Nick Fuentes back on

1722
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:40,351
Israel by Nick Fuentes YouTube channel getting taken down

1723
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:44,959
So weird that he's responding to an article in The Times of Israel as opposed to some other out

1724
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:49,567
Stream tell Alex chooses to respond to a Times of Israel article when he's trying to do

1725
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:50,591
Offend a holocaust

1726
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:53,919
That is if that's intentional

1727
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:57,247
Absolutely

1728
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:00,575
I've heard him and you know do his stick

1729
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:04,159
Enough David's very clear these one hundred percent of white nationalist

1730
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:05,439
Who just really doesn't

1731
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:06,463
Call back

1732
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:07,999
Because much like Alex

1733
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,535
He wants to be accepted

1734
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:11,327
In the same way Alex is fighting

1735
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:13,119
Doom campaign to take over the trunk

1736
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:14,143
Community entirely

1737
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:16,447
Nick Fuentes is also engaged in a battle.

1738
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:19,519
Take down Turning Point USA so he can shift the college

1739
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:20,287
Conservative world

1740
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:22,335
Super far to the extreme right

1741
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:25,151
In order to have any success in that endeavor he knows he

1742
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:25,919
Can't just open

1743
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,455
Only call himself accurate thing

1744
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:29,503
That'll scare off the potential recruits

1745
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:34,623
Nick Fuentes on many occasions has made arguments against non-white immigration to the United

1746
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:38,463
He's argued that Jim Crow era was better for both blacks and whites

1747
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,791
Is how the consistent position that America should be a white Homeland

1748
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,071
He does not.

1749
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,351
Disagree with any of

1750
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:46,143
Things with the final white nationalist

1751
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:47,423
He just doesn't like the term cuz

1752
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:48,191
It's bad for business

1753
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,471
In fact

1754
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:52,031
He said exactly that back in 2018

1755
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:58,687
The reason I wouldn't call myself a white nationalist it's not because I don't see the necessity for white people to have a Homeland.

1756
01:14:58,943 --> 01:14:59,967
For white people to have a country

1757
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:03,039
It's because I think I kind of terminology is he was almost

1758
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,319
Exclusively by the left

1759
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,599
Did the fame and I think

1760
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:07,391
The terminology in the labels that we use

1761
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:10,975
I don't think we can look at them outside the context of their connotation in America

1762
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:17,119
You only really has a problem with being called a white nationalist cuz the left calls of that and he knows that it tarnishes his ability

1763
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,911
The trick unsuspecting

1764
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:21,983
I into thinking that isn't what he's about

1765
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:24,543
When Alex Jones is doing here what he's doing

1766
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:27,359
He's engaging and platforming and covering for Anna

1767
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:29,151
Explicit white nationalist Holocaust

1768
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:29,919
Denier

1769
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,711
Richard surprise no one

1770
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:33,247
So Alec

1771
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:36,063
You know it's interesting that he's going to see

1772
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:38,111
And you'd think the lazy

1773
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,647
Well not really

1774
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,927
Please never gone before

1775
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:43,231
He's never gone before

1776
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:46,815
I didn't care to check in.

1777
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:49,887
I was like why did it why is it good I said I wasn't saying

1778
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:50,911
Alex explains

1779
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,959
What does what made him decide to go

1780
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:57,567
When I heard all this last week

1781
01:15:59,359 --> 01:15:59,871
Go to sleep

1782
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:02,175
I've never gone to see pack

1783
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:03,967
The biggest

1784
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:05,247
An event every year

1785
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:09,855
Try to be in DC or being out later being New York

1786
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:12,415
Where I born in

1787
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,695
Build something new

1788
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:18,047
Go to seapac be anointed and benighted

1789
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:20,095
In the Ben Shapiro show

1790
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:22,399
Club

1791
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:23,679
With the game well

1792

Boracay

1794
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:29,311
So Alex heard that Nick Fuentes was doing

1795
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,335
His own

1796
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:31,359
Inside thing

1797
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:32,383
SexyBack

1798
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,919
Any seeing all the like

1799
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,711
Attention that he's getting for attack

1800
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:37,759
Talking Ben Shapiro and Charlie Kirk

1801
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:38,527
Turning Point

1802
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:40,063
And Alex is like

1803
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:41,599
I could get in on that

1804
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:43,903
MC packet there cuz on French

1805
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:47,999
He's inspired by the not-so crypto-fascist

1806
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:50,303
I Catholic monarchist

1807
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:51,327
Wing

1808
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:53,887
It's trying to take over the just

1809
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:56,447
Offensively conservative

1810
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,215
Hot

1811
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:58,495
Turning Point USA

1812
01:16:58,751 --> 01:16:59,775
Yeah yeah

1813
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:04,895
It is it is one more proof that Alex has never had his own idea for any

1814
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:06,431
Ever this is

1815
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:07,199
A

1816
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:07,967
Addition

1817
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:10,015
It is

1818
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:12,063
If you can get expelled for plagiarism

1819
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:15,135
He should be expelled from the radio

1820
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,159
Right

1821
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,951
It's interesting how bad is it

1822
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:21,791
Instincts are too because like this isn't the way to go

1823
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:28,191
Things insured aquantis is going to get a lot of press would like you did the turning point take the bench

1824
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:29,471
Spiro speaking at Wen

He

Video taped himself tied to confront bench

01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:39,711
Followed him

1832
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:41,503
Depressed for that

1833
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:42,527
But that's not good

1834
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:43,295
That's not good

1835
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:49,695
All press is good press if you're a white nationalist makes people who don't agree with Ben Shapiro sympathy

1836
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:50,975
Size of Ben Shapiro

1837
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:53,279
Yeah look at you like you're a piece of s***

1838
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,047

1839
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:55,327
True

1840
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:56,607
But that's not good

1841
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:01,727
I mean if your brand is white nationalist without saying white Nashville YouTube

1842
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,775
Apologize is Brandon

1843
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:06,335
America America

1844
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:11,455
Attracting people who are piece of s*** already anyways right now

1845
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:14,015
But it isn't it hinders your ability to

1846
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:17,087
Get in the spaces that you wish to be at

1847
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,623
I don't know

1848
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:21,439
Anyway Nick Martinez comes on DS

1851
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:23,743
Like that are

1852
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,279
F****** stupid

1853
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:27,327
Friday this Friday we're going to be host

1854
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,095
Singing event

1855
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:28,863
Call America First

1856
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:31,679
C-pack political action

1857
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:33,983
Michelle Malkin

1858
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:38,335
Greer and hopefully we're going to have an alternative sorta like you guys are having

1859
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:39,359
Seapak

1860
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,127
Or perhaps

1861
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:42,431
Fit in line with the never try

1862
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:44,735
Mainstream conservatives of Mets

1863
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:47,295
Oh yeah C packets

1864
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,831
Truly a hotbed of never

1865
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:53,951
Trumper's the never Trump CPAP

1866
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:55,231
Donald Trump

1867
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:57,791
Mike Pence Ray Mike Pompeo

1868
01:18:58,047 --> 01:19:00,351
Elaine Chao

1869
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:04,191
Don Trump Jr Ivanka Trump

1870
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:10,591
Okay Haley

1871
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:14,687
Never Trumper all the way you could be more never Trump than

1872
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:19,295
Pornstar amazingly never Trump

1873
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,319
This event could not be

1874
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:21,599
Further from never Trump

1875
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:24,671
It's been completely co-opted by the Trump called and it's fascinating

1876
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:26,207
Nick Fuentes trying

1877
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,487
43 this list of people

1878
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:30,303
Including a f*** ton of trump Administration officials

1879
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:32,607
At least three members of the Trump family

1880
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:34,399
Trying to call that never trumper's

1881
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:36,703
The reason for this is very obvious

1882
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:38,751
Trump isn't even Trump

1883
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:39,519
Do people like me

1884
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:44,383
To him Trump was a symbol of the coming back of an open white supremacist culture

1885
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,175
The promise of a trump presidency

1886
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:47,455
They was that of a

1887
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:51,295
Return to a time when all Social Power rested in the hands of straight white men

1888
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:53,087
Answer when he says never Trumper

1889
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:55,391
People who aren't loyal to that symbol

1890
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:58,975
Nick Fuentes Trump himself could be a never Trumper because he could

1891
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:00,255
What are fail to live up to

1892
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:01,535
To the goals of this movie

1893
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:04,863
This is why it might seem incoherent to call it event

1894
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:06,143
Dominated by Trump

1895
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:06,911
Never Trump

1896
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,959
But it makes perfect sense to someone like Nick

1897
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,007
Did you got understand the code

1898
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,543
To go to the bathroom

1899
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:13,824
In the same bathroom

1900
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,360
As people who are non-whites

1901
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:16,384
That is

1902
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,176
Trump's fault I would never try

1903
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,712
State Fair

1904
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:22,528
Way2go neck please. Michelle Malkin

1905
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,064
Speaking

1906
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:30,464
Puentes package number Just for Laughs Festival

1907
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,512
Shity f****** right-wing lunatic

1908
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:35,328
Text sweetheart we going to end up talking a little bit of Michelle Malkin

1909
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,632
Not really any in-depth stuff

1910
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:39,424
But she doesn't have anything in depth

1911
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:43,776
Apparently her and Alex had a run-in about a decade ago that's going to come up

1912
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:46,592
Actually is up there in terms of what makes

1913
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,360
Episode

1914
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:48,384
Pretty funny

1915
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:50,944
About the poor get to that we're going to talk

1916
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:51,968
About how she's been

1917
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:52,992
Kicked out

1918
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,528
Conservative world

1919
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,064
Somebody like Michelle Malkin

1920
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,088
Example

1921
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,416
You're here with somebody who has one of these legendary America

1922
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:01,696
Conservative

1923
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,744
She's been in legendary

1924
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,560
Like 25 years everybody like her don't like real

1925
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:08,608
When she turns it on

1926
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,376
Got a job

1927
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:11,936
Exactly right exactly right for

1928
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:15,520
Simply refusing to disavow me and the boy person other Young America

1929
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:16,544
Conservative

1930
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,312
Y8

1931
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:18,336
Fires her until

1932
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:19,360
Sorry you're not allowed

1933
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:22,176
Speak anymore will not host you at your events anymore

1934
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:24,224
It's being difficult

1935
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,528
Chisme become difficult

1936
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:29,600
For America first wheel outside dissonant right-wing 5

1937
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:31,648
To organize anywhere we can't

1938
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:34,464
Says we can't get organizations to green-light us

1939
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:37,024
You have mobs of antifa show up

1940
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,840
Robert yellow stars in America

1941
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:42,144
It's real America First conservative

1942
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,448
That's exactly right

1943
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:45,216
Coof

1944
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:48,032
It's like you can't burn across anywhere

1945
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:48,800
Anywhere

1946
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:51,104
Someone who's been

1947
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:51,872
Conservative Gray

1948
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:53,408
Space for a long time

1949
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:55,200
Cr-10 you with your

1950
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:55,968
Position can be

1951
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:56,992
Even with tenure

1952
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,784
When the Griffins done with you

1953
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,088
Her speaking

1954
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:03,648
Are managed by a group called The Young America's Foundation

1955
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:05,696
Which also manages events for all sorts of

1956
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:06,464
Conservative

1957
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,256
Azusa to bend

1958
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:09,024
Shapiro

1959
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:13,376
As it turns out Ben Shapiro makes them a lot more money than

1960
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,144
She does

1961
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,680
Because when she decided to side with

1962
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:17,984
Nick Fuentes in his war against Ben Shapiro

1963
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,264
Young America's Foundation

1964
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,568
Dropped her from their talent roster

1965
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:25,664
Part of the problem is that she got confrontational about Shapiro's derision

1966
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,200
The plant is in a speech in

1967
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:28,992
Front of the young America's Foundation

1968
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:31,040
Switch again also represents Shapiro

1969
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:34,112
So this could easily be written off as just being bad work

1970
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:34,880
Workplace Behavior

1971
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:39,232
Even if you don't factor in the fact that you was supporting a straight-up white nationalist polakoff

1972
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,000
Denier

1973
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:43,328
From there the mainstream conservative World began to sour on malka

1974
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,608
I just had to Resort

1975
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:46,144
Fully throwing in with Nick Fuentes

1976
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:48,448
This is how this stuff works

1977
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:51,008
When the grift is done with you you find the neck

1978
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:52,288
Script and you keep movie

1979
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:53,568
And sometimes

1980
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:54,336
It's sad

1981
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:56,640
Everything else Nick Clippers just Nick Fuentes

1982
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:59,712
Complaining about how no one wants to be associated with them which makes sense

1983
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,552
I know that it does make things harder and it's more difficult to do business

1984
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:05,600
When people know what kind of a crypto

1985
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:06,368
Fascist bigot

1986
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:07,136
You are

1987
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:13,024
The people saying that they don't want to write you a space to hold a bigot rally in that's not an encroachment of your free speech

1988
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,328
Literally the thing that you went to the f******

1989
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:16,352
Supreme Court

1990
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:17,632
To get gay people

1991
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:20,192
From having the cakes

1992
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:21,216
Made for them

1993
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:24,288
Like that is this it

1994
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:25,568
Because of that

1995
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:27,360
That's your whole f****** game

1996
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:30,688
You don't get to win every

1997
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:31,456
I hate a

1998
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,736
Discrimination

1999
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:36,064
Were the only ones where they're allowed to discriminate on social media

2000
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,856
We're the only ones you're allowed to discriminate

2001
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,160
Book a hotel for

2002
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:40,928
Conference

2003
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:43,488
His first speech

2004
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,560
If you look at life

2005
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:48,096
Free Grassroots

2006
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:48,864
Populism

2007
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,144
And what people want

2008
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:54,752
The fact is we were selling my folks one and we're real

2009
01:23:55,520 --> 01:24:01,152
I think it's probably not a great idea for Alex to use the word we when he's talking about him and Nick giving people what they

2010
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:04,480
They want

2011
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:07,040
Has literally no idea who he's talking

2012
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:09,600
Into or that he wants to be associated with someone like

2013
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:10,368
Nick Fuentes

2014
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,160
It's really hard to tell which is the case

2015
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:16,768
But you better believe that he's ever confronted with some of the stuff that Nick says on his own platform

2016
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:20,352
Alex will immediately call him controlled opposition like he does

2017
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:21,120
Richard

2018
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,168
That is the

2019
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:25,472
This would go without was confronted with

2020
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:30,592
All of the stuff that I was surprised whenever they made the

2021
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:33,152
Spiritual sequel to what women want what men want

2022
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:34,688
I was surprised there wasn't more

2023
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:35,712
Explicit White

2024
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:38,016
Nationalist ideology coming from the mines

2025
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:38,784
So many of those p

2026
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:41,600
Some aspect

2027
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:45,696
So they talk about Nick getting kicked off YouTube and Alex's or psychologist

2028
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:48,256
Because you dare fight with Turner

2029
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:54,656
F*** off there's a lot of anti Turning Point contact you can find that's just fine

2030
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:55,680
Subtle warning in gut

2031
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:57,216
Demonetized while back

2032
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:58,496
For hate speech in

2033
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:01,824
Consistently engages in the exact same behavior is he is

2034
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,104
Had chances

2035
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:06,944
And you just want to not to behave the way he doesn't

2036
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:07,712
So babe

2037
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:09,504
YouTube's not for you buddy

2038
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:15,904
That's how it works in such a way as like this content is not

2039
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,208
What advertisers want to be associated with

2040
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:19,232
Boom

2041
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:20,512
Anyway

2042
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:22,304
Alex starts talking to him about how like

2043
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,584
Democrats are going to be gone

2044
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,632
Right we're going to

2045
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:26,656
But that point

2046
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:33,056
Who's going to need to be the two party system Republicans going to split it

2047
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:34,592
Who's going to be the white mask

2048
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:38,432
Interesting suggestion

2049
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:41,248
What the demographics

2050
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:44,064
Right

2051
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:46,624
But I want to change the whole paradigm

2052
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:55,840
Not real

2053
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:57,120
Pharmacy of America

2054
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:59,168
How do you transport that do two party system

2055
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,192
Supremacy

2056
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:04,544
Well it would be difficult to say you know people have said that it could line up with something

2057
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,896
Nothing like a Workers Party Like You could have the working and middle-class of all the diff

2058
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:09,920
Groups of people

2059
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:12,992
Exactly

2060
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,528
Right right again

2061
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:15,296
Against the elites

2062
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:17,856
That's ringing a bell for me

2063
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:21,440
Puerto Vallarta super right wing xenophobic crypto-fascist

2064
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:27,840
Party call itself a Workers Party

2065
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:31,424
National Socialist German Workers Party

2066
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:37,056
They're socialists though they don't support workers they support socialist

2067
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:39,360
I don't want people to think you similar to a Nazi

2068
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:41,152
Sure seems to invite a lot of comparison

2069
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:47,552
Choose choosing

2070
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:53,952
Idea all right the Brown uniforms the real problem maybe that's on his mind

2071
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:56,000
Goofy yes that is an issue

2072
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:58,304
But honestly we're only most

2073
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,328
We like the Nazis

2074
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:00,864
As a douche

2075
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:03,936
Rap-up

2076
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:06,752
It's mostly a complaining session about how they're all like

2077
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:08,288
Everyone's

2078
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,104
Don't like them

2079
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:16,736
We're going to have a rally about it

2080
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,296
So now Alex invites Nick

2081
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,064
To his house.

2082
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:23,904
We get into a little bit of history about

2083
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,952
Alex Jones and Michelle ball

2084
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:30,304
I want to invite you and Michelle Malkin I'm going to fly out Friday nights on Combee Road

2085
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:32,096
Didn't invite me but that's fine I got

2086
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:39,776
Probably was out of control or security got punched me in the arm writing back

2087
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:41,824
I like Michelle

2088
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:46,176
He got into a fight with Michelle Malkin

2089
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:51,808
Security guard yellow little bit later

2090
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:53,344
Of not liking

2091
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,392
Michelle Baca to the point of a salt

2092
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:58,720
With another security guard also seems to be like a pattern

2093
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:00,768
So Alex is theory

2094
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:01,792
Theory I guess

2095
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:03,072
With the way he's been

2096
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:04,096
Pitching thing

2097
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:06,656
Is this entire episode is it like

2098
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:08,704
I heard you were doing this thing

2099
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,288
Around seapak

2100
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,080
Tom pappert my employee

2101
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:15,104
Was running

2102
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:16,640
Another event

2103
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:17,664
And I

2104
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,968
It's like okay yeah let's do that and get

2105
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,248
4:20

2106
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,320
He is operating under the assumption

2107
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:25,600
National file

2108
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:26,880
Tried to get nikto

2109
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:28,672
To be a part of their rally

2110
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:30,976
And we're unable to do so

2111
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:31,744
So

2112
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:32,768
Alex Springs

2113
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:33,536
This up

2114
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:35,584
And it seems like that didn't

2115
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:36,608
Pappadeaux no

2116
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:39,424
I want invite you cuz I know the actual thought wants to know about you

2117
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:42,496
Tomorrow event Wednesday going to come out of the army

2118
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,800
Absolutely I would love to go

2119
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:46,592
I had to reach out to you

2120
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,896
I I don't think they have reached

2121
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,160
You understand what's Happening Here

2122
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:03,744
Oh boy even National filed no

2123
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,536
And Alex is like

2124
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:08,352
Oh my God

2125
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:13,216
Jordan thousand points of information are coming together for me and my wisdom

2126
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:18,336
That even Tom pepper was kind of like I don't know if I want this a****** involved in Arvada

2127
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:20,384
Nick Fuentes is the Alex

2128
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:24,224
Jones of Alex Jones's of doesn't want it

2129
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:30,368
We weren't able to

2130
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:36,768
Oh my God disconnected his phone's breaking up

2131
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:40,352
I want Nick Fuentes

2132
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:47,776
I'm sorry I was mean to you

2133
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:53,408
Papi Papi

2134
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:54,176
Whatever

2135
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:56,224
Whatever

2136
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,016
We'll just put it behind us

2137
01:29:58,272 --> 01:29:59,296
Clearly I'm not

2138
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:02,112
Still holding a grudge

2139
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:03,648
Obviously

2140
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,184
I can just put it all behind

2141
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:09,792
So as it turns out at the 2008 DNC Alex got into a little fight

2142
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:10,560
Michelle Malkin

2143
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:17,472
According to Westworld. He started yelling at her which caused her to try and flee but Alex kept harassing her and following her yelling

2144
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:21,312
Come on you little monster you little fascist piece of trash

2145
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:28,992
I guess his beef with her is better YouTube video those coming around around that time there was up a soldier throwing a puppy off

2146
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:30,016
Forklift in Iraq

2147
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:35,392
I have no idea what the deal is with that video but I do know that Infowars wrote a lot of articles

2148
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:36,928
It's about how much was it

2149
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:40,000
Denying US military atrocities in the war on terror

2150
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:43,328
Because you didn't condemn the video or I guess I think she speculated that it was a

2151
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:44,096
The stuffed animal

2152
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:49,472
If that was a real video that's awful but I should also point out that I haven't heard Alex Ane

2153
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:51,264
About Trump pardoning War crime

2154
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:54,336
One of them was charged with Coach shooting at civilians

2155
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:55,104
Supersport

2156
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:58,944
Another was charged with ordering the murder of two unarmed Afghan villagers

2157
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:01,248
Let this be a teachable moment

2158
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,040
When you're not on Alex's team

2159
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:05,344
Questioning a video of a soldier throwing a dog

2160
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,624
Golf Cliff makes you a fashion

2161
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:07,392
This piece of trash

2162
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:08,928
When you are on Alex

2163
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:11,232
16 literal monsters hoop

2164
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:12,256
Charged with war crimes

2165
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:13,536
It doesn't even come up

2166
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:15,584
That's what I mean when you are a fast

2167
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:18,144
Not a big deal

2168
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,704
Does not come up doesn't seem like it's the issue

2169
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:27,872
So National file was created this little event and they have like 300 Cedar or whatever Alex is already said this

2170
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:35,552
I'll give you 20 grand that I totally have because we're definitely not running out of money here and Alex makes it a little too

2171
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:38,624
Clear in this next clip that they're living

2172
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:42,976
On their listeners dime Notions political incorrectness to

2173
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:45,024
Because absolutely

2174
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:47,840
They say you. Neither am I and I'm just

2175
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:55,776
Hotel on that internet

2176
01:31:57,824 --> 01:32:00,384
But I am paying for part because I just want to have

2177
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:03,456
Where she packaged to meet in a big Ballroom

2178
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:08,064
And I am paying for the drinks

2179
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:09,344
So

2180
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:11,648
One thing

2181
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:19,328
Abuse it is this is abuse this is this is abusing your audience and then slapping their face

2182
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:20,096
Aces in front

2183
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:23,936
IPad is insult needed to do a larger

2184
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:29,312
Publicity stunt the national file was aiming to do so I paid $20,000

2185
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:31,616
That's coming from the listeners

2186
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:36,736
For a larger Ballroom to satisfy my ego and also when you come Nick have a drink

2187
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:39,040
It's all the listeners

2188
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:41,600
Wow

2189
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:42,624
It rough

2190
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,392
F***** up

2191
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:44,160
Yep

2192
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:47,488
So we're done with Nick Fuentes now because I mean most of the

2193
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:49,024
Is meaningless and

2194
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:49,792
Just whining

2195
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:51,584
But Alex

2196
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:52,608
Is also

2197
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:53,376
Trying to

2198
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,144
Cell

2199
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:54,912
His

2200
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:59,264
They put on your mouth

2201
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,568
So he makes a claim that I find

2202
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:04,128
Dubious

2203
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:05,920
Operation

2204
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:06,688
Tom

2205
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,480
What's in your address

2206
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:09,760
Cornelius

2207
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:11,552
1000

2208
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:13,856
Pieces we're on the prop rallies

2209
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:16,416
We're not taking them over we're not disrupting

2210
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:17,696
Operate

2211
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:19,232
Dislike Bernie

2212
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:21,024
Powerful

2213
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:21,792
We'll just

2214
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,448
Looks like

2215
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:34,080
It does look like that it's not about your beard or whatever

2216
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:37,152
I think it's really funny for Alex be like disrupting events

2217
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:39,968
It's not my style

2218
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:40,992
Me

2219
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:41,760
The guy who's

2220
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:44,320
Entire career is based around by bullhorn

2221
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:45,088
And scales

2222
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:47,392
King of the bullhorn

2223
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:51,488
Can you sing it's not my style disrupting event I'm not like Bernie

2224
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:57,888
Episode he's talkin about disrupting a Bernie rally with a bullhorn Bernie rally is

2225
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,168
Disrupt

2226
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:01,216
Take me to Bernie rally Gordie disrupt

2227
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:07,616
He's also trying to lure Michelle Malkin to his event by telling Nick Fuentes to apologize for yelling at her

2228
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:09,664
Car with a bullhorn right

2229
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:11,200
Stop disruption

2230
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:13,248
Redistribution of wealth

2231
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:17,088
All he does is yell at people

2232
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,880
He's not a big fan of disrupting

2233
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:21,952
All he does is yell he doesn't disrupt

2234
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:26,816
Nothing that's more his style name one event that is disrupted in the past outer no 6

2235
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:29,376
That time he showed up that Hillary thing with the

2236
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:30,912
That wasn't disruptive

2237
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:37,312
You just showed up with a tank instead of tree would it be all right so you take a tank to a couple

2238
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:40,384
Rally's in all of a sudden

2239
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:41,920
Whatever

2240
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:47,808
So Alex realizes there's a lot of headlines he hasn't gotten poodle

2241
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:55,232
Talking to Vic Fuentes Rivals, but don't b******* trying to sell his food

2242
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:58,048
Sorry I've been talkin to do white nationalists in the a******

2243
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:02,144
It's just too much going on that Weinstein convicted on a bunch of town

2244
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:05,728
Didn't even cover that cuz the virus is so bad

2245
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:09,824
I'm looking at hundreds of articles

2246
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:14,688
No cards to Intel

2247
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:15,968
Bullying

2248
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:17,760
Well

2249
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:22,624
Look at all the snooze

2250
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:27,488
You have not covered

2251
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:28,256
F******

2252
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:29,024
That is

2253
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:30,304
Criminal

2254
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,840
How dare you

2255
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:33,888
Unless all of those papers are

2256
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:35,936
Pictures of his food

2257
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:37,216
Dario

2258
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:40,800
King Darius doesn't cover the wind

2259
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:42,592
16 conviction is because it runs

2260
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:45,408
Counter to his narratives about how

2261
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:49,248
These Elite globalist type never get punished

2262
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:51,808
Yeah I am Factory Weinstein was charged

2263
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:53,600
It's kind of a problem

2264
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:55,136
For his narrative

2265
01:35:55,392 --> 01:36:01,536
Things upload charges

2266
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:03,072
Actually dwelling on it for any

2267
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:04,352
. of time is

2268
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:08,448
Last clip here and it's

2269
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,776
Little another little headline that he's got that

2270
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:15,104
Stop Bernie campaign funnel Millions to

2271
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:20,480
Meet Bernie stealing campaign money no

2272
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:26,112
Dirty, Steve trusts yammy loves you

2273
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:34,304
There's about a story on National file which again is run by Alex's employee Tom pepper

2274
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:40,960
The allegation is the one of the vendors that the campaign of Ernie's campaign used to run ads I was a company called Old Town

2275
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:41,984
Tell media LLC

2276
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:45,056
Apparently to the people who work at that company no burn

2277
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:49,664
There's no indication what now they just know her other friends or something

2278
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:54,784
There's no indication at all that Miss Andrews made any money from this Arrangement or if there's anything untoward here and

2279
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,576
Trust and Debbie fair I didn't look

2280
01:36:56,832 --> 01:37:00,416
Look into this at all I just took at face value the allegations on National file

2281
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:01,696
And that's what they are

2282
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:04,000
Wow I'm not sure exactly what this article is

2283
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:05,280
Reporting to show other than

2284
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:07,328
Possibly didn't Jane Sanders nose so

2285
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:08,096
Some people who work at

2286
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:10,656
PR Company that her husband's campaign uses

2287
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:11,936
I don't know

2288
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:12,704
That's nothing

2289
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,776
Compared to what Trump has been doing

2290
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:19,616
What what how is he been profiting off of his presidency whatsoever

2291
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:21,920
According to the Washington examiner Trump's campaign

2292
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:22,688
Quotes

2293
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:26,016
More than $190,000 in campaign contributions

2294
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:27,808
Do Trump own properties business

2295
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:29,856
Family members in the fourth quarter of

2296
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:31,136
2019

2297
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:38,048
I don't even have a funny answer that that's f****** tragic Trump Foundation had to

2298
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:41,632
Close after being forced to pay a two million-dollar settlement stemming from there

2299
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:43,424
Directing charity funds to

2300
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,448
The campaign uses

2301
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:48,800
There's not rageous level of self-healing the Trump has been involved in while running for and B

2302
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:50,336
Being president again

2303
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:51,872
Let this be a teachable moment

2304
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:53,664
If you're not on Alex's team

2305
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:56,480
The fact that your wife knows someone at a PR for a few uses

2306
01:37:56,736 --> 01:37:57,248
Is proof of ramp

2307
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:58,016
The corruption

2308
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:59,552
If you are on Alex's TV

2309
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:02,368
Engaging in a pattern of very extensive self and Rich

2310
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:03,392
Campaign

2311
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:05,440
Is not corruption at all

2312
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:06,976
Nope and it's not mentioned

2313
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:07,744
Because

2314
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,024
I don't know about that stuff

2315
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:11,584
Hey now there's no way to find out about anything like

2316
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:16,960
And I don't think of any I can't think of anything in the Constitution that would Express Lee prohibit this kind of behavior from

2317
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,360
Should be I mean I feel like I owe an apology to

2318
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:24,640
Feel like I

2319
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:25,408
Not been in

2320
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:29,760
This episode was really really stupid

2321
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:32,832
Looks like Alex knows that he's leaving tomorrow

2322
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:38,208
He's going to have so much fun yelling at people in DC

2323
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:42,816
The Funtime making a star with his s******* proud boyfriends and

2324
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:47,680
No in Indian all the money that people have donated

2325
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:50,240
To keep in Forza lipo

2326
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:52,032
And he's going to be able to

2327
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:58,432
Get drunk in d.c. in that van and who Among Us hasn't needed a drink to survive the Infowars

2328
01:38:58,688 --> 01:39:00,736
Look I'm not opposed to that

2329
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:07,648
I get the feeling that Alex knows that he's about to go on vacation at this episode is a

2330
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:08,928
Desperate push

2331
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:10,208
For people to buy the food

2332
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,744
And then on top of that

2333
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:13,280
Stupid

2334
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:16,608
The whole thing about being assaulted at the Bernie rally makes no sense

2335
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:20,192
Based on the evidence provided by Infowars it

2336
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:22,240
Paper thin

2337
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:24,288
At the fence it the way it's being used

2338
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,592
And the rest of the stuff is really stupid

2339
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:27,360
Except

2340
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:29,152
For the idea of an emotional

2341
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:29,920
Sport pelican

2342
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:31,456
Yeah you would

2343
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:32,224
Like

2344
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:35,808
I don't

2345
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:39,136
I don't think there's any possible way to be excited

2346
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:40,416
About a show

2347
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:41,440
That

2348
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:42,208
Sitting

2349
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:43,488
As just Benedict

2350
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:44,256
Complete

2351
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:45,792
Assault on reality

2352
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:47,584
Like there's just no other way to do

2353
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:49,120
Describe it then literally

2354
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:51,680
Everything that was over and over and over

2355
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:55,264
The the virus said that they

2356
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:58,592
At economy the f****** everything is a

2357
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:00,896
Complete and utter the video that

2358
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:03,200
Shows the thing that the opposite of the things

2359
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:04,224
Calling it

2360
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:05,248
To your face

2361
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:09,088
This show is if you are a listener of this show you might as well just

2362
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:13,696
Walk up to Alex and let him slap you in the face and then go back to the end of the line

2363
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:15,488
To wait for it to happen all over again

2364
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:16,768
This is flucking

2365
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:18,048
Incredible

2366
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,328
Yeah it's not

2367
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:20,864
More so than usual

2368
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:22,144
Jackets

2369
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:23,168
It's often

2370
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:24,448
