1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
Holding

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:10,496
Alex

3
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:16,896
We are a couple of dudes like to sit around

4
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:22,272
A little bit about Alex Jones

5
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,808
Is in the history of twitch

6
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,600
I am telling you what

7
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,880
Audio issues

8
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:33,280
No never have a bit turns out its staff on that s*** I know nothing about

9
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:39,680
Audio settings but I do know a lot about Alex Jones

10
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:45,056
Find are you doing today Jordan

11
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:48,384
I don't know if you've ever done that by Mariana

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,176
You ever ask me how I know

13
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:56,576
In our friendship I don't know if that never happened I'm very back on my heels because of these issues I don't know what I'm doing anymore

14
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,136
Going back to my freezing point

15
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Just be happy sitting across a conversation

16
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:13,728
OK Google

17
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:18,592
No no

18
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,992
Book Two for the people that I

19
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,576
Rent from to know who we are we would also be famous enough

20
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,856
Need to pay my rent on

21
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:34,208
So

22
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:37,536
That is what we did

23
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,328
I know is

24
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,608
Too damn High

25
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,144
Shoot Em High

26
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,288
It is November 27th

27
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:54,688
Also known as going to a

28
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,736
36 hour live Marathon

29
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,784
Disgusted on our last episode

30
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:05,440
And I listen to Alex

31
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,488
Jones's show during it

32
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,512
I had every intention

33
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,560
The purest of hearts

34
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,096
To cover that

35
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,912
That was going to be recovered on today's episode

36
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,472
But it was all f****** advertise

37
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,544
It was all commercials for products

38
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,384
I just don't know how we cover that

39
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,992
You know there was almost no content and it to the point where I was just like I was getting mad at

40
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:39,232
I have one clip case we should join his pyramids

41
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,536
Might as well

42
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,680
I did I do have one clip from today and it was just a beautiful moment of irony

43
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,984
Because I turn on

44
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,032
Do you live stream of his show

45
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,568
There was a bad before it

46
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,360
And it's very interesting to

47
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,432
Procure this ad

48
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,504
And see the juxtaposition of the two

49
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,272
Okay

50
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,624
Now available to Kohl's in your neighbor

51
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,232
Everybody around me

52
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:14,560
Cannot use Amazon

53
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:24,032
I love that

54
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:30,432
As far as

55
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,480
It was whiplash

56
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,808
It was all just like

57
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,088
Completely boring ads

58
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,392
We have no reason

59
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,160
To talk about it

60
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,440
A butt

61
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,560
You Jordan earlier today I've never done this

62
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:52,960
Before first time ever asked you to choose a day from history for us to go back to episode 4

63
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:57,568
I'll because again I am not prepared to do that time travel episode the one of our policy walk

64
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,616
As I requested updo

65
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,944
How did we go

66
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,504

67
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040

17th or 18th

70
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,160
December 12th

71
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:20,351
That is when the torture report

72
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:26,239
That was that was what happened or what your intention was to see what Alex Jones about the torture report

73
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:32,895
Brand new year anniversary of when the world

74
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:39,295
Basically

75
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,319
Amazing episode

76
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,647
Number of reason

77
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:50,047
No. No way of knowing what's coming seems like I could possibly

78
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,471
Does the Torture part is not really a big factor

79
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:03,871
Other stuff that makes huge out of context drop from today

80
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:21,279
You know they just drops in that quickly the number of times you said that on the air is

81
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:27,423
Elizabeth

84
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,823
I realize that we keep forgetting

85
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,615
To give a shout out to polity walks

86
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:42,271

Alex Jones makes

111
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,159
The very weird reference

112
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
To his personal life

113
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:25,951
City almost

114
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
Never make

115
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,999
Okay

00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
What's going on

117
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
Make it up

118
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,815
Ladies and gentlemen

119
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,727
How will you make up a divorce trial to everybody

120
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:15,359
No it's the divorce settlement 2014 getting divorce

121
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:21,503
So it's actually the separation and everything is what he's talking about that's when he's making it up

122
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
I guess

123
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551
Yeah

124
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,903
Because of his new wife

125
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,511
I always think that's interesting

126
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,303
That

127
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:41,471
Never talks about the divorce and stuff like that

128
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,799
That sort of stuff

129
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,079
Hey alright

130
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,359

Yesterday cuz I was busy getting divorced

133
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,527
Exactly

134
00:08:54,783 --> 00:09:00,927
She's yelling at me about that boat and I'm like I can't give you that but every other

135
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:07,327

00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,655
Which is the name of this car wash

137
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,727
Probably

138
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,799
So

139
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,847

John Brennan

145
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,439
To respond about that

146
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,279
Andy gave a lackluster response

147
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,863
Human rights correctly his response was

148
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:44,703
Hey you know some people do a thing some people talk to you with things

149
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,471
It's

150
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,751

There's no way you can do that it was bad to start with Joe Biden Banner

171
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,695
And he thinks that

172

A3

192
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
4

193
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,615
5

194
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,807
Are going to be seen as a bunch of

195
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,375
That was a very successful

196
00:12:55,935 --> 00:13:02,079
Record of all that might be the first time that I have strategically edited

197
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:11,807
We are stupid if we go along with that and then call myself out on it

198
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,367
But I mean

199
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
Yeah

200
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
Sure

201
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
Alright

202
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,023
Sub owner

203
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,583
Established ear is that

204
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,863
It's funny to say boner

205
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,423
Which you're not wrong he's not wrong

206
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:34,335
This is immediately after

207
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
That was an exam

208
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,431
Comfortable thing.

209
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,783
This is right after the November election

210
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,855
That gave us the Republican majority that we are

211
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,183
Just after the midterms in 2014

212
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,975
December 12th 2014

213
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:55,071
Alex what will happen if they don't successfully repeal Obamacare

214
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,631
I can't think of anything escalation

215
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:04,031
Yeah it seems like that

216
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,591
Actually Karen will not punish their politicians

217
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,615
Sims 4 failing them

218
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,407
The only thing that they really asked

219
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:13,759
Yeah absolutely name is funny

220
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:17,855
Yeah and that there's a spending bill that they didn't

221
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:23,999
Stop with their supermajority they had the funds the government into that after this next clip

222
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,815
Infowars.com

223
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,375
House passes Government funding bill

224
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,679
Belle Isle

225
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,775
Who added that

226
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,247
But it's not even bad enough

227
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
It should be

228
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
House passes

229
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,391
Cuz it is

230
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:20,575
Express

231
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,327
Forgot my work.

232
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:38,239
What's a sales alliteration of assholes Army

233
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:44,383
Yeah this is an article from Kurt Nimmo who is the guy who work for

234
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:51,039
Clearly

235
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,927
You know what the spending bill

236
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,463
Do you know the context

237
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:02,559
Yeah but government

238
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,655
Call Ted Cruz

239
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,959
Very hard to rule the world

240
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,751
Damage the GOP rep

241
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,055
Butaton so that even though they had a

242
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,127
Maturity everybody hate them so much

243
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,663
Specifically Ted Cruz

244
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,687
Who would later

245
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:25,343
Come second and many primary

246
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,647
Trillion-dollar spending

247
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,671
Omnibus

248
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:33,535
Spending Bill Democrats are now opposing several last-minute provisions

249
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:39,935
Including one that would repeal the Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Bill that limits trade by federal Ian

250
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703
Insured Banks

251
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,031
Car insurance seems like the Republican

252
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,823
Trying to get rid of the Dodd-Frank

253
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:54,015
I can't think of any reason that they would get rid of the Dodd-Frank Bill considering that they represent

254
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,295
To just care about

255
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
And just

256
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:01,183
You know getting back to Americana I don't understand why they would try

257
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,975
Destroy a bill that actually

258
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,511
Those people

259
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:10,911
From predatory lenders that you don't understand prosperity it's Mostly Ghostly

260
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,959
About Banks taking risks with your mind

261
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,775
Real prosperity

262
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
When they're doing

263
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:24,479
Are they more fun if it's a surprise

264
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:29,855
No I mean the Revolution was a surprise

265
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:36,255
It's a surprise to all of us by 1776

266
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
Also to be about occasionally being Tech

267
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,911
Text too much Maxine Waters Elizabeth Warren both wearing

268
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,703
Incredibly vocal in their opposition

269
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
TVs

270
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,287
Are these last-minute additions Republican

271
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,823
Snuck through in

272
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:55,711
And someone else is talking about the spending bill now this.

273
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,783
And the real dangerous parts of the things that the Republicans who he is

274
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,111
And

275
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:06,975
I don't know you can always pretend that he's not a Democrat he's not a republican a bipartisan

276
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
Be off

277
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,303
He celebrates a lot with Republicans

278
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,839
Oh oh

279
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,607
Yeah

280
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,703
And I I don't know I don't know if that's just an amp

281
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:17,983
Reno

282
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,519
Democratic Norris

283
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,543
It's just full of s***

284
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,991
Cuz I would say a brings up another employee of

285
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,807
This is right after a video package

286
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,087
It's real like

287
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,439
Fast Cuts things taken out of context with relief swelling dramatic music

288
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,743
Get Nancy Pelosi

289
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,535
Nothing explosive but

290
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,815
Eric Holder

291
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:47,679
Wasn't nearly on his life is shooting board at the

292
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,495
Colder's in there Obama

293
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,287
12 quarts

294
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,823
Obama saying something like

295
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,431
Let's feed people and then he's not horror movie right

296
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,927
Awakening

297
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,071
Infowars

298
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:23,775
Funny story rotten long name for that

299
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,311
Quickly about how Alex is an a******

300
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,127
Interested

301
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,943
If I recall correctly he was to Alex Turner

302
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,967
M24 backup

303
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,503
In the David Duke Energy you

304
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,903
Have gone on to say

305
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,927
Certainly don't agree with

306
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:41,951
Miss B

307
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,511
Israel

308
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:50,911
That's her to stop using their brand over

309
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,703
I was worried that he actually

310
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,495
Went to the side that make sense

311
00:19:55,007 --> 00:20:01,151
No longer there

312
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
Does not like

313
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,503
Do you know what Alex has some Weird Al

314
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,063
This back in 2014 that you would never expect

315
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,879
You already heard him say something negative about Sean Hannity

316
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,927
Best friend

317
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:19,583
What is the present with God because the future is not going to hold well for him

318
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,935
Are you going to be in trouble he's not pimping

319
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,215
This clip is

320
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,495
Interesting as hell

321
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,175
He doesn't just throw out

322
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,087
Teeth

323
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:41,855
Ears better

324
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,391
Venice Sean Hannity

325
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:50,303
Rino Republican talk show host

326
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,839
Support

327
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,119
Drugstore

328
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,471
Police brutality no matter what

329
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,007
We try to look at both sides

330
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:00,799
No you don't

331
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,615
Not at all like okay I get

332
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:07,199
Sean Hannity had morphed into a on the same team

333
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:09,759
Guy at that point right

334
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,855
Corporate Fox News guy question

335
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,135
What happened to Hannity

336
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:18,208
Is Han Solo's happening to Alex

337
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,840
But I mean more like was Hannity a secret Alex Jones this whole time

338
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,120
The what is crazy

339
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:31,520
He was always as crazy as radio show

340
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:38,688
Sensitive like he was a he was really

341
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,784
Unprofessional

342
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,624
I used my grandfather force me to listen to a good hour or

343
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,416
Two of us

344
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,464
Watching him and Usher

345
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,744
Bring him into the

346
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
Beyond

347
00:21:55,328 --> 00:22:00,192
Infinite kept me from listen to Hannity I would have been like an hour or couple earlier

348
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,752
Chicken

349
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:06,848
Hannity

350
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,200
But it's interesting to hear Alex say positive things about

351
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,480
Charles Krauthammer

352
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:18,368
Whenever he gets challenge

353
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,160
I'm not talkin I want to talk person

354
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:24,000
I don't want to talk to anybody

355
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:30,656
I mean it would be hard not to next Shame Shame here are some reasons Alex Trebek

356
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:35,776
Alex cannot say he supports our greasy Charles Krauthammer

357
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:39,360
Supports abortion that's number one

358
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:45,760
Number to believes in evolution and rejects the idea of intelligent design

359
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:52,160
To support environmental causes and energy conservation

360
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:59,328
Emphatically support embryonic stem cell research using tissue from abortion

361
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,888
What's wrong with that

362
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,448
Isaac nothing speaks there

363
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:07,520
Harvesting babies and making cameras

364
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:14,176
Both sides

365
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,992
He likes to listen to Charles Krauthammer

366
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,528
Hey Alex that's f***

367
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,064
King stupid and he's going to be like

368
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,416
Hey Krauthammer you got a lot of good ideas not like that dumbass Hannity over there

369
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,720
Who agrees with me that they're creating chimera

370
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,536
A great Ally

371
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,352
Got into years

372
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:36,960
We have our demon Canada once you guys come to me

373
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,728
Krauthammer

374
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,520
You're gone

375
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
The rip

376
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,336
In the the the reality

377
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,896
Avail becomes big enough

378
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:48,224
I will go to Sean Hannity we will come together

379
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,528
As some sort of globular

380
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,368
Ulta media and professional media

381
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,648
Two headed boy

382
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,184
When we get Force

383
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,488
Listen to the dark timeline by Mixel

384
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:08,704
We have to say his name backwards before we can get into the timeline we're burning one like

385
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,008
Alex is f***** up

386
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:11,776
That makes

387
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,592
Philosophy a anything

388
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,896
His hubris

389
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,432
Back then

390
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,200
Humorous

391
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,248
Back then nose

392
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,272
No bounds

393
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,808
Listen to this book

394
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:28,160
Sales pitch for a second

395
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,208
Exactly what he's asking of his listener

396
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,000
Another key

397
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,608
World

398
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
Supporter

399
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,520
Become sponsors

400
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,568
Become

401
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,848
Supporters

402
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,856
Disco clothes

403
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,416
I want pay for a billboard

404
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,696
That's an interesting

405
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,232
To call your AM FM radio

406
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,168
I don't know about

407
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:17,056
Three Billboards three Billboards in ebbing Missouri and they said $5,000 a month

408
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:20,384
For three Billboards that's pretty close very small town

409
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,200
Yes outside of Milwaukee

410
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:26,016
You can get one for about $4,000 a month

411
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,552
Three to four thousand dollars

412
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,392
Yeah you bump it up to a city like

413
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,416
San Diego

414
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:37,536
Right which is not even a large Market but it's not like LA or something

415
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:41,120
That's going to run you probably about 10 to $15,000 in

416
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:46,752
Still reasonable if you get a return on your investment Boston let's say Boston

417
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:53,920
Urban urban area Metropolitan City it can run you up to 23

418
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,248
Yes

419
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:03,648
Traffic areas is all about how many eyes get on stuff it's all about impression how much would it

420
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,928
Cost us to get a billboard

421
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,488
What are you thinking

422
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,144
At least a $20,000

423
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,680
Boston and

424
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,704
Chicago probably for

425
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,728
Pretty close I'm terms of

426
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:21,056
Maybe a little higher but probably in the ballpark

427
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,872
Geez

428
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,176
So we're going to do a 36-hour lock Street

429
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,552
$23,000 and it's a you want to pay $20,000 for a paddleboard

430
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,624
Or conservatively $10,000

431
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:39,488
I know that it's too expensive to buy my wet herbs

432
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,792
Buy a billboard

433
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,584
Humorous

434
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,352
Hubris

435
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,376
Yeah that's not

436
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,984
Half an hour into his

437
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,776
Tipping Point

438
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,336
Finally decides

439
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,104
To the tortures.

440
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:59,712
Yes we're going to go hard on it he's got a lot of Articles he's really going to get into

441
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,552
You know that doesn't mean anything

442
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,320
Doesn't mean

443
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,856
Who is Alex Jones

444
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,416
Fish report

445
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,488
Tom

446
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,072
Torture report

447
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,168
Torture everyone is

448
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,752
Whatever.

449
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
Asystematic

450
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,432
Across-the-board

451
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,528
Court reports

452
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,576
From 2000 I think it's 2000

453
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,976
Torture report

454
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,768
He's the Filipino American General

455
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,792
3-star General

456
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,328
It's tacuba

457
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,376
Investigation

458
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:52,192
And that was a real one

459
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,176
Launch are related

460
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,736
Military

461
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,064
Federal prison guards

462
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,088
Records on purpose

463
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,304
Whitewash

464
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:23,168
This whole thing

465
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:25,984
Yep and not realized

466
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,824
Tacumbu

467
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,896
Here's the thing about that

468
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,664
Slightly off

469
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:38,784
He said it was 2007 I believe did a report

470
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,088
Tell anything about children being raped

471
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:47,488
Withings dipped in acid in front of their parents

472
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,280
Have not talked to tacuba

473
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:55,168
Tacumbu

474
00:28:55,424 --> 00:29:00,800
Extant

475
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:01,824
No she

476
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,896
Blue

477
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:09,760
Boys come from

478
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:16,928
Closest thing I could find is there

479
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,952
Report

480
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:24,352
General taguba got

481
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:28,448
Incredible based on the circumstances sodomized

482
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,728
With like a

483
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,008
Light a fluorescent

484
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,800
Flight or something along those lines

485
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,336
Horrifying

486
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,872
But that's not quite

487
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,408
Children getting raped with things

488
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,200
Dipped in acid in front of their parents

489
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,992
Alex's sensationalizing

490
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,016
Quite a bit

491
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,040
It's not that

492
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:48,416
It's a stupid place to draw line quite frankly

493
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,952
I I mean

494
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,608
I'm not on anybody's side there but I want to back

495
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:02,752
In this in this race in terms of Alex being a reporter in terms of him actually telling you things

496
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:06,336
He's failing at that this is the most important

497
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:11,200
Takupaz report came out in May 20th 2004

498
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,576
Damasteel International put out their report about Abu ghraib

499
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,344
In

500
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,112
Juniper

501
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:18,880
2003

502
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,416
So his report

503
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:26,816
Came out even after the atrocities that were reported in Abu Dhabi being

504
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,888
Reported so a lot of the stuff that's in there

505
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,656
Is just

506
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,704
I have substantiated that

507
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,008
Detainees told me these things happen

508
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,544
What's it already been reported

509
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,360
Never want to give it up for amnesty

510
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,152
Or something like that so

511
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:48,064
Is it weird

512
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,600
We've all known

513
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,648
At this point that America is

514
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,928
Is torturing people

515
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,952
Non-Stop

516
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,744
11 years

517
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,792
And we're like

518
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,584
Brennan

519
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,400
Don't agree with us

520
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,240
You're supposed to lie so we feel less

521
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,776
Complicit in the

522
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:12,384
It's really f***** up Alex

523
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:16,224
I would think his position on it would be

524
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,112
Pretty close to what I would expect different though

525
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,160
Cuz I would expect it to be gloating

526
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,976
Yeah I would also expected to be gloating with like

527
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,280
Here's all the times I've told you

528
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:35,680
And here is you know me breaking the story way before and all that instead of just message Billy being like to hooba

529
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,472
I'm sorry took

530
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,288
My thoughts

531
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,568
On what he would

532
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,104
Think based on his lover

533
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,640
The Blackwater now is

534
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:48,992
Yeah we're torturing people that's how we should be doing it I don't think you like Blackwater

535
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,904
Cuz he doesn't support it definitely will

536
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,720
Backwater now I assume that you have loved tortures

537
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,512
You saw your first episode of

538
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,328
I'll tell you this

539
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,120
Which I support

540
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:14,592
Does he know what we're doing now with the Trump regime and how we're killing them

541
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:20,992
Food around me

542
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:25,344
Is just going Buckwild

543
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,368
It's just they are

544
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,648
Just fighting a

545
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:31,744
Total War and burning people alive talk

546
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,048
Fake news

547
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,608
Shout out to project veritas

548
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,656
You saw this

549
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,704
Everyone

550
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,752
Most put out

551
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,568
About project Veritas trying to trick them

552
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:50,176
Sting operation about Roy Moore

553
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,992
Right I don't know if everybody is seeing the videos

554
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,784
The project Veritas

555
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,320
Out to try and get ahead of it

556
00:32:56,576 --> 00:33:01,184
Was going to come out

557
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,000
That is so funny if you're

558
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:10,400
I imagine they got reached for comment in the middle of trying to screw the ocean

559
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,448
You guys are you guys are trying to trick us

560
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:15,520
Can you tell me some

561
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,592
The record I want to be a mountain

562
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:23,712
Rushed out some videos and it's like behind the scenes

563
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,760
Talking to people watching

564
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,064
Then post it so much nothing

565
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,880
It's astounding how little there is there

566
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,184
This is the real truth

567
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:33,952
This is

568
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,744
American prophet

569
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,072
Betty's got is

570
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:44,192
Somebody from from The Washington Post editorial board

571
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:44,960
Doesn't like

572
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,776
Realtor

573
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,800
Pretty

574
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,080
I think that's pretty salad

575
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:55,456
Those are not the news writers

576
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,736
It don't like that like

577
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,528
I think there are few

578
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,904
But also in the wake of all this is very important to remember

579
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:07,232
That's a few years back Donald Trump did give James O'Keefe

580
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,256
He's $10,000

581
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,048
Really

582
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:13,632
So interesting to remember and that will come back up

583
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,168
At the end of this episode

584
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,448
In a really weird way

585
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,728
Alright

586
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,752
Be that as it may

587
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,032
1120 bookends

588
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,312
I told you

589
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,104
Alex Jones Against torture

590
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,384
He is Against torture

591
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,688
Now in this time.

592
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,808
When Obama is doing against

593
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,648
Because

594
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,488
To be fair to him

595
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,304
When he's critique

596
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,072
Trump

597
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,376
One of the things he consistently says

598
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,400
Orr has said

599
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,936
Especially in the early days

600
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,960
The presidency was

601
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:54,848
That's one of the only things that he would point out that

602
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,384
I dropped the wrong on this one

603
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:02,784
Yeah generals are misleading him and stuff like that so I mean I think on some level he actually does understand that

604
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
Torture is bad

605
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
But

606
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:05,856
This next

607
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:08,416
Quip understanding and being against

608
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,952
This mess

609
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,232
Clip

610
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,024
Tells me that Alex has

611
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,792
Eating

612
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,328
Incredibly weird tape

613
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,632
On torture as a whole

614
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:21,472
I don't really know what's going on in this clip

615
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,264
Okay I really don't write

616
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,944
You better stop

617
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,576
20 years ago

618
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,744
Good

619
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,168
Level I don't

620
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:18,816
Much less

621
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,912
Where everybody

622
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,984
Here's what I mean

623
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,032
I need you to track the thought

624
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:34,432
I really need to cuz you talkin about Crimes of Passion right now and the idea that like you just go red and UK

625
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,456
Kill somebody or whatever

626
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:40,320
Yeah I swear he's going to try and relate this to torture

627
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,112
He's not but he

628
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,256
Baby baby flying a little bit low right now

629
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,584
Throttled

630
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,656
Porkins no

631
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:05,408
Presentation

632
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:14,368
Torture

633
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,416
Your heart

634
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,744
Torture is natural

635
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,656
And you're going to be

636
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,216
And in the moment

637
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,288
What it's like

638
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,616
You have the energy

639
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,256
What

640
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,448
The government

641
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,984
That's because you don't do it for

642
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,752
Compassion

643
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,992
Because their barbarous

644
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:33,728
But it's really interesting at the end

645
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,008
What am I going to save this

646
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:41,408
Call Grandma

647
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,528
This indicates to me that in December of 2014

648
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:50,624
But Alex has also been debrief

649
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,672
The Russian intelligence agency

650
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,768
I think we can push that date back to 2040

651
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,304
I don't think so

652
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,632
Inclusive thing right there

653
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:09,568
Fair enough I'm standing by this is what happens when you torture me before the show and we wind up getting audio

654
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:12,384
It was a crime of passion

655
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:16,736
I don't know what he thinks torture is

656
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,856
I think he's just against false confession

657
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:22,880
I agree with

658
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,416
I mean I'm against

659
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,440
I think

660
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:29,792
I think that's what you're really doing is talk to Trump about the Central Park five

661
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,120
F****** for any number of people

662
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:34,912
So

663
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,960
So easy

664
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:39,264
I think he's Against torture for the wrong reason

665
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:43,872
Or at least a reason

666
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:46,688
It deprives you of your Humanity

667
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:50,272
Surprised the person who you're torturing

668
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,344
And I would love for everyone to operate on that

669
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,648
But if you can't

670
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,720
And don't torture people because it doesn't work

671
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:02,304
If that's all you got

672
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,144
If it leads torturing people or advocating for people not torturing

673
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,168
Hooray

674
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,448
Yeah

675
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,752
Very Elemental Elementary

676
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,544
Writes very much

677
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,568
In terms of

678
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,640
Yeah there's just there's

679
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:20,736
In the same way there's emotional maturity and intellectual maturity there is like

680
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,784
Moral Majority

681
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,600
No just going by Golden Rule kind of stuff

682
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,672
Basic level and then

683
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:32,000
Principles get built-in as you get older and wrap it

684
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,280
Live by principles

685
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,584
And then eventually you get to the point where

686
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,376
You live by principles that must

687
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,960
Like they'd be the opposite could not be true

688
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,752
Alex is operating on

689
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,520
Very

690
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,312
Very childlike adolescent

691
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,688
Equating torture with beating someone to death

692
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,968
Because they

693
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,248
Drunkenly killed her

694
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,272
Kid in a car accident

695
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,296
That was weird

696
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:59,392
Very much and also that's a crime of passion if you go and get your gun

697
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,720
Though he wants to buy somebody

698
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,256
Like he's describing some

699
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,280
Something that he's done where

700
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,840
Totally

701
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:12,960
Turn it off

702
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,496
Yeah

703
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,288
That's a very it's very real

704
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,872
At least the feeling

705
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:23,200
But that's stealing I'm saying that he thinks he stopped

706
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:23,968
Himself from killing

707
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:29,344
Definitely could have killed a lot of people

708
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,648
Literally said that before

709
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:33,696
Jordan

710
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,720
Yes

711
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,744
You know how I told you

712
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,792
But the beginning of the show

713
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:40,864
Also I think he was referencing the movie The Way of the gun

714
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,424
Probably Silverman gets punched in the parking

715
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:52,128
Free movie I love it Ryan Phillippe Bonita Benicio del Toro

716
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,151
Big fan

717
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,431
Good Sarah Silverman

718
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:58,015
Dim screen

719
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:00,831
Jordan

720
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,599
Yeah

721
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,903
This is the end of his coverage

722
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,719
Torturing

723
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,535
So

724
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:14,399
He nailed it

725
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:17,471
XFINITY Live

726
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:20,543
Check that off the list

727
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:26,431
Now I told you at the beginning of the episode editorial why

728
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,711
Eye cancer

729
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,015
Torture into words

730
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,039
Punch

731
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,063
Don't

732
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,159
Pleasurable but don't do it

733
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:37,951
I told you to beginning

734
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:38,975
Of the show

735
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:39,999
Do you actually

736
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,559
Episode

737
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,351
I will tell you why there's

738
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,119
There's two reasons

739
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,655
And one of them

740
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:53,823
Darrell hamamoto

741
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,383
How did that happen

742
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:02,783
Uc-davis Professor Darrell hamamoto

743
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,831
Get up I started listening to it I was like

744
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,879
Oh f*** yeah

745
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,903
And I will say this

746
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,695
It's not his best showing

747
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:12,511
It's not that it's not I wanted to

748
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:18,911
Tickpick my gayest instrument to go infiltrate Occupy Wall Street

749
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,679
Stop

750
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,727
It's really great also

751
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,799
Keep it this bums me out

752
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,871
Cuz he's brought he's like calling him from his

753
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,407
Pretty small apartment

754
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,199
Yeah whatever it is what it is

755
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,783
Through the interview you can hear like

756
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,551
Truck

757

00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,695
You know Donatos

760
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,743
He's a man of modest mean

761
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:48,863
Tenured professor

762
00:43:56,543 --> 00:44:00,639

763
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,919
Darrell hamamoto

764
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,223
He in this clip

765
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,247
He compliments

766
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,527
And then insult

767
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,063

You talk about Jonathan Gruber

771
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:19,583
It's not important

772
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:23,167
How the world really works

773
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:27,519
Inside baseball a BS

774
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:30,847
Always went on from when I've seen in some special phds

00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,711
Get on C-Span

776
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,063
Arrogance

777
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:42,367
The arrogance of how stupid they say

778
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:49,023
It's arrogance and I was listening to what here earlier interviews this week

779
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:57,983
Great great

780
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:10,527

Rapper

787
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,079
Clancy's got some good

788
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:38,175
Most of the writing of the book Saturday the 1st

789
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,711
Hamamoto is nuts

790
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:46,367
Analyst

791
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:49,439

792
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:54,559
I have no idea I've never read it I would like to Rouses Latter-Day Tom Clancy

793
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,399

794
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,215
Summer reading

795
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,239

798
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,199
How to hide your gun

799
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,479
No. He doesn't know that

800
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:14,015
Where to keep your gaze

801
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,039
You don't know that

802
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:21,951
We got them up they got a book on high today in Summit

803
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,815
I told you that I'm a moto nose thumb

804
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:29,887
Fitness mix

805
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,191
What does

806
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,495
Elaborate

807
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,567
Conspiracy that he is going to lay out in this next clip

808
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,103
And I would like

809
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,895
To point out that the

810
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:43,199
He sets it up even from the beginning

811
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:45,247
He's discussing what

812
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,527
He tells professors

813
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:48,063
To try and get them to wake up

814
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,855
The red pill them or whatever

815
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,927
Even in his own conception

816
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,719
He's talking about

817
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,743
Corporation

818
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:58,047
Trying to screw over people pain

819
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,839
Not globulin

820
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,631
So hold on

821
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,679
We'll get to that on the other side after he makes

822
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,959
Suitcase that is

823
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,519
Rambling and nonsensical

824
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,287
My favorite crazy

825
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,551
Is an illusion

826
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:54,111
Going on at night

827
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:05,631
So when you talk about the weaponized campus

828
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:08,703
He's talking about the electromagnetic rays

829
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,983
And stuff like that they're shooting

830
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:18,431
He's not.

831
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,247
They aren't going to enforce it was militarized

832
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,551
That's where I

833
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:31,231
No I don't believe so and also it's not it's not the

834
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:37,631
It is because they have these remember he has that in Tennessee

835
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:44,031
All kinds of ways that are going around campus

836
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,079
Backup

837
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:51,967
Also the very idea that Wall Street wants

838
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,527
I mean yeah.

839
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:56,831
Do you like

840
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:57,855
That's not Google

841
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:01,439
That's out-of-control capitalist

842
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,767
I don't think they're going to enforce it with lasers

843
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:07,583
Although

844
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:13,215
If you use lasers that better for me somehow

845
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:19,615
I think that's more fun like it's the Pendragon affair

846
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,895
Flamboyant monster

847
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:26,783
Give me some entertainment

848
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:32,159
Search answer such as

849
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,975
She's having a US citizen

850
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:38,815
You have no idea

851
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,959
I didn't do that okay

852
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,567
An international Network

853
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,335
2

854
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:54,943
Education course

855
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,343
For the destruction of

856
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:09,535
What's the destruction of

857
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,327
So

858
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:14,655
If Linda can

859
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:19,775
Through the education system in Greece

860
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:26,175
Economy at that cuz you was so successful you got to be the president of

861
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,039
A bit also

862
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:37,439
She's so important that she's an international destroyer of economies yeah and was fired for giving her son

863
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,975
And stepdaughter a job

864
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:39,743
Yep

865
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,351
He's so crazy

866
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,399
Checks out

867
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:52,799
Indispensable piece of a nefarious International conspiracy

868
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:56,383
Heading

869
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:00,991
Petty nepotism

870
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:06,367
Of our Global scheme to destroy economies through education system

871
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:11,999
I'm stupid I added he already had it whilst redesign your pensions

872
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,279
Make that just one step

873
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:17,375
And if Wallstreet eyes your pension than then takes them

874
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,143
Like they did

875
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:20,447
Then it's a bad thing

876
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,983
Even if you think it's lasers

877
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,359
You're doing so good I like you

878
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,663
Whatever

879
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:32,223
I liked you earlier when I said this wasn't

880
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,503
To go to have a moto up here

881
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,039
You killing it

882
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:37,855
In his next clip we get to find out

883
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,391
Some of the inspirations

884
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,671
For Darrell hamamoto

885
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:43,743
Professor.

886
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:49,887
He wasn't ranting Alex did like a 3-minute commercial and then Isaiah

887
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:53,983
478 get back in the day

888
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:55,519
Questions

889
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,591
Credit First

890
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:02,687
Alex

891
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:08,575
Sedation

892
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:16,255
Wichita course

893
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,799
Or no

894
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,335
Oh no

895
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,895
Are you getting the picture of

896
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:35,455
I'm emoto's life is exactly what we thought

897
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:36,479
Yeah

898
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,015
He was really want to go to

899
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,551
Can we audit one of his lectures

900
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:45,951
We got to take a trip to go on and we can go to you are you kidding me

901
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:50,303
Proud of those lectures that students go to

902
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,143
You understand I mean what he's accidentally revealing

903
00:52:54,399 --> 00:53:00,543
He at one point was a normal human being and then he caught the brain virus of Alex Jones's globe

904
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:07,199
Yeah he already had tenure so they can't fire him scaled-back who's

905
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:22,559
Caitlin his class load your house within the bounds of tenure for someone who's

906
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:26,911
Clearly off the reservation talks about arguing with students

907
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:33,055
Gifting system teaching classes about Illuminati Theory and s*** like that

908
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:38,431
But I mean if you want to teach it from a like academic perspective

909
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:44,831
This is a real Olympic has

910
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:46,879
I want to go

911
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:52,767
How much fun is it is that should be in every University there should be one hidden lunatic.

912
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:53,791
Yeah

913
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:57,887
Missouri

914
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:00,191
Yeah of course

915
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:03,007
Crazy were talking about

916
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,895
He was a doctor

917
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:12,479
It was some like Wellington

918
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:15,807
Somebody named like that

919
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:16,575
The Greek history

920
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,599
Professor

921
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:18,623
F****** a******

922
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:20,159
Music kind of crazy

923
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,695
He was a kind of crazy who like

924
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:23,487
Expected everyone to do the reading

925
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:26,047
Not be grateful about calling

926
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,071
On people in class

927
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:29,887
And then he would clown on them when they hadn't done the reading

928
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:37,567
Crazy, Modo crazy

929
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,335
Crazy

930
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:46,015
Let's see there's a guy that this isn't the right kind of crazy either

931
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:50,623
But he only does classes on whether or not molmed

932
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:57,023
He is definitely

933
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:01,119
This guy named dr. Rowley

934
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:03,423
And archaeology

935
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,447
The professor

936
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,471
Class I took

937
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:09,567
The joke

938
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,663
I'm self cuz he was like 90 something barely talk

939
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:16,735
The entire class with me and the guy next to me being like

940
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,111
Everyone pass

941
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:24,415
Cuz the curve was a disaster

942
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,999
So it sounds like a mystery shows

943
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:34,655
How to get back on the show he knows how to get in Alex's good graces

944
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:42,847
Facetious

945
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:43,615
What the hell

946
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,407
Flickr

947
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:48,479
This is what happens immediately after

948
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,279
Conversation

949
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:06,655
Vitamin

950
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:12,287
Because

951
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:21,759
International Auto Glass

952
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,087
12

953
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:27,391
I mean

954
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:30,719
I don't know what's more troubling about that snake everything

955
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:33,023
Everything is troubling about that

956
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:37,375
B12 makes me feel great I take it before lectures

957
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,399
So I can be slick

958
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,423
Is Joel Osteen

959
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:43,263
He's being glib there

960
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,799
That's making fun of Joe

961
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:49,663
Our favorite glitterbug preacher which is a reference to Alex Jones

962
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:52,223
Insulting these are Prosperity Gospel

963
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:59,391
No I think I did

964
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,439
I think also there's a chance

965
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:06,559
Darrell hamamoto has some sort of a personality

966
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,631
Can you can't tell when you're being

967
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:11,167
Like possible

968
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,703
Tony voice almost never take

969
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:14,751
Guys always die

970
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:16,799
In the same motor

971
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,591
So I think you

972
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,151
When I read the text

973
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,687
IRead

974
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:26,783
Irony and sarcasm I could be wrong but that's what I say

975
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,063
You might be right

976
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:28,831
I might be right

977
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:29,599
Either way

978
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:32,671
F****** amazing

979
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:37,023
Weird tradition on every appearance

980
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,583
Like one one of the other ones we went over

981
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:45,983
He was like he's like a Alex I just want to tell you I just got your book

982
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:52,383
The making of a president

983
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:55,967
Pikachu

984
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,015
Great

985
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:01,087
Now probably yeah he has to be

986
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:03,903
Yeah if you're if you're popping up a book

987
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:09,535
You got to be a social media influencer type gig right there

988
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:13,631
Buzz Marketing another level

989
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:20,031
Just sort of understand where his bread is buttered and he's like I can get a lot of exposure from this that I couldn't get otherwise

990
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:22,079
If I pimp

991
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:25,151
Stuff for Alex I know that's what motivates him

992
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,687
That'll make him more likely

993
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:27,711
To promote me

994
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:34,111
Bright everything works out

995
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,135
Best of mangle

996
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:40,255
Hamamoto is got some

997
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,279
A little bit of

998
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:43,839
Complex

999
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:44,863
Going

1000
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:46,911
In this neck

1001
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:47,679
Flip

1002
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,727
Reference as a colleague of

1003
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:50,495
His

1004
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,567
I did

1005
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:54,335
A bit

1006
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:55,359
A research

1007
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,127
Listen to this

1008
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,199
I can't find any

1009
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,479
Look here's the deal

1010
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:05,599
He gives enough details that it sounds true if you're not okay

1011
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,647
So few details that it

1012
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,671
Possible to search for

1013
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:10,975
Further

1014
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:14,047
Is the ecology speaking of real

1015
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:15,583
I can't

1016
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,607
Say either way

1017
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:17,631
My gut

1018
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,399
Says no

1019
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,727
Ugh

1020
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:23,519
The story is about to tell is

1021
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,823
I got red flag

1022
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:26,591
Okay

1023
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,015
Viciousness

1024
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:36,063
University

1025
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,367
Worcester

1026
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,183
Practice with

1027
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:46,559
What do we do with the ideal

1028
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,031
So College

1029
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,055
Yep

1030
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:02,943
She was declared clinically dead I some kind of alone she still alive

1031
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:07,807
Because her healthcare costs are too high

1032
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:11,903
Here's where the cutoff

1033
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:15,231
Which I'm going to jail

1034
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:24,447
Insurance

1035
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,471
That's not how I heard

1036
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:29,567
I heard it as a better estimate

1037
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:33,151
Retaliation

1038
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,199
Do you think she race

1039
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,735
Healthcare prices

1040
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:40,831
Notre Dame had some sort of an accident

1041
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,367
Yeah

1042
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:44,671
Your your your theory makes the most sense

1043
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:47,743
Yeah I wouldn't what did you think was going on

1044
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:53,119
Your interpretation because mine is great

1045
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:59,775
I'm a big fan of him believing that they would declare a living woman clinically dead for a while right

1046
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,567
The cost of whatever

1047
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:03,359
Because that doesn't work that doesn't track

1048
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:11,295
I heard it

1049
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,575
She was making

1050
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:17,183
If University causing trouble until they declared her dead

1051
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:26,655
Kind of makes it sound being harassed and all this stuff and it seems like

1052
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:30,495
Did declaring her dad your dad now

1053
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:49,695
You out of health care for you either what does he tell them

1054
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:50,975
No

1055
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:57,375
Weather

1056
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,911
Illegally

1057
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:05,311
She wrote a great paper that if you email him he'll give you the name of

1058
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:08,639
But I'm what I'm saying is like things

1059
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,407
Or like

1060
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:11,199
Enough details belt

1061
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:12,735
Couldn't

1062
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:13,759
Make all that up

1063
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:17,087
Anyone

1064
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:17,855
To confirm

1065
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,391
This person's existence

1066
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:25,023
Bright at this point legally

1067
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:26,303
So Automotive

1068
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,095
In his next clip

1069
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:30,143
Omoto has a fever

1070
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:32,959
How would they even have that power

1071
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:33,983
They don't

1072
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:38,335
In what situation could the university be like

1073
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,103
Okay wait

1074
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,383
Her bills are what

1075
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:47,295
Just declared your dad now

1076
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:56,511
Tricked out

1077
01:02:56,767 --> 01:03:00,863
Two guys use Social Security numbers no

1078
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:02,911
This guy

1079
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:03,679
As a lot of theory

1080
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:07,519
A little song

1081
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,311
But the reason why

1082
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,591
My students

1083
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:14,943
ResCare

1084
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:20,575
Earlier conversation with you

1085
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,983
Theoretical

1086
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,519
Gostream

1087
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:50,783
Enterprise

1088
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:55,135
Have an alternative Theory to the siop theory

1089
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:58,719
Eveni Enterprises

1090
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,255
Ever

1091
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:03,839
Put forward to defend

1092
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:07,935
I think the 1970 series

1093
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:14,335
2014

1094
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:16,639
People dropping out of humanities classes

1095
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:23,039
In droves I would imagine that hamamoto sees a lot of people dropping out of his Humanity

1096
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:30,719
And that is a chaotic element to have like giving you grief

1097
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:36,351
Like

1098
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,887
F****** Fantasyland class

1099
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:44,287
Little wasted money but it was worth it

1100
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:46,591
I have another alternative Theory

1101
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:49,151
It's not just based on his subjective experience

1102
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:51,455
And that is the humanities path

1103
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:53,247
Generally does not leave

1104
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,527
Good salary job

1105
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,063
Not in Mike's

1106
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:58,111
Most of the humanities leads

1107
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,927
To akademia or social work

1108
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:03,743
Who are those sorts of things from home

1109
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:08,351
Absolutely

1110
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:12,191
Let's say

1111
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,471
Ryan study class

1112
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:19,359
Like just asking which classical world

1113
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:24,223
Literature even any of those

1114
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:27,039
The real path that you can go down and become a

1115
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:30,367
That's essentially what you can use that degree for

1116
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:32,159
Like I have one of my

1117
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:32,927
Majors

1118
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:35,487
Minor but I took a lot more than

1119
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:38,047
Who cares took a lot of classes in Greece

1120
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:41,119
And if I were to go to grad school I'll probably take more

1121
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:45,471
I'm the only person that would help you run an auto dealership

1122
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:51,871
Absolutely teacher somewhere

1123
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:59,039
It's Jake. It's just people in a bad economy or an economy what debts

1124
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,831
Values people with

1125
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:06,975
Our type of education so little specialized degrees much

1126
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:09,791
People go to those who learned that when you're in college

1127
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:11,583
And that leads you to go away from

1128
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,887
Your motivation is money

1129
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:17,727
So is probably a more sensible

1130
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,007
New job market

1131
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:20,543
I'm here in Pueblo

1132
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:21,823
We

1133
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:22,591
Tutor

1134
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,383
Chemical engineers

1135
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:27,199
Stem field like just all stem field okay

1136
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:27,967
Alright

1137
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:32,831
Kind of going into random stem field people

1138
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:33,599
Homes

1139
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:35,391
Just teach them just AFK

1140
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:36,159
Chat like that

1141
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:40,767
That way we'll never have a theory care of the 1970s again

1142
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:45,119
Bringing these f****** French people over here

1143
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,911
I don't know why you got to dig in at the front

1144
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:50,495
Like this guy f****** overhead most of them

1145
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:52,031
French

1146
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,567
Conspiracy theory

1147
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,383
So at this point Alex is like

1148
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,407
Hamamoto.

1149
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,967
I got to come with some

1150
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:04,831
I can't just let this guy run Circles of crazy around

1151
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,367
Whole Foods

1152
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,903
The magazine

1153
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,719
It's so cool

1154
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:13,279
Meanwhile Obama's Fire On Air Force One

1155
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,007
It's not good

1156
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,287
Has a new dark

1157
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:25,823
To stop the

1158
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,407
So here's what's interesting

1159
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,455
I know that it's

1160
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,479
Tired for us

1161
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:35,807
To play him talkin about that Obama

1162
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:36,831
Air conditioner

1163
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:37,855
I'm flying in on a plane

1164
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:41,695
The reason that I kept it in this time is because

1165
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,975
What key was saying

1166
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:47,071
It literally what Alex has why don't you say

1167
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:52,191
But he's is why don't you say you could have clean cars and clean air conditioning

1168
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:54,751
And the point that Obama was making was

1169
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,287
We can't

1170
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:57,567
Modernize

1171
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,383
The entire world the same way we have modernized

1172
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,151
The world

1173
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,431
The first world we have now

1174
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:06,271
We made a lot of mistakes on the way we have to be smarter about the technology

1175
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,039
That we used

1176
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,831
Or else the world is going to boil over

1177
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:09,855
I do

1178
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:12,159
It's particularly offensive for me

1179
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:12,927
When Alex

1180
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,207
Uses

1181
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:17,791
This narrative to make a stab at Barack Obama

1182
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:22,911
Then give a white of me and says exactly what Obama was saying

1183
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,959
I think that does get into something

1184
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,727
Thing that is true

1185
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,263
What's that

1186
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:29,311
One of the biggest problem

1187
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:31,103
Alex has with Obama

1188
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:32,383
Is

1189
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,687
He just doesn't talk like me

1190
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:35,967
Sure doesn't look like

1191
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:44,671
Necessarily think it's not either I think it is smart exactly I think there's this huge anti

1192
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,463
Intellectual

1193
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:49,023
Coincides with being on the right

1194
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,583
Why you have a professor like hamamoto

1195
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:54,655
There's a lot of really smart professors

1196
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:55,679
Hate smart

1197
01:08:55,935 --> 01:09:02,079
Experts

1198
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:02,847
Common sense

1199
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,407
Dude you guys are so smart but you don't have

1200
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:07,455
Common sense you don't know how to solve this budget

1201
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:09,503
Sure you know your math

1202
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:11,295
And you're gay instruments

1203
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:13,087
What learning stuff is

1204
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:13,855
Hard

1205
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:15,903
That's why

1206
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:17,183
People like

1207
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:20,511
I generally think that the sentiment of intellectual

1208
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,583
That it runs rampant around this year

1209
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:24,351
Country of ours

1210
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:28,191
It mostly comes from people that are abused

1211
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:31,263
In their own head of the with the idea

1212
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:34,079
That smart people are smart people in dumb people are dumb

1213
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,687
It's just an eight

1214
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:39,967
You guys are the f******

1215
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:46,111
Stupid you think you're better than us cuz you were born smart or something like that part is what

1216
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:49,951
I'm kind of stuck on people don't they never come out and say

1217
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,559
Intelligence

1218
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,327
I mean

1219
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:57,887
You can make it nature-nurture

1220
01:09:59,167 --> 01:09:59,935
The biggest

1221
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,215
Piece of it is learning

1222
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,751
The biggest piece of it is

1223
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:04,543
Hard work and reading stuff

1224
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:11,199
Able learning experience in these people know we're going to have to refer you back to the four ways to learn

1225
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:14,015
Episodes memory

1226
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:17,343
That is how you lie was the other one I know that the best way to learn

1227
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,111
Is to learn

1228
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:21,439
That's true I do know that

1229
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:22,975
So at this point

1230
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:23,999
Alex is like

1231
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:24,767
Colorado

1232
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:25,535
You got to talk

1233
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:28,095
We got to take some calls

1234
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,399
Alright

1235
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,703
This does not go with

1236
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:34,239
Doesn't go well

1237
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,031
Here's why

1238
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,055
Here's the color

1239
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:43,199
How you doing

1240
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:49,855
That was

1241
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:55,231
Great work right there you played just enough and then you real quick turn to the get ready

1242
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:59,839
For you to not have an expectation that this is going to be fun okay this is going to be

1243
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:01,375
Pretty sexy.

1244
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:08,799
I just want to say real quick that I'm in the middle of changing my life

1245
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:10,335
Question

1246
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:13,407
Athena

1247
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,687
Powder

1248
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:15,455
My job

1249
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,991
816

1250
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,271
820

1251
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,391
We can't give phone numbers out on Air Bud

1252
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,695
Can somebody can call me

1253
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:26,719
With somebody else

1254
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:30,815
We can't get up

1255
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:32,095
Phone number

1256
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:43,103
Sorry about that

1257
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:48,223
In the season of a

1258
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:51,039
Illinois they're saying you

1259
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:59,231
I'm get ready for your big dude I'm a very good person I'm just wondering how I can

1260
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:00,255
I pray to God

1261
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:07,679
Email

1262
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:10,751
Nissan

1263
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,079
Collapses

1264
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:16,383
Kicked off

1265
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:19,455
First things first unemployment

1266
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,247
Is unemployment insurance

1267
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:22,783
Pay for bikes hacks

1268
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:26,367
Second Alex absolutely hung up on me

1269
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:27,647
Yeah

1270
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:28,671
Undoubtedly

1271
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:32,511
You think so I didn't hang up you was in the middle of a sentence

1272
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:34,303
Cut it off with his

1273
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:37,887
General we're done with this kind of language

1274
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:44,287
And then he's like what's your email

1275
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:48,383
Maybe the call screener did it

1276
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:54,783
I would say probably more likely

1277
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:56,319
Real City

1278
01:12:56,575 --> 01:13:01,951
There's still traffic and I understand that

1279
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:02,975
PS button

1280
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:04,767
Yeah probably

1281
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:06,559
Hard-and-fast like

1282
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,607
I bet he has a dump button

1283
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:11,423
At least the people behind the board No Lie

1284
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,447
Someone starts

1285
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:15,775
Cuz there was actually I found an episode

1286
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:18,335
Steel was on me like

1287
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:20,127
Right

1288
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:24,991
We are on radio

1289
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:34,719
Yeah he lied about buying the DNA force in order.

1290
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:36,767
He might have recently

1291
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:39,327
Yeah but essentially what he was doing is

1292
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:43,167
I'm going to give you this so you can give me this

1293
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:48,543
Yeah you can give me the opportunity to put my name out there number and maybe job

1294
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:51,615
Evicted from my house

1295
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:53,663
Hangs up on ya

1296
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:55,199
Thrill City and then he's like

1297
01:13:55,455 --> 01:14:01,343
Score points with talking about how like to be losing their unemployment

1298
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:08,255
Program program program that you hate so very very much

1299
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:14,655
That stuff everybody hates Medicare until their own Medicare

1300
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:21,311
Oh my God I'm sick and I've lost my job

1301
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:24,383
Coach was on Fox News

1302
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:30,783
I've been on welfare I've been on Unemployment and those are bad programs because they saved my life like

1303
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:32,831
He just he just pulled Craig T Nelson

1304
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:36,927
If you were talking about coach

1305
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:37,951
Coach

1306
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,487
Or if you have a coach

1307
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:40,511
There's only one coach

1308
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:45,631
Okay I was Only We Know

1309
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:47,167
One coach

1310
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:48,703
One through couch

1311
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,983
All praise

1312
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:51,775
Call did not go well

1313
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:57,663
This is not what you want but not photos in studio

1314
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:58,943
Bumper collar

1315
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,479
But

1316
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,271
Guess what we had something

1317
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,039
To pick us up

It's not out of the blue

1331
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:01,919
There's no scandals

1332
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:02,943

This shortest Google search

1344
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:34,175
We'll turn up at least

1345
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:35,711
Ham instances

1346
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:42,111
Of him being totaled Xtube Auntie performs with

He's notorious

1350
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:46,975
Bush People

1351
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:47,743
What's people say

1352
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:50,303
Billy Corgan affected them through their music

1353
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:51,071
Help them

1354
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:53,119
Kind of grow that way and Alex is like

1355
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:59,519
Shity musician but let me tell you about this guy chemtrail f****** made me mature quite a bit

1356
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:02,335
Vaccination

1357
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,503
Airbnb.com

1358
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:12,831
Cooper from the CIA put

1359
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:14,623
About him

1360
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:15,391
A coops

1361
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:21,023
I don't know I don't know how to just I don't know how to

1362
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:22,303
I don't I don't know how to get in

1363
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:23,583
Just get into it

1364
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:26,399
Baby so Cooper had a segment

1365
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:29,983
On his

1366
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:30,751
4360

1367
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:32,031
Around this time

1368
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:33,567
That was called the ridiculous

1369
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,127
Salad pun

1370
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,919
I'm going to be where do I say

1371
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:40,479
It's the local TV level hacker

1372
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:44,063
You know it's just filler

1373
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:50,463
Subway comedy peace within is actually

1374
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,231
Really funny

1375
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:54,815
I've heard him on radio shows like him

1376
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:58,911
Like he's been on E back in the day he was on Loveline a couple times

1377
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:02,239
A couple of like clips of him

1378
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:03,775
On Howard Stern

1379
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:05,823
I need a super personable

1380
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:08,127
Comfortable in his own skin

1381
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:08,895
Present

1382
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:09,663
Funny guy

1383
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:12,735
And this is not

1384
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:16,831
It's not great you know it's definitely not great

1385
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:19,391
Producer wasn't him

1386
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:21,695
Where did he come up with Stephen

1387
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,463
Kind of shity

1388
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:24,255
No I just I think it's

1389
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,815
I think we are comedians

1390
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:28,351
And when you're looking for a premise

1391
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:30,143
You should try a little harder

1392
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:35,775
What happened what happened was there was an issue Chicago

1393
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:40,127
Which pauses the no-kill shelter Chicago

1394
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:42,943
And Billy Corgan did a cover of the magazine

1395
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,991
A couple of cats

1396
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,783
Headline

1397
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:47,807
Siamese Dream

1398
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:54,463
Cover of Madden and so

1399
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:57,791
Around the same time commercial for a furniture store

1400
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:58,559
In Chicago

1401
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:00,095
And

1402
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:01,375
The point of Anderson

1403
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,399
Cooper's piece

1404
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:07,519
It's difficult to wrestle

1405
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:10,591
Difficult to wrestle with the idea of

1406
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:11,615
Musician

1407
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,639
Getting older

1408
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:16,479
Little little

1409
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:19,039
He presented a little bit like

1410
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:21,855
You know it's sad that he's doing these

1411
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:24,415
Ice Cube family

1412
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:27,743
That's because the reality is

1413
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:31,327
Billy Corgan do that cover for charity

1414
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,863
There was like a charity piece

1415
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:34,399
Attached

1416
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:35,167
Hey Porter

1417
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:39,775
Taking that money home supporter of the pause

1418
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:41,311
No kill shelter

1419
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:42,847
Positive

1420
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:47,967
But the other place to get ice cube to do something other piece of it too though is that furniture commercial that's

1421
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:49,247
Isabel that way

1422
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:51,295
It is

1423
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:52,063
Out of

1424
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:53,087
Character

1425
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,367
You know like a

1426
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:57,951
Beyond the saying you're washed up and it's a money thing

1427
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:04,095
It's also like you are avant-garde you were someone who when I was younger I thought was

1428
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:05,887
Really creative and Rakim

1429
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:06,655
Snoop Dogg

1430
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:08,959
Game show and the cover is weird

1431
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:09,983
It looks

1432
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,007
Really weird

1433
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,031
If you look it up

1434
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:14,592
It's multiple on its own

1435
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:16,640
You should have taken another shot Billy

1436
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:22,016
Play you the end of this Anderson Cooper

1437
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:25,344
You'll hear that he takes the piss out of himself

1438
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,368
At the end to

1439
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:29,696
The internet is a real problem

1440
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:34,816
There was a time that nobody outside of Chicago would have ever seen the cover of Paula Chicago magazine

1441
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:38,656
But nowadays you can't even pose for the cover of WebMD Magazine

1442
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:42,496
Wait a minute cover of WebMD

1443
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:43,776
Okay luck

1444
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:44,800
For the record

1445
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:51,200
I have no memory of posing for the cover Web MD with the apparently I did I gave an interview I don't know what I was doing

1446
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:54,272
Anyway

1447
01:20:54,784 --> 01:21:00,928
Stupid like a little bit

1448
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:07,328
It's not great but it's

1449
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:08,352
There is

1450
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:11,168
There is an element of a where he's like

1451
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:12,192
I do it

1452
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:18,848
Yeah I N whatever really being

1453
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:25,248
I need to fill human-interest cuz I hate

1454
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,016
Respect you

1455
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:29,344
Because hey we all do dumb s***

1456
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,136
The softest of hit

1457
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:32,416
Possible

1458
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:34,464
And oh boy

1459
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:37,536
Almost the entire interview with Alex

1460
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,936
Course

1461
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:52,128
Alright alright so if I understand the timeline correct

1462
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:53,920
Anderson Cooper

1463
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:55,968
Makes bad joke at Billy Corgan

1464
01:21:57,248 --> 01:22:00,576
Billy Corgan goes on Infowars

1465
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:07,232
Not realizing how much sadder that is then being on the cover of pause magazine I propose a solution

1466
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,560
Do this with Billy Corgan

1467
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:17,216
Shut the fuk up no I wish I could have told them about the charity

1468
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:23,872
Whatever

1469
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,736
He's not like

1470
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:31,808
Mad

1471
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:34,112
The first one

1472
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:35,136
Alright

1473
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:39,744
Anderson Cooper

1474
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:45,120
But

1475
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:47,168
Torture report

1476
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:54,080
Almost like your publicist is encouraging that sort of thing

1477
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:59,456
Maybe your publicist to copy of this cupboard

1478
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:12,768
No kill shelter

1479
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,048
Very proud

1480
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,168
Hours for the charity

1481
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:25,568
And I

1482
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,432
Magazine

1483
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,296
Equator

1484
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:36,576
Where I am

1485
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:50,144
Where is he

1486
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:05,248
Restrain

1487
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:13,952
Between your legs

1488
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,304
Be a grown up about it you know

1489
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:23,424
Request for correction even not too far

1490
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:28,288
Off the mature pack

1491
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:29,568
To be somewhat convincing

1492
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,872
No rockstar

1493
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:38,272
And he's an aging Rockstar and he's not aging the way that the Rolling Stones

1494
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:39,552
Successful you get

1495
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:45,440
You're always going to feel better about not being more because he's

1496
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:48,256
He's that is the way that Cooper pulled up

1497
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:54,144
He's lived like 15-20 years 25 years pissed off that he's not Nirvana

1498
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:56,704
Is his existence

1499
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,264
And because of that there is probably in a

1500
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:00,288
Complex

1501
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,616
Everybody in the Infowars

1502
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:09,504
Universe does that he's being held down and it is greatness isn't being recognized

1503
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:18,976
I want to know I don't know I'll call it

1504
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:27,936
Booker on that

1505
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:29,984
Email

1506
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:37,152
It look here's as far as I'm willing to go with you on this

1507
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:39,968
I'm willing to agree that he has a good

1508
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:43,296
It was misrepresented

1509
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:45,088
Yes don't believe Super Bowl

1510
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:47,904
If you are an adult looking at that

1511
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:52,256
Your best play is to not get mad about it

1512
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:53,536
And to be like

1513
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:57,376
It's a human interest piece

1514
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:58,912
They Conover

1515
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:04,544
As an adult promoting your next album

1516
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:14,272
A f****** s*** for maybe realize that you have another out map because

1517
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:23,744
What is the first time I've ever said that

1518
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,304
Talk more about it

1519
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:28,864
Is no bad right now

1520
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:35,776
You put a story on your

1521
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:39,616
I wonder if that's why it went viral

1522
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:49,600
Play the game

1523
01:26:55,488 --> 01:27:00,608
It's interesting actually pawschicago is this really great no kill shelter and I was

1524
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:07,008
Doing it to support misunderstands I understand maybe I didn't do a good enough job of explaining that when my age

1525
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:13,408
Maybe they could have done a better job for immediate-release Billy

1526
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:18,016
Morgan does cover for charity instead of Billy Corgan does very weird looking pictures

1527
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:21,344
This is all

1528
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,880
I'm telling it okay

1529
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:24,928
What if it were Kanye

1530
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:30,816
Kanye gets

1531
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:34,656
Get the same result from Anderson Cooper on CNN

1532
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:38,496
Then Kanye goes on Fox News and goes on he likes

1533
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:39,776
F*** this guy

1534
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:41,312
I'm still on Kanye's side

1535
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:52,832
Information

1536
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:53,600
Krowd

1537
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:55,648
But again

1538
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:07,680
Billy Corgan left on their side of himself is like all these low-information

1539
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:14,080
People who only go off headlines

1540
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:18,944
That's what this whole episode is about

1541
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:23,552
I agree with you that he did for charity

1542
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:26,624
F****** a****** anyway

1543
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,928
You're you're biased against assholes

1544
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:31,744
Most of my friends are assholes

1545
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:36,096
Let's talk more about

1546
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:36,864
Uber

1547
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:43,008
Really is he really dead

1548
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:45,568
Kirilli Groove

1549
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:49,408
Of one of the biggest

1550
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:51,200
Nope

1551
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:55,040
He's a little Richie

1552
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:02,208
This this is this failure

1553
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:08,608
Everything

1554
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:22,176
Personal stuff

1555
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:25,504
Except for this example of the other day when I got into the personal stuff

1556
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:31,648
Very interesting

1557
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:37,024
Whatever that crowded

1558
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,072
I mean I love you

1559
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:42,144
Really

1560
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,264
Realizes

1561
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:51,360
I don't understand it

1562
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:10,304
Sounds a lot like Alex

1563
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:13,120
Okay

1564
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:14,400
So

1565
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:16,192
I understand that correctly

1566
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:18,240
Play gotcha

1567
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:24,640
CNN piece about me I'm going to be all angry about it making me

1568
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:26,176
Act like a c-list celebrity

1569
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:30,784
Instead of saying that I'm doing a great thing for charity album

1570
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:35,136
There's a Great Awakening coming

1571
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:41,536
The only other thing about other than Anderson Cooper

1572
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:42,560
But everyone's asleep

1573
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:49,216
Zombies all around

1574
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:52,288
Billy Corgan did come from humble beginnings

1575
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:57,664
Paid for his first show as well.

1576
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,200
Apple Dental practice

1577
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:00,480
Tons of property

1578
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:02,528
Oh really

1579
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:09,184
Wait till this next clip plays but

1580
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:11,232
About Anderson Cooper that I

1581
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:12,512
Alex is probably not

1582
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:13,792
Willing to deal with

1583
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,608
How could you not be eyes open

1584
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,936
Vanderbilt

1585
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:21,216
Vanderbilt

1586
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:26,848
Nothing wrong

1587
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:32,480
I wanted the biggest robber baron

1588
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:34,272
Give us a break

1589
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:35,808
And Cooper

1590
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:37,088
Personality

1591
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:39,904
Toledo

1592
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:46,048
Everybody knows

1593
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:47,584
Are all along

1594
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:50,144
Even great Bel-Air Bel-Air you're the best

1595
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,168
You're the best

1596
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:53,216
Have you tried this

1597
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:54,496
B12

1598
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:55,520
That I'm getting out of here

1599
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:56,544
Billy

1600
01:31:57,056 --> 01:32:01,408
Let me tell you something dr. hamamoto it comes Dexter hamamoto recommended

1601
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:02,688
If you want

1602
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:04,224
To get the morgue a instrument

1603
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:06,528
In your Smashing Pumpkins band

1604
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:09,856
Come on down to hamamoto gay instruments

1605
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:11,904
So

1606
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:14,720
Cooper's mom Gloria is Evander

1607
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:16,768
The Vanderbilts

1608
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:22,912
He's not the last male Heir in the

1609
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:25,472
He's been very clear in interview

1610
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:29,312
Throughout the entirety of his career that he was very young age

1611
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:31,872
But he was disinherited from the families

1612
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:34,176
Well that there was no trust fund

1613
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:34,944
On for him

1614
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:36,480
He's interpreted as

1615
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:40,320
If I knew that there was a trust fund I would have never tried to

1616
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:43,136
Succeed I don't know a lot of people who have

1617
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:45,696
Billions are millions of dollars waiting for them

1618
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:47,488
Is it have a drive to

1619
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:49,792
Disinherited

1620
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,840
Yeah but I had no inheritance

1621
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:55,680
Actual

1622
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:57,216
Real likelihood

1623
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:58,752
Is that there is no

1624
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:05,152
His mom did the equivalent of 33 million-dollar

1625
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:06,176
Not just

1626
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:08,992
Translation $3000000 now

1627
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:10,528
In 19

1628
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:11,296
25

1629
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,088
That's a long f******

1630
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:16,928
His mom is old how old is How old is

1631
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,208
Anderson Cooper

1632
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:19,744
He's probably 50

1633
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:22,304
He looks

1634
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,608
You looks great

1635
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:34,592
I just I like Anderson Cooper I don't get it I get it

1636
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:36,640
Against Billy Corgan

1637
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:37,408
I don't think

1638
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:43,808
Celebrity situation they were running into.

1639
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:47,392
Billy Corgan

1640
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,096
Look the issue is I'm telling you that I I think

1641
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:57,632
But it's correct

1642
01:33:57,888 --> 01:33:58,656
Not right

1643
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:05,056
Too clearly bring up that it is a parity thing that he did also also in 2009

1644
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:06,080
Gordon

1645
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:07,616
Randolph be the right

1646
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:13,760
Someone paid $6,000 to get lunch with him but had to pick up the tab

1647
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:17,344
Total assholes

1648
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:22,464
Price of the mail along with your charity

1649
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:28,864
Thousand dollars and I would say probably like $142 worth of McDonough

1650
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:36,288
225 and family wrangling over the trust eventually accelerated her

1651
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:37,056
Control

1652
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:38,080
Slightly bigger share

1653
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:39,872
A lifetime of artistic and business

1654
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:41,152
Pursuits presumably help

1655
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:42,432
Independent cash flow

1656
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:45,248
Distributions long ago

1657
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:47,808
9 decades is a long time for a traditional Trust

1658
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:50,368
People of modern on that the trust

1659
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:51,904
Was actually empty by the 19th

1660
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:54,464
It's unclear how much money is

1661
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,488
Designer jeans

1662
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,816
Perfume line that you put out actually made her

1663
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:00,864
By the time the perfume came out

1664
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,144
He was already fighting

1665
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,192
Her Partners over a relatively insignificant

1666
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:04,960
Forget 1.3

1667
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:05,728
3 million-dollar

1668
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:08,544
A few years later a Manhattan Court ruled

1669
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:13,664
Better lawyer in psychiatrist had colluded to misappropriate a whopping 1.4 million dollars from work

1670
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:16,992
In the meantime the IRS seize and liquidated her assets

1671
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:19,296
To pay 2.5 million dollars

1672
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,112
So there's a lot

1673
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:26,464
So Anderson Cooper

1674
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,744
Inherited wealth

1675
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,792
Is dad by the 4th generation

1676
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:35,680
Along those lines so many people that are that are in on it

1677
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:38,496
The guy who made all the money generally speaking

1678
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:39,520
It comes from a different

1679
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:41,568
Replacing if you're born into wealth generally

1680
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:44,128
Not going to

1681
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:48,480
Be very good with money there's a really good chance Cooper was a child

1682
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:50,528
His parents told him

1683
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:57,184
He's disinherited and there is no inheritance waiting for him and he interpreted it as a way to stiffen him up and make him more

1684
01:35:57,696 --> 01:36:02,816
Thirsty for life or whatever but the reality is that there was no money there or there's a little bit of money

1685
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:05,120
Make a couple million

1686
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:05,888
They had

1687
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:07,168
A lot of property

1688
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:09,216
Anywhere in with social classes

1689
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:13,824
There was the appearance of royalty your luxury lifestyle

1690
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:16,128
When they were really just probably

1691
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:19,712
Pretty upper-middle-class lower upper class

1692
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:22,016
Or whatever like

1693
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:23,808
Old-money the car

1694
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:24,832
Carnegie's

1695
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:30,464
Yeah of older women

1696
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:34,048
He's just trying to stoke up sort of like class anger that he doesn't

1697
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:35,072
Deserve to play with

1698
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:36,096
Cuz

1699
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:37,120
Alex

1700
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:39,680
You probably have more money than

1701
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:44,544
Yeah I know they probably started out at a relatively similar monetary position

1702
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:47,616
Right it's just the image of the Vanderbilts

1703
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:50,432
Right comes with so much loaded baggage

1704
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:51,200
For Alex City

1705
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:57,856
Hi Alex. Come from royalty

1706
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:00,416
Confederate oil

1707
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:06,560
It is next clip Billy Corgan wow he's been railing

1708
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:07,328
This entire time

1709
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:10,912
Anderson Cooper has called him a washed-up celebrity

1710
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:12,448
On this side

1711
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:13,728
Puff piece

1712
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:17,312
Human-interest nonsense missed comedy

1713
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:19,360
Segment

1714
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:20,384
Thinking this club

1715
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:22,432
If you listen closely Billy Corgan

1716
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:24,736
Kind of says that his career is not going

1717
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:29,344
We have to remember those of us that are awake

1718
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:33,952
Screw

1719
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:34,976
I do

1720
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:44,960
And I

1721
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:45,728
Elrond

1722
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:53,152
We just don't know what to do

1723
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:56,480
And I

1724
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:01,856
Everybody

1725
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:15,168
Here I come

1726
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:24,128
He did it

1727
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:30,016
What he did it I wrote down the moment he started talking about all that stuff

1728
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:32,064
I wrote down go to an ad pivot

1729
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:35,648
Just like Alex Jones he just nailed the Alex Jones

1730
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:42,048
That's why I'm dangerous that's what I'm doing so career going once

1731
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:51,520
He listen to Alex Jones he's got his

1732
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:03,552
Talk about buying it

1733
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:07,136
First of all I'm getting very impressed with your ability to pick out these like

1734
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:13,792
Subtle versions of the active you have hit me with so many ads and area 1

1735
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:20,192
Starting to become a connoisseur the education

1736
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:21,472
Show you the way

1737
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:23,520
Look through Alex's bulshit

1738
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:31,200
Tanner class at the University of Missouri you know what how to go to an ad pivot

1739
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:32,736
He did it

1740
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:34,016
I thought what you were saying

1741
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:34,784
And I was going

1742
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:35,808
Dumbledore

1743
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:36,576
Was that

1744
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,136
Think he gave away that he

1745
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:40,160
Probably planted

1746
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:41,184
Did the story about pot

1747
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:44,256
Because when he says in there

1748
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:49,376
My career gets going in the right direction again

1749
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,448
This blustery nonsense about like

1750
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:55,520
Oh you saying that I washed up my career is not going

1751
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:59,616
In the right direction

1752
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:01,664
It's because not enough people are awake

1753
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:06,272
Not enough people know they got a red pill it and get rid of this CNN

1754
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:08,832
Anderson Cooper Vanderbilt bulshit

1755
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:10,112
And start listening

1756
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:13,440
To the new Smashing Pumpkins album out in 2 weeks

1757
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:17,792
One of the most grandiose and nonsensical plugs for Billy corgan's album

1758
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:21,632
You people go out

1759
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:23,168

Play it for free

Billboard

1766
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:37,504
Tell

1767
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:38,528
The system down

1768
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:39,552
You've got to go

1769
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:40,320
Further

1770
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:44,416
And decide you want to promote cultures of Liberty

1771
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:46,976
How many kings

1772
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:49,536
Down by

1773
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:53,120
We came

1774
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:57,728
By the

1775
01:40:57,984 --> 01:40:58,752
Local band

1776
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:00,544
Guy with his

1777
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:04,896
Is little

1778
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:06,432
Singing songs about the

1779
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:07,456
Corrupt

1780
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:11,040
Organized

1781
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:12,576
Didn't use it in the hands of the

1782
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:14,368
System

1783
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:17,696
6's matric

1784
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:23,072
How do you get rid of oppressive regimes Dan

1785
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:24,864
Well I know this

1786
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:26,400
This machine kills fascists

1787
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:27,168
That is it

1788
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:28,960
Exactly what he's doing right there

1789
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:34,336
You don't you don't go out and do any activism which

1790
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:40,736
To do you wait for somebody to write a song and you buy by the stuff that I promote

1791
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:48,672
I know that you're a student of history as well

1792
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:49,952
Yeah that's not how it works

1793
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:56,352
Do you know of any kings that were brought down by Jesters or song or is that just an archetype vitar

1794
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:58,656
Tell the song

1795
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:00,960
Henry the 8th

1796
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:04,800
Haha

1797
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:05,824
The Great

1798
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:08,896
All right right

1799
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:12,480
Exactly

1800
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:14,528
Let's see

1801
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:15,296
No

1802
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:16,320
Panthers no

1803
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:18,112
Dixie's did

1804
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:25,024
Where's our new protest music new protest

1805
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:30,400
Even gets into that a little bit

1806
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:37,056
Yeah but anyway hip-hop assholes Sono Alex

1807
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:39,872
It's weird because there's already talking about

1808
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:41,920
Potency of Song and all that stuff

1809
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:44,992
Next clip Alex reveal something

1810
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:45,760
Real weird

1811
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:49,600
Facebook

1812
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:53,440
Because he has a lot of Courage

1813
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,424
Classified

1814
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:10,848
I'm just going to stop

1815
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:20,320
Really want on and then what happened

1816
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:33,888
What aren't you telling people

1817
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:35,680
You told people everything

1818
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:40,544
Tell you what I know but here there is all of it

1819
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:47,712
Do people believe that

1820
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:48,480
Alex Mae

1821
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:52,576
People believe that the FBI in the CIA

1822
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:56,160
Traditionally do

1823
01:43:56,672 --> 01:44:01,536
I mean if you're awake

1824
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:11,520
Hotel

1825
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:17,920
It would have been funnier

1826
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:22,528
I don't know that was all part of the cover-up and they killed him back in Liverpool

1827
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:25,856
With nine people believe that Paul McCartney

1828
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:27,648
You still alive food made it takes all kind

1829
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:30,464
It's weird that

1830
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:32,256
Anyway this next place

1831
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:33,280
Glipizide

1832
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:34,304
I got it okay

1833
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:35,584
This makes represent fortunate

1834
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:40,192
About how

1835
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:44,032
I remember how they got onto the

1836
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:44,800
This topic

1837
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:45,568
Borden

1838
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:51,968
Almost all local news

1839
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:53,760
Pharrell ardc

1840
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:56,832
You tell them local story

1841
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:06,304
Cancel somewhere

1842
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:07,840
You know there's not a lot of

1843
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:22,432
Your listeners know I don't know what even losing to the liver is no local news when you're watching your love

1844
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:23,200
Local news

1845
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:24,992
Whatever it is

1846
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:26,784
There's a good chance

1847
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:28,320
That

1848
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:29,856
They don't know what the

1849
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:30,624
The story actual

1850
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:35,744
It's only from New York or La they are broadcasting teleprompters

1851
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:40,096
So the people sitting around at the desk girl reading for the first time

1852
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:41,376
Local news

1853
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:43,168
Well there's what I mean that's

1854
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:47,008
That's nonsense but at the same time I want to say one thing really quick before I dive in

1855
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:48,544
Going to be damning

1856
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:51,616
The man in the High Castle wasn't it

1857
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:53,664
Philip a dick fan

1858
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:57,248
Don't don't do that is your metaphor I know you visually think it makes sense

1859
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:02,624
If I was gone

1860
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:09,024
That's what don't you remember catching the riots about a dude catching all that f****** ride

1861
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:13,376
Conception of what is going on with local news

1862
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:17,472
Is sort of spiritually correct but it's not correct in the way

1863
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:23,872
Conceives of it Broadcasting

1864
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:25,664
Completing to Italian

1865
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:27,968
Control over all local news everywhere enforcement

1866
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:29,504
People to run their propaganda

1867
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:35,648
That's bad if you look at that what's happened

1868
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:36,672
Sinclair

1869
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:40,768
Since Trump got into office a lot of good things strangely enough

1870
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:41,536
It seems like

1871
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:43,072
They're coming out as a

1872
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:47,168
Winter Monday morning this is Becca and I believe March

1873
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:48,192
Of this

1874
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:49,984
Yes let's go

1875
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:52,544
There's an article from

1876
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:54,848
Just aggregate

1877
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:56,384
Replaces

1878
01:46:56,896 --> 01:46:57,408
The fairness and

1879
01:46:58,176 --> 01:46:58,688
Recordings

1880
01:46:58,944 --> 01:46:59,456
Organization

1881
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:01,504
Monday morning Sinclair broadcast group

1882
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:04,320
The conservative media Behemoth that owns more local news stations

1883
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:05,344
Any other company in

1884
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,112
In the country

1885
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:07,392
Just got even bigger

1886
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:12,256
8.9 billion dollars creating with Bloomberg

1887
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:13,280
Play TV Goliath

1888
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:16,608
The purchase which Sinclair

1889
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:18,144
The nearly 69

1890
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:20,192
Now

1891
01:47:20,448 --> 01:47:21,728
What's the u.s. population

1892
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:26,592
Violation of ownership restrictions

1893
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:29,920
But last month

1894
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:31,456
Pi

1895
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:36,064
Updated

1896
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,600
Conglomerates to exceed the nation

1897
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:39,904
39% cap on ownership

1898
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:40,672
Of media

1899
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:47,584
420 million dollar deal to buy Banton Media Group the very next day

1900
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:50,656
This sequence of events quote sure looks like

1901
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:52,192
Quid pro quo

1902
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:54,240
As Craig Aaron of the media advocate

1903
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:55,520
Jiffy group Free Press

1904
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:56,288
Has noted

1905
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:59,360
Months ago Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner

1906
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:00,384
According

1907
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:01,152
Politico

1908
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:06,272
Sinclair broadcast group

1909
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:07,296
Secure better coverage

1910
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:09,856
The geopolitical report

1911
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:10,880
Sinclair

1912
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:12,928
More uncritical coverage

1913
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:16,256
In exchange for more access to Trump and the campaign

1914
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:17,280
Now

1915
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:18,560
Trump appears to be using

1916
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:23,680
A considerable power of the Federal Communications Commission has his own personal ATM for political current

1917
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:28,288
F****** stupid

1918
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:31,360
He's so dumb guys win

1919
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:32,384
Anyways

1920
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:38,784
Adjectives I as well just recently that I'm not done the one that was just a couple of weeks ago

1921
01:48:39,552 --> 01:48:40,064
F******

1922
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,368
So you got to take

1923
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:44,416
Consideration that

1924
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:46,208
In

1925
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:46,976
December

1926
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:47,744
For this year

1927
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:49,792
Or July excuse me

1928
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:52,608
This is from an article in Politico

1929
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:56,960
Even while Under Fire for requiring its Outlets to run conservative content

1930
01:48:57,216 --> 01:49:00,544
Cast group is increasing

1931
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:04,384
White House official

1932
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:05,408
Asian

1933
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,200
10 times a week

1934
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:08,480
The company confirmed money

1935
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:12,320
Yeah you have to run it

1936
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:17,184
The embossed run 9 times a week I have to run to 9%

1937
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:20,256
Of the the coverage in the in the country

1938
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:23,840
Of a conservative propaganda piece

1939
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:25,120
David his mask

1940
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:30,240
To look like local news being presented by a former Trump White House official

1941
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:33,824
Also they have a pieces that are made by former

1942
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:36,128
Trump Communications advisor

1943
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:41,504
Multiple multiple Trump people have gone over and started to actively work

1944
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,832
For the centralized Sinclair broadcast company

1945
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,720
The biggest thing that dies

1946
01:49:51,488 --> 01:49:52,000
Dead is

1947
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:56,864
Allow local

1948
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:59,936
There used to be a rule that you had to have at least six or seven

1949
01:50:00,192 --> 01:50:06,080
Local media outlets and they just got rid of that which means that Sinclair media is only going

1950
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:06,848
92

1951
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:07,616
Expanded

1952
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:08,640
Total Domination

1953
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:09,664
Turn up local news

1954
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:11,968
A nightmare

1955
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:12,992
It's interesting

1956
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:16,064
As far as far-reaching

1957
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:17,344
Consequences of dawn

1958
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:19,648
Ajit Pai has been the most

1959
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:21,184
Damaging person in

1960
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:21,952
Indy Trump

1961
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:24,256
Cabinet

1962
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:27,584
It's

1963
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:33,472
In terms of the future I think I'd reprise probably going to kill us all

1964
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:35,008
It's real

1965
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:38,592
Stacks field

1966
01:50:38,848 --> 01:50:43,200
Real tough to make that kind of decoration but it looks bad

1967
01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:45,248
None of this legislation is really got

1968
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:48,832
His Muslim bans have been stopped by the courts

1969
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:51,648
There's a legal challenge to just about everything

1970
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:53,696
The only thing that has

1971
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:56,256
Apparently unilateral control

1972
01:50:56,512 --> 01:50:57,536
Is the FCC

1973
01:50:57,792 --> 01:50:59,584
Yeah and I G Paez

1974
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:00,864
Singularly

1975
01:51:01,632 --> 01:51:03,424
Destroyed net neutrality

1976
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:05,728
Destroyed

1977
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:07,520
Against monopolies

1978
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:10,080
The power of media conglomerate

1979
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:16,480
More than I think anybody's ever done got rid of the need for equal internet access

1980
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:18,528
Is giving a huge boon

1981
01:51:18,784 --> 01:51:19,808
To your Comcast

1982
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:26,208
In order to make sure that if you're poor in the middle of nowhere they don't have to serve

1983
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:29,536
With you

1984
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:32,096
Idea that there was

1985
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:34,656
Some sort of the deal about coverage

1986
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:35,936
Xxxx

1987
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:40,800
No but just the idea is the predicate

1988
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:43,616
To the antecedent they were seeing now

1989
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:50,272
It is not fine backroom deals you got to give a little

1990
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:54,112
I don't I mean I do but I don't

1991
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:55,392
Well I mean

1992
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:59,744
Is that any different from a guy like Rodger Ailes

1993
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,304
Who stands so much more money

1994
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:05,376
I just think it's a bigger

1995
01:52:05,632 --> 01:52:06,656
Con okay

1996
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:10,240
Not as good

1997
01:52:10,496 --> 01:52:15,872
But it's not as good a situation there there

1998
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:18,176
Local news

1999
01:52:18,432 --> 01:52:20,224
I was making sure that these are

2000
01:52:20,736 --> 01:52:21,504
Not

2001
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,320
Centralized reports

2002
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:25,600
From bias people

2003
01:52:25,856 --> 01:52:26,368
Is going

2004
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:27,392
To do

2005
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:28,160
Incredibly in

2006
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:29,184
Insidious job

2007
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:32,000
Radicalizing people in smaller communities

2008
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:35,584
You're going to have the output of that beats

2009
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,888
I mean I guess that's the same thing if they would just watch

2010
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:38,912
Watch Boxing

2011
01:52:39,424 --> 01:52:40,448
Houndstooth

2012
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:41,984
Yeah it's all bad

2013
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:43,008
The same thing as

2014
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:44,032
Rodger Ailes

2015
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:45,824
Stan's two games

2016
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:48,384
So much for Trump winning as opposed to do

2017
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:51,200
No not him who's there

2018
01:52:51,456 --> 01:52:52,736
Who's the f***

2019
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:53,504
Who runs

2020
01:52:54,528 --> 01:52:55,552
Who runs Fox News

2021
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:56,320
Is the guy who owns it

2022
01:52:58,112 --> 01:52:58,624
Rodger Ailes

2023
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:02,720
Murdock

2024
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:03,488
Murdock

2025
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:05,024
Nikki's dad today

2026
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:08,096
Who the f*** is my remember any

2027
01:53:08,352 --> 01:53:10,144
Remember

2028
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:14,496
So this is all bad. Trump wins

2029
01:53:15,008 --> 01:53:18,336
Because he uses his bottle company

2030
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:19,104
2

2031
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:20,384
Run propaganda

2032
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:25,760
So bad but we have one more clip left

2033
01:53:26,272 --> 01:53:27,808
Guy who's

2034
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:28,576
Going to make everything

2035
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:30,624
I'm going to leave you with a punchline

2036
01:53:35,488 --> 01:53:36,512
Play something that I learned

2037
01:53:42,144 --> 01:53:42,656
Screw

2038
01:53:59,808 --> 01:54:00,576
Something like that

2039
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:06,208
Coming down the road

2040
01:54:07,232 --> 01:54:08,000
Alex

2041
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:11,584
It's bad

2042
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:13,120
Just having him say that

2043
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:14,400
It damning

2044
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:18,752
You're such a strfkr that you will agree with Billy Corgan saying

2045
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:21,568
Literally the opposite of how you conceive of yourself

2046
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:27,968
We don't have to be guys like us

2047
01:54:28,224 --> 01:54:31,040
Things that on the Alex Jones Show

2048
01:54:31,296 --> 01:54:34,624
That's probably true amazing f*** all of you

2049
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:37,440
Knock knock

2050
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:43,584
How did you do it

2051
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:49,984
Celebrities are allowed to be assholes

2052
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:51,520
Disappointing

2053
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:53,056
Power ranking

2054
01:54:53,568 --> 01:54:54,080
Animoto

2055
01:54:54,336 --> 01:54:55,872
Still the number one

2056
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:59,456
F*****'-a how is it that

2057
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:02,528
