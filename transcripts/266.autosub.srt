Alexandra Thurston color

00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:25,344
I'm not I'm not sure if I was

3
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:32,000
I don't know maybe I would be as an adult

4
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:38,400
Don't think so I didn't have many cool friends

5
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:45,568
I wasn't that cool

6
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:56,320
You know like I was trying to buy into it really hard

00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,344
Gemstone books

11
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,496
Hello Google

12
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:18,080
Because we got a

13
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,872
Very very

14
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:23,200
Thought-out response to our Lyme disease

15
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,880
We were wrong about that

16
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:37,280
Swear to God it's the only way I know Avenue is through

17
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,584
Iraq

18
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,912
It's a

19
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:48,032
Does Look a Lot Like a Rock

20
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:51,104
We're out of it

21
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,552
Cedar Point

22
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:04,416
The only reason I even thought that Lyme disease was a thing that happened for a long time

23
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:07,488
What's because in the documentary the punk singer

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,792
Kathleen Hanna

Girl extraordinaire

27
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,984
Main reason that you stop

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
Performing was

29
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,544
Because she had

30
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,568
Anand

31
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:27,968
If you know what this actually brings me to the clarification

32
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,952
Clearly you f***** up couple of actual thing

33
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,280
To unclearly please want to clarify

34
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:47,936
Things that I was saying in no way should have been interpreted as I think it's a good idea to ever hit a kid

35
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:54,080
I don't I think I made that clear but just in case I did not want to come out for 40 Diddley on that side

36
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,616
I meant secondarily

37
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,688
In the same way that you saw that documentary and that Legend

38
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:02,528
To believe that chronic lyme disease with a chronic thing and all that

39
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,648
I think I was operating off bad information understanding of

40
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,952
Spanking being appropriate

41
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,976
Situations according to

42
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:17,632
Like the American Psychological Association

43
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,216
And sorry about that

50
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,888
Some folks

51
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272

Really we're thrilled MacArthur Foundation

Donated to the show

58
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
Guess what

59
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,207
Guess who's on board now

60
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,255
The Bilderberg Group

61
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,327
Galax would agree with it

62
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,607
Fearnow technocrats

63
00:04:54,399 --> 00:05:00,543
Don't get mad and tell your brother someone sodomites a bucket of poop

Jar Jar Binks Caribbean

65
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,039
I don't want

66
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:17,439
Bilderberg Group

67
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:22,815
You can do that by going to

00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,095
Appreciate

69
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,911
Absolutely

70
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,983
Or perhaps any of our listeners who would like to donate

71
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:35,871
I just pretend laundry list of things that we can lie about

72
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
The Builder group

73
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,927
Positive

74
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,231
Pretty good chance

Splc

76
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:01,215
Everybody

77
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,031
Hide under fake names

78
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:09,663
Tell ya era of knowledge fight

79
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:15,039
That's putting it way too strong when I'm starting

80
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,087
We are going to be covering

81
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,439
Launch

82
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:24,255
Did I suggest

83
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,327
I decided as soon as it came out of my mouth that I was going to do it

84
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:33,727
Irresponsible

85
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:37,311
This unanimous of a response that's Lionel

86
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:43,711
In terms of people all being on the same page everybody is very much like

87
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:50,367
No no no no no

88
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:56,255
In the aftermath of the shooting spree

89
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:02,655
Because it's horrifying

90
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:08,287
With the warp reality that will inevitably cover the event

91
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,823
And uses them to push his narrative

92
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:14,175
Ultimately I sat with those feelings and decided that this was something that I had

93
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,575
We know that Alex told his audience at Sandy Hook was a fake of that with actors as recently as late 2015

94
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:25,183
But you been saying stuff like that for a while but we don't know what

95
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,231
For me that is unsatisfied

96
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,303
I know that he's lying about how he covered the tragedy

97
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:36,447
But I believe that it's in everyone's best interest for us to learn more so we can have a fuller understanding of why Alex

98
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
Texas line

99
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,495
To cover up his past action

100
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
Right

101
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,639
Today we're embarking on a new investigation to figure out exactly what this coverage of Sandy Hook

102
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:48,223
There'll be difficult to hear

103
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,527
I promise you that we will do our best

104
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
To be respectful

105
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,575
Embarrassed

106
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
Consideration

107
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,367
Who eating

108
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,159
Everyone except Alex

109
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
In this

110
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:03,071
You know it's the first time that I can honestly say that Alex

111
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,655
But he is quite literally not a bad enough dude to save the Press

112
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:14,079
That's true in present-day Alex being sued by the families of the children who died at Sandy Hook on December 14th

113
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
2012

114
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:20,223
He claims that he never said that Sandy Hook was fake money just had debates and looked at both sides of the issue

115
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:24,831
We know that this is categorically not to ruin demonstrate we demonstrated it plenty of times

116
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:29,951
So that claim isn't worth our time as an investigation

117
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:34,303
He's also claimed that after he heard about the shooting that really happened

118
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,607
It only started questioning if it was a false flag

119
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,911
After hearing about quote-unquote anomaly

120
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,959
Like the classic case of Anderson

121
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:47,359
Cooper's news disappearing people like

122
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,383
Wolfgang halbig

123
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
So

124
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,479
At this point we don't really know if that claim is true

125
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,271
So that's one thing we can look in

126
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,319
Right Alex

127
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,135
Beyond that is on specific as this is

128
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,695
I want to have a narrative develop

129
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,535
By the time that he was pretty much

130
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,375
So far under the radar that he could get away with whatever

131
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,423
How did Alex play as Han

132
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
Yeah

133
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:17,311
I have no idea what we're going to find but I was ready to learn to Alex was restrained in his coverage

134
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,847
And misled by India

135
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,639
As I am ready to learn

136
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:24,479
I think he was the one leading the bandwagon of dumb dumbs down a terrible drug

137
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,039
I don't know we will find out as we go along

138
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,063
We'll see

139
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,647
And I promise that I will approach this with as open a mind as I can

140
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,951
As is alright

141
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,767
I wrote out that introduction

142
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
To this just because

143
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
Be a little bit

144
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,095
We were then

145
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:44,447
Necessarily just us talking

146
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,287
What where we're going why I decided to jump into the

147
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,311
Because it could

148
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
Get ugly

149
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,359
Really ugly

150
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:56,735
Well that's one thing that I was considering it

151
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,039
Saw the overwhelming positive

152
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,319
Do it do it was

153
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,135
It's regarding San Diego

154
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,511
Ideal

155
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,327
I deal with tragedy

156
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,863
Through humor entirely

157
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,399
And I am

158
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
Would like

159
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:22,335
Really do not want to be disrespectful in any way

160
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:31,039
And if this first episode

161
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,367
Navigation is going to just cover December 14th 2012

162
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,903
Does the day of the shooting

163
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,183
And

164
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,535
I'll say this

165
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,839
Exhausted this is

166
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,631
This could have been way worse

167
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:55,359
The idea of us going over out his response to Sandy Hook

168
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
People's heads

169
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,663
Horrifying

170
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
I like oh my God

171
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
For today

172
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:05,343
It's pretty soft going so weather

173
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,927
Thinking you're going to be horrified today

174
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,743
Maybe next week from

175
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,047
Slightly lower than neutral position

176
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,583
Yeah yeah

177
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,119
So here we are

178
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,655
We're going to start things off

179
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,751
This is how Alex begin

180
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
The show

181
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,823
On December 14th 2012

182
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,591
Hygienic

183
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,175
About you cannot confess

184
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,647
Of December 2012

185
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:45,791
There is a reported school shooting

186
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,839
Restrictions on gun ownership

187
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:54,495
Right now it looks like only the gunman is dead

188
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,551
So within seconds

189
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,087
What's a Gunther

190
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,183
Seconds of starting his show

191
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:19,583
Newtown Connecticut 9:35 a.m.

192
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,143
Lanza shot himself at approximately 9:40

193
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,447
Those are Eastern Time

194
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,799
So would actually be 8:35 to 8:40 a.m. in Alex's time

195
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:33,919
And it's important he doesn't start until 11 a.m. or noon

196
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,687
Eastern Time

197
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,271
There were over two hours from the end of the shootings

198
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
Alex got on a

199
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:45,951
I know that it was a developing story but there's no reason for him to be so unaware of the situation at this point

200
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,719
The day

201
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,511
If he's presenting it as if he

202
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
He has an opinion

203
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,095
Yeah if you want

204
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,655
Cover it at details

205
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,191
That's kind of

206
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,983
Fairly responsible weight

207
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:58,751
To deal with these.

208
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,591
The idea of leaving the show with it

209
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,151
When you don't really have any information

210
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,943
Is not good

211
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,991
That is not good thing to do

212
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,575
But you saw it exactly right there start

213
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,879
That it's just immediately into gun.

214
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:24,351
Complain about liberals tweeting about gun reform so quick

215
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,679
G.i. 50

216
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
It is

217
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,775
Absolutely expected

218
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
But it is

219
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,847
Nevertheless disconcerting that

220
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,639
His first response is not

221
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,991
I'm thinking about the Dead

222
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:44,063
His first response is that I'm thinking about guns

223
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,111
That's unfair right now

224
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:52,511
Because at you as you heard they're the information that Alex is operating better information

225
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
Bernard has another question

226
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:57,631
But the information he's operating off of is just the gunman is down

227
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,191
He is not he doesn't know

228
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,727
Did all these kids got killed

229
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,775
He is operating

230
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,055
I don't believe that this is

231
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,359
The first time that the information came out

232
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:11,199
But at 1:40 Eastern Time

233
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,991
The police table press conference

234
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,599
Detail

235
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,367
But

236
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,391
I think the

237
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,207
I thought you were called reporting was coming out

238
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:26,047
Maybe should have been aware that this wasn't situation just a gunman

239
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:31,423
Was down and no other fatalities

240
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,567
At the beginning of the show bear to look at the story

241
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,847
I understand why you

242
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:46,271
Do a regular show he thinks the story is a kid showed up

243
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:53,439
Maybe fired shots into the wall or mandatory officer

244
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,863
If only because that's how you presented the store exactly

245
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
I'm cool.

246
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:07,007
News of the day because he doesn't think that this is that big of a deal yet

247
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:15,199
It's a big deal but for Alex's purposes

248
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:20,063
It's not as big a deal as

249
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,135
Obviously

250
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:33,631
Infowars.com

251
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,287
Tucker

252
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:46,687
American Free Press

253
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,999
A couple months before this

254
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,095
Stuff with that engine Tucker's

255
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,215
I like

256
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,031
To flesh out that story I don't really know any

257
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:12,799
He was talking about

258
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:19,455
And I'm not going to look for Jim Tucker's primary reporter

259
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:24,575
He's going to get to the gym Tucker story about Obama going into turkey what have you

260
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,879
But he also

261
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,671
Start getting kind of

262
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,439
Weird

263
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,463
Beginning of the show

264
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,999
He's very introspective

265
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:35,839
And starts talking about how he's starting to experience emotion

266
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:43,263
There are competing forces is the best way to say it there are competing forces in this world

267
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,799
I will say that

268
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:01,439
A lot of people

269
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,279
And also extremely

270
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:13,215
Experiencing

271
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,823
Understandings

272
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:21,919
Emotions

273
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,711
This is strictly

274
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:28,063
In the context of him like saying that I'm aware of so much

275
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
It's not

276
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,415
Services

277
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,511
You say it's almost like

278
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,815
You pick your red-tailed I have no emotion

279
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,119
Yeah I don't know what that I don't know what that means

280
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:46,239
I'm not sure

281
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,263
That's not new

282
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,335
I feel that a lot

283
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:56,223
I always

284
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,759
French

285
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,527
Never say that

286
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,391
He he doesn't actually talk with these new emotions are necessarily

287
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,695
But he does talk about how it feel

288
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
Feels

289
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,255
Which I find very interesting

290
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,303
This is upsetting

291
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,399
Visitors grandiose talk

292
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,679
Foot

293
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
Want to hear

294
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,775
Closest this feeling

295
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,591
Is more more dominating me

296
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,895
The closest I can describe it

297
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,815
Angled

298
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:51,519
Focused understand

299
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,551
So

300
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,599
Incredibly

301
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,927
Interesting to hear Alex describe how he's feeling in late-2012

302
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:12,511
Because what he's describing is not heightened level of focus

303
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,071
That legitimately sounds like a medical condition

304
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,399
Now obviously he's just exaggerating to make himself sound like

305
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,983
He's tapped into some kind of cosmic understanding fight for fun

306
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:26,335
I'm going to pretend he's actually talking to a doctor about you.

307
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:29,151
If I'm going to play a differential game and diagnose him

308
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,855
Notion in slowly

309
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,415
Similarities

310
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,487
What else is clearly expressing is in the

311
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,559
Condition

312
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:54,239
Compare it two times

313
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,311
If those situations your body is flooded with adrenaline

314
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,359
Which is part of the fight-or-flight reaction

315
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,127
That you have

316
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,431
Everything is describing perfectly fit

317
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,967
We talkin about adrenaline

318
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,247
It would make sense

319
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:10,367
That what he's actually talking about it is unable to control production

320
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,903
And release of adrenaline

321
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:15,487
So if that were the case what symptoms would you expect

322
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,583
One possible cause of elevated adrenaline levels

323
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,887
Is the adrenal gland condition Cushing

324
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:28,799
Along with excess adrenaline condition

325
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,615
Syndrome then I would expect him to be

326
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,407
Trying to

327
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687
Troy

328
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,503
Different syndrome

329
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:44,927
Different symptoms from Johns Hopkins medical schools Cushing syndrome

330
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,231
This sounds like Alex

331
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,279
Upper body

332
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:53,887
Round face high blood pressure

333
00:20:54,143 --> 00:21:00,287
Reduce libido and sex drive in men

334
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,615
The desire to destroy Alderaan

335
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,663
Increased fat around

336
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,783
Neck constantly talks about huge necklace

337
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,575
This can't be real

338
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:16,928
That's what are the symptoms of Cushing's syndrome

339
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:23,328
I'm just doing this

340
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,912
He wants to talk about how is elevated state of red pivot misses

341
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:31,264
It's either changed status

342
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,848
Clearly

343
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,664
Definitely above his

344
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,456
Reality

345
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:42,016
It's just as easy to take what he's describing and say that he needs

346
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,040
Go to the f****** doctor

347
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:49,696
I don't believe any of the things that I just said appropriate

348
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,584
Cushing syndrome

349
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:59,424
That's all I'm saying you should go get checked out

350
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,728
I'm so anyway

351
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,288
We also know that Alex

352
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:11,968
And I don't know I don't know I don't think so

353
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,992
Adrenaline levels

354
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:20,416
Response all the time would be very hard to focus on something

355
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:26,304
But leave that aside

356
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,352
Construe

357
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,400
Eclipse starts talking about how

358
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,168
Things

359
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,960
And I think if you listen carefully

360
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,776
Get a glimpse of exactly why

361
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,056
He has a bad processor

362
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,128
I booked a public now

363
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,176
And they're like children

364
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:46,272
Little spoiled arrogantly scared children

365
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,136
Porsche

366
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,952
A book

367
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:59,840
Before I turn the page

368
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,728
Because I've heard them say it a thousand times

369
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,520
100 different ways

370
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,944
I know exactly what they're going to say

371
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,552
And then I'm going to turn the next page and I know

372
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,464
While he's reading

373
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:31,072
He's reading something

374
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:35,424
If it says what he thinks they're going to say then confirm

375
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,728
I know exactly what they're going to take

376
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,520
If it says something different

377
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,544
Probably going to be

378
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,104
What what they mean is what I would think exact

379
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,200
So many times by looking at its primary sources that don't stay with

380
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:49,248
He pretends they say

381
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,064
That has to be what that process is describing

382
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:55,136
Yeah that makes sense

383
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,208
Exactly what I expected them to say and then

384
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:02,560
I used

385
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:05,376
If I turn the page and it doesn't say what I think

386
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,960
Well I think it says this

387
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:13,568
I'll save it always from my Xperia

388
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:18,432
Of something

389
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:20,480
Like some primary source that he's not missing

390
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,272
Yeah

391
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,040
But I don't think

392
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:29,440
He was in a book club because I would like if he was just reading like

393
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:35,840
Ethology

394
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:43,776
To take me back to like a workshops in College English classes

395
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,616
Chipotle not good

396
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,224
Alex thinks that this is no big deal

397
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,248
Sandy Hook

398
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,832
He hasn't he has no real concern and talking about it

399
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,136
Just wants to talk about emotions

400
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,976
You know we got

401
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,256
Jim Tucker with his news

402
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,560
At this point in the show

403
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,608
Alex finds out the Sandy Hook

404
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
Is way worse than

405
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,032
He thinks it was a foiled

406
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:16,800
Shooting or something

407
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:20,128
Not knowing a lot of

408
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,176
But by this point

409
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,200
Next

410
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:25,760
For a fact

411
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,808
Killed at that school

412
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,088
And

413
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:29,856
Here is in

414
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:30,880
Dealing with that

415
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,960
It looks like

416
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:48,800
Shooter is a father

417
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,712
Christmas trees and I like Christmas

418
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,016
Commercial stress

419
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:02,112
Everybody so stressed out I just feel the bad vibes during the holidays

420
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,000
Dad

421
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:13,120
Oh my God

422
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:19,008
Disquiet

423
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,824
CBS news headlines

424
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,808
Is going to physically

425
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:41,792
You hear their Heaton mediately start

426
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,888
Say what I mean he's not staying it's fake butt

427
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:50,752
Literally everything he says after learning about the reality of this tragedy

428
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,544
Is to reinforce

429
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,568
Future narrative

430
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,360
He's going to push about it

431
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,152
So

432
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:00,224
What I set out to do this investigation

433
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,624
Investigation closed

434
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:17,120
You thought it was a different situation that it was

435
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,960
Now that the reality has come to Bear any realize they're a bunch of

436
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,984
Kids that got shot

437
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,544
And if he still doesn't have any of the real facts

438
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,848
She thinks it was the dad and it was

439
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,944
Once at first then a second later than all my God

440
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,968
Yeah

441
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:38,112
Him comparing its Columbine because he thinks Columbine was a fake

442
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:46,048
And then talking about the timing of this Obama second-term he's trying to take the gun exactly

443
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,072
Serve his interests

444
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,608
Pushing the idea that it's

445
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,888
50

446
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,424
Isn't

447
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,960
Fair

448
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,240
Way to cover the

449
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,824
It is not the act of somebody who is interested in

450
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,104
Hearing both sides

451
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,152
It's someone who's hoping fraying

452
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:04,480
That the reality ends up matching the story he wants

453
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,272
Citalopram

454
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,808
That wasn't prepared

455
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,136
That was his immediate instinctual reaction

456
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:14,208
Was to try and find ways to talk about this

457
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:14,976
That Arkansas

458
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,000
Spirit Oreo

459
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:20,608
He will not come out and say

460
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,888
But not yet

461
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:24,960
He was 85% inclined to say that

462
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:30,080
There were every inclination ever like little thing there is

463
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,920
Ocbf

464
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:37,760
Things responsibly

465
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:42,112
Concert with the cops instead of just randomly saying that it was some a******

466
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:54,912
Unlike

467
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,472
This episode goes on in boron verified

468
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,240
News thing

469
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,008
Come out

470
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,592
Those are the sorts of things as they come out that Alex

471
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,128
Uses to point out

472
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,920
Like they covered this up

473
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,992
Like the idea of

474
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,272
Possibility of a second

475
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,344
Computer

476
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,928
In the future

477
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,696
I'd like

478
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,768
They said that there were two Shooters and then they covered it up

479
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,304
When in reality that was

480
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,328
Reflecting

481
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,352
The fact that there was

482
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,376
Police

483
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,656
Walkie-talkie

484
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,448
Right

485
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,568
Be cautious of the idea that they could be arrested in the woods

486
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,896
Behind unrelated to

487
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,992
The shooter

488
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,040
Recorded

489
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,576
In the fog of

490
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:49,184
Absolutely

491
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,208
Necessarily

492
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,744
Report this stuff

493
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,304
A couple hours after

494
00:29:55,328 --> 00:30:01,472
It's responsible for Ford Explorer

495
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,568
Probably

496
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:10,432
So something is coming

497
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:17,600
And he has for a while in the summer of Rage literally every year since he's been born

498
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,368
Tobacco

499
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:22,976
I told my wife this morning I said I'm feeling so much dread

500
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:28,864
I have never felt in my gut and my spirit

501
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,216
They're really going to use this

502
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:36,544
I'm sure they'll be the usual signs

503
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,760
Very quick

504
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,784
2

505
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:50,112
OfferUp it may be staged as

506
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:53,184
Is possible roads that we're going to be going down

507
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:54,976
It's quick

508
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,024
It's quick with no information

509
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,304
You just back

510
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:04,704
This could be station even if it's not it's probably some Prozac head

511
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,800
I know I know

512
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,336
So you cut clips

513
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:13,152
I just need to

514
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,456
At no point

515
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,992
Even take a second

516
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:17,760
To be like

517
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:24,416
I mean even the fake Republican thoughts and prayers to even bother with the b*******

518
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:29,280
Platitudes of these guys who secretly think the same thing that Alex is picking which is

519
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:34,400
We better stay thoughts and prayers in order to avoid

520
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:41,056
Is an interesting question and I wish that I had pulled more clips of stuff like that because

521
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:41,824
We ended up having

522
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:48,224
Be here for the next week

523
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,528
Care

524
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,832
For the people who are victims of this

525
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,648
Outside of crocodile tears

526
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,000
Verge of his fake crying voice

527
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:04,864
But is always talking about how they're going to take the guns is going to cause a civil war

528
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,936
He does talk about all this is so bad

529
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,728
Right

530
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:12,544
And then there's one point in the episode where he talks about

531
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,080
Thinking about these kids

532
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,200
Like pictures from the school for like a month ago

533
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,480
And the only way he

534
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:23,296
You can even emotionally connect to it is thinking about

535
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,368
If that's what it takes you to get there

536
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,136
Vine

537
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,160
But there's an

538
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,720
There isn't complete absence of

539
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,304
People who are named Alex on the show

540
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,400
Yeah, there's at least one caller

541
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,192
Who Express like

542
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,984
I can't imagine

543
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,008
People are going through

544
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:43,776
That's

545
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,336
Fairy live

546
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,920
Another thing

547
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:55,040
I just wanted I just wanted to confirm so nobody

548
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,320
Thought that it was like

549
00:32:56,576 --> 00:33:02,464
Cutting the clips that make him look like the complete Nutter monster he is and then it was like

550
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,280
It's literally his first response is never

551
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:09,888
I'm sorry or I hope that this isn't Reno like

552
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:16,288
Edited in any way except for a starting point right

553
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:22,176
Reaction was exactly described how most of the show is

554
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,736
I think that immediate reaction tells you all

555
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,552
Need to know right semblances of

556
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:30,112
Humanity throughout but never anything

557
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,136
That I would

558
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,184
Put in the category of

559
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,464
Human response

560
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,256
There's nothing that is

561
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,792
Recognition of

562
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,072
These are

563
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,096
Elementor

564
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:40,864
Three students

565
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,680
Murdered in Cold Blood

566
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,728
Yeah

567
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,032
Because he thinks it

568
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,568
Or anything like that

569
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,104
We can't make that determination

570
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,224
Algebra

571
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:03,392
If one of the his new emotions should really have been empathy

572
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:09,280
Forgot about the new emotion he one of the emotions he'll never be a watch emphasizing

573
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:13,376
Jesus checking on some of those old emotions

574
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,656
Yeah it's tough

575
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:17,984
It's realtor

576
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,800
So after the Parkland shooting last year

577
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:27,200
These teachers should be armed

578
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:30,784
Alex was way ahead of the curve on that

579
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,344
After Sandy Hook that was prescription

580
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,368
Into

581
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,392
What should

582
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:39,744
Orderly evacuation

583
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,800
That

584
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,336
Is exactly what Alex

585
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,360
Would w

586
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,896
His response

587
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,456
Because that is

588
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,272
Is awful

589
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,320
That's something I think

590
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
He could be

591
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,368
Defensible about

592
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,416
Because every

593
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:11,744
Everyone else in the right-wing now in response

594
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,768
Parkland to sing

595
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,304
Very similar things

596
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,704
Yeah I did Alex's take on it was this is a real event I'm worried about the idea that they'll take my guy

597
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,984
Because of it

598
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:25,312
Not as monstrous as saying it

599
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,896
His actors are there anything like that

600
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,200
So I think that you would want that to be

601
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,760
Unfortunately

602
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,296
Even on this episode it's not

603
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,088
You've already hurt him speculate

604
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,392
You already heard it

605
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,672
Internals of a narrative

606
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,208
But he's going to water

607
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,232
High speed

608
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,768
Grow into

609
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:54,496
I can't imagine how that one massive blind-spot

610
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,776
Ali video

611
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,848
It's entirely video games ebony is always

612
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,896
An important thing for our Marin

613
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,664
You don't need to keep

614
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,456
God dammit

615
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,736
I think a lot of people

616
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,064
So in this next clip

617
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,392
Alex and started wrestling with the reality of

618
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,416
What's happened

619
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,952
Are you can you can see

620
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,024
I think throughout this is

621
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,328
A part of his brain that recognizes

622
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,864
How horrible

623
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,400
What's happening is

624
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,936
And then another part

625
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,984
Really really wants to say it

626
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,776
Yeah and his next clip

627
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,824
He's dealing with that part of his brain

628
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,872
That believes it was real

629
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,152
But

630
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,968
All he can do with that part of his brother

631
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
Brain

632
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,272
Is blame other things

633
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,040
For having caused

634
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:42,112
Now Shane 27

635
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:52,096
Connecticut has some pretty strict gun laws

636
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:59,776
We are just a very sick Society

637
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:05,408
Charter 5678 breakdown

638
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,120
Eli Lilly studies

639
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,656
He's misrepresenting

640
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,680
Pretty hard

641
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,216
But you heard in there

642
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,752
You got abortion

643
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,056
Prozac

644
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,848
Harsh gun laws in Connecticut

645
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,640
For corporate

646
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,176
Other than reality

647
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,200
In

648
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:39,968
What was that

649
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,736
42nd

650
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,528
I'm trying to wrestle with

651
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,064
It's pretty

652
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,832
Pretty interesting

653
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,648
You can see manipulation

654
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,440
You can see evasiveness

655
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,208
You can see

656
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:56,096
To figure out where we going to land on

657
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:02,752
If you're Alex Jones this is not you want to come into work for

658
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,616
You wish you accidentally called in sick or something like that because

659
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,408
Figuring out where to plant

660
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,736
Something that's always expected

661
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,784
Yeah cuz he's the expert

662
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,552
He's the guy who

663
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:17,344
Who knows how the globalist to work

664
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,368
And all that stuff

665
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,976
Come on Alex

666
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:27,584
What is it like

667
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,656
Tomorrow's news today

668
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:37,056
Play the Nevis Logan Mega red pill

669
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:41,408
Understanding is above all this stuff right

670
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,944
They expect that from

671
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,504
Studio

672
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,320
And he's blindsided by a bit of news that is

673
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,368
Christ

674
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,184
He's in a position where he needs to stay for

675
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,488
Claim right here already

676
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,536
Him trying to ambivalent

677
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,560
Lee do the fake

678
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,840
Falls Flagstaff

679
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,120
But then also

680
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,400
How to be an unwilling

681
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,752
Is the part of his brain

682
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,032
The runway

683
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,920
Like dealing with

684
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,200
2012

685
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:18,272
I'm far more willing to give him the benefit

686
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,064
The doubt in this situation

687
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,368
Meaning

688
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:25,184
Let me let me actually let me try and put this a lot better

689
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,512
Based on his tone of voice

690
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,560
Honda

691
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,328
To talk through the

692
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,632
It seems to me like

693
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,448
He does feel like

694
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:38,496
Oh no this is a tragedy

695
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,776
This is a real track

696
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,616
And that part is trying to break out because his

697
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:49,504
To say that it's not real I think there's a Persona has to deny it

698
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,856
But his real human being is trying to break out

699
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,648
This is an issue this

700
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,184
Real I can't listen

701
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,768
Exactly

702
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,048
Human element

703
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,072
Vaxxed

704
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:10,496
I think I picked up a 2012 I'm giving him the benefit of Doubt and staying that

705
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,264
Actuation

706
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,568
He is 100%

707
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,616
He knows this is real

708
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,944
And he is trying to scramble to find a way

709
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,992
I think that beat

710
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:27,136
Cuz his response is so much less offensive than we would expect

711
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:27,904
Because

712
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,952
There is this waffling back in

713
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,976
For that little bit

714
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,256
But you can feed

715
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,280
Clear indications of

716
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:38,656
He wants to say it's fake

717
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,960
Yeah there is a choice that's going on

718
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,008
Himself

719
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:43,776
War

720
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,544
To a certain extent

721
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,872
He was covering his ass

722
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:54,016
You know exactly

723
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,344
Interesting

724
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,136
I wasn't

725
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,928
I wasn't specifically

726
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,488
The idea that like it does sort of

727
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,256
Vindicate choice

728
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:07,072
Yeah and end intentional line

729
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,864
It's hard to nail down

730
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,888
I think I think

731
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,168
Your argument is strong

732
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,960
I'm not a hundred percent

733
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,728
Just because

734
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,384
No I know that's what I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt that I would not give him later on

735
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:23,712
Do you know what I mean

736
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:31,392
Because the benefit of the doubt is

737
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:48,288
For my job pretend they're nothing framing it is

738
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:53,151
But it's actually

739
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,967
Alex's

740
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:57,759
Stop

741
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,295
Mother's Day

742
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,135
Be fake

743
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:07,231
Seems like really good timing

744
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:10,047
Alright

745
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,327
Maybe

746
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,351
Maybe you're okay

747
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,263
So that was

748
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:23,615
He said baby it's real

749
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,991
That's not good

750
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,039
That is not good

751
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,575
That's not a good way to report

752
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,879
Hey this thing happened

753
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:37,439
But

754
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,463
If we have

755
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,743
These indications

756
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:43,583
There are parts of the propaganda that we used about other

757
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,655
If some of those things lineup

758
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,495
Elicit

759
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,567
You know and I know

760
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,895
We can't do it right now it's almost

761
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:03,295
Yeah it absolutely is

762
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:06,367
Absolutely

763
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,159
Beetles that way pretty strong

764
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,975
His position is

765
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:15,071
Does development even change throughout the course of

766
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,607
This one day

767
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,375
Of his show

768
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,935
But nothing changes about the idea

769
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:24,799
If it's real they're going to use it to take our guns if it's fake there

770
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:25,823
Let's take our gun

771
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,383
No matter what

772
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,687
Hear that Express

773
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:04,991
Make yourself

774
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:11,391
Pause music.

775
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:15,999
Physically

776
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,631
Start a civil war

777
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:28,543
Before the shooting started

778
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,247
Always honest with you

779
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:44,159
Feeling of dread

780
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,439
So

781
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,935
Yelling over the begin

782
00:44:56,191 --> 00:45:00,799
Beginning / middle of that clip like he did he really just want one

783
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:07,455
That is what you get.

784
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:10,783
They created him to do that

785
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,879
All that is

786
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,159
Is him

787
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,183
Saying it's fake

788
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:20,767
And also also him saying

789
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:28,447
Yahoo it is true he does give himself a lot of that

790
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,215
I knew it

791
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:32,799
In the show Alex Goes to cult

792
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,359
I think

793
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,431
1

794
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,967
The colors

795
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,503
You here on Alex's show

796
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,807
Cannot be taken in any other way than it

797
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,343
Being the people he has try

798
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,647
Inasmuch as they listen

799
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,415
His show

800
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,975
Like back in the day they would never say like

801
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:54,303
Hey

802
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:57,887
Product or whatever but nowadays

803
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:00,959
Because they have had forcement

804
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:01,983
I will take

805
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:02,751
Call if you

806
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:03,775
To promote my product

807
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:06,335
Of course

808
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,103
Responsive

809
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,127
Soap

810
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:10,175
Everyone calls in his show

811
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,967
Are all his fans

812
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,783
Even people who he says I take calls

813
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,575
The disagree with me that usually

814
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:23,231
About style over substance real actual disagreement

815
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,535
There are a couple times

816
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,375
But

817
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,911
Those people are still reflecting

818
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,519
Now that

819
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:38,335
Alex

820
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,103
Was it fake

821
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,407
And the reason that is important

822
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,431
Remember that

823
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,223
These are basically Alex's

824
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,247
We're calling it

825
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,527
Is because

826
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,295
Alex

827
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:50,623
Created this worldview in the post 9/11 World

828
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,903
We're like I know he wasn't

829
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,183
The only person saying it was

830
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:53,951
Is a false flag

831
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,743
Was one of the loudest mouth

832
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:59,583
Consistently does call thing

833
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,351
Fake that

834
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,447
The people who call again are ahead of Alex

835
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:11,871
In terms of the narrative they know that Alex

836
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:16,991
Alex is it fake just to believe everything like this

837
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:20,063
You've already said a bunch of times on the show

838
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,855
It's about trying to take our gun

839
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,391
So let's cut through the BS

840
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:25,695
Yeah

841
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:28,767
Begin like that last clip

842
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,303
I want to say yesterday

843
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,911
Alex and let's start talking

844
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,447
Doesn't say that it's fake

845
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,471
Good response but

846
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,519
It is you can hear

847
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:40,799
The yes

848
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,079
Under the skin

849
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:49,759
Little mouse inside his mouth

850
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:50,527
Yeah

851
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:00,767
Are you still following online

852
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:01,791
And I

853
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,911
Spell possibility

854
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,519
I'm saying that

855
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,175
Shooting star

856
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:25,087
Amazing figure or the government or Republican

857
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:25,855
Beer

858
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,255
Excavating

859
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:34,815
Happen more frequently

860
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:42,495
Well I know this for

861
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:02,975
Requires reporting

862
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,511
Large

863
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,959
2 shooters

864
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:19,615
Reports

865
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,919
When somebody else opens the door when

866
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:29,855
Programs

867
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:33,439
Police orders

868
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:40,863
Regardless

869
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,655
Absolutely

870
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,471
The most important thing has begun defense

871
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:47,263
You can tell that from the way scary

872
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:52,383
Responsive that caller is

873
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,663
Without saying yes

874
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,711
Yeah

875
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:56,991
Vague

876
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,295
He's trying to make it sound

877
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,319
Specific

878
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,599
Perfect condition

879
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:04,159
Under which we can now save this is fake

880
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,951
Yeah and

881
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:11,583
You wouldn't do that if that's the direction you wanted to go

882
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,351
Of course

883
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,983
Dumb f***

884
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:21,055
How can you honestly look at that and be like

885
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:24,383
It seems like these are happening with more frequency and then be like

886
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:28,735
Well clearly that's the government ramping up their let's steal your gun

887
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:32,575
Guess what this is a f****** epidemic

888
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,855
It's still like

889
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:36,159
Understandable why the call

890
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:36,927
Would think that

891
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,463
Given Alex's

892
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:39,743
Yeah

893
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:40,767
Training

894
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,303
It's hard to say

895
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,631
The course

896
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:48,447
You know to get your degree you have

897
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:51,519
I guess

898
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,823
Can't graduate Community College

899
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:58,943
This is going to be such an interesting

900
00:50:59,199 --> 00:50:59,711
Investigation

901
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,479
Just

902
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,503
Based on the fact

903
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,527
Alone.

904
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:05,855
Like

905
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,159
Sandy Hook is one of those

906
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:10,719
Flashpoints in history you can point to where

907
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,767
We didn't do anything about it then

908
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:14,047
So that means

909
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:18,143
Like that's real

910
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:20,703
It's not going it's never going to be addressed

911
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:26,591
So horrifying

912
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:30,943
Exactly

913
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:31,711
You couldn't

914
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:34,527
Maybe you could maybe the best baby

915
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:38,367
Well we get hit with more horrifying realities on a daily basis

916
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:41,439
For writers in the world

917
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:45,279
To come up with some realistic scenarios that would shock up more

918
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,071
Then the idea of someone coming

919
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,607
Automatic weapon

920
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:50,911
Killing a bunch of

921
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:51,679
Children

922
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:53,215
Yeah but it's

923
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:54,495
Hard to fathom

924
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,031
Something worse

925
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:04,479
It was almost like a it was almost a test for America

926
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,015
And we utterly failed

927
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:12,415
People try not to fail Alex made sure

928
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:15,487
Didn't graduate Community goddamn

929
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:22,911
He was just mislaid by these who's playing

930
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:27,007
Investigation

931
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:27,775
Directions

932
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,055
Ultimately unnecessary

933
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:35,199
You just go back to the day we desire for it

934
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,759
Sweet

935
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:41,599
Recognition

936
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,183
Conscious

937
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:45,951
He knows it was

938
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,255
Doesn't know how to spell

939
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:52,863
Yeah so he probably does need those people like Wolfgang halbig to come around

940
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:57,727
To justify the things that he wants to say exactly

941
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:59,007
And I take it they're stumped

942
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,055
But

943
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,079
At this point

944
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:02,847
Can see where it's at

945
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,871
Very clear

946
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:04,639
Yep

947
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,687
Yeah there's no way that you can

948
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:09,247
Listen to what he's had to say so far end

949
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:10,783
Like

950
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,831
You just had debates

951
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:17,183
This guy would have done anything and everything for

952
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:21,535
Anyone like even is 99 of his collar said that it was real

953
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:26,399
And you should worry about

954
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:35,103
Eddievr

955
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:38,175
Send nextplus he talks about it

956
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,967
Are you talkin about how it's fake

957
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:40,735
But not saying

958
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,551
And Compares it to another

959
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,543
I called

960
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:17,599
And of course you know the Batman

961
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:27,583
Tampere for psych Warfare

962
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,679
Salary

963
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:35,519
As part of the program

964
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:41,151
Aurora Batman shooting will come up

965
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,223
Call space on

966
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:48,575
I want better served

967
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,623
To cover that on another episode

968
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:54,975
Because I know it will

969
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,791
On the episode rehab

970
00:54:59,327 --> 00:54:59,839
Take me to

971
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,887
But for now all that's important

972
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:04,703
Alex

973
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:05,983
He's comparing it

974
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:12,639
He thinks the columbines fake

975
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,455
He believed that

976
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:17,759
Wednesday was directed to do his mailbombing

977
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:20,319
MKUltra program

978
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:24,159
False flag blah blah blah

979
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,951
Every single

980
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:27,231
Comparing

981
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:29,791
The events to covering

982
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:30,815
But he believes are fake

983
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,351
And it's not a coincidence

984
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,399
I don't know what a real shooter

985
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:39,263
I don't know if I've ever heard him cover something

986
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,567
This happened does it suck

987
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:42,847
I guess actually like

988
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:45,919
White protesters are hits

989
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,967
Nailed it

990
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:49,759
When.

991
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:53,087
Get the taxes by

992
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:58,463
He thinks that the realest of course

993
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:01,791
I don't know if I've ever actually heard and I know that

994
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,839
Probably partially because I haven't heard

995
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:05,887
I believe

996
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:08,703
Much like there's probably a real use of a source

997
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:10,751
There's probably an example of a

998
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,079
But he's not comparing Sandy Hook

999
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:15,103
Any of those

1000
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,383
Potential example

1001
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:19,967
He's only comparing what's going on to all

1002
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:21,247
These things he's built up

1003
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,015
With his rhetoric

1004
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,551
To be triggers

1005
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:24,319
His audience

1006
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,111
Is there fake

1007
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:26,879
And he's doing that

1008
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:27,903
For a very specific

1009
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,463
Prineville

1010
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,487
Surprise

1011
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:32,767
The pop of the narrative

1012
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,583
Exactly what we've already said I'm

1013
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,375
I love that we already got two

1014
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,423
But just that idea of like

1015
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:44,031
Everyone is listening knows where you going

1016
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:50,431
Andi Mack you're going to see you're going to get to the medical mystery

1017
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:56,575
House and Cuddy ever going to make out

1018
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,623
Even when it comes

1019
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:02,719
It's kind of disappointing

1020
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:12,959
I wish these guys it had more fun with the shootings they thought were fake like

1021
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:13,727
Look

1022
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:20,127
All of the old

1023
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:22,175
RFK wasn't really killed

1024
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:23,711
Reverb

1025
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:26,015
Brunette. Not that he wasn't really killed

1026
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,551
What did Sirhan Sirhan

1027
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:34,719
Okay well I get another one

1028
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,791
Yeah so I wish

1029
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,143
In this episode

1030
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,935
Used talkingshit on the Russians

1031
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,703
A lot

1032
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:49,567
Like you in order to reinforce his idea that these false flag attack

1033
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:52,127
He's like the Russians have been caught doing it a bunch

1034
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,663
Steven

1035
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:59,807
Clean up the apartment

1036
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:05,183
He brings up as an example of the false

1037
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:07,487
F****** hate him

1038
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,279
He now is like I thought it was funny

1039
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:15,423
He uses that as an example of

1040
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:19,519
How dare you get it right

1041
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:22,591
In the wrong service and then just change your mind

1042
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:23,359
F****** ass

1043
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,639
Nothing matters

1044
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,687
All that matters is

1045
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:32,575
Means to an end end in itself everything is just

1046
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,647
Profoundly in a

1047
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:39,231
So it was nextplus Alex

1048
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,583
I think we've already seen

1049
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,119
Things that I would not

1050
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,167
Like to see anyone

1051
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:49,983
Certainly

1052
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:53,311
Times are still not like

1053
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,359
There's not indication

1054
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,383
He's saying

1055
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,175
Things like this

1056
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:02,271
Either but this is where I

1057
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,831
Putting his toe a little too far over the

1058
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:18,399
Is also reporting

1059
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:21,727
So when he says that Sandy Hook has The Tell-Tale sign

1060
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:24,031
I think that's a bridge too far

1061
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,055
Because

1062
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,591
You don't have all the information

1063
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:30,431
You don't have your responsible Place reporting

1064
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,735
Even all of them

1065
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:37,087
CBS is reporting that there two shooters

1066
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:40,671
If you report that with the caveat that

1067
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:41,439
You know

1068
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:42,975
Things Are

1069
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:43,743
Not

1070
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:48,095
Solid right now

1071
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:48,863
Or whatever

1072
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:51,167
Can probably walk that line

1073
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:54,751
But when you introduce it by saying this has all the telltale signs

1074
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,031
Which is

1075
00:59:56,287 --> 01:00:00,127
Implied whatever it is you want them steaks at

1076
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:02,175
Where do you have now

1077
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:03,711
Territory where it's at

1078
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,503
You are

1079
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,527
Doing too much

1080
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:07,551
To make your audience

1081
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,879
False flag hearts

1082
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:12,415
Underneath the floorboards

1083
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,743
Every time there's a false flag

1084
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,047
Bumble

1085
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:22,399
So in a civil war is coming

1086
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:27,263
God I kind of wish it had and then wait for this moment

1087
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,287
There is a Momo

1088
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,055
Where Alex

1089
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,079
I believe

1090
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,615
Scrum

1091
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:33,663
Research and Alex

1092
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:35,199
And knowing how his brain works

1093
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:37,503
I think he almost says

1094
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,807
This is f****** b******* this was fake

1095
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:40,831
30 stops

1096
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:41,599
Himself

1097
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,647
Very sure

1098
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:45,183
From listening to this a couple times

1099
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,463
That he

1100
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:48,511
Really held his tongue

1101
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:53,631
And absolutely

1102
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:27,679
That is restrict on his part

1103
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,959
Just want to tell you

1104
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:40,991
Hey there's a lot of stuff coming up in the news

1105
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,319
Isaac

1106
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:48,159
I think the most interesting speculation is what is causing him

1107
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:52,255
To restrain himself because it's clearly not the threat of

1108
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:56,863
Beginning this episode he's so far under the radar at this point don't give a s***

1109
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:04,543
Amatory things about tons of people already.

1110
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,311
Fear that

1111
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:08,383
What is holding him back and I'm not sure what that is

1112
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,407
And I think

1113
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:12,223
The best argument just because we are all pee

1114
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:14,783
Even Alex is a monster

1115
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,087
I think it's exactly what

1116
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,879
You were talking about earlier

1117
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,647
He knows this

1118
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:22,207
Yeah there's a part of him is that

1119
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,487
That that

1120
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:25,023
That bit of humanity

1121
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:27,071
If you ever seen a dog fall off a dock

1122
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:33,727
Like a dog videos of dogs falling off docks

1123
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:37,311
Videos of dogs falling off

1124
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:40,639
Health don't park your paws will like

1125
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:44,223
At the dock and there's nothing to grab onto so it'll be like

1126
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:50,623
Like 10 seconds of them trying to stay on the dock and then falling

1127
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:57,023
Hanna-Barbera cartoon where they go over the edge and look down at the edge of the cliff and they're standing there and then they looked at

1128
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:02,399
I think that is Alex clawing at

1129
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,167
At the dock

1130
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:05,471
I think it's faster

1131
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:09,567
Do you know that your entire career is predicated on you

1132
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,847
You falling off this.

1133
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:11,871
You can't

1134
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:17,247
You kept these children know it is it is very long like

1135
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:21,599
It's it's has to be some

1136
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,487
The easiest xiumin EXO

1137
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:29,791
If I take this week

1138
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,071
I'm doing something

1139
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:31,839
F******

1140
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:34,911
No you can absolutely see him

1141
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:35,935
Like

1142
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,983
Possibly you can see him

1143
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:43,103
Being like my career is predicated and is dependent upon me saying this

1144
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:43,871
This is fake

1145
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,151
But at the same time

1146
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:49,503
I genuinely can't get the image out of my head of one of my kids

1147
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:50,271
Being shot in

1148
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,039
School

1149
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:52,831
I can't get it out of my head

1150
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:58,463
Give me a day

1151
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:04,863
Give me a day and I'll be able to lie about this but today all I see is that phone call

1152
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,911
When I come home that voicemail

1153
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:11,775
Yeah they go for Sunday

1154
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:14,335
That'll be our next episode

1155
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:16,895
Alex's taking calls

1156
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:17,663
Can you get the call for

1157
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:18,943
From a guy in Connecticut

1158
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:20,479
This guy

1159
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:23,551
Is just spouting unfounded Rumours left and right

1160
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,367
To do with

1161
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:28,415
The shooting I don't really

1162
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:34,815
And that there were some boxes of

1163
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,119
Kids from Sandy Hook

1164
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,423
Who were there at the bowling alley

1165
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,703
Wow the shooting was taking

1166
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:43,263
Play-Doh that proves it

1167
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,567
Art schools

1168
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:47,359
School District

1169
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:49,151
Also I know that

1170
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:50,943
Is it from when I was in high school

1171
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:53,247
I took 0 hour bowling

1172
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,271
Because

1173
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:57,087
And I was going to f****** take another

1174
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,903
EClass

1175
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:05,791
They had buses that would take us to the bowling alley go to Bullock

1176
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:06,559
Many

1177
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:08,863
Or even could be like

1178
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:09,887
I don't know

1179
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:12,447
Christmas break is coming up holiday break

1180
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:15,007
So maybe there's a we're done with our

1181
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:17,311
Finals

1182
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:20,383
Yeah

1183
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:25,247
There's nothing really necessarily suspicious about the

1184
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,295
But you staying at incest

1185
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,063
Vicious weigh

1186
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,855
And Alex allows him to

1187
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:30,879
Give

1188
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,927
All sorts of unverified rumors

1189
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,719
On the show and respond to

1190
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,487
As if

1191
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:36,255
They means

1192
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,047
Here's where Alex

1193
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:38,815
It's gives his worth

1194
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:39,583
Response

1195
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:49,823
Multiple shooters

1196
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:00,575
This is how the people actually got on the property

1197
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:11,327
It's not that he's physically ill

1198
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:14,399
Any of the guy is saying

1199
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:16,191
He's physically ill about

1200
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,471
The like

1201
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:20,543
This amounts to the globalist

1202
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:23,615
So earlier in the show us

1203
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:28,991
This shoe

1204
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:31,295
And it's interesting

1205
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,415
Kirin are usually

1206
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:39,231
From an ego standpoint

1207
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,511
Yeah course

1208
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,351
Versions of that

1209
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:47,679
He wants a prayer

1210
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:51,775
But it's not a prayer for the victims

1211
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:53,567
At Sandy Hook

1212
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:58,431
It's sort of a broader prayer

1213
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:02,015
Google I'm calling for the sprayer

1214
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:03,807
He does implies

1215
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:07,135
That the children who were killed at that school

1216
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,671
Were the victims of the

1217
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,695
The globalist

1218
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:14,303
Prayer

1219
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,959
Very

1220
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:22,751
Elicit

1221
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:23,775
Betty's my

1222
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:30,175
Great you might as well say we need to have a prayer and hope that the gun used in the shooting is

1223
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:31,455
Is okay after the end

1224
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,479
Christ

1225
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:33,759
It's at

1226
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:36,319
My Lord please

1227
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:39,647
Put it into

1228
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:40,927
So that gun

1229
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,207
Can find a better home

1230
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,487
What an ass

1231
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:44,511
Totally

1232
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:47,327
You know Alex

1233
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,351
He's a good guy

1234
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,375
She loves to follow

1235
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,911
He's got to wherever

1236
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,959
Information

1237
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:02,431
And everything that happened

1238
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:12,927
You can hear that wavering in his voice

1239
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:13,695
Does a

1240
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:17,023
He's gotten telling him that this is

1241
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,583
Pretty over

1242
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,119
But

1243
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,167
Because we have to practice this

1244
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:25,727
Version of

1245
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,055
You have to take Alex at exactly

1246
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:31,615
That's still not him saying it was

1247
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:33,663
Right

1248
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:40,063
Hunt has never wronged his audience to accept

1249
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,367
His leanings are

1250
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:45,695
So when he says my gut based on all the time

1251
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:47,743
This stop my God is that it stays

1252
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:50,047
To me that's as good

1253
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:53,375
That's him saying

1254
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:54,655
Right guys

1255
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,471
This is not real

1256
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:59,263
Without him having

1257
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:05,663
At the very least everybody who listens to him is going to know what that mean

1258
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:06,943
That means

1259
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:07,711
Alex says

1260
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:12,319
Which is this this episode so far has been like

1261
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:18,463
I started out saying that he's 85% leading towards it being a false flag and everything he says

1262
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,231
Just goes up

1263
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:19,999
1%

1264
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,023
1%

1265
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,815
To where that is and we're like

1266
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:25,375
This is 99%

1267
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:28,703
I'm almost ready to say I'm so close

1268
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:35,103
Just talkin about the globalist

1269
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,639
And this is probably

1270
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:43,807
The government

1271
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:01,983
It's hard to escape what he's saying there

1272
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:07,103
And also eagle-eyed listeners will remember that when we talked about the Charleston Shoe

1273
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:09,663
His way of

1274
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:12,223
Deflecting from the horror of that

1275
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:13,759
Was to talk about abortion

1276
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,295
Yep.

1277
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:21,951
You know that that's his way of

1278
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:31,935
Could possibly

1279
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:38,335
You know what

1280
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:42,175
Got however many years of life they did they wish they could have killed him sooner

1281
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:42,943
Go fuc yourself

1282
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:47,295
I was going to say it's interesting but it's not

1283
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:52,159
Here

1284
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:58,303
Charleston performed with a f****** gun then we can have a conversation

1285
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:02,399
But until then you shut the goddamn f*** off

1286
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,959
Deflections the distraction

1287
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:07,519
That's interesting

1288
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:15,199
Noteworthy

1289
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,015
The

1290
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:25,695
I would say that you could easily hear the things that Alex is saying

1291
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:27,487
On to whatever is thrown in his face

1292
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:32,351
You know like he's just trying to keep a conversation

1293
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:37,983
Host sharks

1294
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:44,383
Possible

1295
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:47,199
We are in trouble

1296
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:56,415
It's all of it together first reports

1297
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,719
I'm not just saying things

1298
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,255
The timing

1299
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:03,839
That is leading me to believe that this is part of some sort of a globalist

1300
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:05,631
That's not good

1301
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:10,751
The Tell-Tale sign

1302
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,543
Of this being false flag

1303
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,615
The Tell-Tale sign

1304
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,663
Rhino the visit

1305
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:19,455
First Telltale

1306
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:20,479
It happened

1307
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:24,319
A gun was involved

1308
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:25,855
Done false flag

1309
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:28,927
You are more specific

1310
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,023
These

1311
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,047
Tell tale sign

1312
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:39,423
What are the hillside

1313
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:41,983
You're here Alex's

1314
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:45,823
That's not what

1315
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:52,991
What is the signs that you're talkin about

1316
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:58,623
Some years ago maybe when we would catch you see a lot of local police now you're seeing just

1317
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,391
I mean

1318
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:05,791
Dominated by fbins

1319
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:06,559
Always the same

1320
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:09,119
Is him saying it's

1321
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:12,703
Without

1322
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:16,031
Confirming to a collar

1323
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:16,799
That this is fake

1324
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:21,919
Yep. Beside you saw the time

1325
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:23,711
What are the telltale signs

1326
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,479
Keep talking about

1327
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:25,759
Because

1328
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:26,783
Local

1329
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,063
Responding to saying

1330
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:31,647
Let It Go

1331
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,975
That's what you said

1332
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:36,511
Connect the dots

1333
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:37,791
Fake

1334
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:40,607
I would say whatever crime this guy is

1335
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:41,375
Imagining

1336
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,399
From his younger days

1337
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,959
The scale of this crime

1338
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:46,751
It also doesn't match

1339
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:48,799
Breakfast

1340
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:52,127
The amount of resources that we're actually

1341
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,967
For assistance from State Police

1342
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:59,295
Obviously would be interested in

1343
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:02,623
The worst school shooting in American history at the time

1344
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:05,183
Yeah so we got that you have to say at the time

1345
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:07,999
None of that means

1346
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:10,559
No except for it means that Alex

1347
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:11,839
He's trying to

1348
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,191
That's insane

1349
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:17,983
Yep

1350
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,775
So

1351
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:21,055
You heard him say we have some guests

1352
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:22,591
Yeah earlier

1353
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:24,127
He's bumped

1354
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:26,175
Because when the reality of this

1355
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:29,759
He realize like I haven't got to talk about that

1356
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:31,295
He didn't bump one of them

1357
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:53,311
Hundred first Airborne Division for Weather Underground

1358
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:09,951
Larry was a Vietnam vet

1359
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:12,767
But he's most known as the

1360
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:14,815
He infiltrated the weather

1361
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:18,655
An uncovered a plot helmed by Bill Ayers and Bernardine dohrn

1362
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:20,959
Thoughts of America cultural revolution in America

1363
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:26,079
History education

1364
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:27,615
Therapy

1365
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:33,247
In-depth interview from 1980s

1366
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,271
Cubans in Russian

1367
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:36,831
Would stick to occupy part of the United States

1368
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:40,415
What's the weather

1369
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:42,207
Counter-revolution

1370
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:43,487
Which of course is supposed

1371
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:45,023
Alex's Patriot weird

1372
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,559
I don't

1373
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:50,911
He claims

1374
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:53,471
Members of The Weather Underground told him

1375
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:58,847
Not just going to go along and get on board with what they were doing

1376
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:01,407
Presumably because they were die-hard capitalist

1377
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,431
And also would need to

1378
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:08,575
Nothing has ever said about the weather underground or billares has ever been supported by anything other than

1379
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:15,487
There's no evidence of any of the stuff and since he was working as a mole for the FBI

1380
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:18,047
He was never wearing a wire

1381
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:21,119
You never produced anything Auto

1382
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:22,399
Corroborating Witnesses

1383
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,167
Come forward

1384
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:29,311
But that has not stopped him from being hero worship by the anti-communist propaganda circles that we cover

1385
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:32,639
They don't depend so much on actual evidence as they do

1386
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:33,407
Appearance of Eva

1387
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:39,551
It was exactly

1388
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:42,111
Kill all who oppose it

1389
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:43,391
Even in modern days

1390
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:47,231
Heather tentacles have been all the halls of Academia in America

1391
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:54,399
In 2016 when Alex Jones finally got to sit down with Bill Ayers

1392
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:56,191
If you recall it.

1393
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:56,959
Go well

1394
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:22,559
Much a creature of whatever whoever runs the justice department

1395
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:29,471
Preacher of the justice department

1396
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:33,823
All the justice department

1397
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:52,767
Military

1398
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:15,039
Education

1399
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:17,855
Interview

1400
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:21,695
The time that Larry Graf wall would have been working for the FBI

1401
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,487
469

1402
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:29,375
Well it was under the Richard Nixon

1403
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,983
Attorney general was John and Mitchell

1404
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:40,639
For those of you who don't know what John Mitchell got up to in his career

1405
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:46,783
In the lead-up to the 1968 election representatives of Nixon's campaign sabotage the Paris peace talks

1406
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,831
Effectively ended the Vietnam War

1407
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:52,159
They did this specifically to ensure that Nixon won the election

1408
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:57,535
Deal

1409
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:59,583
Menstration cut

1410
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:07,263
LBJ head recordings

1411
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:11,359
Richard Russell Mitchell was deeply involved

1412
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:12,639
Bradley

1413
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:19,039
Johnson allies.

1414
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:23,135
Because Dixon lacked the political baggage

1415
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:25,439
He could give them a better deal too

1416
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:27,743
The actions of John and Mitchell Lee.

1417
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:30,815
Pointless war that could have ended sooner

1418
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:31,839
I need it for

1419
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:33,375
Purely political motives

1420
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:38,239
You think that someone like Larry Graf wall of Vietnam vet would want to work with that kind of

1421
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:39,007
Forgot

1422
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:44,127
Did another call Menorah T leader Everett Dirksen

1423
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:47,199
Explicitly called Nixon's people were doing treason

1424
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:48,991
Twitch Dirksen reply quote

1425
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:49,759
I know

1426
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:51,551
At the time Mitchell was Nixon

1427
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:52,831
Campaign manager

1428
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:54,111
And ran operations

1429
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:55,391
For the campaign

1430
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:59,487
In February 1975 John Mitchell was also found guilty of

1431
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:04,607
Conspiracy obstruction of justice and perjury for his role in planning the Watergate break-in

1432
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:09,471
Throughout his time as Attorney General Mitchell

1433
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:10,239
Left-leaning

1434
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:12,799
Immediately after Nixon won the election

1435
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:16,640
You told a reporter quote this country is going so far to the right you won't

1436
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:22,272
And disrupt civil rights groups and anti-war groups at every

1437
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:23,040
Return

1438
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:27,136
Also he ran the committee for the re-election of the president or is

1439
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:33,280
Which was the fundraising arm of the Nixon 1972 reelection campaign

1440
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:35,328
But really was mostly about money laundering

1441
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:38,144
Creating burglars

1442
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:39,424
Interesting Lee

1443
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,472
Rodger Stone also works for creed

1444
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:43,264
Weird

1445
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:49,664
Given the circumstances

1446
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,688
Stock

1447
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:52,480
It what Larry grass wall says

1448
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:55,552
Absent any other proof I think bellairs explanation

1449
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:58,112
He's a liar who was paid by a criminal department of justice

1450
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:00,160
Probably the most sensible conclusion here

1451
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:02,208
Alex is just having it

1452
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:02,976
Even though

1453
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,256
Newsbroke

1454
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:08,608
Because Larry story helps build Alex's building a budding narrative

1455
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,144
Sandy Hook shooting was

1456
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:12,960
Larry story was that in order to

1457
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:14,752
Fit their desires

1458
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:17,824
The Weather Underground was willing to kill 25 million

1459
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:19,616
It's not true

1460
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:24,736
But it goes a long way toward helping a struggling audience come to terms with the idea

1461
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:28,832
Fifties people would also be willing to kill children in order to reach their goal

1462
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:31,136
What I'm saying is that the fact that out

1463
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:32,928
Bob Larry grass wall

1464
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,720
Involves other people speak

1465
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:35,488
Volume

1466
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:36,512
About his intent

1467
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,816
He has this guy on

1468
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:40,352
Because he knows that there is a

1469
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:46,752
He had it planned anyway that's probably a happy coincidence or whatever because he knows that there's

1470
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:48,032
Something that will help

1471
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:50,336
Speed of a narrative that he's working on

1472
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:51,104
In

1473
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,384
Continuing the interview

1474
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:53,408
And I think

1475
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:55,200
Like I said I think that speaks

1476
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:57,504
Yeah

1477
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:02,112
It's never not important to point out that the Weather Underground

1478
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:06,208
Really far out of their way to try not to hurt

1479
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,864
Really far out of their way to try not to hurt people as far as terrorist organizations go

1480
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,656
They were really going for

1481
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:15,424
0 cash

1482
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:21,824
You with eco-terrorists and Diana

1483
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:22,848
Things go

1484
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,408
Generally

1485
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:27,968
Anytime they hurt anybody even

1486
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:28,736
It's a

1487
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,784
Profound mistakes

1488
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:32,576
There's planning involved

1489
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:34,368
Just property damage

1490
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,160
Yep

1491
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,232
Some sort of a symbolic

1492
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:43,328
Most of the terrorism

1493
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:49,728
Very probably the broad brush but

1494
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:51,776
Rules Etc

1495
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:52,800
Terrorist

1496
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:54,336
That exist

1497
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:56,640
That's very different

1498
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:06,880
All that up and wanted to talk about the history of the people that live

1499
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:08,160
Because they don't

1500
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,696
Fit whatever

1501
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:13,024
Benign version Alex would like to

1502
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:14,560
His work

1503
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:17,888
And Alex

1504
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:18,912
It shouldn't be

1505
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:20,704
He shouldn't likely regret

1506
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,008
Mitchell

1507
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:27,360
What he presents himself to be should be

1508
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:29,152
Super against this guy

1509
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,432
Buddies.

1510
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:31,712
Because it suited them

1511
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:32,480
Pinterest

1512
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:34,528
Like I said

1513
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,064
Specifically because

1514
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,112
Weather Underground narrative

1515
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:40,416
It says that they wanted to kill 25

1516
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:42,208
Which Alex says

1517
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:44,512
Yeah

1518
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:45,536
All that stuff

1519
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:46,304
Is 2

1520
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,328
Acclimate

1521
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,096
The audience

1522
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:50,144
He would kill children

1523
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,424
Right and I

1524
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,960
It's soon as I heard

1525
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:56,032
He didn't bump I was like that's what he's doing

1526
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:56,800
I get it

1527
01:23:58,848 --> 01:23:59,616
I heard this clip

1528
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:01,920
I was like haha you son of a b****

1529
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:08,320
Larry what's Your Gut on this right now

1530
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:19,328
You son of a b**** that was you do

1531
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:21,632
Fast

1532
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,936
You know what do you know it's fascinating

1533
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:26,752
The reason it's so

1534
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:30,080
LBJ probably could have been re-elected

1535
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:35,200
His memoirs

1536
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:40,576
He could have been re-elected

1537
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:43,904
I know Nick's

1538
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:47,232
Like

1539
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:50,560
And was also like when he was calling what they were doing treason

1540
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,936
I don't think it should enter the campaign

1541
01:24:56,192 --> 01:25:02,336
World

1542
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,224
That should not

1543
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,528
Do we should not talk about this topic you know

1544
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:15,904
I'm only talking to you about that

1545
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:20,000
What is one of the reasons run is because

1546
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,608
Because of his family's history

1547
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,912
Of dying

1548
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:28,960
That he would die within 4 years

1549
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:31,264
What are the reasons he didn't run it because

1550
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:34,848
He said that the American people had enough presidents died in office

1551
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:43,552
Year that is doctors predicted is that nuts

1552
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:45,344
President

1553
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,464
To rewrite history

1554
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:54,048
The Paris peace talks to begin

1555
01:25:54,304 --> 01:26:00,192
That it would

1556
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:01,472
Conclusion we imagine

1557
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:02,752
Right

1558
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:04,288
Is Fantasy of Lights

1559
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:08,384
War ended exactly

1560
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:12,224
Notes from the fact

1561
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,760
Right

1562
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:16,064
Difficulty doing that s***

1563
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,344
A one of them

1564
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,624
Was John Mitchell

1565
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:22,464
Who was the head of the Attorney General

1566
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,232
Who

1567
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,792
The buck stops with him right

1568
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:28,608
Whatever Larry grass

1569
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:33,472
History

1570
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:36,288
Is almost never like

1571
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:39,360
The right-wing didn't get his ass

1572
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:40,640
You know what I'm saying

1573
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:44,224
Like an American history so often are are like

1574
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:48,832
Here was the moment

1575
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:55,232
You don't like we always do

1576
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:58,816
Murdered the moment that their popularity was at their highest

1577
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:01,120
Somebody murdered

1578
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:03,168
It is it is one of those like

1579
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:09,824
Motherfuking right-wing assholes always say all if we do this we're going to get killed in

1580
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:16,224
Claimed actively talked

1581
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,248
Enemies

1582
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:23,648
They get appointed as ambassador to Venezuela

1583
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:28,000
President

1584
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:29,024
Especially

1585
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:32,352
Life

1586
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,120
Not make

1587
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:33,888
This

1588
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:34,912
F****** ugly

1589
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:37,216
Right let's find a way to deal with this

1590
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:39,008
Like behind-the-scenes cuz

1591
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:42,336
Let's Roll.

1592
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:47,712
Otherwise we will have two charges against that would be fun

1593
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:51,296
So

1594
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:52,320
Just because

1595
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,088
I think

1596
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:55,136
Interesting and I haven't heard an episode

1597
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:57,440
Larry actually shows up

1598
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:59,488
His. Cuz he dies

1599
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:02,304
Huey died by the time

1600
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,584
Most of our episodes

1601
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:05,376
Cover like a nut

1602
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:06,400
2015

1603
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:07,168
Panera

1604
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:09,216
Alex talks about interviewing his daughter

1605
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:11,264
And stuff like that

1606
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:15,616
When you ask me

1607
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:16,640
Does Alex

1608
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:20,992
His response when I asked him

1609
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:22,528
Based on your experience

1610
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:25,344
With the weather kill 25

1611
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,112
Do you think

1612
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:28,160
In order to get R Gun

1613
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:29,952
The end of

1614
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,000
Very long

1615
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:36,096
But at the same time

1616
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:37,376
I can imagine

1617
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:38,400
What it must be like for

1618
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:40,704
Answer keys

1619
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:46,336
Solaria even even me pathological liar Larry Graf wall

1620
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:47,872
Have to say this is

1621
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:48,640
Is f***** up

1622
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:53,760
Expresses more of that cumin

1623
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:55,296
You want to hear

1624
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:56,064
Yeah

1625
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:00,928
So Alex next clip

1626
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:04,512
What's up

1627
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,168
So in this next clip Alex

1628
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:11,936
I mean again

1629
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:13,472
Just all insinuation

1630
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:23,712
Comes into a second term

1631
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,248
Smells

1632
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:26,784
Just quit

1633
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:27,552
Teething

1634
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:32,416
Just quit f******

1635
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:35,488
Do it just do what you want to do and say it

1636
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,536
You have no conscience

1637
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:39,328
Do it or don't

1638
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:42,400
This is an example

1639
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:48,800
Yeah this sort of

1640
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:51,360
With my nipples

1641
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:56,736
So in a text when we were talking about earlier the idea that like there's mist

1642
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:57,760
Recording early

1643
01:29:58,528 --> 01:30:00,064
And that that sort of thing happen

1644
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:02,624
Alex is now going to church

1645
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:03,648
The ideas

1646
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:05,184
The people had reported

1647
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,208
Various thing

1648
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:08,256
Like there's talk that there might be a second

1649
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,096
To the surface

1650
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:14,400
They realize it was that report of the second

1651
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:20,288
They're going back and correcting their story

1652
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:21,824
Alex interpret

1653
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:26,688
Scrubbing the internet

1654
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:30,016
Use that as a correlation

1655
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:32,576
Articles

1656
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:38,720
Health Ranger

1657
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:40,000
From the news

1658
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:53,056
That was going to

1659
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:53,824
Verdad

1660
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:56,896
Is also not suspicious

1661
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:58,432
But

1662
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,344
Where there's smoke there's fire

1663
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:10,720
Drill

1664
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:15,840
He's making of like if there was a drill then it's fake

1665
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:23,008
Also there's a bunch of other things that I'll accept it

1666
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:29,408
And I will say this is fake please DeGraw or whatever

1667
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:35,296
French things and established

1668
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:36,832
Sprint

1669
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:38,880
That would be the things that is like

1670
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:40,160
Beyond The Pale

1671
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:48,096
Ironic How concerned he is about the parents of the Vic

1672
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:55,776
I mean like before that we went we need to talk to them before they get harassed

1673
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:59,104
Work at the school

1674
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:03,712
Yeah

1675
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:12,416
Play situations

1676
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:17,024
Implies that he believes that

1677
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:21,888
We're talkin about that clip

1678
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:23,936
The only way that that Clinton

1679
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:24,704
Makes sense

1680
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:26,240
Because he's saying

1681
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:28,288
We need to talk to them before they get threatened

1682
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:30,080
Was there a drill there

1683
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,128
The only way you

1684
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:33,920
Is if you

1685
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:34,688
Believe

1686
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:36,224
With no evidence that there

1687
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,760
Was a drill there

1688
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:39,296
And

1689
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,064
Threatened

1690
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:41,600
In order to cover it up

1691
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,136
Tell if there is no evidence

1692
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:47,744
It means that you didn't get there quick enough and everyone's been threatened

1693
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,560
And if someone tells you that there was a drills

1694
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:52,864
I do still think

1695
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,400
He's on the right side

1696
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:55,936
Legality

1697
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:56,960
Probably

1698
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:57,728
At this point

1699
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,264
It's kind of hard to say

1700
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,288
Because of what

1701
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,312
What are you saying

1702
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:02,848
Plies and you know how is Audie

1703
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:05,920
Yeah

1704
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:07,968
In the 2015

1705
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,248
Go back to

1706
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:12,320
Event

1707
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:13,344
It's all actors

1708
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:17,440
Absolute

1709
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,256
What do you say

1710
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:22,560
Ambivalent

1711
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:27,168
Ambivalent cowardly

1712
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:31,776
I think it's one of those things where this were an isolated incident

1713
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:32,544
You could

1714
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,312
Say

1715
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:34,592
He's protect

1716
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:41,760
But if we were going to if we work more heat anyone else anyone else we were doing

1717
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:44,832
In this if this was court case where he anyone else you'd say

1718
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:54,304
You'd hope so

1719
01:33:56,608 --> 01:34:01,728
Kind of blew it on a little bit of that sorry about that

1720
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:04,032
With our contact

1721
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:06,080
Text with all of what we've put together

1722
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:11,712
This one show where he doesn't even explicitly say I feel like we could prove

1723
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:13,248
Beyond A Reasonable Doubt

1724
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:15,296
That he was committing a crime on this show

1725
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:16,832
I think it's

1726
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:18,112
It's a borderline

1727
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:18,880
It's close

1728
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:22,464
I don't know I'm not I don't I think

1729
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,768
Spiritually and intent wise

1730
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:27,072
Yeah the intent is there for sure

1731
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:28,352
Butternut Tree the actor

1732
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:29,888
Yeah

1733
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:30,656
But

1734
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:34,240
Let's put all that aside

1735
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:36,288
For a second because

1736
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:37,056
Journal

1737
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:39,360
And tell me what kind of

1738
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:40,896
Any thinks what he's doing is

1739
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:41,664
Is reporting

1740
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:44,480
Like that

1741
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:46,016
It's the one I heard this neck

1742
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:47,296
Clip I was like

1743
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:48,576
No one

1744
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:49,600
Would ever

1745
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:51,648
If they cared

1746
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:52,416
About

1747
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:54,464
No one would

1748
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,232
Ever

1749
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:57,792
Put this call to action into the world

1750
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:59,840
If they were interested in reporting

1751
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:00,864
The actual

1752
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:01,632
Fact

1753
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,704
Big-ticket takes

1754
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:06,752
Let's play

1755
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:13,152
I don't know someone stole a loaf of bread from Jacob Street

1756
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:15,712
Fine

1757
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:24,928
Whatever happened

1758
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:26,464
They would never do something

1759
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:28,000
This next clip

1760
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:28,768
Grossed me out

1761
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:39,520
News reports

1762
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:54,112
So he's written memo I believe or what

1763
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:55,904
Aaron Dykes one of those guys

1764
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,696
His written article enemies

1765
01:35:57,952 --> 01:35:59,744
The Second Amendment will exploit

1766
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,024
Connecticut

1767
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:01,792
Good shooting

1768
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:03,072
That's the article

1769
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:04,864
So that is already

1770
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:11,008
Leave your comment

1771
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:14,080
That article and I

1772
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:17,152
You wouldn't do that if you wanted real information

1773
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:20,992
Who the f*** is going to leave like a comment on that article that's going to be

1774
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:23,552
If you ever read the Infowars comment

1775
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:27,648
It's insane never do that a lot of spam

1776
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:34,304
Large sunglasses

1777
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,072
Question for you

1778
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:38,656
Is Trump doing a great job or is he doing

1779
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:42,240
The greatest job

1780
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:46,592
Trump email

1781
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:48,384
It is not

1782
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:49,664
If you want to get information

1783
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,712
On the show

1784
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:53,504
The day of Sandy Hook being like

1785
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:55,552
We got this article with a

1786
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:57,088
Very bias headline

1787
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:58,880
And what we want is

1788
01:36:59,136 --> 01:37:03,232
Put on the air like no one

1789
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:04,256
I would do that picture

1790
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,280
No one

1791
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:06,304
That is

1792
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:11,424
To the idea that he cares

1793
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:13,216
Sprite

1794
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:16,800
Drama

1795
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:19,616
Yeah I guess

1796
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:24,480
Get people to go to article engagement

1797
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:30,880
You've always wanted to be on my show but you have been able to call yet been able to get through well guess what if you comment

1798
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:31,904
This article

1799
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:34,720
Then I will take that and I will read it

1800
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:41,120
On-air think about how famous you Dan will personally because Alex

1801
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:47,264
Will read out your b******* on air

1802
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:50,848
Painfully siniakova probably accurate

1803
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:54,432
Bentley

1804
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:56,992
Drum up more traffic to your site the only reason

1805
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:57,760
Damn

1806
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:01,856
Goddamn

1807
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:02,624
The great Rite

1808
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:05,184
I never really thought about that I just thought it was like

1809
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,976
I want more contact

1810
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:09,792
And I don't care where it comes from

1811
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:15,168
But you probably

1812
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:16,960
This is this is a rare

1813
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:18,752
Circumstance

1814
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:20,032
That's where I'm going

1815
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:22,336
Get a lot of interest

1816
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:25,152
If I can funnel them to my website

1817
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:31,040
Explode well I mean it's like nothing drives up gun sales more than a mass shooting

1818
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:32,832
So there is a

1819
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:34,624
There is a very real

1820
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:41,024
Tangible monetary interest that all of the gun manufacturers have in making sure guns

1821
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,304
Got mass shooting

1822
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:43,584
Continue to happen

1823
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:46,400
Yeah it dropped so brutally cynical

1824
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:50,240
Is it that probably what's going

1825
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,800
Maybe it is and maybe that

1826
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:53,568
Part of the couch

1827
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:54,848
He's going through

1828
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:55,616
Use wrestling

1829
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:57,408
Where do I live

1830
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:58,688
And now by this point

1831
01:38:58,944 --> 01:38:59,968
In the show he's realized

1832
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:02,272
This could

1833
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:03,296
Help

1834
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:05,600
This could really help right

1835
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:07,136
Forget it on the map

1836
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:08,672
Right everyone goes to

1837
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:09,440
To the website

1838
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:10,208
Comet

1839
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,488
Maybe we get

1840
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:13,792
1000 ship comment

1841
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:17,888
But one guy run with or whatever

1842
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:19,680
Then that thousand comments

1843
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:22,240
Thousand

1844
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:23,520
Actual hits

1845
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:24,288
Debs

1846
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:26,080
Install more AdSense

1847
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:32,736
I mean it is it is very much like there's no if you recorded everything that the CEO of

1848
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:34,272
Smith & Wesson ever said

1849
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:35,808
There is no way

1850
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:37,344
That he is never said

1851
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:44,000
I'm kind of happy every time a mass shooting happens because their sales go up

1852
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:46,560
He's been like

1853
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:48,352
Mass shootings are great for business

1854
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:53,984
Save that dumb dumb had to do like four hours of radio today

1855
01:39:57,568 --> 01:39:58,080
Prediction

1856
01:39:58,336 --> 01:39:58,848
About what

1857
01:39:59,104 --> 01:39:59,616
Is going to happen

1858
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:02,688
Cuz of this Sandy Hook shooting

1859
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:06,016
This is very interesting

1860
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:15,488
Because

1861
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:17,280
I agree

1862
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:21,120
Grass wall

1863
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:22,912
Alex

1864
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:25,472
If they hype this up

1865
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:28,032
There will be real that shoot up school

1866
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:34,432
Have we seen any examples of him or have all school shootings

1867
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:35,456
But

1868
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:37,248
Even take that aside

1869
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:42,624
The implicit thing that he saying is that this one isn't a real.

1870
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:46,208
Inspired

1871
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:47,488
Which

1872
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:49,536
You just have

1873
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:51,584
How to cut through a little bit of what

1874
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:52,352
Are you saying

1875
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:53,632
Without saying

1876
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:55,936
And realize like this is the

1877
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:57,984
Absolutely

1878
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:02,080
Michelle Alex takes a call

1879
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:03,104
From somebody who

1880
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:03,872
Cousin

1881
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,152
Teacher

1882
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:06,432
It's Sandy Hook Elementary

1883
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:09,504
I don't know if that's

1884
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:11,808
No idea faster

1885
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:12,576
Could be

1886
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:16,672
The benefit of doubt

1887
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:18,976
The benefit of the doubt is not given

1888
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:22,560
To an Infowars listener giving a second-hand information

1889
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:24,096
From a cousin

1890
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:33,312
I will never act on the information that's being provided by this guy

1891
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:35,872
Infowars collars who prison-like

1892
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:42,528
Red flags

1893
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:44,832
Back to the school

1894
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:46,112
But unfortunately

1895
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:47,904
Defensive

1896
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:49,696
About the idea that

1897
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:50,464
Like he thinks it

1898
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:53,024
Steak and other people are not thrilled

1899
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:53,792
Oh that's not good

1900
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:00,960
Amateur information

1901
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:05,312
Is going to hell in a handbasket

1902
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:07,104
Alex

1903
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:10,176
I'll try to make it quick Barbershop

1904
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:15,552
I got a text message from my phone about a shooting at elementary school

1905
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:18,112
I live in New York I went to college in Connecticut

1906
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:22,976
Call my my roommate who I went to school with to make sure his daughter was okay

1907
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:25,792
Emily told me that the school was in Newton

1908
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:27,584
You're very

1909
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:29,888
My mom texted me

1910
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:33,728
And she said oh my God that scary School carries my cousin

1911
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:38,080
Call house

1912
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:41,408
I know that we want to

1913
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:47,552
Doubt all of Alex's callers in

1914
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:48,320
Charismatic

1915
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:49,088
Exact

1916
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:52,672
That is not how your brain works when you have a square

1917
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:58,048
First-year pitching

1918
01:42:58,304 --> 01:43:00,608
Oh I realize that detailed

1919
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:04,704
How people communicate

1920
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:07,520
His his passes the smell test

1921
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:11,104
I can believe him on the fact and also disbelieve him on the

1922
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,408
Interpretation

1923
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:18,016
At the barbershop in this job

1924
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:22,112
And I said I'm not saying that it wasn't but I wouldn't put it past them and they were like

1925
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:26,976
Do they kill innocent children and I said excuse me I said abortion

1926
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:33,376
Taxis in poisoning food and water these people are Satan

1927
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:42,848
So he's reinforcing this caller who may or may not have a cousin who worked

1928
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:43,616
At the school

1929
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:45,664
Yeah who's the false flag

1930
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:46,688
Because of listening

1931
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:48,736
The barbershop

1932
01:43:49,504 --> 01:43:51,296
Hold on why would you do that

1933
01:43:56,928 --> 01:43:57,696
That should be

1934
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:00,768
Trying to bring this

1935
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:01,536
As opposed to

1936
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:02,560
Reinforcing the

1937
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:05,632
So far the only Heroes

1938
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:07,424
In this story are

1939
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:09,728
Barber shop

1940
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:13,056
You're f****** crazy dude so that's really weird like

1941
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:16,384
Responding to these people who

1942
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,152
Dealing with

1943
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:18,688
Like that guy's dealing

1944
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:19,712
Some s***

1945
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:22,784
Like on a personal level

1946
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,064
He's got to be strong

1947
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:26,624
Like it cousin was it

1948
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:27,648
Right

1949
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:28,672
He has a connection

1950
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:30,464
What's collagen

1951
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:31,744
Look at that.

1952
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:34,048
And I was like yeah

1953
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:39,424
All reinforcing

1954
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:42,496
The Prelude to staying

1955
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:43,776
And I know

1956
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:44,800
It's such a

1957
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:46,336
And there isn't

1958
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:47,360
Necessarily

1959
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:48,896
A strong payoff

1960
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:51,712
To even when we're going to end this episode

1961
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:53,504
Of him being like

1962
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:55,808
Anything but

1963
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:57,600
He's doing

1964
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:59,648
Is interesting

1965
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:00,672
Because

1966
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:02,464
Because of his personal care

1967
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,256
He knows

1968
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:05,280
That it is

1969
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:07,072
Because his cousin

1970
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:08,096
Is it

1971
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:09,888
His concern

1972
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:13,472
His text to all of his family members into his friend

1973
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:16,544
From college are from a very real place of

1974
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:18,336
Did it happen

1975
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:19,360
These kids

1976
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:20,640
Were killed

1977
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:24,736
He's not in the fall he's he's in the false flag but in that

1978
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:25,504
All the kills

1979
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:27,040
All the kids were actually

1980
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:27,808
Murdered

1981
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:28,576
It's not

1982
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:30,624
Crisis actors or anything like that

1983
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:33,696
So it's fascinating for him to call in

1984
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:39,072
When we know that Alex is going to that all of these people work

1985
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:40,096
Right

1986
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:42,400
Because he's getting first-hand

1987
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:46,240
Borderline

1988
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,776
From a first-hand stores

1989
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:50,336
That everybody really is dead

1990
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:52,128
Uno

1991
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:53,408
The difficulty of being

1992
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:56,224
Because there are so many

1993
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:57,504
Conspiracy

1994
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,040
You could take ya

1995
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:00,576
And maybe that's part of Alex

1996
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:02,112
Is

1997
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:04,672
Where is the line I draw

1998
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:06,976
Or is it

1999
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:08,512
That the globalist

2000
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:11,584
Put the shooter into the school or is it

2001
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:14,912
That he was a real shooter and then they covered it up

2002
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,240
Doesn't quite know exactly

2003
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:19,520
Glee what

2004
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:20,800
Yeah

2005
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:24,640
On one level you just want somebody to

2006
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:25,920
Straight up

2007
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:26,688
And

2008
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:27,968
Like deal with the

2009
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:29,248
The fact is there

2010
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:31,040
There's tacos

2011
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:32,064
They're being to shoot

2012
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:33,088
We'll see

2013
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:34,112
If the facts

2014
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:38,464
Yeah

2015
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:40,000
Then there's another version

2016
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:41,280
Alex

2017
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:42,304
Future Self

2018
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:43,584
That is

2019
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:45,120
F****** aggressive

2020
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:46,144
And just I don't

2021
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,424
Give a s***

2022
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:48,448
F*** you

2023
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:51,520
If ya go fuc yourself

2024
01:46:52,032 --> 01:46:53,056
He's not doing either of those

2025
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:54,592
He's playing the fence

2026
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:55,872
Cuz he needs to buy this

2027
01:46:57,408 --> 01:46:58,944
Because exactly what you said

2028
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:00,480
Hour-and-a-half

2029
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:02,528
You knows it's

2030
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:04,320
And there is a

2031
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:05,856
Part of him

2032
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:08,416
Knows he's going

2033
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:09,184
To do what

2034
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:10,464
Yeah

2035
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:12,768
From a very

2036
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:14,304
Exposed

2037
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,328
Purely

2038
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:16,608
Practically

2039
01:47:16,864 --> 01:47:17,632
Moral

2040
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:18,912
Questioning

2041
01:47:20,448 --> 01:47:20,960
Is it

2042
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:21,728
Worse

2043
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:23,264
If he

2044
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:25,056
Knows it's real

2045
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:26,592
And then lies about it

2046
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:28,384
Or is it worse

2047
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:31,200
Doesn't know it

2048
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:33,248
And lies about it

2049
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:39,904
Do you know what I mean

2050
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:44,000
Utilitarians generally

2051
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:46,304
Results

2052
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:52,448
Yeah I would say no

2053
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:56,288
You're doing it makes it worse

2054
01:47:58,336 --> 01:47:58,848
Equivalent

2055
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:01,408
Pictures of knowingly doing this or

2056
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:06,784
Mr. Magoo

2057
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,320
The end result is the same

2058
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,392
But if you

2059
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:12,672
You know what you're doing

2060
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:15,232
You are there is a will Baha'i

2061
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:18,816
We talked about all the time

2062
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:19,584
The idea of

2063
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:20,864
People who are Bad Axe

2064
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:23,680
Position like

2065
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:24,960
That is

2066
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:32,128
Yeah that's enshrined in our legal system

2067
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:35,200
That that winter that libel is

2068
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:38,272
Intent intent it does come in

2069
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:39,808
Legal death

2070
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:41,856
I think

2071
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:42,624
Yeah for sure

2072
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:45,952
I think we've proven that Alex's intent is to lie about

2073
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:48,000
I don't know if we

2074
01:48:48,256 --> 01:48:50,304
Proven it but we've seen strong indication

2075
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:56,704
Fair enough

2076
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:59,008
Presidente

2077
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:02,592
I ruin the fun of a lot of these things

2078
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:03,872
Because just like sticks

2079
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:05,920
Hold on

2080
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:07,456
I know that

2081
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:10,528
I know that there's a

2082
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:15,648
But this point I don't

2083
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:16,416
We can't

2084
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:17,952
I think that what we have is

2085
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:19,744
Very

2086
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:20,512
Very

2087
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:21,792
Very strong in

2088
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:25,120
That he wants to lie about this

2089
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:25,888
And his

2090
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:27,424
Vestigial

2091
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:28,704
Oregon

2092
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:30,752
Decency

2093
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:32,800
Humanity

2094
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:42,016
Emotion inside of it says three vertebrae that stick out from his ass

2095
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:44,320
A little bit too far his

2096
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:45,344
It is weird

2097
01:49:49,184 --> 01:49:55,072
Tonsil tonsils of morality

2098
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:00,448
20 seconds

2099
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:01,984
I would tell you the truth

2100
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:02,752
For sure

2101
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:05,056
For sure

2102
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:07,360
That's the struggle that you have

2103
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:09,664
Struggling a noble

2104
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:16,320
Oh hell no

2105
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:17,600
I didn't expect Define

2106
01:50:18,368 --> 01:50:19,392
Like when I look back

2107
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:22,208
Like what I expected

2108
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:23,744
Because I listen to

2109
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:24,768
The Boston bombing

2110
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:26,304
I am here

2111
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:32,960
Right

2112
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:34,240
Is it happen

2113
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:35,264
He's just like

2114
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:39,616
Which is like this is the turning

2115
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:41,664
Because the Boston bombing was after

2116
01:50:42,176 --> 01:50:45,248
Exactly this is the point where he had that

2117
01:50:45,504 --> 01:50:48,832
Like moral to here are two paths to go down

2118
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:51,136
It's possible that you know

2119
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:53,184
And maybe that's what you don't expect to see

2120
01:50:53,696 --> 01:50:57,024
You go back to the actual date things I'm super grateful

2121
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:01,120
Because I did expect

2122
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:02,656
That

2123
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:03,936
Boston bombing

2124
01:51:04,192 --> 01:51:06,240
Episode

2125
01:51:06,496 --> 01:51:08,800
Yeah

2126
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:10,592
Is this

2127
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:11,872
Wishi-washi and Bev

2128
01:51:12,384 --> 01:51:12,896
Whatever

2129
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:15,968
Like you can hear him obviously

2130
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:19,040
But not

2131
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:20,320
Demonizing

2132
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:21,344
Children

2133
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:26,976
This is the David Anakin kills

2134
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:28,768
Like this moment

2135
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:30,560
We're watching this man

2136
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:39,776
He was dark before though

2137
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:40,800
That's true

2138
01:51:41,568 --> 01:51:42,080
Yeah

2139
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:45,920
Can all

2140
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:52,576
Yeah I mean there is.

2141
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:58,208
Represent

2142
01:51:58,464 --> 01:52:01,024
Alright

2143
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:04,096
What about the

2144
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:09,728
Is that are cheap

2145
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:20,992
Will you ever

2146
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:23,296
I do think it's interesting

2147
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:24,320
Because I

2148
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:25,856
You think there's a demarcation

2149
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:28,160
Like

2150
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:29,184
This is part of

2151
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:30,464
Like I said

2152
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:32,256
Think I think that when

2153
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:33,024
You accept

2154
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:35,584
Lying about Sandy Hook

2155
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:37,120
For opportunist

2156
01:52:38,656 --> 01:52:40,192
You definitely put yourself

2157
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:41,472
Send a position where like

2158
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:43,008
You are

2159
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:45,312
You're too far gone

2160
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:46,592
Mike

2161
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:50,944
I think it's possible

2162
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:52,992
Enter a realm of like

2163
01:52:53,504 --> 01:52:59,648
I have no soul which makes this doubly fascinating in that this might actually be the one

2164
01:52:59,904 --> 01:53:00,416
Instead

2165
01:53:00,928 --> 01:53:03,744
Really delineates the Alex of

2166
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,280
The past

2167
01:53:05,536 --> 01:53:06,048
2009

2168
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:07,072
Who was

2169
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:12,192
Still an a****** but he was also that whimsical

2170
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:16,544
Who is Montresor which is

2171
01:53:17,568 --> 01:53:19,360
Irredeemable

2172
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:22,176
And we'll see

2173
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:23,200
I don't know

2174
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:24,992
We'll see I think it's very

2175
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:27,552
I don't know what

2176
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:28,576
I don't know what it is

2177
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:29,856
Cuz it's too simplistic

2178
01:53:30,112 --> 01:53:31,392
Shredz

2179
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:33,952
Nascent Humanity

2180
01:53:34,464 --> 01:53:35,232
Because I think

2181
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:38,560
We should call ourselves

2182
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:41,120
We are probably giving way too much credit.

2183
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:45,472
Or or what

2184
01:53:45,728 --> 01:53:49,568
Right.

2185
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:51,104
That's our interpretation

2186
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:57,504
And of course there's business people search

2187
01:53:58,784 --> 01:54:00,320
But we could also be wrong

2188
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:01,088
And be given

2189
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:06,208
Trying to figure out

2190
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:07,232
Where's the money

2191
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:13,376
Where is the money angle he could be just restrain himself because

2192
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:14,144
Look

2193
01:54:18,496 --> 01:54:19,776
Market vest

2194
01:54:20,288 --> 01:54:20,800
What is the

2195
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:21,568
The best way to

2196
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:23,104
You do it I don't want it

2197
01:54:23,616 --> 01:54:26,688
I don't want to stay at if Y is more profitable

2198
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:28,992
And I'm not sure which is yet

2199
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:30,272
Gotta

2200
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:36,928
Surroundings it's possible

2201
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:45,632
This is a human being or operating from Human impulses

2202
01:54:46,144 --> 01:54:52,288
It's so much easier for us to empathize with the guy that we talked about on a daily basis

2203
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:53,824
For several years now

2204
01:54:54,336 --> 01:54:56,640
If he has that moment

2205
01:54:57,152 --> 01:54:58,432
Long pause

2206
01:54:58,688 --> 01:55:04,832
Because he experienced

2207
01:55:05,088 --> 01:55:06,368
For us to actually

2208
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:08,416
Really

2209
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:12,512
Finally put the nail in the coffin of this is a human without

2210
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:16,096
Human empathy or impulses or anything whatsoever

2211
01:55:16,608 --> 01:55:17,376
Because if

2212
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:18,912
Pause

2213
01:55:19,424 --> 01:55:20,192
Is

2214
01:55:20,704 --> 01:55:21,216
Purely

2215
01:55:21,472 --> 01:55:21,984
Prophet Bass

2216
01:55:23,008 --> 01:55:25,312
Then this is a non-human

2217
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:26,592
Like this is a

2218
01:55:26,848 --> 01:55:28,384
This is a pure

2219
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:29,408
Serial killer

2220
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:32,736
The salesman

2221
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:37,600
Morlock

2222
01:55:37,856 --> 01:55:40,160
Show Alex

2223
01:55:40,416 --> 01:55:41,440
He's like he's taken

2224
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:42,208
Calls

2225
01:55:42,976 --> 01:55:43,744
He's done his business

2226
01:55:44,768 --> 01:55:45,536
People about

2227
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:48,608
He has a report

2228
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:49,888
Is a special report

2229
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:52,448
But he

2230
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:53,472
Put together

2231
01:55:53,984 --> 01:55:55,008
About the Mayan apocalypse

2232
01:55:55,520 --> 01:56:01,664
It's coming up December 2012 versus whenever it's going to go down

2233
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:06,528
The end of the show

2234
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:08,064
He does this

2235
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:09,600
He throws to this

2236
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:13,696
5-minute Special Report

2237
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:18,304
Worst day for it's a follow-up I think that he

2238
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:21,376
So much work into

2239
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:22,144
He's like

2240
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:24,192
There's no goddamn

2241
01:56:24,448 --> 01:56:26,240
We're not bumping it

2242
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:27,776
Dickies like

2243
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:29,568
Zoodnews

2244
01:56:29,824 --> 01:56:30,592
I'm out of my league

2245
01:56:32,384 --> 01:56:34,176
Yeah

2246
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:37,504
You coming out

2247
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:38,784
Get off air

2248
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:40,320
So he just goes to

2249
01:56:40,832 --> 01:56:41,600
Dispatcher

2250
01:56:49,536 --> 01:56:50,560
12

2251
01:56:51,328 --> 01:56:55,680
21st is not the end of the world

2252
01:56:57,472 --> 01:56:58,240
He skips a

2253
01:56:59,264 --> 01:57:03,872
In order to play this special report wow

2254
01:57:05,408 --> 01:57:10,016
The end of the world but guess what

2255
01:57:10,272 --> 01:57:12,576
Vaccines

2256
01:57:13,344 --> 01:57:17,696
No it's just a special report was like the Mayan apocalypse shoes bulshit but also

2257
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:24,096
Afraid of all the things

2258
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:26,400
It's one of those weird things.

2259
01:57:26,656 --> 01:57:27,936
He's trying to tell you

2260
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:31,008
Be cool.

2261
01:57:31,264 --> 01:57:34,848
You know who's afraid of the buying apocalypse

2262
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:36,384
Liberal Liberal

2263
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:38,432
Don't get into

2264
01:57:40,736 --> 01:57:43,296
It's that s***

2265
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:44,576
Are tripping out next

2266
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:46,112
It's a super long report

2267
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:46,880
It goes

2268
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:48,928
Across the commercial break

2269
01:57:49,184 --> 01:57:52,000
And then in the final minutes of the show

2270
01:57:52,256 --> 01:57:53,024
Alex says

2271
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:54,816
To try and like

2272
01:57:55,072 --> 01:57:55,584
Bring thing

2273
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:56,352
Home

2274
01:58:04,032 --> 01:58:09,408
22 children at Connecticut

2275
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:21,184
That is a inside job

2276
01:58:24,256 --> 01:58:25,536
Money

2277
01:58:26,048 --> 01:58:29,632
That's what I said I said

2278
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:34,752
Melissa

2279
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:36,288
And daughter like

2280
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:39,360
Esparto

2281
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:49,344
Heaven Help Us

2282
01:58:56,512 --> 01:58:57,280
Who knows

2283
01:58:57,536 --> 01:58:59,584
Hey if your angle is who knows

2284
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:01,888
Sort of thing

2285
01:59:02,912 --> 01:59:04,192
If your ankle is

2286
01:59:04,448 --> 01:59:04,960
Nose

2287
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:07,520
Then you can't be speculating that this

2288
01:59:07,776 --> 01:59:08,288
Might be

2289
01:59:09,568 --> 01:59:10,848
You can't do both of those things

2290
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:12,128
And that's what he's

2291
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:13,664
He's trying to play Both Sides

2292
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:15,712
And the reason he's doing that

2293
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:21,088
We have one last clip

2294
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:22,112
The show

2295
01:59:22,368 --> 01:59:23,392
It is just

2296
01:59:23,648 --> 01:59:24,160
More

2297
01:59:25,696 --> 01:59:30,304
Call

2298
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:41,568
That's literally the end of the show

2299
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:45,664
This didn't happen

2300
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:46,944
That's he's already said

2301
01:59:47,968 --> 01:59:49,248
He wants to take your gun

2302
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:50,528
Of course this is

2303
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:53,856
The implicit

2304
01:59:54,368 --> 01:59:54,880
Behind that is

2305
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:55,904
Obama

2306
01:59:56,416 --> 01:59:57,952
Whoever his minions are

2307
01:59:59,488 --> 02:00:03,328
Made this happen in order to give them an excuse to take your

2308
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:06,144
I think like

2309
02:00:07,168 --> 02:00:11,008
I mean on 130 substantial level

2310
02:00:11,264 --> 02:00:14,336
And for us to do

2311
02:00:17,152 --> 02:00:21,248
Cuz at the beginning of this episode

2312
02:00:21,504 --> 02:00:22,016
Is it really

2313
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:24,064
Is Alex's

2314
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:27,904
Modern-day perception

2315
02:00:28,928 --> 02:00:29,440
Deidre

2316
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:31,744
He thought it was real but then

2317
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:32,512
These other

2318
02:00:32,768 --> 02:00:35,328
Forces led him astray bright

2319
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:36,352
Right

2320
02:00:38,144 --> 02:00:38,912
Things to do with this episode

2321
02:00:39,168 --> 02:00:42,496
Show up at all didn't show up at all

2322
02:00:42,752 --> 02:00:45,312
Yeah Alex on his own accord

2323
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:46,848
Is talk

2324
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:48,384
Self

2325
02:00:49,152 --> 02:00:49,920
Fake agree

2326
02:00:50,176 --> 02:00:50,944
By his own

2327
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:52,736
Instinct on the episode

2328
02:00:52,992 --> 02:00:54,016
The day of

2329
02:00:54,272 --> 02:00:54,784
100

2330
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:55,808
I don't think

2331
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:57,344
That this investigation

2332
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:00,928
It's a closed case already

2333
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:02,208
I want to continue

2334
02:01:02,464 --> 02:01:02,976
Fantasy

2335
02:01:03,232 --> 02:01:04,000
See where it develops

2336
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:07,328
Because I know that his narratives are going to

2337
02:01:07,584 --> 02:01:09,120
It works yeah

2338
02:01:09,376 --> 02:01:11,168
Forget those quote-unquote anomaly

2339
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:13,984
Quiznos

2340
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:15,776
It'll be

2341
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:17,056
To see how bad

2342
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:18,592
But

2343
02:01:19,616 --> 02:01:20,640
The day it happened

2344
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:22,688
He spent all this time

2345
02:01:23,456 --> 02:01:25,248
Trying to insinuate

2346
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:26,016
His audience

2347
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:28,576
He has no

2348
02:01:31,648 --> 02:01:33,696
Nope one of the reasons that I am

2349
02:01:33,952 --> 02:01:35,232
Interested

2350
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:37,792
Is because just like when we started the show

2351
02:01:39,072 --> 02:01:40,096
Just like when we did 22

2352
02:01:40,352 --> 02:01:42,912
I'm just like when we did 2009

2353
02:01:43,168 --> 02:01:45,984
I am all the sudden asking myself all over again

2354
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:48,032
Who the f*** is this guy

2355
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:50,592
Who the f*** is this guy

2356
02:01:51,104 --> 02:01:52,896
What are you doing

2357
02:01:53,152 --> 02:01:59,296
Chameleon

2358
02:01:59,552 --> 02:02:02,368
2009 Audi

2359
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:03,904
20

2360
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:05,952
Ridiculous

2361
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:06,720
Strain

2362
02:02:09,024 --> 02:02:09,536
Nefarious

2363
02:02:09,792 --> 02:02:10,560
Chameleon

2364
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:17,472
That's a new emotion that I've been in that lately just bad

2365
02:02:19,264 --> 02:02:24,128
Might be new one to him to I'm interested to see where this goes no f****** idea

2366
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:24,896
How bad is

2367
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:25,664
Is it going to get

2368
02:02:26,176 --> 02:02:26,688
I apologize

2369
02:02:27,968 --> 02:02:31,040
Really bad it's going to get really bad

2370
02:02:31,296 --> 02:02:33,600
I think what we walk away from this first episode with

2371
02:02:33,856 --> 02:02:34,368
What is

2372
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:35,904
A very

2373
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:36,928
Very

2374
02:02:37,184 --> 02:02:37,696
Clear science

2375
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:38,720
That

2376
02:02:38,976 --> 02:02:39,744
From the

2377
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:40,768
First second

2378
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:41,792
You knew this was

2379
02:02:42,816 --> 02:02:45,376
Because I didn't know how bad it was

2380
02:02:49,984 --> 02:02:51,264
Every impulse

2381
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:52,544
But he had was

2382
02:02:53,568 --> 02:02:54,080
Say it

2383
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:54,848
It's fake

2384
02:02:55,616 --> 02:02:56,640
And then

2385
02:02:56,896 --> 02:02:57,408
Weird parts

2386
02:02:58,944 --> 02:02:59,712
Yeah

2387
02:02:59,968 --> 02:03:00,480
Overlake

2388
02:03:00,736 --> 02:03:01,504
Committing

2389
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:02,272
I think we'll get

2390
02:03:02,528 --> 02:03:04,576
As we go forward as

2391
02:03:06,624 --> 02:03:07,136
I hope

2392
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:09,184
Cuz otherwise that's going to

2393
02:03:09,952 --> 02:03:11,488
Keep me up at night

2394
02:03:12,256 --> 02:03:12,768
We'll see

2395
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:14,048
Anyway

2396
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:15,072
Waze website

2397
02:03:16,608 --> 02:03:18,144
Hey babe

2398
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:19,680
It that is a place you can

2399
02:03:21,984 --> 02:03:23,008
To knowledge right

2400
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:25,824
That's correct

2401
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:27,360
Underscore

2402
02:03:27,616 --> 02:03:29,920
Also we are at

2403
02:03:30,432 --> 02:03:36,576
Facebook

2404
02:03:36,832 --> 02:03:42,976
The goddamn f*** Admiral really upset about that so stupid it looks like a rock

2405
02:03:43,232 --> 02:03:47,072
Massive blind spots that I never even can

2406
02:03:47,328 --> 02:03:51,680
Sidered looking into like a rock

2407
02:03:51,936 --> 02:03:57,312
Legitimately feel the dumbest I've ever felt in my entire life

2408
02:03:57,568 --> 02:03:58,080
Accepted

2409
02:03:58,336 --> 02:04:04,480
I do I'm wrong I'm an idiot

2410
02:04:04,736 --> 02:04:08,832
Forecast for

2411
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:13,952
So much for listening

2412
02:04:15,744 --> 02:04:16,512
With another episode

2413
02:04:16,768 --> 02:04:17,280
Friday

2414
02:04:17,792 --> 02:04:19,840
I'm not sure it might actually be

2415
02:04:23,168 --> 02:04:27,008
This might be a barely finish this investigation

2416
02:04:27,264 --> 02:04:30,080
Yeah whatever he's doing

2417
02:04:30,336 --> 02:04:30,848
The present day

2418
02:04:31,104 --> 02:04:32,640
He's already told people like

2419
02:04:32,896 --> 02:04:34,432
It's time to kill soon

2420
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:39,552
Yeah it's going to be like

2421
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:43,648
I suppose I suppose the day where he says it's time to kill now

2422
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:44,672
He'll never do that

2423
02:04:46,464 --> 02:04:49,536
She knows better at the end at the end of the day

2424
02:04:57,984 --> 02:04:59,520
Yeah

2425
02:05:01,312 --> 02:05:01,824
Cuz I want to see

2426
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:06,176
But I will say

2427
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:06,944
That

2428
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:09,504
Grass wall

2429
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:11,296
What is a real piece of s***

2430
02:05:11,552 --> 02:05:17,696
No he did kill us we have

2431
02:05:17,952 --> 02:05:20,000
38 minutes

2432
02:05:21,024 --> 02:05:26,144
Bel-Airs was tertiarily involved in this episode because of Larry grathwol

2433
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:28,704
I don't believe The Bel-Airs ever killed anybody

2434
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:29,984
I'll give him the credit

2435
02:05:30,752 --> 02:05:32,544
Absolutely

2436
02:05:34,848 --> 02:05:35,360
And that's out

2437
02:05:36,384 --> 02:05:38,432
Holding

2438
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:44,064
Alexandra Thurston color
