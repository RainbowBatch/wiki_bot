00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,200
For the record

39
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,736

Yeah because you never know how shirts are going to come out

80
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,543

Gas

99
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,871
It was the Obama phone made

100
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,455
Today we're going over January 14th

101
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,807

00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,895
She's talking about how like

110
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:13,503
He didn't even say it was

111
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,551
I don't want to

112
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:20,671
Jinx it by saying who it was lest something the fall through

113
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,487
Right

114
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,863
So Alex

115
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
Open

116
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,911

We do not have any

121
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:57,279
This is going to be

122
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:07,775
You might have recognized in essential problem with

123
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,055
Beginning of this episode

124
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,847
And that is what Alex

125
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,895
Seemed to know her name at all

126
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,735
Here is another clip where he just refers to her as the Obama Phone Lady

127
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,207
And I and I want to go home and see them tonight

128
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,863
I'll have my wife come meet us for dinner

129
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,959
Husband

130
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:44,639
What's a cigarette

131
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,575
Quest

132
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,695
What is the Obama phone

133
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:04,095
Goodbye

134
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,887
He knows enough

135
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,191
You knows what she stands for in the

136
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,495
Conservative media

137
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
Alex

138
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,615
That the Obama Phone Lady

139
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,383
Ended up

140
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:21,247
Are they

141
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,999
What's there

142
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,239
$5,000 bounty

143
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,135
So he paid

144
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:02,975
$5,000 for one of his listeners to go

145
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,791
To fly her to Texas

146
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,095
He's in the hole for this

147
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,983
How do you know how to get ahold of no one

148
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,007
Had her name

149
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,335
I bet she was just someone who appeared in a f****** viral video

150
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,783
Alex is like really trying to do the email address

151
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,575
Do you have a computer

152
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:36,255
You wouldn't have been able to get ahold of her except by some buddy on the ground and finding her

153
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:43,679
Alex has to give that guy

154
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
And that's such a bummer

155
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
Riot

156
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,263
Yeah

157
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
Yeah but

158
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,591
Unfortunately it doesn't

159
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,615
Fuel that great

160
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,919
Once she's there

161
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
She's a lady

162
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
Her present

163
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,551
A little bit

164
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,839
Diamond cufflinks on

165
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,911
Short sleeve shirt that's not respectful enough

166
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,751
That's all I had back there my wardrobe I sent stuff way to be clean

167
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,335
She coming

168
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,967
He's a character

169
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:39,743
I'm not respectful enough and yet he still had the Obama phone

170
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,071
Are not

171
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,375
This is the beginning of the Falcons

172
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,703
Maybe half an hour 40

173
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,983
Alex

174
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:56,639
I can't believe I deserve to be around her really do is the most

175
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,967
I have ever met in my life

176
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
It is

177
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,343
So Jordan in order to fully understand the context around which the Obama

178
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,623
My phone video

179
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,391
Which

180
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,719
Peters

181
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,743
It existed in package

182
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:12,767
12

183
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,791
When it was released

184
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,839
It's important to remember a couple of things

185
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,119
First

186
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,959
The video was posted and went viral about a month before the 2012 election

187
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,775
What was

188
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,591
With each passing day

189
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,127
His campaign was in

190
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
Need of an October

191
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
Prize

192
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
Becoming

193
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,503
In fact the opposite

194
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
Had come

195
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,575
On September 17th 2012

196
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:42,975
The series of tapes of Rodney's $50,000 a plate private dinner

197
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:46,559
I do large portion of the response to them where is that Rodney gets

198
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,607
Straight up f***** himself over

199
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,191
Out-of-touch fairly resentful rich

200
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,215
Prick speaking

201
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,263
Freely because he knows he's surrounded by

202
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,287
People who are the same

203
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,591
People ran with internal

204
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,615
Reporting was this

205
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:03,455
All right there 47% who are with him

206
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,015
You're dependent on the government who believe their victim

207
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,087
I'm super leave the government has a responsibility to care for them

208
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,135
Who believe that they are entitled to healthcare

209
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,159
The food to housing

210
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,183
Do you name it

211
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,463
That's entitled

212
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,743
And the government

213
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,791
Should give it to them

214
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,887
He goes on to say quote my job is not to worry about those

215
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,239
After a lackluster Republican National Convention

216
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,031
Considerable bump in his numbers

217
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,871
Attacking Obama

218
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,663
And focus on what

219
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,431
We could do if you

220
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
He was elected

221
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:41,343
Then almost immediately this tape comes out to the surface of him telling a roomful of multi-millionaires

222
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,135
Almost half of the country are people

223
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,159
He's not supposed to

224
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,695
Care about as president

225
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,231
This is a huge crisis

226
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,023
If you recall

227
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,327
It looked bad

228
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,631
Because this was cuz it was bad

229
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,191
Because that whole thing was so insane

230
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,751
People have largely forgotten also said this

231
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,055
In that video about his own wife

232
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,895
Quotes we use and sparingly right now so people don't

233
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,919
Get tired of her

234
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:09,247
Like a real guy

235
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,831
F****** car

236
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,855
And drove

237
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,391
And then try to get a job

238
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,927
Drop

239
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,719
How is How is

240
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,423
Of your car driveway and then America's just like this

241
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,215
Did you laugh about it

242
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,031
So Romney's campaign

243
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,823
And the perception

244
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,383
Complete assholes

245
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,919
Slightly richer with starting

246
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,759
Come up with something

247
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,551
Compelling

248
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,391
And what about a week later

249
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
What are YouTuber named

250
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,951
The real freedom

251
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,975
76

252
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,047
Posted a 44-second video of Michelle dowry

253
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,351
Who is now known as the Obama phone

254
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,911
Yelling about how Obama gave her a phone

255
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,191
And he should.

256
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,727
President

257
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
Even more

258
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,775
Here is the

259
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,567
Complete audio of that

260
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:11,711
Obama phone

261
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,855
How to give you a phone

262
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,839
Okay what's wrong with Romney again

263
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,239
Obama phone

264
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,847
People bombing president

265
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
You know

266
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,199
Give me the phone give you a phone

267
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,039
I think it's over

268
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,319
Repeat

269
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:54,207
I think the video might be shorter than 24

270
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,023
I think that he's just staying

271
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
So if

272
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,119
The problem was that Ronnie's face

273
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,679
Have been attached to the idea that 47% of the

274
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,703
Population was a bunch of

275
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,471
Freeloading

276
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,007
Inconsequential

277
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,591
The natural solution to that was to make someone else's face

278
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,383
Is living proof that Romney was right

279
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,663
And if this person

280
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,735
Percent she's a Welfare Queen

281
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,039
Bingo

282
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
Bingo

283
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,343
Real 327

284
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,879
76 heads

285
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
Scribers on YouTube

286
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,439
But that didn't really matter

287
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,975
His video was posted on

288
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
September 26th

289
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
2012

290
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,303
YouTube

291
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,583
And the very next day

292
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,631
The video was the top link on The Drudge

293
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,703
But the headline

294
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,471
He gave me a free

295
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
Free phone

296
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:44,895
Pretty much make careers off just reading drudge headlines

297
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:48,479
Griffin Arthur

298
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,271
The message was clear

299
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,575
As conservative commentators were quick to

300
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,111
This viral video 2

301
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,391
2 defense of Romney

302
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,415
These horrible statement

303
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,463
It was very clear that this

304
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,279
They existed in of opposition

305
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,303
Into each other

306
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,375
They pushed the idea that this woman

307
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:11,007
Was the face of the 47% that Romney was criticized

308
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,823
She was proof that Romney was right

309
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,871
And the attacks against Uber really just

310
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,895
The cover-up

311
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:21,247
It's important to remember that this video went viral for to Ruiz

312
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,527
2 Reasons

313
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,831
1 people laughing

314
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,623
Many of whom were doing

315
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,719
As expressed by this poster on Stormfront

316
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,791
First I thought this was a joke but it's real

317
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,583
Racial inferiority on

318
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,423
A lot of people just thought the video was funny in an absurd way

319
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,703
Sure

320
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,263
I believe that there are people who thought this is funny

321
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,287
18 Andres

322
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:48,639
Large portion of people who thought the video was funny

323
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:51,455
Thought it was funny because how closely it mirrored there races

324
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
Stereotype

325
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
Oh yeah

326
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,319
The other reason why this got really popular

327
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,111
Was that there was a coordinated

328
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
Media blitz

329
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,439
To push this video in an attempt to help the Romney

330
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,487
This was be bandaged

331
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:07,839
To stop the bleeding from the fundraiser videos

332
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,655
Entire media operating

333
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,959
Operation

334
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:26,783
Appears to have been in like Alexa

335
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,063
Yes

336
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,111
There is there is a pipeline

337
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,207
Stop the bleeding

338
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,487
So this was pushed the grass

339
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,071
It was top links on drudge it immediately became the Boogie

340
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,119
He-Man of conservative top talk radio

341
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,679
The video and audio reply

342
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,959
Play all news radio shows

343
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,263
Infinger wagon

344
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,543
About the entitlements

345
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,567
How this woman

346
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,639
Is proof that there and Randy and bulshit was right all along

347
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,431
The second group of P

348
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,735
People these people were using it as a bandage

349
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,783
Stop the bleeding in the Romney campaign

350
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,087
We're using the video for political points

351
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,647
Hey wants Romney lost

352
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:07,231
They didn't talk about the Obama Phone Lady wants their purpose

353
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,279
They were using her for was gone

354
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,375
I'm sure she'll be brought back up and passing when the midterm come along

355
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,191
But looking back at the coverage of the story it's clear that it

356
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:20,543
This is in the right-wing media just as a Hail Mary to try and help Romney

357
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,591
When you see something like this

358
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,895
Where's story of the media is so cord

359
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
For such a specific

360
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:30,015
The kind of speaks volumes when a certain outlier continues to

361
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:33,087
Cover that story where its progenitors

362
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,367
I've left it in the dark

363
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:38,719
Alex Jones interview lady on January 14th

364
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,999
2013

365
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,559
Why do while after the election

366
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:52,031
If you if you get ahold of the Obama Phone Lady

367
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,823
You don't turn down that call

368
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,615
It fixed up

369
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:01,247
Contract says imma give you $5,000 for

370
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:07,647
Her before the election

371
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,951
Does kinda sound right now just from the first

372
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
Opening B

373
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
The fact that he does

374
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,535
And did not bother to learn it

375
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:18,399
Prior to having her I think he knows it but he doesn't

376
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:26,335
Well I think also it could be one of those things

377
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,127
Her name is Michelle in

378
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,455
Obama's wife is named Michelle

379
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:37,855
I'm guessing himself while he's on are like the warmest color

380
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:41,183
Obama's wife

381
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:47,583
Something like that look like an a******

382
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:53,983
I don't know I think he's probably not

383
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,263
Spend five grand

384
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,567
Strawberry farm

385
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,735
Most of the right-wing used her

386
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
Okay

387
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:09,855
The coverage of the Obama Phone Lady video with full effect

388
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,671
And I think the people were right to make this jar

389
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,999
I would like the Atlantic Ram pieces about how racist

390
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
Everyone's

391
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
Responsive

392
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,303
Lydia was

393
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,119
Distinction that the video itself is

394
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,423
Nor is the person who recorded it

395
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,191
Posted it

396
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:28,287
They assert that quote the racism comes when drugs Rush

397
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,127
Do a mental calculation

398
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:35,711
Enough people would just be this video they would support run

399
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,503
Because it plays on the same races

400
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,063
Stereotypes that are usually trotted out this

401
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,159
The article in the Atlantic goes on to say quote

402
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:48,511
The point of the video and the reason drudgen Limbaugh hyped it is to say

403
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,815
This is what Obama voters look like

404
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,375
Poor stupid after your money

405
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,703
The video subject wasn't picked up because she happens

406
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,471
To be black

407
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,751
She was picked up because she

408
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,519
He is black

409
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:03,359
Lee Atwater strategist for Ronald Reagan and George h.w. Bush

410
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,383
Explain how will this work

411
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,919
Back in 1981

412
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,735
Better to talk about cutting taxes and fussing

413
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,831
Because it's quote a hell of a lot more abstract than Edward Edward

414
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,159
And isn't the same as another video

415
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,720
Long after I ate clearly

416
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,256
Serve its intended purpose

417
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,792
Of driving people to Rob

418
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,840
Alex I'm not saying

419
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,376
The n-word n-word part

420
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,144
Is Alex's

421
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,008
Intended purpose of this is an Obama supporter

422
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,056
This is what they look like

423
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,360
Is that so

424
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:42,016
His goal is to use her as a architect

425
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,832
Yeah, supporter

426
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,368
Comes out

427
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,416
He reads off teleprompters and he looks really

428
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,440
Really smart

429
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,464
Makino's things

430
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,072
This is what they're really like is that what he's doing is it's almost like

431
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,608
Create

432
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,888
A straw man

433
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,936
And then it was brought to life

434
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,472
In the form of

435
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,336
Part of why Alex Hester

436
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,872
To pretend he's so excited

437
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,896
To see her at such a

438
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,664
Celebrity

439
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,224
He has to walk this really fine line

440
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,296
Of like overdoing it because if he doesn't

441
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,576
You just going to yell at her

442
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,488
Yes

443
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,792
Mexico

444
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,584
Artificial respect

445
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,168
In order to safeguard himself from very relaxation

446
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:34,496
That you're having your on your show for nefarious reason

447
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,080
He's excited as a way of hiding

448
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:54,464
Text Alex talk about how he's going to hire

449
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,768
I'll just be honest with you here

450
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:03,168
Obama Phone Lady

451
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,016
I am to try to

452
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,088
Okay that's a little Patron

453
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,416
Need to schedule

454
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,952
Get into comedy

455
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,000
It's a good thing

456
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,560
Obama was re-elected

457
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,888
Otherwise she might not have a phone with which for him to

458
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,704
Spoiler alert

459
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,104
She wouldn't

460
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,488
One of his

461
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,304
Introducing

462
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,072
Talkin about her

463
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,376
But you should get into comedy

464
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,936
2 into voiceover work

465
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,472
Express

466
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,976
Natural

467
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,840
I don't have it

468
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:37,888
Okay

469
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:47,104
I thought about how stupid messed up

470
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,784
She could get buck

471
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:00,160
October

472
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:05,280
You see all these things were like people who are on reality shows and stuff headlining clubs

473
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,912
Some sets

474
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,960
Somewhere but it wouldn't work

475
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,752
Amy Schumer

476
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,800
Started doing that

477
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,664
Before she

478
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,688
Last Comic Standing

479
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:27,808
Is a stand-up show

480
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:30,880
The reality show that is based on

481
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:35,232
Temptation Island

482
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,792
I don't know

483
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,816
Be great on Temptations

484
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,608
Whatever

485
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:45,216
My point is this

486
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,776
Did Alex Azar

487
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,800
Hilarious

488
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,688
Trend it's going throughout day like I don't really

489
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,480
I don't really care about any of this stuff

490
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,504
I'm just Alex being stupid

491
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,296
Important

492
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,320
Consider how he

493
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
He's rapping

494
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:01,856
What's up

495
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,880
Because it's like

496
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:06,976
Realtor

497
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:07,744
Anyone

498
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,328
Anyone who's ever listened to your show doesn't think

499
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,704
This is a weird Alex

500
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,288
What are you doing Alex

501
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,056
It's the

502
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:30,272
He's going over the top in order to Wells

503
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,808
Because

504
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:35,136
It's building her up with the also added

505
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:35,904
Piece of

506
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,208
Patronizing

507
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,232
Are you talking about

508
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,512
The educator one

509
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,816
And that comes up in the

510
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,752
Help somebody

511
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:03,552
We can probably try to help

512
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:11,232
Situation going on but it's not

513
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,256
Cuz it's not better

514
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,024
You can't

515
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:15,584
Help

516
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,376
Schoolboy

517
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,960
Message of that movie

518
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,312
A lot of messages

519
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,224
Voicemail joke

520
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:32,992
Play app

521
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,064
How do you get to a small-time, club

522
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,416
Beretta Cougar

523
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,976
So it's probably important

524
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,256
For me to know that there's no such

525
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:48,352
Outside of what

526
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,632
Meme creator

527
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:52,704
What's behind this because there is a little bit of reality

528
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,288
I'd like to generously call this

529
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
Understand

530
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,592
How is the idea

531
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,616
These programs

532
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,176
The help people with low income

533
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,200
At the phone

534
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,504
Easy telephones are considered a utility

535
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:09,600
That's such the government has what's known as quote a universal service

536
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,880
Requirements for them

537
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,440
This is laid out the communications Act of 90

538
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,512
T-34 which reason that access to wire and radio

539
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,792
Where is Central Perk

540
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,584
Of living in B vent modern

541
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352
Society

542
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,400
Should be offered access

543
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,960
The programs that are sprung out of this

544
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,496
Later all centered around the under

545
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,776
Understanding

546
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,056
Access to a phone

547
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:29,824
Is Knotts

548
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,592
Some kind of watch

549
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,128
It's pretty much a necessity

550
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,408
3 in today's world

551
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,456
Connect America fund

552
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,016
Was established to promote connectivity to rural community

553
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:42,112
Then in 1984 the lifeline program was started by Zen

554
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:42,880
Reagan

555
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,648
Which a.m.

556
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,464
To quote ensure that all Americans have the opportunity

557
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,024
Insecurities that phone service brings

558
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,560
Included being able to connect

559
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,096
Two jobs family an

560
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:52,864
MC services

561
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,656
There's an essential piece

562
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,496
Love to ignore

563
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:04,640
And that is ultimately cost Society more to deprive people of access to phones than it would to subsidize

564
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,688
And the only real argument against

565
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,712
The program like this is

566
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,736
Is rooted in cruelty

567
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,040
And appeals that quote people like this

568
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,064
Just don't deserve

569
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,112
And also it was

570
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,904
They also love to ignore

571
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:19,232
1996 Honda President Clinton

572
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,768
Program was redesigned

573
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,840
The people who qualified for the benefits

574
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,376
For a cell phone

575
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,680
Crazy

576
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,472
That's just a modernization of the program

577
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,008
Psychological

578
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,824
The program doesn't give out free phone

579
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
Feisty

580
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,152
Myth

581
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,992
It's set up to cover monthly discounts on phone service

582
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:44,320
The free phones that may or may not be giving out or giving it to

583
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,600
Discretion of the cell phone

584
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,624
Provider

585
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,696
That company may offer a free phone as an incentive

586
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,280
But that's not the government's doing

587
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,328
The idea of giving out phone doesn't

588
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,096
Entirely up to

589
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,120
These companies

590
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,424
Also the money for the program doesn't come

591
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,704
Comfort up from packs

592
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,472
Husband

593
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,240
That goes

594
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,544
Most people's phone bill

595
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,104
Include the small fee to go to the universal service

596
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,408
And this is where the money for the

597
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:16,320
Do USF is used to make sure the girl communities are able to call the fire department

598
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,368
And some of that money also goes

599
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,648
How to make sure that

600
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,672
Just because you're poor

601
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,952
That doesn't mean you can't

602
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,488
Also called the fire department

603
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,024
Some hardcore

604
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,792
Conservative makeup

605
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,816
Complain that

606
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:29,376
Pay a dollar and their bills

607
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,656
The government should

608
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,448
Force them to and I have great news

609
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,472
The government is

610
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,240
Forcing them to

611
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,520
Their phone company

612
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,592
Cfcc requires Telecommunications

613
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,384
Companies to pay into the universal

614
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,152
Full-service Spa

615
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,200
But it's up to the individual companies

616
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:43,968
Decide whether they

617
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,248
Pass along those

618
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,016
Sister their customer

619
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:49,088
So is your package come up into this be

620
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,368
This phone

621
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,904
Don't be mad at the recipient

622
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,208
Access to phones don't be mad at the governor

623
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:59,584
Phone provider for making you pay their fair share

624
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:04,960
They wanted for it that's

625
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,984
The company's Troy

626
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,264
They have to pay

627
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:13,408
To this Market that is a utility it's just part of how the

628
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:20,576
System works well there's another while I was working with the hearing impaired entire

629
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,624
Series of programs set up to get

630
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,976
That will

631
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,256
UniverSoul Circus

632
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,792
You don't have to pay for those

633
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,584
It is all taken care of

634
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,632
No it's

635
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,192
Do you want the company to have to pay

636
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,496
Or do you want them

637
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,264
To charge

638
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,032
You for it

639
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:46,176
I think that's probably the only real conversation here your phone bill

640
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,968
Are you mad enough about it

641
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:53,600
I mean I think a company should pay but I also don't mind that I'm charged

642
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,136
That's where I'm at

643
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,208
I would like the company to Japan

644
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:58,976
On it it's

645
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,000
Seems like it's bear respond

646
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:05,376
Possibility I also recognized

647
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,912
Great help

648
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,056
2 bucks a month on my bill

649
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,664
For this until someone point

650
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,992
Makes them mad about

651
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,856
People get mad about it

652
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,672
Do people like Rush Limbaugh make people mad about it

653
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:32,256
Fictionalized version

654
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,792
Of the program itself

655
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,608
They're using propaganda to make you mad about something

656
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,688
Let's go back even further when

657
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,248
We didn't even have subsidized

658
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:56,064
Right

659
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:00,672
Not on fire how much more money that cost ever

660
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,888
To pay for it well if you don't have a phone.

661
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,216
How are you going to pay for it

662
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,520
A job if they can't call you back

663
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,312
Right you know

664
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,592
Two-cycle Vape

665
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,616
This Is War

666
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,688
Attempt to disrupt the cycle of

667
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,480
Of inability

668
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,344
And I don't I don't

669
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,112
Theory

670
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:34,208
If there are abuses within the system and stuff like that then that's

671
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,744
Coupon greater regulation

672
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,304
To sort out or greater oversight of the program

673
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,448
Long is the program

674
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,472
Scores

675
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,032
Created

676
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,568
New Challenger

677
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:50,848
Programming

678
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,896
Not all of it

679
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,688
But

680
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,480
That's not a result of

681
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,504
Obama

682
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,296
Or anything like that

683
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,856
I find it acceptable to be

684
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,880
They're calling the coverage

685
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,720
Of the Obama Phone Lady in this whole thing

686
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,512
Is it the coverage doesn't

687
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,584
Discuss the reality of the program like we've been discussing

688
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,680
Yeah it just seems like they don't care about the reality

689
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,496
People went

690
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,264
About this

691
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,312
People like Russian Alex

692
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:25,152
Just accept the false reality that this woman is God video

693
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,432
Which state uses

694
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:31,552
They aren't using the video is an opportunity to argue against

695
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,832
The lifeline program

696
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,112
In fact

697
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,672
The name of the program where the Universal Services

698
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:40,512
Respond come up in any of the coverage I've seen

699
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,656
Explain

700
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,680
Soar program

701
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,008
Parents that they want to

702
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:56,640
Obama is the f****** phone

703
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,664
Arguing

704
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,248
People like Alex videos

705
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,272
Send a f*****-up message

706
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,832
Basically this is what we're up

707
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,392
This is the true face of an Obama

708
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:10,720
Supporter

709
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,488
Stroke

710
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,512
The Flash out their coverage

711
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:16,352
They're basically attempting to log modern

712
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:19,424
Is you sucked out almost immediately

713
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,472
As the Atlantic article about this

714
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,496
Points out quote

715
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:26,592
The video wasn't on drugs because drudges advocated getting rid of the probe

716
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,896
It's racist because the point is

717
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,456
Portray poor black people is stupid and lazy

718
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,784
If that's what it comes down to

719
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,808
That's what Alex

720
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,832
Need

721
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,368
To present on this show

722
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,416
Within the con

723
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,440
Text of

724
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,976
And I'm having her here too

725
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,000
To help her

726
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,024
Which is

727
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,096
Probably even worse

728
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:51,168
Especially considering even the people pushing this race

729
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,960
Has me mad already given up

730
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,008
Yeah by this point Alex's

731
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,032
Continuing it on

732
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,568
Well past its expiration

733
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,872
Alex

734
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,896
Talks for a long time

735
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,320
I guess

736
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,344
Talking about night

737
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,112
84

738
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,672
You remember the quote from the book about

739
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:19,072
Being able to overthrow the party

740
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,120
I just like it whenever Alec

741
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,888
What's brings up one

742
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,704
Books that he believes are real

743
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,544
Then he accidentally

744
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,336
Completely misinterpret something

745
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,408
So let's see if you can pick out what's wrong

746
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:46,208
First the song Choices

747
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,048
Only there in those swarming

748
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,352
Disregarded message

749
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,680
Population of Oceania

750
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:05,664
Did you pick out what the major glaring problem there is

751
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:07,968
Well

752
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,248
Seems like that

753
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,784
Support for

754
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,440
Oceania is not the United States

755
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,208
England

756
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:22,304
It's also South America is also Australia

757
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,656
Serie A 1984

758
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,704
The idea that he's presenting it as

759
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,008
Just the United States

760
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:36,896
Oceania does what he think

761
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,968
Wholesale discount

762
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,992
I don't know

763
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:44,832
Half of the rest of the world

764
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,976
I don't know I don't trust the rest of yours

765
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,792
If that's what you're taking away from this

766
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,352
I mean I would give him the benefit of the doubt

767
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,632
There because I would

768
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,008
Doubt

769
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:09,408
Mention well because outside 1984 Oceania

770
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,176
Lights to

771
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,968
Australia

772
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,784
The game of Risk

773
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,136
The word has a greater context

774
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,328
Anyway I was lying he's not done talking

775
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,864
About the Obamas

776
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,544
Some of the ideas that I was breaking up

777
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,568
In my inter

778
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,432
Obama phone

779
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,528
That's her first name

780
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,576
Michelle

781
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,600
We have a tide

782
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,440
An hour from now we can also have some of your questions

783
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:57,280
Austin Texas

784
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:10,848
My argument

785
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,920
This is what they're all like

786
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:21,088
So Alex said that she's going to be on in an hour

787
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:22,880
She shows up

788
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,160
Barges into the stew

789
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:45,920
Obama Phone Lady

790
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,816
I know by my phone lady

791
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,632
Represent Nom Alex Jones here today

792
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:14,080
Walmart

793
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,992
Oh boy

794
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:21,760
To be here agent

795
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,600
I don't know

796
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,672
She doesn't

797
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:31,488
Studio immediately

798
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,048
She's hanging out like in the booth

799
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,120
Something like that

800
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:40,192
At a certain point Alex just yells at them like a

801
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,984
Not

802
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,456
Weird

803
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:54,528
To open this

804
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,624
Do you have her in the other room

805
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:01,184
Celebrities

806
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,000
Present

807
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,304
He does get into some other news

808
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,864
Who asked about

809
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:09,888
Sandy Hooks.

810
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,448
And Alex respond

811
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,984
F***

812
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,824
Next clip this caller asks

813
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,592
About the

814
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,664
Who was

815
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,480
The people have described as being like an actor

816
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,248
Now

817
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,528
Mike down man

818
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,112
Listen to this response that Alex gives him

819
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,720
But what I wanted to talk about was Sandy Hook

820
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:41,376
Somebody that believes that there's some fishing it's there and I think through a couple things I'm not sure if you've seen all these

821
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:47,776
Have you seen the video where the little girl's father

822
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,967
Camera

823
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,359
So he's

824
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:32,063
What he said about

825
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,391
It's a clear indication

826
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,159
He knows

827
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:39,487
What's up

828
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,303
Consistent to ascertain

829
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,119
Because the furthest he's gone is sort of endorsing

830
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,143
Obispo

831
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,703
Professor Florida University

832
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:51,519
Professor who's advocating

833
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,287
They're all actors

834
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,943
I don't know how

835
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,967
Respond

836
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:05,087
Like this you know I am not going to

837
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,111
Say

838
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:09,695
It still tracks with the idea even if he's advocating For What the

839
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,463
Professor say

840
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,999
Because the professor saying

841
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,023
It's dumb people were at

842
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,863
This guy isn't

843
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:21,983
Terrifying is that Alex is keenly aware of the ideas it

844
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,519
You're in heavy stuff

845
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,287
Stressful

846
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,823
People respondents

847
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,847
Surprising

848
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:30,431
Sometimes there's nothing suspicious about the idea that this guy

849
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,223
May have nervously been laughing

850
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,503
Before he got on camera

851
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:36,319
Like that's really scary cuz if you have that awareness

852
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,343
It's the fact that he does

853
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,135
Later make it something

854
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:39,903
Suspicious

855
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,183
Means that he knows

856
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,231
Yeah fool well that he's lying

857
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:51,423
Easy little bit giddy he's acting like a little bit like a real person

858
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,983
I consider that as a possibility

859
00:43:54,239 --> 00:44:00,383
Need the tempers language cuz Obama Phone Lady is listening and if it was all fake

860
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,151
Maybe that would

861
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,223
Or something like that

862
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,783
About that is possibility but

863
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,807
I don't have enough evidence

864
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,879
It's the back that up it's just weird

865
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,415
Good mood

866
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,951
Color does not like that

867
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,231
Response

868
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,255
You keep pushing

869
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:20,607
Moreover that side of like

870
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:23,167
I'm not going down this road

871
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:23,935
Which is even worse

872
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:28,287
One thing that's weird about him is that his daughter

873
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:32,127
The end of the day she had a Facebook page

874
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:35,455
That one is already looking looking for money

875
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:38,271
It seems kind of odd that

876
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:43,391
So quickly

877
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,303
What

878
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,615
Editorial position

879
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,151
Very severely

880
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:09,247
I think he's going to flip his script

881
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,551
Yeah

882
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,319
Water

883
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,207
Pretty much the entirety of the information

884
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:23,583
Because Obama Phone Lady is going to come in just Duty go and they talked almost the

885
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,607
Higher

886
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,935
It's a very long interview

887
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:30,239
Really boring

888
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:35,871
Will explain what happened

889
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,663
But a lot of it is just Alex

890
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:38,943
Badgering

891
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,223
Is this Alex

892
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:46,623
Info on thirty-year-old suing his parents to stay in their house mode

893
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,927
Get to that

894
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:55,327
Yes this is Alex and Mike rotundo imma give you $3,000

895
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:01,983
A pep talk

896
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,775
Impulse that he has

897
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,359
Definitely has more of a racial

898
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:10,431
Where is Rotonda

899
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:14,783
I feel

900
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:21,183
Galaxy Express in the building

901
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,207
Weirded out by this whole thing

902
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:32,959
What is happening

903
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:42,943
She's awesome

904
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,223
Absolutely awesome

905
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,463
I just did

906
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,047
It's over flattering

907
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,583
It's it's manipulative

908
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,751
Reliving his Pretty Woman

909
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,543
Or whatever

910
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,335
Don't I don't think that

911
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:13,919
Play Eye of the Tiger whenever she

912
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:14,687
She comes in

913
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:17,503
2

914
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,927
The tiger and then gets really defensive

915
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,463
Even though

916
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:11,519
Cornea

917
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:27,647
There's so much to love about that clip

918
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,951
At the beginning of it you can tell that he think

919
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:34,303
The chorus is coming another verse

920
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,655
It goes to the First Defense

921
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:41,983
You here where you roll the windows down in love it

922
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:52,991
The Obama Phone Lady she showed up yet

923
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,527
She has the eye of the tiger

924
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:59,647
You're on the air you want to talk about

925
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:05,023
Just got everything that was on at 2 a.m. while you were driving and just

926
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,559
Just that clip you be like

927
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:07,839
Is a good night live

928
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:11,935
College radio

929
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:15,263
It's so f****** silly

930
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:23,199
Coaster parody

931
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:29,599
Lady comes in

932
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,391
You know that's all good and well

933
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,975
This is the first step that I want to play as their interaction

934
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:38,559
Is one where I believe that they both keenly are aware

935
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:42,655
That there's more to this program than the idea that Obama is giving

936
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,935
People phone

937
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:46,239
They're aware of it but they refused

938
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,287
To operate with that awareness

939
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,335
If you understand

940
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:53,663
Okay. Kind of aware that it's a racist

941
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:54,687
Yeah

942
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,223
Okay

943
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,807
I have seen

944
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,599
Last year win

945
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:04,159
Some things have

946
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,303
I know you really didn't

947
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,351
Once I

948
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,471
They show me that

949
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:20,799
Ask for when Obama

950
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,615
It was it was Obama phone

951
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:37,183
No but you want to present it at

952
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:41,023
Because you can talk about the idea that cell phones were included in

953
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:43,839
You plan on the click because you don't want to make the

954
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:50,751
A bipartisan say it was started under your conservative god king Ronald Reagan

955
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:53,311
You want to make it look like it's only Democrat

956
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:57,151
Did is the Democrats are giving you free

957
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:01,503
To keep you on the plantation because they hate you and all this.

958
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:03,807
If you incorporate

959
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:05,855
The greater reality of it that argument

960
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:10,207
Completely falls apart and you can't do this propaganda

961
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,743
She is here as a tool

962
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:13,279
For Alex to use

963
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,047
Any

964
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:16,095
I mean I'll be honest

965
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,399
Yeah well it's pretty bad

966
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:19,935
But

967
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:24,031
For most of the time Alex is just trying to get her to hate Obama

968
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,591
Okay is just going on and on

969
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,615
Don't you know

970
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,639
He uses drones

971
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:35,295
Okay alright if I had Baloch sitting down right

972
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,319
You know all this

973
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:38,111
The same argument

974
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,415
For someone to

975
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:43,231
Throw in his face now

976
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:46,047
So it just

977
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,375
It just feels like I'm trying

978
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,423
To get her to not like Obama

979
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:55,519
He convened brag about getting the Obama Phone Lady do not like Obama

980
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:56,799
And it's annoying

981
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:02,431
Is a front man for some very dangerous

982
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:05,503
Part of the New World Order

983
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:17,279
There's a lot of that there's a lot of Alex just like a lot of his normal talking points

984
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:23,935
These are also trying to be like the Democrats hate you because you're black

985
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,751
This clip

986
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:29,823
Encapsulation of that especially because of How It Ends

987
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,639
And I want you to know

988
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,511
To put you Six Feet Under

989
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,959
To kill black people

990
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,263
Alright

991
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:08,479
That was longer than I thought

992
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:11,039
Kill all the blacks

993
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,743
Rhoda commercial and you

994
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:20,767
You can just have the last

995
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:21,791
Forward no matter what

996
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,327
F****** insane

997
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:31,263
Democratic party wants to kill you all right time to go to break but I'll prowl

998
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:34,847
I got a story

999
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:39,967
Well I guess you'll open with that when we come back to break right

1000
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:44,831
Or come back from Moana bathtub

1001
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,879
Is interesting

1002
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,415
Michelle's phone keeps ringing

1003
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:50,719
Episode

1004
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:53,791
Which Alex would never put up with from anybody else

1005
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:57,887
Needs visitors

1006
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:05,567
The present

1007
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:07,103
Right there

1008
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:12,735
I can't talk to you

1009
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,647
So you wouldn't allow he wouldn't allow that

1010
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,719
That's absurd

1011
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:25,791
Present

1012
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:27,583
Fairing

1013
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:33,983
While the same time trying to attack her

1014
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,287
With all of his propaganda

1015
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,847
In order for the outcome that he wants

1016
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:45,247
The outcome but he wants here is present is bad

1017
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,527
To blindly and

1018
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:47,551
Stupidly

1019
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,319
Was out there

1020
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:52,671
Screaming in a Romney rally that Obama was going to give us phones and all that

1021
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,207
I have managed

1022
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:56,255
To show her the light and the truth

1023
00:54:56,511 --> 00:55:01,375
Write in the same way that like Mike Rotondo is embarrassing thirty-year-old who suing the parents

1024
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,655
Taking them out of the house

1025
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,679
Alex Warren

1026
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:05,215
The end result of that to be like

1027
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:11,615
You've got him on his feet I got him in this apartment because I am able to

1028
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,639
For you

1029
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:16,223
By using my principles and applying them to you

1030
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,783
Such a valuable

1031
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:19,551
For him from

1032
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:22,623
Propaganda is willing to put up with

1033
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:25,951
Her phone going off multiple times throughout the interview

1034
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:27,487
He's willing to pretend

1035
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:31,071
He's the biggest celebrity ever to butter her up with flattery

1036
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,095
To make her not

1037
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:35,423
Fuel on guard about the idea that he's just

1038
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:36,959
Just bummed

1039
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,263
Stupid ideas

1040
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:43,103
And knowings it like okay I'm going to stay that Margaret Sanger wants

1041
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,943
Kill all black people you don't know anything about this

1042
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,991
And I know you're not going to look it up

1043
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,319
Like manipulative Fox

1044
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:54,111
Used when they go on Rogan

1045
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,903
Show

1046
00:55:56,159 --> 00:56:02,303
The maximum amount of research that anybody can do without the program is a Google search

1047
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,607
Appearance of something little

1048
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,887
Call Bob on Google

1049
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:08,447
Your arguments going to fly

1050
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:10,239
And that's what Alex ends up

1051
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:12,543
Because he ends up talking

1052
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:16,127
Think about how like Obama promised there wouldn't be any new texts

1053
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,663
Urbino taxes

1054
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,943
And there are tax

1055
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:22,783
So you like one of his interns

1056
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,551
Those things

1057
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:27,135
Shows it to her and then she's like wow

1058
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:30,719
And because he's been beating her down throughout this

1059
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,743
Entire episode

1060
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:33,791
Once that receipt

1061
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:34,815
She's like

1062
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:40,191
Wow Mama. I'm not going to vote for him next time

1063
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:45,055
That would be a possibility

1064
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,871
I would also say that

1065
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,663
Phone going off

1066
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,943
During this interview

1067
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:51,967
Is

1068
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:52,991
A win for him

1069
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:54,783
Keep saying Obama

1070
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:57,855
Keep bringing up the very thing that

1071
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:59,135
He wants everybody to

1072
00:56:59,391 --> 00:56:59,903
Associate

1073
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,951
Yes and associate with

1074
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:03,743
It does help

1075
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:09,631
It does help but that's also why he's not behaving

1076
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,519
The end where it gets

1077
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:17,823
To put some of that is important because

1078
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:20,127
To know even in the middle

1079
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:20,895
In the middle

1080
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,943
Where we're at now

1081
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:26,015
She's not responding superweld

1082
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:26,783
To Alex's

1083
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,599
Apartment

1084
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,391
Digicel

1085
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:34,975
Because it's very aggressive and he hasn't

1086
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:37,791
Lying

1087
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,071
Sushi

1088
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:39,839
Kind of like

1089
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:47,519
Alright and Alex is interpreting that as like a

1090
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:50,335
And we're Donaire but it really just seems

1091
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:52,383
Like he's being a dick to her

1092
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,407
She's trying to

1093
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,175
Be polite

1094
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:56,223
Come right back

1095
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,551
Here

1096
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,695
I just think that there's

1097
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,743
Like there's a real strong feeling that

1098
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:09,279
Protecting herself from

1099
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:17,727
Cuz when they come back Alex wants to ask her about Gunn

1100
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:22,079
Her feelings about God and later he indicates

1101
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,615
Did they talked about it last night

1102
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:26,175
Flown into town

1103
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:30,015
Position already

1104
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,575
And she knows that he's probably going to yell at her

1105
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:34,111
If she answers the question

1106
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,647
You can see how that plays out

1107
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:39,743
Where do you stand on their arms

1108
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,343
Have faith in God

1109
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:09,439
Well

1110
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:14,559
Tamia

1111
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:15,839
Ensalada 92

1112
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:19,679
Cool

1113
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:26,079
Last night when they talked about it you probably got really Adam

1114
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:28,639
Talking about guns

1115
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,175
Going to go well

1116
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:32,735
I don't want to answer your question

1117
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:33,759
Because

1118
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,295
What it could

1119
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,319
End up with

1120
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,623
Hey that's why she's cool

1121
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,159
Is because

1122
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,951
Whether it's on a

1123
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:44,767
Like a conscious level or subconscious level

1124
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,791
She has a sense

1125
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:48,351
He's going to yell at her or there's going to be

1126
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,631
She doesn't go the right

1127
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,399
Path

1128
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:52,703
The things are going to go bad

1129
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,495
When you hear her

1130
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,263
Receiving

1131
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,031
These questions

1132
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:56,799
You can hear the

1133
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,103
Thoughts in her head just go

1134
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,919
What possible

1135
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:04,735
Good outcome could there be

1136
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:08,319
Why does it matter what I think about God

1137
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:12,159
I was in a f****** video

1138
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:14,975
Exactly so I can stay home

1139
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:16,255
And then he gets to yell

1140
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:23,167
Right right I can even doesn't know what I'm talking about origin

1141
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,191
Joke or something

1142
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:25,983
Yeah

1143
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,007
You could tell there's

1144
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:28,799
The feeling of truck

1145
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:30,591
There's no wind for her in that

1146
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:37,247
This is my favorite the entire thing

1147
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,783
And if when Alex

1148
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,831
Even better than I the Tiger

1149
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:44,671
To her and

1150
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:45,951
State IDs

1151
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,743
People so they could be able to

1152
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:49,535
Alex think

1153
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:52,607
Accidentally stumbled upon

1154
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:53,375
Proof

1155
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:57,215
Beautiful alien being allowed to vote

1156
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:00,543
I'm going to deposit after the park

1157
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:05,407
But it's so funny

1158
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,991
I think that this is

1159
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,319
It's Unbecoming

1160
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:17,695
I had plenty of people telling me

1161
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:21,279
Cleveland

1162
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,815
Install free to get up

1163
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,679
Illegal

1164
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:47,903
Iraq

1165
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:17,087
Because he's from here

1166
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:20,927
You said two years and I said

1167
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:30,911
Wyoming

1168
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:39,103
I think you have an ID from Wyoming

1169
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:54,463
I don't think I think because of her feelings about middle easterners

1170
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:57,791
She thinks that Arabian people from Wyoming

1171
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:59,327
Are foreigners

1172
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,887
Okay

1173
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:04,703
The other Necedah middle easterners

1174
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:06,751
Is informing the chief

1175
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:10,847
Or whatever

1176
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:13,663
What does really

1177
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:18,015
Ohio resident with a Wyoming

1178
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:21,343
You need to update your ID

1179
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,647
To register to vote

1180
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:26,207
Describing the process that she was involved in as

1181
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:28,767
But because Alex is so f****** suspicious

1182
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:33,119
Wyoming oh I see

1183
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:37,215
This is just an out-of-state ID situation

1184
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:39,519
Sauce bad out he's decided that it's yummy

1185
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:50,527
Helping people yeah but now Alex is reinterpreting all that is a negative

1186
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,095
I wanted to make sure

1187
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:16,383
But when they been here in America

1188
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:22,271
A license

1189
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,767
They've been here so long

1190
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,327
They were citizen but

1191
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:40,959
No because they still here

1192
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,775
Been here long time

1193
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,919
Right

1194
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:52,991
He said he almost

1195
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,015
4 years

1196
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,039
He never vote

1197
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:59,135
And I said

1198
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:01,951
Have you heard about the problem of illegal aliens voting

1199
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:09,631
Trying to make the conversation about that

1200
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,911
Does Alex is even like

1201
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:18,591
Is a popper

1202
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:24,735
I'm sort of an admission that she was involved in helping

1203
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:25,759
Immigrants

1204
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:28,831
Voting ability

1205
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:30,879
This is what is built on

1206
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,927
And she was doing everything right

1207
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,207
She's doing everything

1208
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:41,887
I would say is that her Prejudice one little bit

1209
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:42,655
What okay

1210
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:47,263
Is it

1211
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:51,615
Hold on

1212
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:58,015
We call them

1213
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,831
Discriminating in a

1214
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:02,367
Malicious way

1215
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:03,135
Gorgeous

1216
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:08,511
It does feel I mean I don't know what the line is but yeah

1217
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:10,559
Maliciously you're not been going to go like

1218
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:14,911
Let's go to the movie help you out

1219
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,447
Most likely

1220
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,727
The right place

1221
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,775
It's possible I don't know enough to

1222
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:22,847
It's not as bad as our

1223
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,711
These are taking

1224
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:29,247
Calls from listeners

1225
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:33,087
Who want to talk to Obama

1226
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,951
Obama's

1227
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:38,719

Is on the wrong side

1235
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:03,295
Battle

01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,671
Illinois Lottery

1240
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:15,071
The number that came up for the Pick 3 3 and I check this out myself on one of those

1241
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:17,887
The numbers you know

1242
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:19,423
6

1243
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:28,895
OK Google

1244
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:30,175
Wasn't obvious

1245
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,479
Made myself a

1246
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:36,063
Edit had Obama

1247
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:40,671
If God was going to speak to

1248
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:41,695
It would be

1249
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:45,279
The lottery

1250
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,327
Does working

1251
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,095
Mysterious ways

1252
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:51,935
Guys

1253
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:58,335
I understand that you want to present the idea that these are the end times and Obama's evil you have to understand

1254
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,943
Lottery numbers

1255
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:05,503
Just if you break it down you look

1256
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:06,271
Crazy

1257
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:14,463
Color looks crazy and you mean like yeah you know what I saw I was in other lotteries

1258
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:16,767
Alex is making it worse

1259
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,559
Man if it was

1260
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,583
Every Lottery

1261
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:29,055
Now we're in territory where I'm picking a little it's a little harder to

1262
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:34,687
Three numbers like everybody who

1263
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:37,247
Get the gas and the brisket

1264
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:39,551
Stop

1265
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:40,575
56

1266
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:42,879
Whatever

1267
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:47,743
Who

1268
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:50,303
Keep this in because it will really sounds like he's reading a

1269
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:54,399
16

1270
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:57,215
100

1271
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:59,519
Alex and Michelle

1272
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:03,615
Michelle if you haven't seen the Obama

1273
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:05,151
Deception documentary

1274
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:10,527
I recommend did Alex get you a copy of that as well as all of his other documentaries

1275
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:17,183
Magazine as well as access

1276
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:23,583
You know she can wow do to the universal service fund

1277
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:25,887
But who cares

1278
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:28,703
What eight

1279
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:30,495
Implants

1280
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:32,031
Lot of consecutive plugs

1281
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,055
Yeah

1282
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,847
Also

1283
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:39,967
You know I accept the possibility that it's just someone really well

1284
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:41,247
Before getting on air

1285
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,599
Even though

1286
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:46,879
Come on

1287
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:48,927
Plug-in

1288
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:50,463
It's a little suspicious

1289
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:56,351
All the colors that are calling in are essentially along these lines

1290
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:57,375
Either lunatic

1291
01:09:57,631 --> 01:10:03,519
To think that God speaks through the lottery

1292
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,079
You got to hate this Obama guy

1293
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:09,407
Call

1294
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:11,967
This call makes a pretty good point

1295
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,879
Hey how you doing Michelle

1296
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:21,951

Do you know something Michelle the only reason why you didn't speak round

01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:31,423
That's only reason why you there

1299
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:33,215
Before you got there

1300
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:34,751
Prince Cream

1301
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:36,543
Soundbite of yours

01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:40,383
Over and over and over again to clown you

1303
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:45,503
And they and the reason why he's trying to get you to say things because he needs

01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:50,367
Clown you again when you leave

1305
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:17,503

01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:21,599
Clown around

1307
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:52,319
No

1308
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:01,023
He was right on every point

1309
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:05,375
Guy is a hundred percent

1310
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:11,775
Alex's having her onto clown her and an ant

1311
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:13,055
The audio so you can

1312
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:15,359
Clown her later that's absolute

1313
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:17,919
Look

01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:20,479
Don't misrepresent what I Stan

1315
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:25,855
Even video came out

1316
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:29,695
She seems funny I bet you'd be really interesting to talk to

1317
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:30,719
Alex

1318
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:37,375
Let's listen to how you covered first come out

1319
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:41,727
Some of the clips of Alex talking about this after it was posted on drugs

1320
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,287
Here is Alexei

1321
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:45,823
Is just pathetic

1322
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:53,503
The Nazis

1323
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:59,647
We're inspired by her so she's not not since she's a Nazis mama

1324
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:02,207
IPhone

1325
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:05,535
Politics

It's hard. Obama phone

1327
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:26,271
Give you a phone

1328
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:41,375
Pathetic

1329
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:46,239
So it doesn't seem like it

1330
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:54,175
Xvideo

1331
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:54,943
She sounds like an

1332
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,223
Evil version of Elmo

1333
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:59,807
Elmo gone bad

1334
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:04,159
Elmo real quick

1335
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:10,047
Elmo Elmo

1336
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:19,007
Styling a bunch of people

1337
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:25,919
A bunch of

1338
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,535
Point of order you never produced any of those

1339
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:45,631
Play Baby Kaely

1340
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:52,543
Elmo

1341
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,575
Elmo

1342
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:07,647
Jillian

1343
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:13,023
I don't know what to do

1344
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,567
Voice

1345
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:30,943
Define her as a talent search for comedy lines

1346
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,247
She would be the biggest sensation in

1347
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:36,319
Country

1348
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:42,719
That was that

1349
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:04,991
That's not great

1350
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,783
Pretty f*** a defensive

1351
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:08,319
Yeah I just have a question

1352
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,623
He let his kids

1353
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:11,647
Watch sesame

1354
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:15,487
Globalist programming

1355
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,767
That's a weird thing to

1356
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,679
Nobody's trying to get across

1357
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:27,007
Gross

1358
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:32,639
I thought I had more to say but I don't

1359
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:35,711
It really just doesn't match up at all with what he's trying to present

1360
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:42,111
He's laughing as a literal

1361
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:46,207
Which is slightly

1362
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:59,519
Well she's around in this January 2013

1363
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:00,799
She is so funny she

1364
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:01,567
If you just

1365
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:02,335
What

1366
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:04,895
Small-time Comedy Club

1367
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:08,735
She needs Alex right for her the brains of the operation

1368
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:10,527
She is a clown to him

1369
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:15,647
Text Cliff Alex talks about these are all from September 29th

1370
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:16,415
2012

1371
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:18,719
Wendy's video Broke

1372
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:22,815
But this woman is

1373
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:28,191
I got an Obama phone

1374
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:34,591
It's sad

1375
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:36,895
So his version of it is almost like

1376
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:40,223
It's not even good to laugh at

1377
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:41,759
Beyond

1378
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:44,063
This deserves reproach

1379
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:50,719
Clips from the Alex on the Nightly News

1380
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:52,511
1240 calls

1381
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:53,279
National

1382
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:57,375
Then again some people like to laugh at that lady

1383
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:59,423
It's very very sad that

1384
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:04,799
Their hopes and dreams are to elect someone who will take from others to give to them

1385
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:08,895
American Nightmare

1386
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:11,455
So I just

1387
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:15,807
This caller while he doesn't have all these clips that his disposal necessarily

1388
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:16,831
I think he's making

1389
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:17,855
Pretty FairPoint

1390
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:19,903
Defensive about it because

1391
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:20,927
Exactly what

1392
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:21,951
What he's doing

1393
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:27,839
It should be pointed out that on September 28th

1394
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:37,567
Quote a video clip posted by the charger port has since gone viral which shows no papa supporters semi in coherently

1395
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:38,335
Blathering

1396
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:40,895
But how she's voting for Obama

1397
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:43,455
Because the government gave her a free Phone Tracker

1398
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:48,319
Underscore

1399
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:51,135
Both simultaneously stealing their entire economic future

1400
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:53,439
Quote

1401
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:58,047
Once you've recovered from the hilarity of the video clip The Awful Truth begins

1402
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:01,119
Future quotes

1403
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:01,887
Freaking

1404
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:02,655
Lincoln death

1405
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:05,471
The delusion that these people are living under

1406
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:06,495
Knows no bounds

1407
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:12,639
Paul Joseph Watson article on a weekly racial

1408
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:19,039
10 kind of because it might be unintentional entire economic

1409
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:22,367
Future has been sold down the river these people have allowed their votes

1410
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:24,159
To be bought by a free phone

1411
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:27,743
For the course being sold down the river is in reference to

1412
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:31,583
To the slave trade on the Lake Mississippi

1413
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:34,143
I don't know if that's intentional but it

1414
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:34,911
It's very weird

1415
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:39,007
I don't know it could be nothing could be a lot of

1416
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:41,311
Is there a lot of regional

1417
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:44,639
Different idioms that

1418
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:47,455
Trace their lineage

1419
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:53,855
So December 11th 2012

1420
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:59,231
The video was cited by critics of big government as a reflection of the typical Obama supporter

1421
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:02,047
Someone lazily dependent on government handouts

1422
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:04,607
How to vote could easily be bought with free stuff

1423
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:05,631
Lazily

1424
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:06,655
First off

1425
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:07,935
She is very cold here

1426
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,239
You understand

1427
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:14,080
Made Crystal Clear what

1428
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,176
Even even in that video.

1429
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:19,968
She's not being lazy like she's

1430
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:23,552
She has to go.

1431
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:25,600
What are you guys doing

1432
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:31,488
Just nothing that's real about what Alex's presenting about his

1433
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:36,096
Engines are in the present

1434
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:39,168
Because on January 15th 2013

1435
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:44,288
Alex posted an article on Infowars about how he woke up the Obama Phone Lady

1436
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:47,872
Because she came around

1437
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:51,200
It's enough of a propaganda win

1438
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:52,224
But he's able to

1439
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:52,992
Super 10

1440
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:53,760
But he's

1441
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:54,528
Succeeded here

1442
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:56,064
But ultimately it doesn't matter

1443
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:56,832
Because

1444
01:20:57,088 --> 01:21:01,184
The only people who cared about this story cared about it to push Romney

1445
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,744
That's the only reason that it made it on drugs

1446
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:07,584
They were using these Welfare Queen races bracket types

1447
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,888
And stuff like that but the purpose was

1448
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:12,448
Find it was Romney

1449
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:16,544
Is right that article on December 11th

1450
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:26,272
Animated team articles about the Obama Phone Lady passed

1451
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:33,696
Alex on the explanation because Infowars doesn't operate in the entire

1452
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:41,120
World that the this funnel does cross-purposes a little bit

1453
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,144
Sometimes have

1454
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,448
Their own druthers

1455
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:49,056
They follow their druthers

1456
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:51,616
Recycled viral content

1457
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:52,640
Yeah

1458
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:55,456
So

1459
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:57,760
Clip here and it's just one of the weirder things

1460
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:59,296
Michelle says

1461
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:00,832
View towards the end

1462
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,368
They're talking about how

1463
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:04,160
Police are out of line

1464
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:05,696
Which is a FairPoint

1465
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,536
Example of why

1466
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:12,608
Is really weird see if you can catch what

1467
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:25,920
Attention

1468
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:31,040
Hugo

1469
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:36,160
The police is watching it all

1470
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:41,024
I've confused

1471
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:45,888
Cleveland you can walk around naked in Cleveland Heights

1472
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,168
You cannot

1473
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:53,312
Police station

1474
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:58,432
Metaphor is

1475
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:06,368
Cleveland Heights place that they're cops

1476
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:09,440
Constantly discriminating against black people in Cleveland

1477
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:13,536
Play oh I think I think you could probably make an argument the witch

1478
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:17,120
She's saying what you saying is that there over police

1479
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:23,008
Cleveland Heights Cleveland

1480
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:26,848
And possibly hours in Cleveland Heights such a police presence

1481
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,384
You can't get away with

1482
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:34,784
But it sounds funny it sounds funny but there's probably like a reality behind it

1483
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,344
Emojis described

1484
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:40,672
Well if she's trying to argue about the

1485
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:42,208
Over policing

1486
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:45,792
If she's trying to complain about not being able to walk around naked

1487
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:51,680
Because the Cleveland cop saw you walking around naked they still have some

1488
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:53,984
So I mean

1489
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,776
Beyond any like

1490
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,568
Fine points

1491
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,384
They're behind the nudity in Cleveland

1492
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,176
Argument

1493
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:02,944
I don't know

1494
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:07,808
You kind of get the descent with that's kind of as good as this interview could ever be

1495
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:09,600
Really you don't like

1496
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:10,880
It Alex

1497
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:15,232
Sublevel knows that when he's walking into is

1498
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:16,768
Either going to be

1499
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,560
Him getting hurt

1500
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,096
Hillside

1501
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:20,864
Things

1502
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:21,632
Event

1503
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,168
4

1504
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:24,448
She says

1505
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:27,264
Stuff like you can't walk around naked in Cleveland Heights

1506
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,360
Right

1507
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:32,640
Alex is already

1508
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:34,432
Presented

1509
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:36,736
Is that himself up in such a

1510
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:37,504
Situation

1511
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,808
That he wins kind of no matter what

1512
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:41,856
Although is a pyrrhic victory

1513
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:48,256
Like I don't think most people listen to our show or you or almost anybody

1514
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:52,352
Because the Obama Phone Lady video with

1515
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:55,936
Specifically used for the Romney campaign

1516
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:58,752
But it was a media arms

1517
01:24:59,008 --> 01:24:59,776
Supporting the Rodney King

1518
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:02,080
Campaign

1519
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:04,896
Better than

1520
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:07,200
Especially associated

1521
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:11,040
No kinky

1522
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:12,064
Almost 100

1523
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:14,368
He left it at

1524
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,416
They're just there to clown

1525
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:17,184
Which would be

1526
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,464
Reusing

1527
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:19,232
Walk-around

1528
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,536
Forgot to add

1529
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:23,072
Also they're using you as a

1530
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:24,864
Hopefully they

1531
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:26,400
Convince everybody that

1532
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:30,752
Look even the prototypical

1533
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:32,544
Obama voter

1534
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,312
Steve-O

1535
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,848
Will will

1536
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:35,872
Abandoned

1537
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:37,152
Right

1538
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,760
For Alex

1539
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:44,320
Nope

1540
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:48,928
I was a little disappointed because I

1541
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:50,720
You know I'd spent a lot of time

1542
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:52,512
With the Armada episode

1543
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:55,840
Atlanta Wednesday episode getting into the

1544
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:57,632
Play flyer

1545
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:59,168
Channel

1546
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:05,056
Do tell you don't have to

1547
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:06,336
Forgot

1548
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:11,456
That the next episode was the OPA

1549
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:14,784
Bike work on the episode I turned it on and I was like

1550
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,904
I was like this is going to take

1551
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,696
The entire episode

1552
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,256
Really

1553
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:26,560
For us to learn

1554
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:28,864
On that level I'm actually kind of happy because

1555
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,400
Ultimately

1556
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:31,168
That

1557
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:31,936
What Alex

1558
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:32,704
She's up to

1559
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:36,032
What he like

1560
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:37,824
To do how he operates

1561
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:40,128
Butler

1562
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:47,552
It's not even happening in the contact

1563
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:53,440
What other what other conclusion is there too

1564
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:54,464
To draw

1565
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:56,000
Alex

1566
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:58,304
Is trying to create a

1567
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:02,656
Racist caricature

1568
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:06,752
What do you mean think about the the The Welfare Queen parallels

1569
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,568
Obviously

1570
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,360
The image of the Welfare Queen

1571
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:14,176
Is used to try and push through

1572
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:15,968
Unpopular Legend

1573
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:19,808
Dysplasia

1574
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,112
But it's also used to deflect

1575
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:22,880
From

1576
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:25,440
Sort of ideas of Cruelty on the right

1577
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:28,000
Trying to help

1578
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:29,792
These Welfare Queen

1579
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:31,840
The state that they're living

1580
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:36,192
Myth

1581
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:39,008
To make yourself look like not the month

1582
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:40,544
Monster that you are

1583
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,616
It really is very parallel to what Alex is doing

1584
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:46,432
Her in this way

1585
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,968
In order to human eyes

1586
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:48,736
Himself

1587
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:51,296
I'm willing to reach out

1588
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:53,856
This person who's such a f******

1589
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:59,232
Typical Obama supporter of manifestation of everything I hate art Animas

1590
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:03,840
It's the

1591
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,120
I don't know

1592
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:07,168
That's a bummer and I'm glad to be

1593
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:08,192
He passed it cuz

1594
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:10,496
I don't want to I don't want to suck it

1595
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:16,896
About this I know he doesn't hire her I don't think she shows back up

1596
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:17,920
On the show ever again

1597
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:20,992
I think this is probably the end of

1598
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,064
Next week

1599
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:28,160
Until then we website

1600
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:33,280
Correct we also on Twitter

1601
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:35,584
Bowser want Facebook

1602
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:41,728
Best

1603
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:46,848
There's so many of them and aluminum

1604
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:51,968
Responding within a couple days

1605
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:54,016
Ignore it

1606
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:55,296
Like that before

1607
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:56,832
Like fuk you I don't give a

1608
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,976
Obama Phone Lady hasn't killed

1609
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:04,000
She definitely

1610
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:06,048
Isaac

1611
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:09,120
We would have heard about it if she killed

1612
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:12,704
Absolutely

1613
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:16,288
Technically probably has killed

1614
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:17,056
Somebody

1615
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:19,104
Make a clown

1616
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:24,736
Holding

1617
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:30,368
Alexandra Thurston color
