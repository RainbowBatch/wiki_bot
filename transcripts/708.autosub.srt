00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,736
Nola.com

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge by now it's like I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,064
Knowledge fight

4
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:07,072
Hotel room and worship Selene from afar and talk a little bit

5
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:12,192
Alex Jones

6
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:16,288
Jordan is just like

7
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,056
Getting

8
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,920
I had such high hopes

9
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:26,528
Of being able to get an episode about that documentary out on the day it was released

10
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,904
And I thought there's no way I'm going to be able to

11
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,928
Perseverance

12
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,488
Stick-to-itiveness

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
Whatever you want to call it

14
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,560
Persistence

15
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,120
We managed to do it and I'm proud of us for it

16
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,912
Although a presstime

17
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:46,496
No response from Glenn Greenwald

18
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,800
Bora or Matt Taibbi

19
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,080
Nothing for me

20
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,872
No soul searching

21
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,944
Nope post unsubscribe haven't seen them be like

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,248
This is why we're examining our life

23
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,016
Is not one

24
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,928
I want a question why I didn't think it was weird that Sandy Hook came up in the context of why people are mad at Alex

25
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,464
It's just because of trump

26
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh yeah

27
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,096
I am glad that we were able to do that

28
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,680
I I think that there is a

29
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:20,800
Such a whirlwind of Alex going on right now that it's so easy for things to get lost

30
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,848
And that seemed to important

31
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,920
To the larger body of like

32
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:32,320
Alex apologia yet I wanted to make sure that wasn't missed

33
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,136
I forgot to bring up one very important thing that wasn't

34
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,160
Documentary

35
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:40,256
Recent Wars

36
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,048
The most important

37
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:48,448
It wasn't in the documentary the crowning achievement of Alex's wife the culmination of his career

38
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,216
Warriors

39
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,544
Not in the document everybody here

40
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,872
It's you are right Alicia it

41
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:00,736
No mention of like Cleon skousen no no

42
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:07,136
Anyway what's your bread back on yours because yours is very magnanimous and sayings

43
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,416
That we got it done

44
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:13,024
Stayed up late until 3:30 or 4 this morning

45
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:18,912
You worked all the way until 10 a.m. this morning when most people they would have said hey

46
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
3:30

47
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,960
I'm just going to go to sleep

48
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:26,592
I'll do it tomorrow and then then the episode of going out at 9 p.m. at night that's not how you f***

49
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:31,200
Workday at the I don't want to go to bed until a task is done even if it's

50
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,736
Possible

51
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:39,136
Fight like hell to make it pop

52
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:46,560
More like 6 Central Time

53
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,888
You know people really rely on me not to be like

54
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,936
Hyperbolic

55
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,472
Actually you know what Jimmy Buffett says

56
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,544
Then I am somewhere

57
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:02,944
I have found something that I think will be a

58
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,968
A bit of fun

59
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:09,088
For folks still a little bit more

60
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,112
Impactful.

61
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,672
Not as hard as the the trial

62
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:16,768
Not as hard as the documentary Greenwald

63
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,815
I still off in the horizon

64
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,839
Going to do that soon

65
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,631
But we're going to have fun

66
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,959
This is an amuse-bouche

67
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,871
But also one of the things that I wanted to do was

68
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,431
Take an opportunity to

69
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:39,807
Do it take talk a little bit about the trial itself and how things are going on and

70
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,623
Give folks a little bit of a recap cuz obviously

71
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,647
That's

72
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:49,023
Step something on Friday just

73
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,071
After the case

74
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:58,239
TGIF

75
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,543
Same

76
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:07,455
David mentioned Philadelphia earlier

77
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,247
I'm hungry

78
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:15,647
I feel like you've been either keeping a real a real watchful eye on this case

79
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,975
I think so

80
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:24,607
I mean there I did I did go back because I read I read a lot of what I wrote

81
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:29,471
Today and I think that I could be making all of this up

82
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,519
Like if you read through that

83
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:36,639
That is a made-up there's no way that any of that is real based on a real thing I'm clearly hallucinating

84
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:43,039
In my hotel room after we recorded until 3 a.m. last night that must be what happened today

85
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:49,439
Thank you that were the case you'd have a lot more people responded to your tweets with like I'm worried about you because I'm watching the Stream

86
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,743
This is not at all what's happened

87
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
Well

88
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,815
I'm worried about you but not for that read

89
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,607
12 shirt

90
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,655
Dana par for the course

91
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,935
No it was

92
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,263
Today was I mean

93
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,311
It started

94
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,871
Good with Owen being a piece of s***

95
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,407
Who is trying to

96
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,455
Owen was trying to be like

97
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,527
That Stonewall witness where is like

98
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:19,135
You know I don't know if you and I don't know if you can prove I said that you know he's trying to do that whole thing

99
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:24,511
Pressure but everybody annoying until he left

100
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,791
The Jurassic

101
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,071
The jurors asked him to question

102
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,607
Is that where it was quite funny

103
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,887
The story of today

104
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,191
Is the jurors questions as

105
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,215
As time went on

106
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:33,983
Yeah right

107
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,519
They started off being

108
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,287
Very

109
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,823
Simple and

110
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
Then by the end of the day

111
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:45,759
They are wondering who is and is not a lizard person in the courtroom

112
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,807
Nobody was not aware of how this this

113
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,367
Does working out when you have the witnesses

114
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,951
The jury is able to record questions

115
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,487
That the judge will ask them

116
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:59,327
I'm right and people can object to the question

117
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,375
The judge can say I'm not going to ask that that's

118
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,399
Ridiculous

119
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,983
Too hard

120
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,519
But yeah

121
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,591
The progression of these questions has

122
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
If you're Alex

123
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,895
Skorys lawyer

124
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,175
You cannot

125
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,991
Feel good about something

126
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,295
Is the way that they are open

127
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:25,695
Yeah yeah it is it is hard not to think that the defense is like here's what we're going to

128
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,255
We're going to Red Pill these people

129
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:35,167
And those questions near the end of the day I have got me thinking that the opposite is true

130
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,959
Well actually we don't know tone

131
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:45,151
Are you a lizard person we could we could be totally missed

132
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:49,503
I wish that were to possibility but I will put it at maybe 15 20%

133
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,343
I feel quite I feel quite low odds

134
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:57,695
And then we then we played some depositions Rob Jake

135
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:01,023
Demolition crack up the Kraken

136
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,303
But dondi's deposition

137
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,839
Which was so funny

138
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,631
And listening to him talk

139
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:11,775
About how much he loves Infowars and how close he is with them and how they're his favorite people

140
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,335
Depose next to Dari be like I don't know if I've ever been

141
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:20,735
Ben-Hur to put on day before my birthday

142
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:25,599
Absolutely love my daughter money like it's that kind of made me a kraken plushie

143
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,903
It was it was that

144
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:34,047
I'm laughing about that but at the same time there is a pesos to that because

145
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,607
This guy is being used by

146
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:42,751
Play cannot absolve him of any of these things probably on his own

147
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,567
But he's being egged on and

148
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,895
Directed in some way and

149
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:54,015
Validated and probably told by Alex that you're part of the family and all of this

150
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,343
And it's going on a bed once it's inconvenient ending

151
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,367
Incredibly

152
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,415
Dammit

153
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,999
To be too close with patandi you immediately cut bait and

154
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,023
Never heard of her

155
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,583
Never heard of this guy is kind of sad

156
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,119
It is it is cuz he was

157
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,191
He was really expressing just various versions of like

158
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
It feels good

159
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,263
Get feels good to get a good boy from Alex

160
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,799
You know I imagined

161
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
I guess

162
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
The UPS

163
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,759
Swing of it is Oregon

164
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,551
Maybe the justice of it is

165
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:33,951
Because there is that little bit of pesos maybe we can feel okay that the Gandhi himself is not getting sued

166
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,743
Off the hook

167
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,279
Or whatever

168
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,047
I mean

169
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,631
It is it is a little bit like don't be done.

170
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,655
Deposition

171
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,471
Kind of makes him look to be more the gun and not

172
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,495
Somebody who is firing

173
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,263
You know

174
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,591
So it's like well I mean I know he's a person but also

175
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:55,711
He's a person shaped like a gun that doesn't think real well so that kind of a problem

176
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,807
Convince the Sandy Hook

177
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:05,695
Is a false flag or whatever video yelling at somebody about it and no one cares

178
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,487
Aldar there's not going to be second

179
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,767
Video

180
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,535
Keep going

181
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:14,399
If you have a platform like Alex's show like the Nightly News on Infowars

182
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,447
That's willing to validate and

183
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,727
Disseminate your content

184
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
And

185
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:22,079
Connect you with like Wolfgang halbig in right you know like

186
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:22,847
B

187
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,151
It cut its encouraging in a way

188
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:29,759
Again I don't know we can prove it but I would say probably

189
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,295
Facilitate

190
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,063
Pizza kind of makes

191
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:37,183
It happened it happened and that is what the afternoon testimony was almost in

192
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,487
Entirely about Becca Lewis

193
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,023
Spy hero to the

194
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,839
Squatch forever well I appreciate that

195
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,887
Did do a great job on the train

196
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,959
Sasquatch has no hearing

197
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:55,615
I will I'm I'm nominating her potential here over dishwasher

198
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,895
Artificial light

199
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,431
Understand

200
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:02,527
But she did a spectacular job explaining like

201
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:07,903
The difference between what happens whenever you post on Facebook and what happens when you post on

202
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,671
Infowars

203
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,231
And while it seems like it that's a very

204
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,023
G-Eazy thing for people to

205
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,815
To just instinctively grasp around

206
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,863
It is kind of complicated

207
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,655
Whenever you start getting into

208
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,935
What it is better

209
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:25,055
Memes to post on Facebook you know you get 100 shares or whatever and you think while I'm the meteor

210
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:25,823
Innovation

211
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,847
As opposed to

212
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,663
When Infowars post something maybe it says 100

213
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,223
But because it's Infowars it's on this platform

214
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
Echoes over there

215
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:39,647
And then because it it's like a spider Wester bution of the content

216
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:45,535
She made clear the better it was now they're getting that s*** yeah

217
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:51,935
Kind of hard to recognize now in 2022 and even over the past few years the different nature

218
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,471
Sure of what Facebook was like

219
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,775
Can 2012 2013 2014

220
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:02,431
Like it was not the same website that it is now wow I didn't even consider that but I don't think anybody can say

221
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,735
Fitted that I imagine that if they'd actually

222
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,015
Just been like okay

223
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:10,111
Let me show you who screenshot of Facebook in 2020 12 and what it look

224
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:15,487
I think that would be a very different question as well that's why I think so and I think

225
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,047
That it was it was the last

226
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,839
And unusable website

227
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:23,935
And more like it wasn't as much of a like place where people

228
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,751
In a grandparent chain emails

229
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:31,359
Basically be reposted over and over again

230
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,455
Confined to smaller spaces groups of people who hated

231
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,503
Gardening but somehow wanted to know

232
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
To your point

233
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,879
With the lake if you have 100 shares or whatever

234
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,207
And you're like the hundred people who are sharing it

235
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,231
Are people who have

236
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,791
Spigen audience of two exact you know it's

237
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,071
It's

238
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,607
It's a distorted

239
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,679
Image of 100 chairs and Route real like right

240
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,215
Well it's real but it's

241
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,495
It's not as impactful as

242
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,775
2 shares from

243
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
Bike

244
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:07,711
Tia Becca did a great job she was fantastic on the stand

245
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,063
And I thought it was interesting to watch the

246
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,879
The Defence try and do the cross

247
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,415
My God it was

248
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
Cuz it was weird

249
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,231
I don't even know how to describe that guy's

250
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
Performance today

251
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,535
I think that was

252
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,583
Today I really did feel like

253
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,911
Like I tweeted this and I don't want to repeat

254
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,519
Exactly

255
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,287
But

256
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:38,687
Today really felt like the first day that Infowars tried to put the system on trial instead of Infowars being

257
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,223
Cross-examined in like

258
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,015
Here's why you guys are terrible

259
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:42,783
This was

260
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,063
Shitballs first

261
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
The temp to be like

262
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,367
Here's what I'm going to do

263
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,415
I'm going to prove that you're a liar

264
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:52,511
I'm going to prove that you aren't an expert at all what is

265
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,583
Harvard Law School price

266
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,191
Stafford law school can you walk me through an entire statista

267
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,471
6 class holder

268
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:07,871
It was it was very much that it was like Alex's questions for somebody who actually knows something and they do now

269
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,407
Not sound good in a in a quart

270
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,967
No

271
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,991
To be a little bug

272
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,295
Over the course of the last

273
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,575
Few days do their bidding

274
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,599
Some things

275
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,879
They have gone on

276
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:22,463
There has been probably the biggest

277
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
Moment

278
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:27,839
Outside of the Rolling Thunder of darya's horrible performing

279
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,399
It went on way too long

280
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,191
Exhausting

281
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,983
But I think honestly

282
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
Most

283
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,287
Of that

284
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,823
Is stuff there

285
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
It relates

286
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
At least

287
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,639
Sort of

288
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,711
Tangentially to stuff we covered in the

289
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:49,855
Right and I don't know if anything happened in the courtroom that is more shocking than Daria saying

290
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,135
Chipotle

291
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,415
Is a image of Hope

292
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,951
Yep an expression of Hope

293
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,231
Yep and so

294
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,767
I don't want to dwell too much on it

295
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
Because

296
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,863
I don't know other people have talked about it. He was trending on Twitter

297
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:05,983
Things I think stick out are obviously the fight

298
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,263
That Mark

299
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,055
And the defense attorney

300
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
Been to course

301
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,639
Add a little little fun

302
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
Hey it's Jack

303
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,503
Texas Justice

304
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,063
I think I should have had to do with li

305
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,879
I think they might still and then

306
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:27,999
The other thing was Owen being we're going on Infowars and tacos

307
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,071
And the moment of him saying

308
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:34,143
That his lawyer had not told him about the rules

309
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,679
Of him being a witness

310
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,983
And not being able to talk to other women

311
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,055
And not being able to talk about the case

312
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,591
That was

313
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
I mean

314
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,687
If if there was a moment

315
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,223
That was needed to be like

316
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
This is

317
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,039
This is disrespectful

318
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
Like the bad guy

319
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,159
You know

320
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,951
I knew

321
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:58,975
Where we be

322
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,767
But still

323
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
I thought the

324
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,583
When the actual trial happen

325
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,655
And I don't know why I thought this I feel like a

326
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,423
The fool

327
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:12,287
Cuz I still had that thought in the back of my mind even though I knew here's what I'm going to do and expect the worst

328
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,335
It's still in my head I was like

329
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,359
At the

330
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,383
Actual trial

331
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,943
They will have prepared

332
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,735
Something hahaha

333
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,271
Nothing

334
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:28,927
I mean nothing prepared emotionally to be this Brazen I don't know if there is a way to prepare to be

335
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,719
I think you're born with this kind of

336
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,047
Involves whiskey

337
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:37,119
Cantina theme

338
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,679
Yeah it's so I don't know

339
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,495
It's interesting for me to look at it

340
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,287
I'd recognize that like

341
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:48,895
I think that there is a not-insignificant amount of our audience who are watching

342
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,663
The LifeStraw

343
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,199
Of the trial

344
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
And

345
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:58,367
To any discussion of something that would be redundant there is not

346
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
Is it a lot of

347
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,671
Outlets are covering the

348
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:04,767
The trial and some of them have a better understanding of law

349
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:09,887
100 opening arguments didn't episode the game out of believe today about the

350
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
The case ohyeah

351
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
I don't know

352
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
Are you

353
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,591
Feel that I'm at my best

354
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,407
When were talking about things that other people aren't talk

355
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,967
Yeah and when there's other coverage

356
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,735
Just things

357
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,759
I kind of feel like

358
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,319
We'll end up just being another voice

359
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,391
And that's not to say that we shouldn't talk about the trial at all

360
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,231
Are you talk about our feelings on it but

361
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:40,607
I don't have as much of an interest in doing like a play-by-play on it

362
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,655
Like I would with the documentary

363
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,447
At least until it's over

364
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,471
Well

365
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,263
The reality of it is

366
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,799
In our

367
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:54,175
Is that what is happening is they're just being forced to listen to

368
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,455
All of the evidence

369
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,247
Instead has been presented against them

370
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,087
Not not necessarily collected by but you specifically

371
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,903
Just that that's what our show is to

372
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
You know and there's

373
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,463
They're looking at it and the

374
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,487
That would be redundant

375
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,535
For us to cover it because it's the same stuff we

376
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,303
We have cover

377
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,375
You know they're just presenting the evidence that we've spent

378
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,423
Talking about

379
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,191
Finally

380
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,983
Dumb people's face

381
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:24,127
Yeah it's a little bit brief in terms of like

382
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:24,895
The court recap

383
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,431

For comedian

00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,199
I don't know if they're one of your old friends

409
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,015
But somebody that I knew dad was friendly with

410
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:41,695
Chicago ever Maynard got new places

411
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,255

I am great

413
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,887
They're great and I got in this this mood of thinking about stand-up

414
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,167
Really fortunate

415
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
Because

416
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,239
I'm banned. Video

417
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:58,335
Owen Shroyer released in 18 minutes that is

418
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,967
Owen Shroyer does a stand-up special

419
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,551
Yeah stand-ups

420
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:15,231
Did he get a chance he'll not because if he gets one and I have never gotten one I am going to be mad I'm going to be furious

421
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,023
You've never auditioned I don't think

422
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,607
Well every I'm nobody's ever even ask me that's how bad

423
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,191
Considered asking me so we don't need to worry about

424
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:28,287
The audition audition

425
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,079
Cyf

426
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,871
And it was

427
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,407
Painfully clear

428
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:40,063
Even going into it they were interested in seeing and I doubt the rest of the show right

429
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,879
You know the producers asked me to like

430
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:49,279
Be a part of that pattern your meeting was so f****** clear like

431
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,583
All right before people that have a shot

432
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,607
View

433
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:56,447
If you torpedo this f****** room yeah then maybe

434
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:01,567
Will consider it but like you don't really have a shot

435
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:04,127
Oh you came here with your agents

436
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,687
And we all came by ourselves

437
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,967
We're not going

438
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,991
Djfl are we

439
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,039
Nowhere

440
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,343
So this was at a

441
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,135
Bryson Gray

442
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,488
Rappers

443
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
Comedian

444
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,024
Flash

445
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,096
Public figure man I'll go figure

446
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,376
Real Renaissance

447
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:29,728
I call him that I don't know too much about him actually cuz I

448
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:34,080
I think that he lives mostly in the War Room guests.

449
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,616
Are you seeing him less

450
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,688
If I even remember to be on Infowars

451
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,712
But I'm sure he has

452
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,248
He's been on with Alex

453
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,016
Brightside

454
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,344
Yeah he's a guy who's running a little bit of a show

455
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,136
In San Antonio

456
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:53,536
In San Antonio have been there

457
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,560
On the day that we got

458
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,888
The wrong City

459
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,424
So this

460
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,960
Had

461
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,728
That's

462
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,544
Who else was on the Bliss

463
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:08,128
That night

464
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,432
There were two people from

465
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,712
2000 Buick

466
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:16,832
But not tonight D'Souza other people involved in 2008

467
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:21,184
There was that that Maga rapper did that song with Rodger

468
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,744
Stone stone is dancing

469
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:29,120
I I just don't do it you know whenever the Maga people have their culture

470
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,144
That they in

471
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,704
50 is something we might describe as rap

472
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,984
Or something we might describe

473
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,008
Humor

474
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,568
I just did I disagree with them on the prince

475
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,872
It's not rap for fun

476
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,664
So I'm done I be honest

477
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,456
Sickflowz

478
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:48,064
Well then I guess I take it back

479
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,672
The fastest rapper in the world

480
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,232
Methamphetamine lyrics god dammit

481
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,792
Here is

482
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,816
Owens

483
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,120
Introduction you got to come out of the Gates Strong

484
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,680
Obviously you want if you are

485
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,448
Someone who is

486
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:07,776
Maybe starting to get into the world of stand-up Niwot a little bit

487
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,592
Strong opener

488
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,360
Strong closer

489
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:16,224
You know the old the old saying you know your best joke is last in your second best joke

490
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,992
August 1st

491
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,272
That's the way you do it

492
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:23,392
You can tread water for a little while in the middle get away with it if you stroke

493
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,184
Strong close strong

494
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,720
So here's Owen opening

495
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,848
Did he

496
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,368
Snooze

497
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,792
Woo

498
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:05,120
So the tacos thing

499
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,656
That was that Jill Biden

500
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,192
Comment

501
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,520
About the

502
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:15,872
The Hispanic population is diverse as the bodegas in the Bronx

503
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,176
Brighten the breakfast tacos

504
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,224
Obviously the point that she was making

505
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:24,064
Not a defensive one right but boy was it

506
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,136
They got her boy was it got it

507
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,416
She should have

508
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:32,256
Reconsider the way she was

509
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,304
But yeah I mean I guess

510
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,584
It was

511
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,864
Pretty recent I guess

512
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,912
To Whitney did the stand-up special

513
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,448
Until coming out with a

514
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,216
Topical

515
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,264
Hey we got any tacos out there

516
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,288
Wolf

517
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
Yeah

518
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,360
Hey hey that's what they call you

519
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:53,760
I'm calling you that produced you and

520
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:58,880
Greeted you that way without performing the context Jewel that would give you the idea that I'm above that it was

521
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:05,280
It's it's so widely known within the displacement like you have

522
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,304
Explain

523
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,840
I need to explain to you

524
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,888
Man in our listeners probably

525
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,936
So yeah they know it's so well.

526
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,704
It's been that

527
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,752
Top headline at every right

528
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:18,592
Refugio Biden calls Mexican people tacos is absurd

529
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,920
I can't believe that I have no idea about that

530
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:25,248
Whatsoever and that's just the most famous thing in the right

531
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,088
Crazy this is also caution

532
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:34,720
Two people want to get it set up be careful about whether or not you think your material will age

533
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,256
Right Right Alright this is

534
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:42,400
This is tired so we left already unrelatable

535
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,448
Easier for John Stewart to like

536
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,216
S*** talk

537
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,008
Gaffes you know the late night shows

538
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,824
They talked the gas all look at the president he said this

539
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,640
You know and then it's gone tomorrow because it's a very

540
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,664
To throw away

541
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,992
Right you know you don't need it and if you're saying it out loud on stage

542
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,528
You should stop being on stage

543
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,976
Did make the news people talking about that

544
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,512
About exactly it's not like he was

545
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:12,608
Following biting around like everybody's lying about you but thanks for

546
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,632
Hanging out and having

547
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,400
Cancer with me

548
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,168
Yeah

549
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,216
GasBuddy

550
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:22,080
I was reflecting on it be I made reference to somebody being like

551
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,104
Precinct list three

552
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,920
I didn't realize it but what I was

553
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,992
Trying to pull up in my memory was that George W bush

554
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:32,064
Who's giving it like a press speech on a golf course

555
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,368
And that he was talking about like a rock

556
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,440
And now a watch this drive

557
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,464
That's right

558
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,792
Are you forgotten that that's what why wouldn't I was in my mind

559
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,328
Wow I take

560
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:46,912
Outside of all of the context of being George W bush and

561
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,448
Talking about Iraq

562
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,752
It's a pretty baller movie

563
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:56,128
God dammit yes it was like a science

564
00:26:56,384 --> 00:27:02,528
Terrible terrible

565
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,576
Can't be president if you say that

566
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,112
That should be

567
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,672
Again I'm not saying that we need to make like big

568
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:14,816
Grand lies I'm saying that we should make more targeted very specific laws like if you say that to the media

569
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:18,912
You immediately stop being president

570
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,216
That arises from that is like

571
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,520
Was that an attempt to be funny

572
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,568
Or was that something that was just like

573
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:30,688
He uncomfortably said it and it ended up here

574
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,992
Amazingly disrespectful and very funny

575
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,016
Knowing w

576
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,808
The way that we all do after

577
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,600
Do they sell many years I imagine

578
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:43,232
I just really wanted to hit the drive and they kept asking him questions and Zoe weapon chili he lost in

579
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,512
Interesting what they were doing

580
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,280
And was like

581
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,584
I'm going to go hit this drive I'm the president

582
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:53,728
So he doesn't but the media didn't cover it but they did

583
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,056
Decides to develop

584
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,336
OfficeTeam a little bit of

585
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:02,944
Sicknesses that Biden hats

586
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,736
Not necessarily just a joke

587
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,016
Maybe

588
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,880
Joe Biden covid

589
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,440
Dementia

590
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,408
Arabia

591
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:39,040
Turn All the Lights Off

592
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,464
20 minutes

593
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,816
No but you noticed

594
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:57,472
Who stand up that I think a lot of people

595
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,032
Like

596
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
Right

597
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,848
It is a little bit like

598
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,152
Saying like oh I could

599
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:08,736
Just go sing the national anthem in front of the staple

600
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,272
Where you like

601
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,576
Sure maybe you know how to sing

602
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,624
You could physically do it

603
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,928
Yes but you don't know what the

604
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:22,048
The song actually sounds like until when you sing at your kind of layoff and that's

605
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,144
Stand-up has a music in the Rhythm and the end of vibe to it

606
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,448
And if you are singing a bad song

607
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,472
That's going to happen

608
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:35,104
You also don't really know what that you're going to feel when it doesn't go the way you expect yeah

609
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,968
Unless you've done it a lot of times that could be really disoriented

610
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,248
And you can end up in

611
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:44,832
Situations like we just heard there like he has no control over the audio

612
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,368
Is the Allen shootout

613
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:52,768
Just like I will say that I do like

614
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,520
If you if you weren't doing it like he was trying to do a bit

615
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,800
It's at the if you were asked

616
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,824
Accidentally or

617
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:12,224
Maybe even on purpose I get like that and that would be funny but unfortunately for like an Auntie, decent away

618
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,552
Absolutely also Biden went to those countries

619
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,576
Before

620
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,624
I was diagnosed with covid

621
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,648
Also we stop

622
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,952
UPS tracking and tracing way before

623
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:25,024
Never got it I actually but would bet that there has been

624
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,816
Some attempt to attract

625
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,584
King in Tracy

626
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,608
Given

627
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,376
O'Reilly

628
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,424
Yeah yeah yeah but the people that he has

629
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,752
Contact with yeah but yeah those trips that

630
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,544
Not after

631
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,872
Find canceled like a domestic

632
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:44,736
QuikTrip because of Coke

633
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,808
60 never outside

634
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,112
Wishing well

635
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,928
Covid

636
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,072
Manuel

637
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,192
I'm going to go Gray

638
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,104
Why

639
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:17,504
Yeah it's not that great but the structure of a joke

640
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,112
I like the low and then they just kidding it at somebody else or not

641
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,952
Babies of that that was a very that

642
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:32,096
What is kind of an interesting thing about the rights version of humor you know they have the structure of a joke but they just say something they believe

643
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,376
You know like

644
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:36,704
I don't want him to dive covid iwant him to die of cancer

645
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,728
That's what he said

646
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,776
And so he wasn't joking

647
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,056
Maybe but

648
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,104
If you just look at it from a purely

649
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,384
Comedic perspective

650
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,432
Mister Ed

651
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,968
Is the classic mr. X

652
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:50,272
Congratulations on you pulled that off

653
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,320
Kind of that is true that is true

654
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,088
Bow Wow

655
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,624
There is just a better that's

656
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,464
The punch adult that their punch shoppable joke though I mean you don't go from covid

657
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,232
The cancer

658
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,768
You escalated into a

659
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,536
Completely

660
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,560
Territory you know

661
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,096
We don't want to die if covid

662
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,656
We wanted to be hit by a giant rubber duck

663
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,448
You know you really push it

664
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,080
To be absurd might be helpful but I think there's something about the

665
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,104
The Revenant

666
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:22,016
Sound covid-19

667
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,088
I think I got to go with it

668
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:31,488
Sound is usable for humor much better than many of that maybe instead you should say he should be Brown

669
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:34,304
Caca

670
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,376
And it's not hard to punch up this joke

671
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:41,984
But he'd already established the cancer earlier so I think it kind of boxed in

672
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,776
The button doesn't have cancer

673
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:57,088
Clapter

674
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,856
Maybe I can

675
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,672
Thank you so much

676
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,208
Always he done

677
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:34,976
Thank God

678
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,256
Is it like

679
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,304
60 cents a gallon or is it what is it

680
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,072
I don't know

681
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,376
There's no context where there's no

682
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:47,776
What did Aikido put the same amount of gas in your tank every type of barrel

683
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,544
Yeah I mean

684
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,824
Is this a joke

685
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,128
I guess it is he's funny

686
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,920
He just thinks he's funny all the time

687
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:57,248
I would assume that a lot of his life

688
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:00,576
Revolves around people affirming that

689
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,880
A lot of people yelling you get them cut

690
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,184
Destroying stuff like that

691
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:06,976
DIA

692
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,000
I think that

693
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,072
There's any problem with this and that is that they

694
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:11,840
Complaining

695
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:14,656
The gas prices are too high for a very long time

696
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,192
And they're making fun of

697
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,496
Somebody achieving that

698
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,776
So that's a problem

699
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:26,176
The second problem is that does he not think that Trump has bragged about way smaller.

700
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,712
Reductions in gas price

701
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,504
I don't think you understand how he

702
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,088
I understand

703
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:37,440
No I know I understand that sometimes you want to just you know

704
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,000
Swing a big bat or whatever

705
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:42,048
Winter joke

706
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,072
Structural problem

707
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,120
The point that he's absolutely

708
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,168
I think what's what's fun about it

709
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,448
Is that for the far-right

710
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,984
Sprite you know how we

711
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:54,592
Comedians who are like everybody give it up for the troops in order to get a huge

712
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,360
The Applause break

713
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,640
For the far-right

714
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,688
Apparently you get an easier Place break if you're like

715
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,784
Biden is a Cancer and that's it

716
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,904
BB f****** hate what they see is like a virtue signalling in comedy in

717
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,184
Stop

718
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,976
What is that

719
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,792
No no no it's way different

720
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,888
Meme well I guess you could argue that it's elevated from

721
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:23,008
Pure virtue signaling because he's saying he doesn't have cancer he is cancer so there's like a linguistic

722
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,824
Twist using but it's

723
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,616
Elementary

724
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,664
Joe

725
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:30,944
I'll be only by

726
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,224
There's another

727
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:37,344
Jill Biden

728
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,136
No-oooooo we're talkin about

729
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,416
Hunter

730
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,664
Yeah it's

731
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,968
It's funny because he's horny

732
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:07,808
Now there's a strip club

733
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:14,208
How old is in San Antonio is there any reason to assume Hunter Biden would be

734
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
Any thoughts

735
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,024
Hey there's boobs in there

736
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,048
Let's put

737
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:21,376
These two together and how can I turn this into something that is

738
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,400
Is it going to let

739
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,472
Break ground in the industry

740
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,520
Yeah it really did

741
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,312
I really did

742
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,592
Hunter has come up

743
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:34,176
I have to say that I think that this next clip that he

744
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,224
This joke that he has about Hunter Biden

745
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:36,992
I think

746
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,040
He's as close as you're going to get to a good

747
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,832
Interesting

748
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,600
There's leg

749
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:45,952
To do some work on it I would recommend him hit some open mike okay

750
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,976
Think about what he

751
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,512
He's trying to say a little bit

752
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,280
There's some

753
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,048
Thing here

754
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,376
News

755
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,928
Car comes over the antenna

756
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,896
Sometimes

757
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,752
What's going on

758
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,312
Your

759
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:11,712
You're a legend.

760
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:15,040
What's the music that's a weird 12n.

761
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,320
The joke

762
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,600
In the act out of

763
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:21,696
I'm going to Best Buy in Victor

764
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:32,704
And gross it's disgusting

765
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,984
Tighten the B

766
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,008
Of what he was

767
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,288
Who's working on

768
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:39,616
The absurdity of a man going and buying a camera

769
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,408
To film his own criminal act

770
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,200
Yes yeah yeah yeah

771
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,296
The image of

772
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:50,112
That like why would you feel McCracken

773
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,904
Are the specs

774
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,000
So the camera like there is something there that you could chisel away at

775
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,024
It kind of

776
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,304
Barely funny joke

777
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,912
No context

778
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,704
Cuz what you got in your back pocket

779
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,728
Yeah. What you got

780
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,520
Compact in your back pocket on this

781
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,336
Rights as you can slowly escalated

782
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,128
Through that kind of prism

783
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,456
And then instead of being like a ruler to go look up to the whatever

784
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,480
You can be like

785
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,248
Wait

786
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,528
Are you Hunter Biden

787
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:25,184
That's what the you know and then it would be that would be a better life

788
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,072
I don't know whether to call the police or the manager is kind of lazy

789
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,888
That's something you would get out in like

790
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,520
The first three or four times you tell the DirecTV is not working

791
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,688
It was kind of like

792
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,712
Do I see you

793
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,992
Terrible good premise

794
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:55,136
Negated it halfway through instead of continuing whenever.

795
00:39:55,392 --> 00:40:01,536
You can't do that you got to have the Rhythm you got to have the music like what you're saying to is

796
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,096
And that is that like

797
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
The shock

798
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,448
Of the the twist or whatever bring it to the inside writing

799
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,264
It isn't earned know me and it's not like

800
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:17,152
It's not what the foundation of the joke was raised absurdity and then you went

801
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,176
But gross

802
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,992
What time does no time to process

803
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:25,088
So there's more topical stuff here

804
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,648
They're fighting

805
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,416
Oppression

806
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,208
Racism

807
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,352
Heard

808
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,888
Look fat

809
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,032
I don't know like

810
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,592
What that is exactly

811
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,920
But like in the context of a parody of o n

812
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:55,808
That's a pretty funny Alliance

813
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:58,112
It is a funny thing to say

814
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:01,952
Cuz it's so absurd that anyone would ever say it

815
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,744
Only owenwood

816
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,536
In the context

817
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,816
Something that is

818
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,376
Commenting on people like Owen

819
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,680
That is a great line to include

820
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:16,800
Obvious very bizarre

821
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:22,688
Yeah if you dressed up in a knowing suit and said that people be like that is the funniest impression I've ever seen

822
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:26,016
Sacha Baron Cohen character

823
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,368
Professional

824
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,720
Victoria Saudi Arabia

825
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:37,024
Find

826
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,792
Call Stearns

827
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,912
Google

828
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:01,599
Historically been a sport that was built on exclusion

829
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,647
In order to play it you needed access to

830
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,951
The huge areas of land which are usually expensive

831
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:06,719
Access

832
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:13,375
Expensive equipment and is deeply rooted in segregation with courses be part of golf club

833
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,655
We could choose to it

834
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:17,471
No black people if they want to do until relatively recent

835
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:21,311
Things have gotten gradually improved with a sport but it's

836
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,615
Still got a ways to go in terms of inclusion

837
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:24,639
Anyway

838
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:27,199
There's a larger backdrop behind the phenomenon that Owen is

839
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,223
Is discussing what you eat

840
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,783
Pretending not to know about it is relevant to

841
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,551
Did something

842
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,319
Ejected this joke

843
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,599
Also

844
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,647
The structure of this joke doesn't really make sense

845
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,183
He likes it

846
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:40,255
PGA you like sleep because he interprets them

847
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,535
Lesbian listen to work

848
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:46,399
Soar accepting gay people while he hates the NFL and NBA because they're too woke

849
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:53,055
Saudi Arabia apparently wants to buy Gall sewing wants them by the NFL and NBA presumably so they wouldn't be so

850
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:54,847
Gay people

851
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:57,407
But there's really only two ways this could make

852
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,175
Make sense

853
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:04,575
You have to believe that the sport of golf was preemptively being excluded of people in order to coordinate offer from Saudi Arabia

854
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,879
Whores that golf was previously full of woke

855
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:09,695
But Saudi Arabia somehow got them in check

856
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,999
Nothing about golf change because of

857
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:15,327
The possibility of Saudi Arabia buying the sport whatever that means

858
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,399
So there isn't a hinged put this on to make

859
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,167
The joke

860
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,983
If they bought the NBA it would stop being woke

861
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:25,311
This is just not very well-thought-out material he's just saying

862
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,335
Then hey

863
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,359
There's a

864
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:28,639
Venom

865
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,663
Bigotry that runs

866
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,199
Through the Gulf

867
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,479
I like

868
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:37,343
Right there is a vein of wokeness that goes through the NFL and NBA

869
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,927
Write Saudi Arabia is starting their own golf

870
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,463
Series that up buying the

871
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:45,279
PGA or something

872
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:47,327
Writers getting their own lives

873
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:53,727
Series of golf event and so he wants Arabia to get into these other professional sports because he

874
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,495
Believes

875
00:43:56,287 --> 00:44:01,407
The things that he complains about about Muslim culture would then be applied to any to be better

876
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:06,015
What he saying is that he would rather live in Saudi Arabia than he would live in the United States

877
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,575
Because the United States has to work in Saudi Arabia kills game

878
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,879
I I mean

879
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:16,767
I don't know how else to interpret the structure of other than he is saying that I would prefer

880
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,047
For f******

881
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:21,887
Sharia law to be the law of the land

882
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:25,215
NBA player

883
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,007
To say black people exist

884
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,823
At least he would like Sharia law to be applied to Spa

885
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,591
Sports bets

886
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:33,919
Baby

887
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:36,223
Yeah I mean was it what are you saying is like

888
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,759
Here's here's the problem right

889
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,551
NFL in a 2-1

890
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:42,111
That's why all of the openly gay players

891
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,903
Come out after they retire

892
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:44,927
Too much wealth

893
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,719
In the sport that's how it goes

894
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:51,071
So goddamn walk now it's naughty Arabia bought them

895
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,375
We wouldn't even need to worry about it would weigh

896
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,935
There is there are there are just like

897
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,727
Somatic

898
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:01,055
And I like idea based reasons that this joke

899
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,591
Pretty weird right

900
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,895
Especially for someone like going to be saying it right

901
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:08,223
But then even just from a structural standpoint it doesn't make sense like

902
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:10,271
What would be achieved by

903
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,575
Saudi Arabia

904
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,623
Buying a golf

905
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,183
If what I'm what I'm interpreting is that

906
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:17,951
He wants

907
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:20,255
Saudi Arabia to f******

908
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:22,815
People of

909
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:23,583
Anything that but

910
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:26,143
Straight white male then

911
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,191
He's doing a bad job of telling

912
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:28,959
A joke about

913
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:32,287
You know like I said from a from a telling the jokes

914
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,335
Standpoint if that's what you're trying to say

915
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,127
You going to have to write a better joke

916
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,943
Actually decent joke

917
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,479
It's simple

918
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:43,039
I kind of think it works it's Feller

919
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:45,599
I really respect and Greg

920
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:49,951
I really do hate

921
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:29,631
Oh no no no

922
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,423
That's a fine joke

923
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,703
Because of calling back

924
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:39,103
To Joe Biden interview on The Campaign trail with The Breakfast Club black if you have a problem

925
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,407
Deciding between him and Trump

926
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:43,967
Right

927
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,271
Apologize for it but like

928
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:50,111
Yeah that's making fun of something that did happen right

929
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,647
Maybe

930
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:54,207
Maybe the it could be Rewritten a little bit

931
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:57,791
I do I don't necessarily think of it like that's a Polish joke

932
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,607
Sure thing that he's trying to say like

933
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:03,935
These people are racist against Bryson Gray

934
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:11,103
Here I go for Joe Biden is the joke there and I mean on a scale

935
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:11,871
I know

936
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,687
Emperor for what this is that the find joke

937
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:17,503
Okay I guess I will get y a

938
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,807
Maga crowd would laugh at that

939
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,087
Run not be like what's

940
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:21,855
The joke

941
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,391
Here I get what the joke is

942
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,671
And why

943
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,463
If you're in that space you might think that's

944
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,255
Right right I mean

945
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,023
Okay

946
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:32,351
If I'm if I'm rewriting it I'm saying

947
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,911
You are coming dangerously close to

948
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:35,935
Not

949
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,471
Parroting the thing that you

950
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,751
You're describing but in fact

951
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,567
The thing that you're describing insofar as your

952
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,591
Describing a black person

953
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:43,871
Asthma in Black

954
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,919
Do do whatever it is you feel like

955
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:46,943
So you're saying

956
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:49,503
These people are criticizing him for this

957
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,295
And then you're doing the same thing

958
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,575
Only in a positive

959
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,647
So it's not really changing or or

960
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,951
Switching the premise around it's just like

961
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,487
I like

962
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:03,327
Deeper analysis that you're

963
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,863
You're touching on that I think

964
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,655
Could be there

965
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:10,239
Sure I'm looking at triviality of stamps

966
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,543
When we're on that level it works

967
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:20,223
Stuff like Biden saying that kind of stuff that's fair game that's what people should be lampooning if you're right

968
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:20,991
Play wingspan

969
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,015
Start

970
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,039
By all means

971
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:23,807
Yeah I know that's

972
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:32,255
Here we touch on Owen's getting it getting into the hot gun

973
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,327
Good guy with a gun

974
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,887
Situation that just happened recently

975
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:38,911
So funny

976
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,471
Indiana Mall

977
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:43,519
Animal

978
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,823
Very tragic

979
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,871
There was a hero

980
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,047
Place to go

981
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:06,815
Suggested

982
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,079
Get ready to do math

983
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:28,319
I don't want without t-shirt.

984
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,391
And they're sitting on the TV

985
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,431
Control

986
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:00,831
We forgot the joke

987
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,135
Yeah that's

988
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,671
Exactly like what

989
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:05,439
The

990
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,487
Right complains about

991
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,255
The left

992
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,535
Then stand up and

993
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,303
Stuff doing

994
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,863
Which is not being funny and just

995
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,655
Sort of virtue signaling

996
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,679
Lapoint yeah

997
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,215
And then just getting clapped

998
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,775
From the audience to agree with your point

999
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:22,079
You can hear people muttering

1000
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,615
There was no lektor

1001
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:27,199
He's doing the what is presumably an act out

1002
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:29,503
Of this this liberal who wants

1003
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,039
More people to die in the shooting

1004
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:32,575
Control

1005
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:34,111
Alright man just

1006
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:34,879
Grimm

1007
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:39,999
Well you heard somebody like whisper that's what they want this is a call and response

1008
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,023
Pastor

1009
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:43,327
This is not a

1010
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,887
Santa Baby

1011
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,935
If I were in this position

1012
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:48,959
On stage

1013
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:50,751
I might bail

1014
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:53,311
I would have so that means I might get Hosta

1015
00:50:54,847 --> 00:51:00,479
Irene weave weave weave spoken at length about one of our favorite places to perform,

1016
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:04,063
TV

1017
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,367
Centerburg Windsor Garland

1018
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:12,767
And there was a I will call him Infamous Man Who Would host the shows and he

1019
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:15,583
Open by bringing out the worst headlines

1020
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,351
You can think of

1021
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,375
Hey just go like

1022
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:21,215
Three people died on the street because it was too hot yet

1023
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:21,983
Yesterday

1024
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:24,287
But they wish they had an egg

1025
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:26,591
And no one would laugh and it be like

1026
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,127
Yeah that's what you deserve

1027
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,663
That's this is horrific

1028
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:30,687
That is what I heard

1029
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:34,015
And what I realize now is that he was just in the wrong place

1030
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,575
Superman

1031
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:38,623
Had gone to wherever Owens going

1032
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,159
He would be on Infowars

1033
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:42,975
You might you might have a show

1034
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:46,815
Yeah Google look up obviously is a tragic thing

1035
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,863
Need to see but my experience with scars

1036
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:49,631
Stripes was

1037
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:50,655
Is a hostile place

1038
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,447
Not always

1039
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,727
The best time

1040
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:56,799
But there was a very rarely a lack of reaction

1041
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:02,175
Whenever most people were performing

1042
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,455
Silence

1043
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:07,039
When you're doing a l o yeah it's

1044
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:09,599
8-bit that's terrifying

1045
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,135
Is a performer

1046
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:13,183
Did you win committing to like

1047
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:16,255
Bad character that you're getting nothing

1048
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:18,559
Not good not good

1049
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,887
It's the silence that's worse than

1050
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:27,007
The yells at least I can work with it

1051
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:33,407
Are you watching TV right now with silence is what you've got to retreat to that like making Apple ID

1052
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:36,991
Medical point to get Applause room and bring things back into a lake

1053
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,271
Alright I'm actually

1054
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:41,855
Here eliciting a response from these people okay we can

1055
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,135
Maybe try again

1056
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,671
Yeah

1057
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,719
He stays on the

1058
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,255
The shooting

1059
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,559
Subject a little bit about Uvalde

1060
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:55,679
And how's the market police didn't respond if I was writing the setlist

1061
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:56,959
Might change it

1062
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:57,983
Thanks

1063
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,543
I have to tell you

1064
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:02,847
Right here

1065
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,895
Stephanie ruhle

1066
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,175
Do you know about Stephanie

1067
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:08,479
Probably not

1068
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,831
N400

1069
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,391
Prepared

1070
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,695
What's the argument

1071
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,231
Kindergarten teacher

1072
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:39,199
Virtue signaling to Gunn sheet with like Army

1073
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,479
The teachers but like

1074
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:47,903
I guess if you're in that space and you really believe that arming teachers is the solution of

1075
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:49,439
All of them

1076
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:55,839
Disarm everybody everybody with a gun in their hands because you know it's going to take five minutes for the police to show

1077
00:53:56,095 --> 00:54:00,191
Show up even in under perfect circumstances

1078
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:03,007
Fine whatever I get that that's your beliefs is right

1079
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:03,775
But

1080
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:04,799
I think

1081
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:08,639
Just looking at it through clear and sober eyes

1082
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:12,735
400 police not responding right

1083
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:16,063
The teacher being on arms is not the problem

1084
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,599
Right

1085
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:19,135
Write this is much bigger

1086
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:21,183
Problem that is a 440

1087
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,207
No idea

1088
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:25,279
The teacher is the teacher had just been better

1089
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:26,815
Is what he say

1090
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:30,399
Well if the teacher had had access to guns to be better

1091
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:33,983
Sure honestly then you have to ask yourself why didn't

1092
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:38,847
The teacher take upon themselves just be armed and basically saying that

1093
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:44,479
If your students die it's your fault as the teacher and the inactivity of the police is not

1094
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:47,295
An indication of a systemic problem

1095
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,111
Right there over there working

1096
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:51,647
But

1097
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:54,207
Yeah I don't know I get

1098
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:55,999
But it's

1099
00:54:56,255 --> 00:55:00,351
It's it's not that it's not thawed out in the way these other b r

1100
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,375
It's just

1101
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,399
The fanservice

1102
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:04,959
I mean it's cuz I think he thinks there's

1103
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:07,519
The turn he thinks that Saturn is

1104
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,055
You say 400 police off

1105
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:11,615
Officers and then you put it on the the single teacher

1106
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,639
Do you know that's the turn

1107
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:13,919
I guess yeah

1108
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:14,687
And it's

1109
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:20,063
It doesn't actually make sense it's it's more structured like a Norm Macdonald joke where the premise

1110
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,111
And the punchline are the same

1111
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,391
Sentence you know

1112
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,927
But it's not funny

1113
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:26,463
Because it doesn't make any sense

1114
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:30,815
So I will get to talk in a little bit about abortion

1115
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,607
The top hot topics

1116
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,631
All over

1117
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,679
About abortion

1118
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,703
Protester

1119
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:45,919
And we have a crazy liberals and a good comic references his own videos

1120
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,199
Yes

1121
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,271
Material so strong

1122
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:08,959
What women are naked and they cover themselves

1123
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:12,031
Tennis courts

1124
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:17,407
Starbucks

1125
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:48,383
Don't think that's going to happen

1126
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:58,879
Used because

1127
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,415
There's not really a

1128
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:03,999
Joke other than calling to mind what

1129
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,047
He now he wants to characterize

1130
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,583
Abortion protester

1131
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:11,167
And then the statement that he's making is I think their tactics

1132
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,191
Are ineffective

1133
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:18,847
There's no joke what he needed to do at the end there is like what

1134
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,639
They should do is

1135
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,687
Or something

1136
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:26,527
Funny idea of what they should do to protest

1137
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,575
That would get a message across

1138
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,111
Or something or

1139
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:32,159
Hi Tana parody of

1140
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,695
I don't know

1141
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:37,535
Whatever

1142
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,839
After complaining

1143
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,119
About these

1144
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,143
Being ineffective

1145
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,679
The audience

1146
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:50,079
So kind of expecting a

1147
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:53,919
This for hundreds of years how jokes work is if you establish

1148
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:55,199
In the context of being a

1149
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:57,503
Comedians that you have to follow it up with a punchline

1150
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:00,319
Yeah of some sort other than like I think that's dumb

1151
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:03,391
What I what I didn't realize really until just

1152
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,671
Now is like

1153
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:07,487
People who watch stand-up a don't do it

1154
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:09,023
Right when they

1155
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:09,791
They don't

1156
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,327
Realize that the biggest liar

1157
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,375
Comedian says is I don't understand

1158
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:15,679
Like if you are writing a joke

1159
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,983
When you say I don't understand

1160
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,031
Because at the end of the joke

1161
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:22,079
You will have made a point

1162
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:28,735
Because secretly you always understood the whole time understand in order to watch

1163
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:34,623
Play a dumb person

1164
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,415
Play the movie you don't like that

1165
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:37,951
I think

1166
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,743
Obviously

1167
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:44,607
Obviously a man but he doesn't actually understand what he's talking about so he's like

1168
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,631
I'm killing it

1169
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,959
I think then just

1170
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,495
This is dumb

1171
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:52,287
Like I think that stripe

1172
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,335
And if you're expecting

1173
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:58,687
To carry you on stage you are sorely mistaken

1174
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:03,295
It works for Alex though we saw that

1175
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:09,695
About a long time might work now

1176
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,719
Deliworks

1177
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,743
Brought that brutal

1178
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:14,559
So we get to International affairs

1179
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:18,143
Terrible it is

1180
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:23,263
Terrible

1181
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:41,695
Petlab

1182
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:06,271
Stationary osisoft

1183
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,719
What time is it

1184
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,407
It's okay

1185
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,735
Anything that they do it

1186
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,343
Phoebus Athena stuff wow

1187
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,135
Soldier Boy

1188
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:49,279
No laughter they're supposed to work on things

1189
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:51,839
And the comparison between the two of them immediately striking

1190
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:52,863
By position

1191
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:56,447
Contrast with each other you reveal how similar things are treated differently

1192
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:00,543
For instance you can look at historical sentencing Trends between crack

1193
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,311
And cocaine

1194
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,079
Orson

1195
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:06,431
Between white and black people who commit similar crimes and by doing so

1196
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:08,479
You reveal a hidden truth about Society

1197
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:14,367
Right that's kind of what I want thinks he's doing here by saying that went to close up

1198
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:16,415
Does it it's good

1199
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,207
But the problem with this

1200
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:20,255
Is that these Arden Allegan situation

1201
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:23,583
What own is referring to as the Keystone XL pipeline

1202
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:25,631
This is a private company

1203
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:30,495
TC energy that had applied for a permit to build this Pipeline and were rejected by Obama

1204
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:31,775
In 2015

1205
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:36,383
If you prove it and then Biden withdrew the permit

1206
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,407
That's when he became president

1207
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:44,319
Boil from Canada will still make its way to refineries in the US but it won't be done

1208
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,879
With its pipeline that endanger surrounding areas

1209
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,927
Allegiant all sorts of other concern

1210
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:50,719
As for Putin

1211
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:57,119
He's threatening to literally cut off oil supplies two areas of Europe that rely on that oil to provide essential service

1212
01:01:57,887 --> 01:02:00,447
This is not a matter of convenience and profit

1213
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:02,495
Like with the Keystone XL

1214
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:05,823
It's a situation where someone is actually restricting access

1215
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:09,919
These situations are so completely different that Owens joke is

1216
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,455
Confusing as a statement

1217
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:13,503
And the only really at the way the distance

1218
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,271
Be construed

1219
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:17,087
Is funny is if you imagine that Owen is doing a carrot

1220
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:20,927
Who's a parody of his own ideology meant to highlight how superficial

1221
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:24,767
Their understanding of issues is and how they celebrate their own willful ignorance

1222
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,047
But it's not

1223
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,583
Owain is just dumb

1224
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,887
And his understanding of this stuff is superficial

1225
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:32,447
Any celebrates his own willful ignorance and

1226
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:34,751
Expectant audience to applaud for it

1227
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:38,079
You can really

1228
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:40,127
If you understand that subject

1229
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,151
It's being discussed

1230
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:44,735
The only conclusion you can really take away from the point of that joke is

1231
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:47,039
Is I like Putin and I don't like by

1232
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,415
Yeah I mean I know people that

1233
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,951
Think that comedians are stupid

1234
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:54,975
And for good reason

1235
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:58,559
We've earned it

1236
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,327
But what

1237
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,351
We do

1238
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:01,631
Is

1239
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:02,911
Pinkberry

1240
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:03,935
Very hard

1241
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,239
About what we're going to say on stage

1242
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:10,079
Regardless of how old your intelligence is beyond that

1243
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:12,383
So people who you might think are like

1244
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:14,687
Enable to do long division

1245
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:17,503
Are still capable of coming up with intense insights

1246
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:18,783
Through this medium

1247
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:21,855
Kissing on something very very well

1248
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:23,903
An understanding it totality

1249
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:26,463
Its totality trial

1250
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:31,839
Such a large part of being able to deliver.

1251
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:34,655
Basically what you're seeing here is somebody who's not respecting

1252
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:36,959
The idea of doing stand-up

1253
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:38,239
Have like

1254
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:39,519
A joke like this

1255
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:42,079
If you were if you thought it made sense

1256
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,871
Did you went out to open mics

1257
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,151
Tried it a few times

1258
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,431
You didn't get a response

1259
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:48,479
You might start questioning like

1260
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:51,039
Why is does it not make sense

1261
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:53,343
Is there something I'm missing about this

1262
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:57,183
I might just order instinctually you try to figure a way to readjust

1263
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:59,487
The things that you're saying to your at

1264
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,255
How to tell the

1265
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:03,327
The point that you think you're trying to make it a different way

1266
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:05,119
To elicit a response from the audience

1267
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:05,887
Because they would land on

1268
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,423
I understand what you're saying

1269
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:08,447
I mean just

1270
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,239
Beyond

1271
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:12,031
The more elevated ways of

1272
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:13,311
Looking at how

1273
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:14,335
What comedians write jokes

1274
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:15,359
Here's a simple

1275
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:16,383
If

1276
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,663
You think you have too many words

1277
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:19,967
You have three times as many words as you should

1278
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:22,783
I mean he needs to get rid of

1279
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:23,551
90%

1280
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:26,111
It's much like with the documentary

1281
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:28,415
Trinidad

1282
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:31,231
So I hear about this bribery

1283
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:37,631
I forgot that

1284
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,423
You didn't

1285
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:41,727
Anything that they do need a driver ASAP

1286
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:49,663
Going one

1287
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:03,487
Storytime show going on

1288
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,583
Daddy

1289
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:13,727
Anyway

1290
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:18,847
Call back to the earlier joke about Saudi Arabia buying golf

1291
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:21,151
Right which I admire him trying

1292
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:26,527
It didn't really land as well as I think he wanted it to least attempt a call back which is

1293
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:27,551
Second

1294
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:30,367
Belts who is yellow belt level

1295
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,207
Flawed premise

1296
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:36,255
In this joke

1297
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:39,583
You contradicting his entire worldview that is

1298
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:43,423
Going to be Pride parades is an attempt to make kids gay

1299
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:46,239
That is their whole grooming thing ideas

1300
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:51,359
So you're negating everything that you say not on sale

1301
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:54,431
Yes in order to I guess

1302
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:56,223
Call people at Pride parades

1303
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:58,271
Clowns expose is that

1304
01:05:58,527 --> 01:05:59,551
The joke is the joke

1305
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:00,319
About

1306
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,599
How's the people at

1307
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:03,135
The pride parade are clown

1308
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:07,999
Spoiled there's one point in that is the you couldn't get away with the stuff that they get away with

1309
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:13,887
Which is just the victimhood and persecution complex expressions

1310
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,423
What get away with what she

1311
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:18,751
That's the way into the Joker

1312
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:25,151
I see that and then yes it's not a sex thing there clowns you'll be afraid of clowns

1313
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,431
Like clowns

1314
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:28,223
And then

1315
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:29,759
Guy at baseball

1316
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:33,599
To gay I mean really that's you're going to say that you're

1317
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,135
You've thought about this

1318
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,159
It's your own Shroyer

1319
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:37,951
Then after you thought about it

1320
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:42,815
And set it on stage you decided to post this the internet so other people can be clear

1321
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:48,703
The only reason I'm treating this this way is because it's labeled Owen Shroyer stand up special

1322
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,727
Temperature

1323
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:50,495
England

1324
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,775
These are bits

1325
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:53,567
Yep this isn't something that

1326
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:55,615
He's just talkin off the Dome

1327
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:57,919
These are at there's a call back

1328
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:58,943
Back there

1329
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:02,271
Joke structure in some of these things that he saying

1330
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,295
Preparation

1331
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:09,951
And that's why I'm freaking

1332
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:11,743
Proper

1333
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:14,047
It's why I'm giving you the business

1334
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:16,351
Treating it like it's someone trying

1335
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,631
Because

1336
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:18,399
It is

1337
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:20,191
Stay out of our fuckingworld Owen

1338
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:23,263
If you want to walk in here you're going to have to learn how to write a joke

1339
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:28,127
I would like to make clear that I have given it up on a couple of

1340
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:30,431
Applications where there's like okay

1341
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:32,223
This isn't like the vibe

1342
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:38,879
This guy's not black cuz I didn't vote for Biden absolutely that's a fine joke the

1343
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:41,695
Play the fancy about Hunter buying a

1344
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:44,255
Camera to film a crack deal

1345
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:46,815
Potential right I'm not I'm not saying none of this

1346
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:51,167
Almost

1347
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:52,959
You don't like it

1348
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:55,775
You're taking a very good sport attack

1349
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:59,359
Towards the way and this is how kind of how we treat

1350
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:01,151
Young newer comedians

1351
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,687
Currently as we both

1352
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,455
Substance and up

1353
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,991
I did my best to

1354
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,783
It just encouraged anyone

1355
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,831
From ever trying to to do

1356
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,623
I focus on all the bad joke

1357
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:17,023
I really went into your face I was like this is why this is bad I have no idea where you're getting the idea that I would

1358
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:21,375
I wanted to hide from

1359
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:29,311
Open strong Gallo strong

1360
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:33,919
You can get away with a good deal of this Meandering nonsense in the middle if you come in with like

1361
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:39,807
Just burning the house down with you and then a closer if you're closer is 10 minutes

1362
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:41,343
And it's really good

1363
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,879
You can do a bad

1364
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:44,415
20 in the middle and you'll be fine

1365
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:46,719
I guess week I would say that is open

1366
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:50,559
Was weak cuz it was mostly that Biden cancer chunk

1367
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:54,143
Yeah and I don't think that really played

1368
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:56,191
Sounds

1369
01:08:58,495 --> 01:08:59,007
Consonant

1370
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,543
That's what it's all about

1371
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:16,671
Calvin and Hobbes map

1372
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:24,351
Right that's not a

1373
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,519
We don't hold false idol.

1374
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:51,487
If that was on

1375
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:54,303
It all my God that's the funniest thing he's ever said

1376
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:59,935
Response from the audience of any of the things

1377
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:00,703
Is any of his

1378
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:03,263
Yeah no the problem is he meant it

1379
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:08,895
That's why it's terrible sort of expression

1380
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:10,943
It's like a someone saying

1381
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,223
Look at the end of their set like

1382
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:16,575
Let me be serious for a minute here except

1383
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:19,903
Is a joke after serious

1384
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,183
Again

1385
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:22,207
Incidentally

1386
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:25,791
The funniest thing that he's ever said I can't imagine a fun of your things

1387
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:27,071
Then like

1388
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:29,375
If aliens come down

1389
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,655
To Earth

1390
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:31,935
Anne askew

1391
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:38,335
To take you to their leader you hand them the Bible what kind of insane world

1392
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:40,127
View is that where you're like

1393
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,151
Not only

1394
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,175
Am I not

1395
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,199
Think about that

1396
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:45,247
But all of these people are going to

1397
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:46,015
Clapping

1398
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:48,319
Scream how great I have for doing that

1399
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,343
That is a maze

1400
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:53,439
This is this is Owens closer to and what is that

1401
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:59,839
Accepted expression of virtue signalling to Christianity

1402
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:06,239
Signal to aliens there is nothing

1403
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,007
You should have done to take

1404
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,567
To your dealer

1405
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:11,103
There's nothing

1406
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:14,175
About this baby is an attempt to being funny

1407
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:18,783
Is just demonstrating your virtue to an audience and them applauding

1408
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:19,551
In for it

1409
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,599
This is exactly what

1410
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,647
He has gone on ran

1411
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:25,695
People on Infowars

1412
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:28,255
Peterson's of the world all talk about this being

1413
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:32,351
The cancer of the left and how they approach being funny

1414
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,887
Healing humor

1415
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:36,703
Bulshit

1416
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,495
Version of all the exact same thing

1417
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:40,799
Yeah I mean this is really really tragic

1418
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:42,079
How's the traffic

1419
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:44,639
Really bad I mean the problem is

1420
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:45,919
The problem is

1421
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,455
This is a man

1422
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:49,503
Who is posting that video

1423
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:50,783
Well someone

1424
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:56,415
Well I guess he allowed it I mean I assume if I had if I had that on my wrecker

1425
01:11:56,927 --> 01:12:00,767
Every gone I would be telling that I would I would

1426
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:02,303
The producers of the show

1427
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:06,399
I have talked to producers of the show The Past who recorded it and I told them

1428
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:07,935
Don't play this

1429
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:10,751
Because I am embarrassed of how bad it

1430
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:13,311
Listen to me in the past sure

1431
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:16,127
Yeah

1432
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:18,175
I think that a woman should have

1433
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:19,199
Vicodin

1434
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:21,247
Click click

1435
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,063
No

1436
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:28,159
I thought we could use a little bit of a momentary breath

1437
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:30,463
Of something different than

1438
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:33,279
The trial in the documentaries that Delight

1439
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,047
Shop

1440
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:40,191
I don't think it owns getting JFL

1441
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:43,775
I agree but I agree I don't want to sleep think

1442
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:44,543
Bass

1443
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:45,567
Just on

1444
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:46,847
Talent

1445
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:47,871
And Merritt

1446
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:49,407
That wouldn't even

1447
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:51,967
Fly at a bad local show

1448
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:52,991
In Chicago

1449
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:57,343
Struggle to get a response at an open

1450
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:00,415
Recognize

1451
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:02,975
Is the hubris of doing 18 minutes

1452
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:04,255
1808

1453
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:05,535
18 minutes

1454
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:11,935
18 minutes and Dan how many how many producers stories do both of us have along the

1455
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:12,959
The lines of somebody's like

1456
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:20,383
I've got forty minutes of material of really want to go up on you show it is my first time doing stand-up comedy but

1457
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,663
I know it's going to be great

1458
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,455
This is that

1459
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,735
Yeah this is that

1460
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:29,343
It's bad hubris to not recognizing

1461
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,647
Is something like box

1462
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:33,695
Jackson has much as like it

1463
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:37,023
Seems like a shorter time than it actually is

1464
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:39,583
Like a 3-minute round in a lifetime

1465
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:42,911
In the boxing ring is

1466
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:43,935
Tough to fill

1467
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:45,983
If you care about it being

1468
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:48,287
Good entertaining for the people you're talking to
