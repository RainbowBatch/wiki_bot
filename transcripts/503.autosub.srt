20
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,928
Some interesting vinegars

21
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,000

00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,080
Why not

26
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,360
I didn't realize there was

27
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,384
Such a

28
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,664

30
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,480
Of weird vinegar products

31
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,528
I thought it was just

32
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,368
Yeah that makes

33
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,928
Vinegar is it like ketchup

34
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,208
It's not just like a thing

35
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:09,024
No but there are also a bunch of different ketchup

36
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,816

37
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,096

00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,120
Not really

39
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,144

It is

60
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448

Nicely done

68
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,904
Probably a hockey joke

69
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,696
No it's pronounced

70
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,512
Play whatever people say it's

71
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,352
Like a lot of grocery stores they have the things you can put the

72
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:54,752
Peanut sitting grinded up

73
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,848
Grocery store because I don't have a Peanut Farm not because I want to talk to my boy 2

74
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:05,248
I don't want to Moonlight as a Peanut Farm

75
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,368
I'm glad you're enjoying that peanut butter

76
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,160
So Jordan today

Bonjour website knowledge

118
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,167
That we would love it

119
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,471
What you could do is you could

120
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
Superknife

121
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,263
Into a big old

122
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,871
Jar of generosity

123
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,943
Crunchy jizz creamy generosity

124
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,503
Spread it all over the bagel of a local

125
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,039
Call Charity or bail Fund in your air

126
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,855
On top of a really weird vinegar

127
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,695
So Jordan to out-of-context drops

128
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
Today Show

129
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,535
So we'll do one little bit

130
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,863
Because I'm a Christian

131
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,655
Cannot kill you

132
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,935
Just because you're stupid

133
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,215
They're enough

134
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,007
Feeling good

135
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:13,407
Galaxy

136
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
People were killed because they were stupid and

137
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,223
And it's a lot but I don't know if it's

138
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,247
Post-crisis

139
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,551
I don't know if it was specifically only be

140
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,343
Because they were stupid

141
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:27,999
George when we last left off on our our previous episode Shroyer in his merry band of

142
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:31,583
Impersonators and hippies4trump we're about to roll into Atlanta Georgia

143
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,631
That was Wednesday the 11th

144
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:39,519
I was just wrapped up his show where Steve pieczenik came in to claim that whether or not you believe the 20th

145
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,567
20 election was a massive sting operation

146
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,591
Planned in advance

147
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,431
It's a small detail what you believe that or not

148
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:51,551
What is important is the Trump is going to win and then apparently he's going to get a third term because these dudes love

149
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,319
America

150
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:56,671
One thing is crucially important to understand as we continue exploring this Caravan

151
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,207
And is that a certain point

152
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,511
It stopped being an Infowars Caravan

153
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,327
And it starts being Infowars With Envy larger space

154
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,911
I'm comfortable judging Owen and Infowars for their crowds

155
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,959
In places like Tallahassee in Baton Rouge

156
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,287
Because those are specifically Infowars Caravan events

157
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,823
At least appear to be

158
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,127
Once they reach Washington DC

159
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,663
They are now becoming part of something

160
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,431
Open larger

161
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,247
Which is the combined work of a network of loosely affiliated

162
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:27,903
Plan for the weekend has been for everyone to show up in d.c. informed be million Maga March

163
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
Iconography

164
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,719
Did spare

165
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:36,095
This effort combines the Infowars Caravan with a lie Alexander stop the steel campaign

166
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:41,727
As well as Brandon straka walkaway nonsense and whatever the f*** Mike cernovich is doing these days

167
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,031
Beyond that it's attracted the legions

168
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,567
Both Keepers proud boys

169
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:49,151
And members of many right-wing gangs who are less interested in talking

170
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:49,919
The spotlight

171
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:56,831
According to an article from Friday and USA Today the only group that had a permit for the event is a group called women

172
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,855
America first

173
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
Amy Kremer

174
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,487
Care for Women for America first

175
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,071
Not coordinating with any of the other groups planning simultaneous events

176
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:14,239
This is really interesting because according to a recent article in Mother Jones women for America first run one of the main websites for stop this

177
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,055
Steel www. Stolen election.

178
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:17,823
What US

179
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,871
Donations that people made on these

180
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,431
Bastille through that website

181
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,223
End up going to women for America first

182
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:28,063
Stand the sight was used to promote Rally's branded as. The steel

183
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:33,951
Great Apocalypse these people are coordinating

184
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,231
But that's not even

185
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,279
An argument it's really worth having I think

186
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:43,679
The point is that the end result of these rallies will be the combined efforts of a whole Cadre of weirdos

187
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,495
And it's so even if we get to the end of this

188
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,263
And there is

189
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
Big turnout in d.c.

190
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,591
We'll keep our eyes on the ball

191
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,407
And remember that had nothing to do with this stupid road trip

192
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,431
Not at all

193
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,199
None at all

194
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,015
It's because I've again

195
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,599
Evil Steve Bannon

196
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,159
Furious into the other

197
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,463
More or less

198
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,583
We've never lived in more historical times

199
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,375
This is one of the most historical

200
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,191
Jesus Christ

201
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:19,775
Okay

202
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:28,223
Let's see if we can name under his other historical figures who

203
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,759
Jesus

204
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:39,743
1776 with no big deal

205
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,583
Smallville call trailer

206
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
But it look

207
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,471
Exactly like

208
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,823
Hundreds of thousands of Mongols riding horseback with their

209
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,383
Amazing that s*** was nothing

210
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
Fair enough

211
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,223
11th November

212
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,503
Arrive

213
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
And Atlanta

214
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:10,207
Atlanta Georgia

215
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,279
Play right now

216
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:19,679
Building

217
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,775
Stop the steel Caravan

218
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,847
There was no reason for me to pull this clip nothing happens in it

219
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,127
I only decided to

220
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
To start with this

221
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:32,223
Because the opening of the video in Atlanta is so real

222
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:37,599
You have Owen Shroyer poking his little head out of the sunroof of the Infowars tank with a handheld mic

223
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:41,439
Talking about how they're heading to the Capitol while driving down an empty Street

224
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,231
There's no reason for them

225
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,559
Tuesday's presentation all it does is make me audio terrible

226
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:51,935
Even if I went as a windscreen on his Mikey still using a regular microphone to hang out of a moving vehicle

227
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:57,055
Just very bizarre is really easy to understand what he was saying.

228
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,615
This videos real bad

229
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,407
Not a pop out of their tablet

230
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:10,623
Stop the hill Caravan and right now it is very successful it looks like we may

231
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,743
There's one thing that's

232
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:19,327
Suspicious and its absence from the shot of Owen hang out the top of the tank

233
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,887
And that's any indication that there are any cars

234
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,655
Behind him

235
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:28,799
You would think that if the Caravan is that successful as I want his claiming they pan around to show the giant Convoy but no

236
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,847
Just Owen talking to no one

237
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,383
I'm driving down an empty Street

238
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,783
Great metaphor you know that I'm Mister Caravan fan Mister Carol saying if you will but I found it incredibly chal

239
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,575
Challenging to jump back into this stuff

240
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,855
Entirely because I

241
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,159
Who are the produce this Infowars video is

242
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:50,559
I want doesn't arrive at the Atlanta rally until eight minutes into the video and the entire time up to that point is just hit with

243
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,607
What is head out the sunroof repeatedly saying

244
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:56,959
Atlanta wherein you make sounds it sounds more like

245
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,983
That like

246
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,055
After the end of a week at Camp they always have the

247
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:05,407
The slideshow with of the there's always a clip of somebody being like

248
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:09,503
That's why we love camping when they're swelling music around it everybody's like

249
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,551
That's great but it was just him

250
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
Silent

251
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,367
The Emptiness you feel like this is a bad guy

252
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,695
If I went to that camp

253
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:23,071
I probably I probably be into a well-made version of memories from cats

254
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:23,839
Sure

255
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,399
I still wouldn't be into it if it was poorly made

256
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:31,263
And that's how I feel about this like even if I were into Infowars and I thought

257
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:38,175
I've got to do better than that minutes ago and saying nothing

258
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,199
Sucks

259
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:44,319
Toys R Us version of Mission Impossible I don't understand

260
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,367
Keep it for time or anyting

261
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:50,975
There's no reason for this to be in there it's so distracting

262
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:56,095
I think it's just hubris they just think any idea is the best idea at the time

263
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,375
Their attention span

264
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,191
Well I would argue that it's more likely that they think

265
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:06,591
There's something badass about him driving around out the sunroof

266
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,383
Kind of looks

267
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
Just like

268
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
I mean it looks

269
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,199
What's fun

270
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,551
The wind in your hair MythBusters one-time is great

271
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,831
Sure

272
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,367
I don't know it it was

273
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
Made this

274
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,207
On his way

275
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,559
Whether or not he's back or not leaving out the roof of this year

276
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
Your tank

277
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
He does

278
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,911
End up at a stoplight

279
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,775
There's a guy at the stoplight

280
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,799
Up and like

281
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,103
Immediately deflating

282
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,639
About a tank at a stoplight

283
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,479
It's pretty sad

284
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,527
Ifucking tank

285
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:52,927
Leading a convoy traffic laws

286
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,463
And a little bit of

287
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:58,559
Does Doolittle card work with a guy who's standing waiting to cross the street

288
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:02,911
I know that's our plan and that's why I rented landed here today how are you doing sir

289
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,215
Me too

290
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:09,823
Me to Atlanta

291
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,919
We are here

292
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:19,807
Stop The Shield Caravan has arrived

293
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:26,463
How far Auto Repair

294
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,023
They are out of gas

295
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,119
There is no enthusiasm left in this f****** thing at all

296
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:39,007
I'm trying really hard to stay excited about this and they're not doing it

297
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:43,103
They realized a couple of days and it was a terrible idea

298
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:49,503
We went to bed Andrews we drove 7 hours and they were 10 people there what are we doing

299
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,039
Starbucks

300
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,623
Oh man this is what you want to be on the

301
00:15:54,879 --> 00:16:00,511
Rb21 be getting the conversations and bird's eye view just right there beautiful

302
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,143
He's funny and so he tries

303
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:06,911
What's to do

304
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,679
And this is this

305
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:14,335
I mean I guess this is exactly how comedians do it you know you polish things up at open mics before you tried on a real house

306
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,383
The open-mic is

307
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,711
Sticking his head out the top of a car while no one's list

308
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,551
I think the Democrats are actually still voting guide

309
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,391
Democrats still voting in Georgia or have they stopped yet

310
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,415
Duino

311
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,207
I think they're still voting

312
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,743
Is not a head yet

313
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,583
There's no one there wow he's just talking to nobody

314
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,655
Now hold on now I want s'more schalke

315
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:44,031
Well maybe your maybe your mood will change okay

316
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,359
What's you hear the crowd with it within the background

317
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,895
Try this on an actual Act

318
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,223
I think the Democrats are still voting guys

319
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,039
I think the Democrats are voting

320
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,087
Georgia

321
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,159
What does Joe Biden hasn't been put in the lead

322
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,719
Georgia

323
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,559
But I don't think it's going to work

324
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,655
Good stuff but I don't think it's going to work

325
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:17,055
Alright that sounds too much shade at the turnout of the

326
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:17,823
Lancer rally

327
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,967
It's still south of 200 people but that's really good printer Wars event is taking place during the day

328
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:30,623
So far their daytime rallies have been very very sad at least looks like you might call a group

329
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,647
People

330
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,695
There were some strange signs in the crowd

331
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,719
Why was this a big

332
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,535
You with a where we go one we go all slogan

333
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:44,191
Another was quote Trump's coup d'etat is already underway with kind of applies the Trump is leading and overthrow the government

334
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,727
Really don't think they get how that

335
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,519
That sound that seems to either be

336
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:52,895
Counter-protester or the opposite of where the messaging is supposed to be I don't know what's going on

337
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,967
Overall I would give this a final rally

338
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,735
A solid

339
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:02,623
Decent turnout when we grade on a curve but full of suspect weirdos and nothing really enter

340
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
Nothing at all

341
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,975
It kind of feels like this was an event that might have been planned already and OMG

342
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,743
Just crashed it

343
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,047
Since there's definitely some people there who seem to be

344
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,583
Confused by his arrival

345
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,887
The video on Infowars is titled quote

346
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,727
Democrats and operatives to start violence at rally in Atlanta which

347
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,519
I don't see in the video itself

348
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,847
And even if there were violence in the video their claim that they were

349
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,383
Operative sent in by anyone

350
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,919
Completely manufactured

351
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,711
And not substantiated in anyway

352
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:33,343
I think the title is in reference to a young woman who drives by and yells the Trump isn't President anymore

353
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,647
The closest I could see the scary stuff

354
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:42,047
Yeah I just certain point another guy with a bullhorn threatens Owens dominance with a we don't want pedo zhuocheng at

355
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,327
Badal results

356
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,655
I would hate to see in fighting at the

357
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,311
I imagine their Democratic operatives if that's that's got to be somebody in the movie who's like

358
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:57,663
Their green is our first operation in the field you know they've been on the death

359
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,967
Few years

360
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:06,367
Somebody else got injured so now it's their chance to shine and they like we're sending you to a rally with 200 people

361
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,647
To cause problems

362
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:14,303
Oh no going to go send you to agent provocateur

363
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,375
Out-of-control terrorism or something

364
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
Next time

365
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:18,911
Alright

366
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:22,751
Video from just another Channel also doesn't really show any violence

367
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:26,847
There's a little bit of yelling between a few people at one point but it's unclear where the context is

368
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,431
And then there's a long segment where the video maker and his friend Tom

369
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
Who's that

370
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:35,807
Friend Tom to I complain about how someone is flipping them off from a nearby window

371
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,343
It's pretty sad

372
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,623
Wrong with these people

373
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:39,903
It's very

374
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:47,071
Adele just like making heart shapes with their hand

375
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:53,727
The Atlanta rally was at 3 p.m. and unlike past stops this one included

376
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,751
An actual March

377
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,823
I have no idea where they were going or why they were parading but

378
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,103
It seems like a new development

379
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,919
Compared to previous cities

380
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,711
From there

381
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:08,063
Because he had to arrive in Columbia South Carolina for an 8 p.m. rally

382
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:14,463
Infowars only posted a 1-minute video about South Carolina but she's weird

383
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:20,863
Because from they just another Channel footage it seems like that would be the most useful for them optically sure it was nighttime

384
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,887
That was pretty good

385
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,935
There were some college students yelling at the

386
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:29,311
Creating the sort of tension and victimhood they desire in their optic operatives

387
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:35,967
Go to college spend 40 to $60,000 and then they're undercover enough

388
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,015
70

389
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:41,599
In the video on Infowars we get a shot of the Caravan itself

390
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:45,695
It's really hard to tell how many of these cars are actually along with them

391
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,975
Or if it's just breath

392
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:51,327
Assuming that all these cars are part of the Convoy it's like maybe 4:50

393
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,095
15 cars

394
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:57,727
There's nothing to sneeze at if you're a ninja or something but it's really sad for Dave free when you're Infowars

395
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,079
Turnout was alright

396
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,383
In Columbia South Carolina

397
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,687
Easy to overestimate because it was nighttime

398
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,015
They ended up taking a big group picture in front of the Capitol building

399
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,343
And I think it's about 150 people properly

400
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,111
Sure that's nice

401
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,184
The in the evening of the 11th

402
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,232
Things took a turn for the ugly

403
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,048
As the Infowars Caravan came under attack

404
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,352
According to a video posted on parlor

405
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,144
We're throwing milkshakes

406
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,912
Convoy

407
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,448
And here is the report

408
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:35,616
I still think we're like 20 cars strong 31st

409
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:42,016
Five cars back behind the info

410
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:48,416
Ford's right wagon

411
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:54,816
Throw something at the nasty milkshake or something

412
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:07,616
Heard through something so I'm getting attacked because other people

413
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:14,016
Caravan driving well

414
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:20,416
And traveling back and forth across this country that I've never had a trucker throne

415
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:26,816
So that's definitely a new one

416
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:33,216
We're on our way to DC have to get a car wash

417
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:39,616
Several of our guys up here ahead of us

418
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:46,016
Driving this Caravan stuff is pretty crazy because

419
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:52,416
Slowing and speeding up and slowing and speeding up

420
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:05,216
Hope you're all dramas

421
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,496
People were pretty quick to

422
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,056
To point out that the reason for all the things this guy is

423
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,848
Describing is because they were basically

424
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,384
Logging the interstate

425
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:19,040
20 cars in a row in the passing Lane which is it that's dumb and selfish and where

426
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:24,160
Passing Lane they were on the left side of the road as a chicagoan

427
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,976
Sets me more than what they stand for

428
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:33,888
When you do a convoy like this there's no reason that the car is all need to actually travel down the highway on a line

429
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,960
But that's what they seemed insistent on doing what

430
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,288
Courseplus at night for no reason

431
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:46,176
This was the leg between Columbia South Carolina and Raleigh North Carolina which is about three and a half hours drive

432
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:46,944
Elmendorf

433
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
Carolina rally was

434
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,272
Is at 3 p.m. on Thursday

435
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:54,112
There's no reason tonight drive that one in a convoy 20 cars deep

436
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,904
That's just a****** Behavior

437
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,696
Luckily

438
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,000
Everyone survived

439
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,560
Car Wash you're a rugged individualist you have to

440
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:08,960
To find a f****** Hozier you don't get to use all of his Creature Comforts if you're trying to sell yourself as the

441
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,776
Revolutionary that you are I would like

442
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:17,152
To wash it another f****** flashlight

443
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:17,920
To shift

444
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,200
Your criticism

445
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,040
I don't care whether they use car washes or not

446
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,320
I would like to say

447
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:28,416
You don't get to complain about someone throwing the belt

448
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,464
Thoroughly agree with

449
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,000
Yeah

450
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,096
Now we jump in on the 12th

451
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,632
On Alex Jones

452
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:41,216
Ashoka might have had full coverage of the Caravan

453
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:47,872
And it'll be a mystery lost to time much like who built the pyramids was at the aliens

454
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,432
Iliad

455
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,224
Non-white

456
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,624
People can also build things turned out what is the equivalent of David Knight covered like ancient mystery

457
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,208
Yeah that's possible

458
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,256
If you wanted to hide

459
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,280
True information

460
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,840
Can you give it to David night and no one will ever know

461
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:13,984
Yeah and if you want to have a really fun interesting fake information give it to him and the s*** out of me

462
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,264
Does normally would happen

463
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,312
Here is Alec

464
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,104
Attempting to make some analogies

465
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,920
And I apologize in advance for the audio quality on the

466
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,736
Alex Wireless

467
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,040
California

468
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,320
Vote for Biden

469
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,856
Wednesday

470
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,256
What

471
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,072
Stop

472
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,424
I thought it was

473
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,776
35%

474
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,640
Donald Trump

475
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:56,480
Oh Peter so that coming up

476
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,296
Why would they treat California

477
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,368
It's like saying

478
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
You're a Cheney

479
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,440
Remarried

480
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,232
Your new wife pregnant

481
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:11,840
4

482
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,800
What

483
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:22,848
Yes please

484
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,152
Okay

485
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,176
Correct

486
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,536
We can defeat the bubble cuz there

487
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,376
Sports Authority

488
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,288
I do I do

489
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:57,664
So I listen to Alex a bunch so I can help you out here cuz that was a garbled mess

490
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:58,944
I got the point

491
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,344
Really well let's see if you did trying to make as the truck basically one almost

492
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,392
Every state but there was fraud all over the

493
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:12,256
There was even massive voter fraud in California which people he talks to

494
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,280
Can't understand

495
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,328
They don't understand why the globalist

496
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,912
Steal votes in California when California consistently votes Democrat

497
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,800
How does explanation is a California doesn't actually consistently vote Democrat in the appearance that they do

498
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:29,664
He's only there because the voting fraud that's already and always going on there

499
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,944
They were stealing quotes

500
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,552
Open California because they're only in power in California due to all the vote they always feel

501
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,880
This is not that complicated of a concept that he's trying to

502
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,672
Describe and yet Alex strugglers

503
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:43,232
To come up with two really bad analogy

504
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:48,352
The first is getting married and your new wife is pregnant but you have an 18 year old child

505
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,632
From a previous marriage

506
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,424
This analogy doesn't make sense

507
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,448
It's because each Prague

508
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:56,288
Nancy would be an unrelated event where is the imaginary voting fraud probably

509
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:02,176
Homie be able to be pulled off by the people in California because the people committed all the fraud or in power and covering it up

510
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:06,528
Now they're having kids because they've already always been having kids

511
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:09,344
We'll get to that previous frog facilitate

512
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,368
It's the current fraud

513
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,648
Linda California

514
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,416
Example

515
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:18,816
LG actually work would be to imagine a scenario where the new wife allows Alex to impregnate her because she's

516
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,864
So impressed that he has an 18 year old son

517
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,936
That would make sense something about his son needs to implicate

518
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:27,776
Current situation in the existing analogy that's not the case

519
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:32,896
With the California stuff the ideas that they're stealing the election because they always do so

520
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:37,504
It's possible that another way to make this analogy work is for Alex's response to this person

521
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,904
To be that his new wife is pregnant because he only gets romantically involved with women he's gotten pregnant

522
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,696
That would make

523
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:52,096
The second Melody Alex is trying is that he's slaughtering a cowlick keeping what's left of his previous calendar.

524
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,424
Is also doesn't make sense based on what he's trying to

525
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:00,032
This would be a good analogy if you were trying to argue the Democrats kept

526
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,312
Frozen votes

527
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,592
From the last election

528
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,384
To use on this one because they want

529
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,688
One by such a wide margin last time

530
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:10,016
So they have leftovers or something like that

531
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:13,344
I mean in terms of the keeping cows in the deep freezer

532
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,416
That's that's how that might work I would put the votes

533
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,440
In a plastic bag

534
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,464
Tornado game

535
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,144
M these analogies help clarify his point but Alex insist this is somehow third-dimensional thinking whatever the f*** that

536
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:31,264
Really the only thing that these two analogies have in common is a sense of time

537
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,336
That's whoever Alex is talking to seems unaware of

538
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:40,736
The previous marriage analogy involves a person who doesn't realize you could have had a child with someone else in the past

539
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:47,136
DeKalb butchering example involves a person who doesn't realize that the cow in the freezer will eventually be eating in the future

540
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:54,304
The only thing I come away from this convinced of is that Alex is really bad analogies and people to talk to you on a regular basis must have a

541
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,352
Guilty with really Elementary concept

542
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,144
Maybe even object permanence

543
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,216
Tested Alex on object permanence

544
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:07,104
We could play Peek-a-boo I wouldn't I would be interested to know exactly

545
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,872
Still

546
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:10,176
Assume it's more than peekaboo

547
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,712
Okay what is it like

548
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:15,040
Anybody who's involved with the Sandy Hook trial is listen

549
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,832
On the stand

550
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,392
Cast his object

551
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,672
Here's what you do

552
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,464
On the first day

553
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,744
Hold up a sign

554
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,304
And then see if he remembers that there was a

555
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,072
The side of the road

556
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,912
Sew-ins next clip

557
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,680
Alex

558
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,728
Discusses the cycle of History

559
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,776
Interesting theories about this

560
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
Pretty simple

561
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,080
Based on his assessment

562
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,872
What happens throughout history

563
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,712
Power

564
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,736
Whether it be

565
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:47,808
Brian Chapman

566
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,464
Capitalization

567
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,560
Just suddenly there's no one left

568
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,216
Everywhere

569
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,384
Everybody dead

570
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,552
Dollface

571
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:29,280
Populator

572
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,072
Is the cycle of History

573
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,352
Wow

574
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:39,264
I wish I wish there was some way that every archaeological dig throughout history found like some sort of recording

575
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,312
Or like a

576
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,616
Tablet or something and it's all just

577
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,664
The same Alex Jones ideas

578
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:49,248
Like every civilization has been ultimately destroyed

579
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:51,552
By somebody like Alex Jones

580
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:57,952
Somebody thinks that all history is a cycle of decadent leading to the priest

581
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,744
Everyone

582
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,840
Somebody in ancient Rome just running around screaming

583
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:08,960
There was a priest types of eating people

584
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,520
I would I would I would say that

585
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:15,104
Maybe in Cruller times they had less of an influence

586
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,504
Sherpani cuz they couldn't ever so they could never get to a point where they would have a radio show

587
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,040
That's fair you know people would just

588
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:23,808
Like hell

589
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,904
I think that's the ideal solution no I don't think so

590
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,184
I do

591
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,232
Guarantee that this this sort of

592
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,280
Mentality of probably exist

593
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,840
Throughout all cultures

594
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:40,192
Paranoia

595
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,264
Sort of imaginative creative paranoia

596
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,800
Yeah I mean

597
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,592
I I suppose you could

598
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:50,432
Probably make a very good argument that every civilization ultimately

599
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,200
Collapses

600
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:54,016
When the perceived Corruption of the government

601
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,064
Equals they actual corruption

602
00:32:56,832 --> 00:33:00,416
Do you know what I'm saying I hear what you're saying I don't know how I could

603
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,184
Protest that

604
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,328
In the moment

605
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,352
Yep

606
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,632
Alright boo boo

607
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,656
Depriest

608
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,960
I understand what you're saying

609
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:16,288
It's an interesting thought but I don't know if I fully agree with

610
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,312
I don't know if it's

611
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,360
Accurate

612
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:24,736
What was well said it sounds really great sounds almost like an aphorism

613
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:29,600
Society collapses let me perceived corruption matches the actual cup

614
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:36,000
Nevermind I take back my comment because now it's

615
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:40,352
Pillow where they die

616
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,400
Probably economic

617
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:47,776
I worry about it being b******* because it sounds good so good

618
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:52,128
Speaking of things that are b*******

619
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,600
North Carolina

620
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:08,000
There's absolutely zero chance there been 400 cars in the Caravan at any point and I would be comfortable

621
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,072
Wasn't even a total of 400 cars throughout the entire thing

622
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:16,448
I would go so far as to bet that the combined turnout for the events that have happened up to this point on November 12th

623
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:20,032
Are barely more than 400 total people I would agree

624
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:20,800
This is

625
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:23,104
Same levels of hubris

626
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,872
Enough

627
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,408
People in the cars

628
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:31,296
I'm so it's not like there's four people to a car where if you guys could all afford your own individual cars

629
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,576
Derby 200 car

630
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:37,696
Offended that there probably are 10 cars

631
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,512
That is to be as shocking and scary

632
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:44,096
Probably Infowars employees

633
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,400
Another one is the guy from just another Channel

634
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,192
Another color is the hippies

635
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:48,960
For Trump

636
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,728
So like

637
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,496
They're not busy

638
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:53,568
No this is

639
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:57,920
We want to live the hippie lifestyle also support a couple a man

640
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:04,320
That is trying to actively kill it my Grandpa father The Grateful Dead around I'm following Owen Shroyer

641
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,648
That's

642
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,672
That's real bad

643
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:11,488
You know what you know where the best place to get drugs is

644
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:14,048
The parking lot

645
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:16,608
Who's my real dad mom

646
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,912
Well back in the 2020s

647
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:25,312
South Carolina

648
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:28,896
Here you are

649
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:40,416
70 year old people with Infowars Caravan tattoos where were you made

650
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:45,024
There were upwards of 50 people

651
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:49,120
If you can remember the Infowars Caravan that means you weren't there

652
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:57,056
Bastard

653
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:09,344
Anyway

654
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,464
Pidf

655
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,840
All right we got we can't we can't live in

656
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,400
Different versions of that exact same job.

657
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,008
I will say that there's one thing that I like

658
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,568
It's pretty consistent.

659
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,128
Exaggerate

660
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,664
A little bit here

661
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,224
I thought about doing this broadcast

662
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,504
426

663
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,040
Plus years you know

664
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,064
Broadcast

665
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,368
What's my last broadcast

666
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,696
I need to just let you know and explain something to you

667
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,560
I don't exaggerate any of this

668
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,632
This could be our last

669
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,424
We could be

670
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,616
RhymeZone

671
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
Set a new coffee

672
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,504
Good thing you don't exaggerate ever feel safe

673
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,112
I don't exaggerate things but if you spend one single moment and safety

674
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:17,696
Does this mean that this is the actual last

675
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,976
Broadcast that he's been

676
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,000
Teasing doing

677
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:25,888
Play after he's done if he is out already

678
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:26,656
Yeah yeah

679
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,704
I don't know what's going on

680
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,848
He's talking about this sort of like I could be his last where I guess it's obvious but like

681
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,384
I want I want him to

682
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,408
To do that

683
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:40,224
Good Mythical Last Broadcast already

684
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:46,624
How can you say I don't exaggerate things and then say This Could Be Our Last Broadcast knowing full well

685
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,392
That you've got it

686
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,672
Least several more months

687
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,440
In the

688
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,720
Do you know

689
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:56,864
Like you're bigger than assholes everybody isn't it of itself an exaggeration

690
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,960
This disorder

691
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,520
Stream this is really escalating here in this

692
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,288
Distraction

693
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:10,688
I guess maybe I was disappointed in the Caravan cuz he's talking about like you know a nuke is going to go off Trump to get his ass

694
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,456
Fascinated

695
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:14,528
Turn off the internet why not

696
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,296
Text with dresses

697
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,576
Head to the hills guys

698
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,344
It's over

699
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,672
Express

700
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,000
The Press has been on me that I

701
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,536
Howard Stern Lake Joseph

702
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,632
Last last 2 months

703
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:35,520
Maybe it's those f****** pills

704
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,616
Absolutely lashing out

705
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,408
God

706
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,688
Last Knights

707
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,272
I listen to Just the Way

708
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,088
Peopleready

709
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,232
It's all over

710
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,608
Cuz it's all just going to

711
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,144
Holyshit

712
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:06,752
The only thing that differentiates Alex from someone like Jim Jones is that Jim Jones

713
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,288
With specific

714
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,056
Yeah

715
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,336
Also not for nothing

716
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,104
Like

717
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,640
Responded to this

718
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:16,736
Being passionate doesn't result in grinding your teeth to the point they fall out of your head

719
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,040
However that's one of the most common symptoms of

720
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,064
Stimulant abuse

721
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:23,648
Between that pretty much everything about how Alex acts in the fact

722
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:27,744
The Joe Rogan tried to get Alex to talk about his problem with adderal on their last episode

723
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,792
How to make the picture come into Focus

724
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:32,864
Alex might as well be like a high-functioning cocaine

725
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,632
Yeah

726
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,656
This is

727
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,192
Take it all

728
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,728
Makes a bit more sense

729
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,544
When you imagine that I owe ya

730
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,568
He's on

731
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:42,336
Stimulants

732
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,176
That this is disappointingly simple answer

733
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:46,944
But

734
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,480
Probably the correct one

735
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:51,552
Explain

736
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:56,672
Is everything there still a whole bunch of ideas that are bad

737
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,976
And if it certainly doesn't let him off the hook

738
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,256
For his behavior

739
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,280
It does make it like

740
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,584
The weather things that don't make sense

741
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,352
Do make sense

742
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,632
When you consider like a

743
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,400
He's just

744
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,168
On drugs

745
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,824
Billions are going to die and you got to head to the Hills

746
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,104
Alex

747
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,128
Need you to know

748
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
Billions are going

749
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,432
Doesn't exaggerate

750
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,832
Just say that you will watch

751
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,856
Williams died

752
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,672
Bloodborne authorize their ears about

753
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:31,232
Cool are you going to watch

754
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,512
Absolutely

755
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,936
And we were coming into the Earth

756
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,728
Negative

757
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,848
All you can do

758
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,408
Holding back

759
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,688
Silverdale

760
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,248
But we've seen a model of the devil's attack

761
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,552
Revelation

762
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,952
He'll keep going

763
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,488
Going and going

764
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,536
It overcomes

765
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,608
Really difficult to go back to normal

766
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:14,752
After that we're living in the biblical end times

767
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,544
Stories are like oh really

768
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,312
Easy

769
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,080
Waiter

770
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,104
Walk-back

771
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,640
Where in Revelation

772
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:23,712
Doesn't include like.

773
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:24,736
Gyno

774
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,272
I got some good news for you

775
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,576
They closed the third seal

776
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:34,976
They closed the Third Wheel backup guys we've only got to deal with seals one and two let's get to work on

777
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:38,816
A lockdown to deal with all these goddamn place

778
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:42,144
We have a special on steel ceiling

779
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,960
In the

780
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:48,288
Get the f*** out of here yeah

781
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,056
Troubling

782
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,336
It's troubling because like

783
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,640
It feels like the only move after this

784
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:57,247
Is go away or become a doomsday like full-on

785
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,271
Religious preacher

786
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:02,879
I don't think it's all that stuff when Obama was elected to those the biblical end times

787
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,927
I kept that

788
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:11,583
That's true but I heard about the biblical end-times probably from Biblical end-times preacher

789
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,911
A bunch of times

790
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,935
Do something less

791
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,703
Extreme

792
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:21,567
You know like they can say we were wrong in the ER or whatever am I

793
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,591
Hey man I can be

794
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,359
Become a hot dog

795
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:29,759
These are the blood moon real last time we

796
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,551
We thought we knew was up at this time blood moon

797
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,575
You do that

798
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,111
But you can't be like

799
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:37,183
The world is going to end I know it's coming

800
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,231
And then be wrong and then be like

801
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:42,559
Who would you really need to do is focus on your Alderman race

802
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,863
Or or whatever or like it

803
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,703
2D sensationalized

804
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:51,007
From the point of of end times

805
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:51,775
5 minutes

806
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,823
Again like the idea of of like

807
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,591
Alright

808
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,127
We lost this one

809
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,175
Devil's going to win

810
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,223
But we got to focus on the midterms

811
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:03,551
In order to defeat the Devil again like right

812
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,647
And the other problem too is if you are in m x type

813
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,439
Enzymes always got to become

814
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:14,559
The end times cannot be here

815
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,863
That's what the money is in end times being

816
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,911
Coming down the road somewhere

817
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:21,983
It really screw things up when it's here I think Alex is going to

818
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,287
I don't know I see this is a bad

819
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,591
So Alex

820
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,383
Scripture talking about Galactic laws

821
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,431
Contract law for aliens

822
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,199
Sure

823
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,223
This is released

824
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,503
5th dimensional chess

825
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,879
All the timeline for the globalist always tell us what to do

826
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,671
All documents that are public

827
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,047
Wyoroads

828
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,007
What are some down

829
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:01,663
Give you notice cuz you have metaphysical spiritual rice

830
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:07,039
Common law

831
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:15,999
This is a comically childish and stupid view of morality and I would just like to take everyone who claims the Altis smart

832
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:16,767
He has good point

833
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,303
What they think of that

834
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:20,863
Because that moral system and Alex's presenting

835
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,143
He's really hard to

836
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,167
To defend if you want to look at

837
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:23,935
Human history

838
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,983
It's simple enough to say that everyone

839
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:30,591
Deprive people of their alienable rights went to hell after they died

840
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:36,735
Yeah that's kind of a problem Alex would have to either save it slavery doesn't

841
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:41,343
Violate inalienable rights for a bunch of his Heroes and ancestors are in hell

842
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:46,975
But leaving that aside looking at the actions that are ascribed to the devil in traditional Christian

843
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:50,559
I don't see where he's warning people what he's going to do before he does it

844
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,095
In the Garden of Eden

845
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,655
It's God who tells them not to eat from the Tree of knowledge

846
00:44:55,167 --> 00:45:01,311
If God hadn't done that then the serpent would presumably have done the exact same thing it did in the story and convince Adam and Eve to eat the

847
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,079
Fruit

848
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:05,663
The serpent didn't do anything except a manipulative evil Act

849
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:08,223
The part where there was a warning came from someone else

850
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:08,991
Entirely

851
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:12,575
Do in order for this make any sense and how it's his moral conception

852
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:16,927
The morality or immorality of your actions can be determined by other

853
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:17,951
People's actions

854
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:21,023
This would imply that it would be very wrong

855
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,815
For me to punch you randomly

856
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:23,583
And without Warren

857
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:24,863
However

858
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:28,447
If someone were to tell you Dan is going to punch you when you go to his house

859
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,239
Then my Poncho be completely fine

860
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:33,823
Because someone else let you know that it was coming and you chose to come here anyway

861
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,847
In fact

862
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,383
In this conception

863
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:40,735
It could be argued that me punching you is never immoral in and of itself

864
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:44,319
If my punch is morally correct when someone else warns you

865
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,087
And Morley

866
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,623
Incorrect when they do not

867
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:49,439
The actual distinction is the warning itself

868
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:51,231
That's where the moral weight loss

869
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:54,303
So it becomes a matter of the other person doing something

870
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:58,143
The emerald by not warning you my punch doesn't matter at all

871
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:58,911
So then

872
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,471
What if no one else knows that I'm going to punch

873
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:07,103
Then apparently I have to tell you ahead of time that I plan to punch you had that if you come over anyway

874
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,895
You consented to being punched

875
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,199
This is stupid for a number of reasons

876
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,503
To what extent do I need to make

877
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,551
Make sure that you're aware that I'm going to punch

878
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,343
Don't you have to serve people before you

879
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:21,951
Is it enough that I bumble it to you as you leave knowing they go probably not

880
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:22,719
Hear me or fur

881
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:25,791
Forget by the time we end up getting together to record again

882
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,327
How to make put it in a movie

883
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,631
Is it enough for me to write I'm going to punch

884
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:34,495
Jordan the next time he comes over on a piece of paper that I taped to a Lamppost 2 miles north of my house

885
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,311
Knowing that you'll never pass that Lamppost

886
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,847
I thought Arthur got that bike

887
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:44,479
Satisfy the metaphysical condition even though there's literally no way it could ever a

888
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,247
Pack your behavior

889
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,271
Ask the Vogons

890
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:50,367
You could say that the warning was that there if you wanted to look

891
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:53,183
Look for it and it's really your fault that you didn't find that lamp post

892
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,463
Stood right there on the old

893
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,487
Open for everyone to see

894
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,279
That does

895
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:01,119
The person that thing is being done to need to be aware of the thing that's going

896
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,399
Going to be done to them

897
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:05,983
This is a question that Alex cannot answer because no matter what

898
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:06,751
The answer is

899
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,287
It doesn't make sense

900
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:10,591
If the standard is informed consent

901
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,127
You need to be doing

902
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:14,687
Way more warning than they're doing right now

903
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:18,783
And honestly would probably need to get literally everyone to sign off on their plan

904
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,343
Knowing the implications of what they were agreeing to

905
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,623
So it obviously can't be

906
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,391
That

907
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:26,975
If the standard is that person needs to believe the Warren

908
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:29,535
Is that possible sure you need to believe it

909
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:35,679
Because even if that's the standard I still don't think you deserve to be punched for coming over whether or not you believe the warning

910
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:40,031
You might not believe it someone could say damn going to punch you to come over and I can have f*** you

911
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:46,431
Sure but you understand that this line of thinking makes perfect sense because of the way that the all of these people

912
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,455
The deal with hell

913
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,991
Like okay

914
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:53,343
If everybody that doesn't accept Jesus Christ into their heart is going to hell

915
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:56,671
Jesus didn't get his message out for a good long while

916
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,207
To the rest of the world

917
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:03,327
So all of those people despite never having heard of Jesus Christ spend eternity in hell

918
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,119
Just because God was like

919
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,423
Geographical product placement

920
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:08,959
You know like that's

921
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:12,031
So your argument that has to be well there's evidence

922
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:16,127
God all around you so you should have known that God was real and Ava

923
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,663
Christ if there's a God

924
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,455
Stood Still your phone

925
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:22,015
And that's why he'll is justifiable

926
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,575
Two people who've never heard of Christianity

927
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,343
B b

928
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,111
I I think

929
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,903
You're trying to bring

930
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,439
Too much sense

931
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:31,231
Stewart and I'm trying to Deacon

932
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:35,583
Struck this from an ethical perspective

933
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,655
Wealthy here's what I think that Alex would say the standard is

934
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:44,287
He would say that the standard that you need to achieve is that you need to publicly admit this somewhere

935
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:49,407
So even if you do it in code that's only decipherable to a genius like Alex Jones

936
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,687
That's still good enough

937
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:51,967
I struggled

938
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:58,367
See how this qualifies as warning people in an ethically meaningful way for the same reason that by message tape to Lamppost doesn't seem like

939
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,903
You could reasonably be seen

940
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,183
Possibly impact

941
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,207
Acting your behavior

942
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,487
I mean you know

943
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,767
And we're dealing with Satan

944
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:11,167
Name God there's obviously a lot of wiggle room in the rules those two guys aren't human behavior

945
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:15,519
What we're f***** in order to make this morality work it must not be the wood

946
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,287
Be victims of

947
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:19,103
The crime that are required to be warned about what they're going

948
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,127
Into this person's going

949
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:25,247
He must be a thing where the act of writing it down and put it out there is to serve as a notice

950
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:28,575
The god of their intentions but what kind of sense does that make

951
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:29,599
Also what are the

952
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,647
Consequences for breaking these supposed

953
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,671
Galactic laws

954
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,975
And why should the devil be concerned with any

955
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:35,999
He's already the

956
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,023
The f****** devil

957
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,047
Disintegration

958
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:40,095
Punishment he fears most

959
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:43,167
Okay so you do

960
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:48,031
The devil anymore but otherwise who's

961
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,055
Probably wouldn't come

962
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,103
See you again

963
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:55,967
Here's where I'm really struggling with Alex and all this b******* you understand that for your

964
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,735
Actual religion

965
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,759
Do not be both

966
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:00,319
B******* you have to have the entire time

967
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,343
You can't

968
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,111
Stop them

969
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,903
You can't delay them

970
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,439
It's God's moment

971
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,463
He chooses

972
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:08,511
There's no way that bite

973
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,535
Is going to affect

974
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,559
God's plan

975
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:13,631
Otherwise your entire religion is nonsense

976
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,911
Yeah and you can't

977
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:17,727
Vote on the devil

978
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:22,079
Assuming Joe would have had a different voice

979
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:26,687
This'll be moral system of a child and honestly it's embarrassing to hear and try to explain

980
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,735
His beliefs

981
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:31,039
How small his vision of the Divine is

982
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:36,927
Same kind of bummer I get whenever I hear people on Project Camelot talking about like a lien contract

983
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,463
Psycho

984
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:39,999
Yeah are you

985
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:40,767
Who sang to me

986
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,303
Even if we

987
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,607
Beyond the stars we're never going to get

988
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:45,887
Point where at

989
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,679
Materias going to

990
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,727
Hold the entire universe

991
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:50,495
Together

992
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:52,799
It's still just going to be a signature

993
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:54,335
And God is trying

994
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:57,151
To get the devil on technicalities or something

995
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:00,479
All right we have them on a RICO case

996
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,015
Yeah

997
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,343
At this point Alex does something

998
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,367
Incredibly familiar

999
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:13,279
Ladies and gentlemen we are back live broadcasting worldwide again we are Night live broadcasting worldwide Miami

1000
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:16,863
Alex Jones

1001
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,399
To be here with you today

1002
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:30,431
Cuz I got to reset

1003
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:42,207
I got some really important news released over here and hit reset

1004
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:49,887
And so the

1005
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,799
What what

1006
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:59,871
He's an important announcement

1007
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,431
I was thinking about

1008
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:03,967
Is going on

1009
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:09,087
Yeah Alex isn't DC now you lost the bet

1010
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:15,487
So he's freaking out trying to do this show remotely sounds like s*** like that a lot of audio

1011
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:20,863
Crackly nurses terrible and honestly even beyond that his heart is not in it

1012
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,935
Sweet freaks out a little bit and he goes to rebroadcast it

1013
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,959
Honestly wasn't surprising

1014
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,751
To me at all but it never honestly seems like a

1015
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,031
Prootest

1016
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:28,799
Decision

1017
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:31,615
The only real question to me is why is he hosts

1018
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,639
Nothing at all

1019
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:35,711
Then it dawned on me there's probably no one else

1020
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:36,479
Who can host

1021
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:39,295
Shroyer's on the Caravan

1022
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,831
David Knight is

1023
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:47,231
Definitely not a prime-time candidate I think David Knight he has his own show right and he had a heart attack like a

1024
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,255
You're a go

1025
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,279
This workload

1026
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:57,471
I think it's great that he's not taking on unnecessary probably not be the person who

1027
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,751
He's not going to move product

1028
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:02,335
And Millie Weaver is gone forever Diablo

1029
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:05,663
Terrible 22 Green happily for The Man Show

1030
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,943
Same problem with Harrison

1031
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:10,015
Smith Galaxy can fill in on the war room cuz no one's watching

1032
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:13,855
Actual Owen show

1033
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,391
Seems like it's probably

1034
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:21,791
Probably no good Mike Adams is gone like you can't talk to Mike Adams the 4th hour fill-in host

1035
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,327
Sorry Heather

1036
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,095
Like

1037
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,887
They wouldn't do it or

1038
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:26,655
Are we going to have

1039
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:30,495
Three-and-a-half 4 hours of Gerald Celente

1040
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,287
Are those the funeral Bells

1041
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,591
Because I can hear Rodger Stones name cover

1042
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:40,991
Coming right down 3 hours of rambling

1043
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,527
I do not

1044
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,551
I listen to it

1045
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:44,575
I do not want him

1046
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:48,415
There may literally be no one left it enforces able to fill in for Alex

1047
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,951
It's interesting in a way

1048
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:50,975
He's kind of reached

1049
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,999
The Pinnacle of success

1050
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,303
But at the same time he's right where he started

1051
00:53:55,071 --> 00:54:00,191
He's got a giant business with a ton of employees but he still needs to do everything himself cuz everyone sucks

1052
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,495
He's the president's biggest cheerleader but

1053
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,775
Are you still ignored in cast

1054
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:06,335
Decide in favor of more seemingly acceptable right

1055
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,359
When commentators

1056
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:08,895
Same as it ever was

1057
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:12,223
I feel like you should realize that

1058
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:15,295
Patxi's on lead to Nowhere it never has

1059
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:18,623
It started with him being alone is going to end with him being alone

1060
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:20,671
And I good luck to you buddy

1061
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,439
Except

1062
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:22,975
There's some good

1063
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:23,999
Was that

1064
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:27,071
Affair and comes back and then

1065
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,375
Sports talk about having cancer

1066
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:32,191
I was like wait to actually have cancer

1067
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,751
Just the only way I can talk to

1068
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,543
It's hard where I'm at

1069
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,567
Snooze

1070
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:39,615
Devastator

1071
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:41,919
Devastator

1072
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:44,479
It's not just that I've learned that I have

1073
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,183
Cancer

1074
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,791
My God

1075
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,351
Alright you didn't even need that

1076
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,655
No just say I don't have cancer

1077
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:08,543
They're not weirded me out cuz I kind of felt like

1078
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:12,127
Oh that makes sense answer

1079
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:20,063
Spaghetti I would believe it if I have terminal cancer

1080
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,623
S*** well no wonder you went the world

1081
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:23,903
Yeah I got your nose

1082
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,207
This is amazing.

1083
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,231
Well

1084
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:33,119
No unfortunately that is not how I would put it

1085
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,679
He just thinks that I was going to die

1086
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,215
You should know he's not happy to report

1087
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:37,983
Joshua

1088
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:40,287
I'm sitting here last night and this morning

1089
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:45,151
Thinking about what I'm going to say today on here because of all the announcements and all the statements have been made

1090
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,527
I don't feel good coming on air

1091
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:52,319
Telling you

1092
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:54,367
Dad

1093
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:02,047
I want explain

1094
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:06,399
Sound like

1095
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,423
Yeah

1096
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,703
Ceremony

1097
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,519
Alright I don't want to

1098
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:12,799
Man I know I just

1099
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:17,407
Now that we kind of get more of the gist of what he told his kids at The Breakfast Table

1100
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,687
You're going to watch

1101
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,711
Millions died

1102
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:21,503
Is like not a good morning

1103
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,295
Kids got to head to the Hills

1104
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:26,623
Hey we can do remote learning

1105
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:32,767
As far remote As we need to be looked I got some John Birch Society books that's all the Buckle I need

1106
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:39,935
Siri I mean we're all going to die

1107
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:43,007
Reporting that if Trump had won the election which is weird

1108
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,567
The election stolen

1109
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,615
Stole this wigger

1110
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:49,919
In Dallas in front of everybody

1111
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:53,503
House with a safe

1112
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,039
Bring your house with it

1113
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:55,807
Computers

1114
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,343
Bring your house with a silverware

1115
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,135
Family heirloom

1116
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,231
Damn right you do

1117
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,535
So they are

1118
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:08,095
Person have a coup against Trump all over the news

1119
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:10,143
He's insane he's crazy

1120
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:12,191
He's not going to let them have this

1121
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:22,431
Infowarsstore.com

1122
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:30,111
Brandon Caravan up here is a shockingly pointless

1123
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,903
Spent a lot on gas for no reason

1124
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,183
Owen the bomber

1125
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:36,255
I I do I do appreciate the the if

1126
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,279
You know if

1127
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:39,071
You catch the robber in your house

1128
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,863
That's that's good

1129
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:41,887
If

1130
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:42,655
You catch

1131
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:44,703
You know you have a right to

1132
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:45,471
To defend yourself

1133
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:47,007
Etcetera

1134
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:53,663
But if instead of doing that you're you lose something and then you drive to DC and murder

1135
00:57:53,919 --> 00:58:00,063
For someone who has you've never met before and who's never been to

1136
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:03,647
No similar tablet

1137
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,951
Cuz of metaphysical laws were

1138
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:12,351
Also from that clip at the audio is not gotten better hell

1139
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,119
Answer Alex

1140
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,399
It's really mad again

1141
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:17,983
I'm on the road I'm here in Washington d.c. not a lot of technical

1142
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,007
Salty's Redondo

1143
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,543
Stay on here is best

1144
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:22,335
As I can

1145
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,943
Muddy signal I'm getting blessed in my ear

1146
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:42,559
Broadcast

1147
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:50,495
But it's okay

1148
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,311
I'm trying about scanner

1149
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:58,687
By the whole country is going to hell in a handbasket

1150
00:58:58,943 --> 00:58:59,967
Jumpman

1151
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:07,391
My feelings of course the entire country is falling apart naturally isn't my

1152
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:10,719
City set up Jodi cattive of the state of the world

1153
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:18,911
Alex Jones Infowars would have issues with my phone can

1154
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:23,775
I constantly have these techies shoes to plague me in studio and out

1155
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:30,175
And everytime I try and take a phone call from somebody and broadcast from DC and I'm having problems

1156
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:30,943
Somehow I'm

1157
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:32,223
Surprised

1158
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,759
Shock in the world

1159
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:37,599
Is clearly going to hell totally interesting

1160
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:38,879
Did this happen

1161
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,671
Twice

1162
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:44,255
I don't recall the last time he's done this twice

1163
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:46,047
Probably end up vamping

1164
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:48,863
Until the commercial breaks it doesn't actually have to storm out

1165
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:49,631
Second time

1166
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,167
But

1167
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,215
Leaving early

1168
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:55,519
Of course

1169
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:57,311
Yeah yeah definitely

1170
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,079
Totally

1171
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:08,063
Lorraine

1172
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:19,583
Williams Junior

1173
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:22,911
Horseshoe

1174
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:26,239
Country Boys work is never done

1175
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:33,407
The Lord has certainly made a lot of beautiful woman

1176
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,199
Wow

1177
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:39,551
Hanover

1178
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,303
Snooze

1179
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:55,935
That was just on

1180
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,263
Remember

1181
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:12,831
So this is a great add for brain Force

1182
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:17,183
You have these sort of nootropics these supplements that give you

1183
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:20,511
Focus and Clarity and the ability to really stay on task

1184
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:26,911
Yaya bility to disintegrate in gotland also real eye-opener

1185
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:32,799
Mental fog versus Clarity you're talking about the ability to do a radio show and a hotel room

1186
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,591
There are other people present

1187
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:36,639
God.

1188
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,175
Anyway

1189
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:44,319
Takes over for like the last half-hour

1190
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:47,647
He's terrible but I'm a little tired

1191
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:50,207
Give him 5 minutes up top he won't hurt the show

1192
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:56,607
Yeah it's alright I want you to get some

1193
01:01:56,863 --> 01:02:01,215
Best spotahome product

1194
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:03,775
You have to keep the audience happy Alex

1195
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:05,823
Most of it although he's not going to do much

1196
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:08,383
That night

1197
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:10,431
Or that day in

1198
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,199
Caravan

1199
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,479
Activity

1200
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,527
It was really stormy

1201
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:15,295
That day

1202
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,063
Proin

1203
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:19,135
So why you talked to an underwhelming group of people in the rain

1204
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:22,463
I'm in in North Carolina but how the election was stolen

1205
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:25,279
And honestly by this point the charm of the Caribbean

1206
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,815
Caravan it worn off for me

1207
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:28,095
It's redundant

1208
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:30,399
It's unimpressive and ultimately

1209
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,679
Too obvious with

1210
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:34,495
This is all about creating the Optics

1211
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,287
Taking your dumb show on the road

1212
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:38,335
Arriving at a much larger event

1213
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:40,895
And then giving yourself credit for the turnout at the largest

1214
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,431
It's honestly

1215
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,711
Pretty disappointing

1216
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:44,735
There's such great

1217
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:48,063
Potential for this road trip in the end it's really forgettable

1218
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:51,391
I tried to find an angle of something interesting

1219
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:54,463
We talked about the open my comic did the shellcon impression

1220
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:59,071
I tried to see if there was a human-interest angle in here somewhere but there just isn't

1221
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:02,655
They have the opportunity to do something really interesting and compelling

1222
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:05,471
Instead they did exactly what Infowars always does

1223
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:09,055
They produced a cookie-cutter performance that was meant to create profit

1224
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,079
And gather attention

1225
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:12,127
Well funneling support to larger fashion

1226
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:12,895
Movements

1227
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:16,223
I'm really disappointed in them but I also know there's

1228
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:18,015
It's not really anything else they can do

1229
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:22,111
The only thing that's even close to interesting in this stretch

1230
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,647
Is they did a damaged

1231
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:26,463
Control video in Raleigh where gris-gris

1232
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,743
And some other employees

1233
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:30,815
Discuss how someone gave them a book with a Nazi bookmark in it

1234
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:35,679
Their angle naturally is that this was an agent provocateur like that who is that

1235
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:39,007
Trump look bad natural although I would argue it's equally possible it was just

1236
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:42,079
Justify a bookmark in our yoga book

1237
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:48,991
After the rally stop ended on to Richmond Virginia and honestly it's a fine turnout but it's more of the same

1238
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:54,367
My highlight is that a guy playing the trumpet there while the crowd sings the national anthem

1239
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:58,975
And a shot of the trumpet player happens to include a historical marker in the background

1240
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:03,071
This was actually shot on the site of the 1863 rich

1241
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,095
Red Riot

1242
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,887
Cool kind of fit

1243
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,679
The Union forces at her

1244
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:08,703
Supply lines for the

1245
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:09,471
Confederacy

1246
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:11,263
The prices of food at increased in Richmond

1247
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,287
Considerably

1248
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,823
From history.com

1249
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:20,479
On April 1st the group of poor working women held a meeting in a Baptist Church to organize a demonstration against the rising

1250
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:21,247
Acosta food

1251
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:25,855
Mary Jackson a 34 year-old mother and Martha Ferguson riled up the audience

1252
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:26,879
The tales of Rapids

1253
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:27,903
Speculation

1254
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:29,695
And price gouging happening in the market

1255
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:32,767
Soon the mob was angry enough to agree to meet

1256
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:35,071
The very next day outside the Capitol building

1257
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,607
An extract bread and just

1258
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,631
Stats from the men in charge

1259
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:41,727
The governor initially refused to meet with them but then then when he

1260
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:42,495
Daddy was Unser

1261
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:45,055
Sympathetic to the mob went on a tear and started writing

1262
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:49,919
They stole food but also luxury goods until the riot police arrived and we're prepared to fire

1263
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:51,711
The reason that I think this is

1264
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:52,735
Spitting it is

1265
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:55,551
Ridiculous display was on the same side of the bread riot

1266
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:58,111
Is because the aftermath of that Riot was it

1267
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,159
The Confederacy tried really hard

1268
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:01,183
To keep it quiet

1269
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,719
Since I knew that word of this

1270
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:05,279
Internal chaos would raise the morale of the Union Army

1271
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:08,607
These videos are really things that I want in Infowars

1272
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:09,631
Try to keep quiet

1273
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:12,703
They're out there yelling about how does the end of the country and

1274
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:16,287
This Caravan the last battle in these of the crowds they can draw

1275
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:19,615
I don't know that raises my morale but I think it should hurt tears

1276
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:23,199
They looked at it honestly this is not this is not impressive

1277
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:25,247
I wouldn't

1278
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:28,575
If I was doing that in any capacity

1279
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:30,623
Like even

1280
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:33,439
Play tours

1281
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,463
Where I made

1282
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,487
Negative

1283
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,839
Exclusively. Math

1284
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:43,935
I think I broke even once maybe maybe maybe for me

1285
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:46,751
But yeah if I was doing

1286
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:47,775
Vicinity

1287
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:51,871
Like this would be bad for me on an amateur tour

1288
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:53,663
Like that

1289
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,687
The level of

1290
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,711
The bad this is

1291
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:57,503
Yeah

1292
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:03,903
You might be able to get like a little bit of b-roll from there she asked for a larger thing yet

1293
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:10,303
Camp video the wrap-up has Maybe.

1294
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,071
Susan good

1295
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:13,631
It it seem it seems to me like

1296
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:16,191
This is them throwing

1297
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,727
Everything they've got

1298
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:18,495
The most

1299
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:21,823
Extreme language the most immediacy possible

1300
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,359
And it's still

1301
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,895
Ratably underwhelming

1302
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:27,967
And I I would be embarrassed to that if I work until Warriors

1303
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:28,991
And if I were Ellen

1304
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,271
I would treat this like the

1305
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,807
The Confederacy treated the bread riot

1306
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:33,599
And I would not to have

1307
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:37,951
You're standing right in front of the memorial of that

1308
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,255
So we jumped

1309
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,279
To the 13th

1310
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:44,351
Friday and Alex's back Hosta

1311
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,119
Singing Shower

1312
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:46,655
Prophesied

1313
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,215
I've been really funny if he

1314
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:55,615
But we can't I can't do it from here and nobody is home

1315
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:57,663
I dropped called yesterday but I was napping

1316
01:06:59,199 --> 01:06:59,967
Call him back

1317
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:06,879
Drove by the hotel in Vienna

1318
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:10,719
Classic Hotel staff

1319
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,791
Yeah it would be fun if you left

1320
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:15,583
But instead he stayed and then just

1321
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,351
Did nothing

1322
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:18,399
Except for y'all to a bullhorn

1323
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:21,471
But you're here he is talking about what has happened

1324
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,007
On the the Caravan

1325
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:25,055
You know that this wasn't

1326
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:28,383
True if you were keeping up with the cameras at

1327
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:34,783
On the way here

1328
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:37,855
Posing as

1329
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:40,671
Patriots

1330
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,695
Premise literature

1331
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:44,255
Tomorrow

1332
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:47,071
Video red-handed

1333
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:51,423
Station Subs

1334
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,191
Thrift stores

1335
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:54,239
Tears are not

1336
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:03,199
Tomorrow

1337
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:04,223
Boring

1338
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,063
Berrington

1339
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:09,599
Haha

1340
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:13,695
I was just making all that up shirt

1341
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:17,023
The only thing that's real is that book

1342
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:19,839
Did someone gave that with a Nazi book Market

1343
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:27,775
And they have a bowl and antifa follow them broke

1344
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:30,591
Florida up through the the whole Convoy

1345
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:32,383
All the way up and there's plans

1346
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,663
Paradisi

1347
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:34,687
They're going to show up

1348
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,711
With backwards

1349
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,479
Maga hat

1350
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:40,575
A camouflage pants sure they're going to hand out dirty literature

1351
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:42,879
Do you ever want to make a Patriots look bad

1352
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:44,671
So dumb

1353
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,719
I can think of a few things

1354
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:47,487
Is that

1355
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:50,047
Would do more for the cause

1356
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:52,863
Then antifa

1357
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:56,959
Joining that Infowars Caravan as agent prop

1358
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:01,823
Because yours I did I just don't think there's anything else that could be done for the movement

1359
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:03,615
Don't have that much effect

1360
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:04,383
Stop

1361
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:06,431
I don't think I've heard anybody but

1362
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:08,223
Me talk about this

1363
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:21,023
I really care about it just for that one.

1364
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:27,423
A+ daddy like Angry tweets about it or even I think I saw a couple

1365
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,471
People posting about the milkshake

1366
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:33,055
From the trucker is a little bit of jokes about that

1367
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:36,895
I don't think anybody gives a s*** except for them and me

1368
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,991
I don't think anybody

1369
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:43,551
It's really it's really

1370
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:44,575
Annoying

1371
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:47,647
That you spend all of your time whipping up whites

1372
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,671
Two promises to fight

1373
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:49,439
For you

1374
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,207
And then you like

1375
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:52,767
I don't know where all these white supremacist come from

1376
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:53,791
Must Be Love

1377
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:57,887
Man you don't so much time loving me

1378
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:00,959
Too little it's a little much

1379
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:06,079
It's not going to end it's not going to alienate 48% of the country

1380
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:10,943
It's not going to alienate the people who are still listening to you at this point

1381
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:17,343
If you can ramble about the literal devil all the f****** time and say all this nonsense b******* and people don't leave

1382
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:21,695
Just mask off man

1383
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,279
So even if he does do that these listeners

1384
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:29,119
Nazi or otherwise need to recognize that their lives are over

1385
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:31,423
And so because their lives are over

1386
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:33,471
Time to go yell at the governor

1387
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,311
Your life is over

1388
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:42,175
We need people everyday surrounding

1389
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:46,015
Pizza restaurant

1390
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:48,575
Threatening you go up in the spacer

1391
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:49,599
We know you're being black

1392
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:53,695
We know the lockdowns permanent Bo lyrics

1393
01:10:55,231 --> 01:11:01,375
Smash got to Alex complaining about people yelling at Trump officials a restaurant

1394
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:07,263
Also there are 20 states in the United States where Governor can be recalled in Texas is not one of them

1395
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:13,151
In order for Alex to do his plan about recalling Governor Abbott he would first need to find to just

1396
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:14,687
Application for a new law in context

1397
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:15,711
The Constitution

1398
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:18,015
And then get a law passed by the state legislature

1399
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:19,807
To be a cumbersome process

1400
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:24,671
He's not up for it honestly will probably just be easier to wait until he's up for re-election

1401
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:29,791
And then filled a fringe as candidate to lose to him and probably split the vote to a Democrat ends up winning

1402
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:32,863
Also Governor Abbott's not being blackmailed you still living

1403
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:34,399
Credibly far-right politician

1404
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:36,191
I'm just not far right enough for Alex

1405
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,007
He's failed Alex's purity test

1406
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:42,591
It's not illegal to write a law that just says

1407
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:43,615
Is Governor Abbott

1408
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:44,639
Can never be governor

1409
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:47,199
Wright Abbott out

1410
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:49,247
Abbotsford

1411
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:50,783
I might be a ninja

1412
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,599
Challenge

1413
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:55,903
Someone filed a lawsuit

1414
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:59,487
I'm not a lawyer

1415
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:05,887
Little bit long but I kept it in because it begins with Alex

1416
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:06,911
Talkin about

1417
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,727
How he's not into offensive violence

1418
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:11,007
Sure and then it

1419
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:13,823
Wider ramble about a bunch of nonsense

1420
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:16,127
But I think I needed to play it

1421
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:20,735
It's two-and-a-half minutes long but the recent want to play this whole chunk is like if you listen to this

1422
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,807
It's sort of an ABA kind of

1423
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:30,463
Structure you have the a theme of offensive violence sure he's kind of just

1424
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:33,535
Random talking points spaghetti up against the wall

1425
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:36,095
And then you return to what the thesis

1426
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,887
Of the initial thought was

1427
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:39,679
But by that point

1428
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:45,567
Your brain will ask if you're not paying attention you'll kind of already you've forgotten that that's what he was talking about

1429
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:49,151
And if this happens quite a bit but I rarely play full clip

1430
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,223
Just because it's

1431
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,247
Plumbing floor

1432
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:58,879
I don't want the offensive line with but I see a lot of talk online dual saying time to dust off the market

1433
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:02,719
Is eclipse

1434
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,559
Under common law under comments

1435
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,143
You cannot talk

1436
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,679
Experimental dangerous facts

1437
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:15,263
Will they be safe or not they're not there

1438
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:18,335
People have

1439
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:21,151
Long history

1440
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:22,687
Assistant

1441
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:28,319
Billions of dollars he got four big foundation

1442
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:29,855
Robber barons

1443
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,439
The most anxious teksystems

1444
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,975
He's a friend of R22

1445
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:38,815
Thrown out of 20 gauge

1446
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,095
When you got something

1447
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:42,143
Through plate glass window

1448
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:44,191

You disappear

1462
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,967
They say you have covid

Lungs

1467
01:14:58,431 --> 01:15:00,735
In the blue study area for the doctor

1468
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:02,271
Copilot

White girl

Bigger Psycho Killer

1472

Run Road

1473
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,631
What's the pressure you're supposed to

1474
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:18,655
There's like

1475
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:21,983
Because I got to get kill numbers

1476
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:24,543
Coming to kill

1477
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,591
They're coming to kill you

1478
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:29,663
Kind of you kind of get

1479
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:30,687
What I'm saying

1480
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:32,991
He starts with the Press

1481
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:37,087
Temptation of like there's a lot of people were saying clean off your rifles

1482
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:38,111
Amen

1483
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:41,695
He gives the appearance of saying that no you shouldn't

1484
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:45,535
That is good for him because he can sort of point to that

1485
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,559
Yeah that's being like

1486
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:51,679
This is me pushing back against the idea of offensive violin now the next 2 minutes as him saying

1487
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:52,703
100

1488
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,983
F****** different things

1489
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,031
Right you can't keep track of all these

1490
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,311
Various little

1491
01:15:57,567 --> 01:16:01,919
Bulshit

1492
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:04,223
Leftist doctors

1493
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:05,759
Killers

1494
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:10,879
Colts creep bioethics boards

1495
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:11,903
Increase

1496
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,439
Goddamn Temple

1497
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:15,487
And then it gets to the end

1498
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:18,559
And the messages he's trying to drive home if they're coming

1499
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,583
To kill you they're coming

1500
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:21,119
The kill you they're coming to kill you

1501
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:22,143
This

1502
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:24,191
Is the answer to the

1503
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:24,959
Beginning of

1504
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:26,751
This is him saying

1505
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,799
There is no such

1506
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:32,383
Being as offensive it's not a question of that

1507
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:39,039
Existentially this isn't even a question we need to worry about yet all violence is defensive

1508
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:44,159
But he doesn't need to actually say that if he structures be argument this way

1509
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:50,559
Anybody tries to say like Alex you're advocating for people to dust off their rifles and

1510
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:53,119
Fire at people if they feel like they're

1511
01:16:54,911 --> 01:17:01,055
New vaccine evolution is coming for that

1512
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:05,663
Anything you do to that person is anybody

1513
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:08,223
He tries to say that Alex this is what you're saying

1514
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:08,991
2.2 like

1515
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:13,087
I said that there's a lot of people were saying clean off the rifles and I was pushing

1516
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:14,879
Back against that idea

1517
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:15,903
You are one of them

1518
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:22,047
The coward's way of saying exactly that just shoot people there's no such

1519
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,327
Such thing as offensive Ila

1520
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:26,399
That one of those crimes

1521
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:32,031
I will say that it's a leftist student

1522
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:36,639
F****** book with the Nazis bookmark

1523
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:37,663
Cheese's

1524
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:41,759
So I can slide clip Alex talks about

1525
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:44,063
Conspiracy that I'd like to see him

1526
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:45,087
Substantiate at all

1527
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:48,927
And the police come and say you're not allowed to criticize a lockdown

1528
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:53,279
By the way all these people leave them on Daria

1529
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:55,071
Remember that job

1530
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,887
What's Swedish couples

1531
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:00,447
He was organizing a demonstration they arrested her

1532
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,591
Hyundai in Australia they disappeared

1533
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:12,735
Members of City Council

1534
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:13,759
What

1535
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:20,415
There's a big difference between you not checking this is object permanence

1536
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:26,815
Existed we would have heard of him about them in the news again yeah we haven't heard about them in the middle never been seen there

1537
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:29,375
You killed they've been disappeared

1538
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:33,215
That's really sloppy

1539
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,007
That's all

1540
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:39,359
That's all it takes I have not seen my delivery driver

1541
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,895
For the Chinese food that I got last

1542
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:44,223
For 24 hours and I'm thinking about filing

1543
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:49,343
I would assume that if city council members

1544
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,367
Schreiber being pissy

1545
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:51,903
Appeared

1546
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:55,743
Continue Council they were very suspicious

1547
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:59,839
We never run off why we have we elected somebody

1548
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:00,607
A don't worry about

1549
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:02,399
Okay

1550
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:05,983
PDF

1551
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:12,639
1 things that would happen there is paperwork short

1552
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:14,687
Conspicuous in its absence for many others

1553
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:17,247
Does any proof and when Alex

1554
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:19,295
Swedish couple

1555
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:20,831
They've never been

1556
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:23,647
Again we should look into them

1557
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:27,743
Like I told me you'd have it and you're making that off so why would you say

1558
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,535
Alex Costa calls

1559
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:30,303
You take some calls

1560
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:34,143
And one of them I offer the job to

1561
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,423
And this guy

1562
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:38,239
Is somebody who had previously offered a job too

1563
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:44,639
And he's he's okay give me a half hour show or something and then Alex's

1564
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:47,199
Start that up soon

1565
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:50,527
You still planning on starting that show with callers up soon

1566
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:53,855
But here's what this caller is theory is

1567
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:55,647
It's about what the Dems are up to

1568
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:58,719
The left is winding up there people

1569
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:00,511
Ejected this win

1570
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:03,071
Does win on the day of the eclipse

1571
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,607
December 14th

1572
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:05,375
Sorted out

1573
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,167
Is it going to rain

1574
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:07,935
Bedlam Industries

1575
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:11,263
News now

1576
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,287
Create a lockdown

1577
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:15,360
Scenario and all those people down to supper

1578
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:16,384
Present even more

1579
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,432
They go crazy when Trump wins

1580
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,200
The released

1581
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,272
That's really what they set up

1582
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:26,112
I totally agree with you start what else you think

1583
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:28,672
You were saying about the

1584
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:29,440
Rio taxi

1585
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:30,464
I feel like

1586
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:33,536
You're going with God here and looking at the alignment and God

1587
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:36,352
Annie work here just look there's a great conjunction on December

1588
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:39,680
21st

1589
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:41,984
I'm sick of conjunction years later

1590
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,264
Matic a conjunction

1591
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:49,408
So that Eclipse that's happening on December 14th is it going to be visible in any part of North America but they will be able to

1592
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:55,808
It's only going to be seen in South America parts of Northern Antarctica and some of

1593
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:57,344
Southwest Africa

1594
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:58,880
I have no idea why that would be sitting

1595
01:20:59,136 --> 01:20:59,648
Navigate to the United

1596
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:00,416
Midstates bud

1597
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:01,696
Go off whatever

1598
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:02,720
It's an eclipse

1599
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,768
Eclipses are Global events

1600
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:10,144
It's the sun in the moon and they're doing the whole thing they're spinning all the time I grow weary

1601
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:16,032
These sorts of ideas being brought to Alex's attention hibiya

1602
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:22,688
Getting my fist down to whip them up into a frenzy so whatever Trump death

1603
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:26,016
Probably doesn't steal the election wins it outright sale be whipped

1604
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:32,416
Savers and start the Civil War and they knew that they had to do all of this

1605
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:35,488
Is right now because the stars are aligning it other than eclipse

1606
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:36,512
So does that report

1607
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:37,280
It's eclipse

1608
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:49,056
Anybody who dares take this s*** seriously has the pretense of like

1609
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:53,920
He's right about more than he's wrong about f*** yourself

1610
01:21:54,176 --> 01:22:00,320
Fuckyour soon never listen to this show you listen to this God damn it

1611
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:03,648
Anybody I challenge them if they think

1612
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:05,696
But Alex has more right than he's wrong

1613
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:06,464
No kidding

1614
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,536
Explain away tell me tell me about

1615
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:12,352
How eclipses are part of the fuc

1616
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:15,424
Plan every civilization ended because of

1617
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:21,568
Priest eating people only 100 years

1618
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:22,592
Sometimes it's like

1619
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:29,248
Okay where is different time frame is it always ends up with a human barbecue

1620
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:30,272
Never wanted Spectre

1621
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:32,064
Christ and totally falls apart

1622
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:39,488
Instead of just handing off the Baton to Harrison Smith this episode

1623
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,840
And that is he has Ezra Levant from Rebel media come on

1624
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:45,376
Two Hosts for a couple segments

1625
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:49,984
And then Harrison takes over a nice Alex still gets to leave early

1626
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,520
Is coming up

1627
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:53,824
Very excited I'm interviewing a segment

1628
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,872
These great talk to us is alright

1629
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:58,432
And then

1630
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,248
Coronavirus methadone Shroyer

1631
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,296
Housing for d.c.

1632
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:04,576
Austin Texas

1633
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:10,208
The interview is not very interesting at all and the only other clip Alex has on the show before he leaves I think his interests

1634
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:11,488
And anyway is this

1635
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,280
But man

1636
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:15,328
Landslide

1637
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,608
Everyone I know

1638
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:17,376
Believe

1639
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,680
Hispanic gold Young

1640
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:22,496
It's like 60%

1641
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:26,592
No one builds for that

1642
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:27,360
Dead zombie

1643
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,296
Is there such

1644
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,064
Papa

1645
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:37,088
Controller

1646
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,880
So I think we have 60%

1647
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:41,952
If it's we have to convince ourselves we are the majority

1648
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:45,792
This is in reference to a caller who is like

1649
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:52,192
3% in polls believe Trump won the election

1650
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:53,728
It's a hundred percent

1651
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:54,496
Hachi

1652
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:57,312
You talk to Ezra Levant

1653
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:59,104
On consequential event

1654
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,128
The show wraps up

1655
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:00,896
I think

1656
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,688
Frustrates me the most

1657
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:08,064
Principal reason that Alex in the conservatives like

1658
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:09,856
Is because he's a dick

1659
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:10,624
2 Libs

1660
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:12,672
Liberty Road

1661
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:15,232
Never occur to you

1662
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:16,768
That would motivate

1663
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:19,584
Right

1664
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:24,192
Say okay fine say that nobody is voting for Biden

1665
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:29,824
Principal factor of your guy is making a lot of people hate him

1666
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:32,384
Yeah yeah that's motivating

1667
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,432
I better when you add on like

1668
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:39,552
The existential danger that he presents to vulnerable populations

1669
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:43,136
Probably galvanized quite a bit of support that way as well

1670
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,928
Oh yeah it's all just

1671
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:45,696
Job

1672
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:47,744
Anyway on Friday the Convoy

1673
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:48,768
Arrived

1674
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,048
In d.c.

1675
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:54,400
At that point really kind of pointless to discuss it is it being its own thing anymore

1676
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:59,008
From that point on the Caravan just became another group of participants in the larger very sad

1677
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,032
Display in d.c.

1678
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:01,824
Here's a little clip of Owen

1679
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:04,896
I guess this is their point now

1680
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:28,960
I don't

1681
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:30,752
Know what they're doing

1682
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:31,520
Man

1683
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,312
God

1684
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:34,592
Yes we've been

1685
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:37,920
Wildly obsessed with electoral politics with the last

1686
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:39,200
A little while and

1687
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:42,528
Yet here we are trying to overturn an election

1688
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:43,808
While yelling

1689
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:44,832
Government sucks

1690
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:46,624
I just

1691
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,648
I just

1692
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,440
You guys

1693
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:51,488
Don't understand

1694
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:58,144
Anything you want to be anarchists

1695
01:25:59,424 --> 01:25:59,936
God I hate

1696
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:00,704
These people

1697
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:07,360
Government that is not fully in line with exactly what we want in his way that represses

1698
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:08,384
The people we don't like

1699
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,920
Sucks that's the real

1700
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:11,456
The Nazi suck

1701
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:14,528
She suck on the one hand

1702
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:18,368
It's only fair that I congratulate Owen for being able to get to d.c.

1703
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,416
Theoretically on time

1704
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:26,816
50 bucks in hindsight this was a miscalculation on my part because I thought they were actually planning to do things in

1705
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:31,936
In the cities that they went to not just drop in and ongoing rallies for about 15 minutes before leaving

1706
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:34,496
They were able to achieve their goals on their trip

1707
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:35,520
Because he had no goals

1708
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:38,080
So I guess I just overestimated the

1709
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:40,128
You put together that

1710
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:40,896
Time

1711
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:42,688
Schedule where I was like yeah

1712
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:49,088
I would say two hours is about right for a rally

1713
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:54,208
Awesome to go around America maybe you good

1714
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:58,304
And I know from the times that I've been on the road like there's just unexpected

1715
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,584
The s*** like invite hat

1716
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,352
Take a shet

1717
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,120
You might have to

1718
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:03,168
Pull over at a rest stop

1719
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:06,496
For a couple minutes

1720
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:10,592
How many times have you been on the road and been like I weird

1721
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:11,360
10 minutes

1722
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:15,456
We're 15 minutes of track exit

1723
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,480
Yeah it's the best

1724
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:18,784
You might even stop and see the world's largest

1725
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,064
Blank

1726
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:24,672
I think that they probably weren't on time for most of it but they did end up pulling it off in the

1727
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:25,696
The trip ended up

1728
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:26,464
So like

1729
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:27,488
Congratulate

1730
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:28,768
I mean what they said

1731
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:29,792
Barzola

1732
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:34,144
Success I had more ambition for them but they did

1733
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,960
Kind of course it's kind of sad

1734
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:40,800
With that congratulation out-of-the-way I have to say that this is one of the most

1735
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:44,896
Pathetic dismal embarrassing and childish weekends I've ever seen in this country

1736
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:46,688
The Prelude of Alex's

1737
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:51,296
Completely pointless and poorly attended Caravan tour is what made me pay closer attention

1738
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:57,440
But if not for that aspect I think I might have given this entire million Maga March nonsense a Passenger Terminal invention

1739
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:00,768
The turnout on Saturday was in the tens of

1740
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:03,328
But nowhere near their goal of a million people

1741
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:07,936
And well below the 400,000 + who came to DC for the 2017 women's March

1742
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:10,240
It doesn't even come close to the turnout for John

1743
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:14,336
Stewart and Stephen Colbert's rally to restore sanity and or fear back in 20

1744
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:15,104
10

1745
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:17,152
They're two pieces of the puzzle here

1746
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:20,480
The reporting to recognize are both true

1747
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:22,528
And seemed at odds with each other but aren't

1748
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:25,600
The first is that this rally was a horrible fails

1749
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:29,184
The turnout wasn't even closed with the organizers and propagandists

1750
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,464
Like Alex would have wanted

1751
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,512
Haven't built this up as their last fight

1752
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:33,280
For the country

1753
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:39,936
The fact that you did a poorly attended Caravan leading up to the March only serves to highlight how thin the support for their causes and others

1754
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:41,216
Cities around the country

1755
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:41,984
Even the board

1756
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,264
Conservative-leaning South

1757
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:45,312
Their attempt at creating optic

1758
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:46,848
Pics of the country speaking out in

1759
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:50,944
In support of trump is really only proven that their best shot isn't even a fraction of the people

1760
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:51,712
Cucarachas

1761
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:52,480
Support reproductive

1762
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:53,760
Rights are civil rights

1763
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:59,136
Who's going to be excuses for the small turnout and there'll be pictures that do look

1764
01:28:59,392 --> 01:28:59,904
Like million

1765
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,696
Are people but they're far less

1766
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:06,816
There are a ton of attempts to use pictures from the women's March or the March for our lives protest

1767
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:08,608
Of course been around easily claim to have been

1768
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:09,376
For this weekend

1769
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,424
Videos

1770
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:15,008
The Trump supporters being attacked where the context of them initiating the violence

1771
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:15,776
Was left out

1772
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:18,848
These will be the attempts to salvage what the trumps

1773
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:19,872
Scammers cam

1774
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:21,664
From this utter failure of a rally

1775
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:23,200
The second piece of

1776
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:23,968
The puzzle is that the

1777
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:25,760
The turnout was still way too hot

1778
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:27,808
And that's because this rally was

1779
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:29,088
Explicitly radical

1780
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:32,672
This was not a political rally in the sense that like a March

1781
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:36,000
Supporting the Second Amendment or March protesting attacks like might be

1782
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:42,656
The only reason Israeli was happening is that these people decided to show up to say they don't want to follow the rules of the country anymore

1783
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:45,472
Whenever the news there's a new president elected

1784
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,032
I'm sorry but doesn't win will often hold them

1785
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:51,616
Inspirations and you're likely to hear people chanting stuff like notmypresident

1786
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:58,272
I bet you can find small pockets of people in those protests to insist the election itself with invalid and the right

1787
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,552
The results are real

1788
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:02,112
This weekend's rally was an entire rally that

1789
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:03,648
Just consisted of that smallpox

1790
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:04,928
Which is now

1791
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:06,208
Yes the right way

1792
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:09,536
Collection of really f***** up weirdo

1793
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:12,096
Alex Jones had the proud boys giving him

1794
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:15,936
Security Apparently one of them at a Pinochet did nothing wrong shirt on

1795
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:20,800
The old neighbors may or may not have had men stationed around the city in case it got hot

1796
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:26,688
Great Nick Fuentes and his groper gripers walked around as completely normal participants in the affair

1797
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:28,480
Qanon weirdos are all around

1798
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:31,552
The seeming contradiction is

1799
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:32,320
Same thing

1800
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:33,856
Haunted every stop on the

1801
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:34,624
Caravan

1802
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:37,696
In every city the turned out they got was miniscule

1803
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:39,232
Compared to the way they present the rowdy

1804
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:44,352
Every event they held would be considered a flop by anyone who seriously had the self-image

1805
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:45,120
That they do

1806
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:48,448
But they don't mean it when they describe how popular they are

1807
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,728
Kind of a joke

1808
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,008
They know they're lying

1809
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:54,336
Just like Alex does when he says there were 400 cars in the Caravan

1810
01:30:54,848 --> 01:31:00,480
That's a lie for the benefit of The Listener in the middle of nowhere who thinks they're hearing dispatches from the Frontline

1811
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:03,296
Not realizing that they're being deceived to sell them pills

1812
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:09,440
They don't care if there's no one at the actual rally because on some level ever wanted in Forza has to know

1813
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:12,512
Did insane world no one would show up at their rally

1814
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:17,888
9 people showing up to send them off in Austin is more than they deserve based on their credibility

1815
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:18,656
Work ethic

1816
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:19,424
And Integra

1817
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:20,192
Indeed

1818
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:22,752
This is the same Dynamic at the DC rally

1819
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,288
Butternut is a disaster

1820
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:25,824
If you're looking at it as a

1821
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,872
Sincere attempt at a political rally

1822
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:29,664
If you're looking at it for what it is

1823
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,456
Which is a collection of people living in a

1824
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:34,784
Completely fractured reality that's at odds with our reality

1825
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:37,088
And sees all reality as hostile

1826
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,648
Turn out to be terrified and a wake-up call

1827
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:43,232
Any event that would allowed people like Nick Fuentes and Alex

1828
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:46,048
Put Jones to speak on their stages is not a political event

1829
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:47,840
And I worry that some people there

1830
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:50,400
Or some people who I've seen cover to the rally

1831
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:52,192
He might not understand that dynamic

1832
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:54,752
And how extreme the stuff they're seeing actually is

1833
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:59,872
I don't know what to think about what the future holds but I do have a couple of main thought

1834
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:00,896
The came up

1835
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:05,760
The first is that Alex is messaging to his audience is completely out of sync with his public

1836
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:06,528
Behavior

1837
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:12,928
It is. Where he's going to DC and join again this rally that's trying to reinstall Trump as the president of the country

1838
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:18,304
He simultaneously telling his audience that there is no hope and everyone's going to die so everyone needs to head to the Hills

1839
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:20,608
This messaging is discordant

1840
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:24,704
And it kind of gives you the impression that his primary focus is attention-seeking behavior

1841
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:25,984
And selling survival food.

1842
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:32,896
The second is that we're about to be entering a period where fantasies and alternative realities on the extreme right

1843
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:35,456
Are going to be coming into large-scale conflict

1844
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:36,224
With what I'm going to

1845
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,248
Call reality

1846
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:40,576
As more and more excuses for why these fantasies are coming

1847
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:42,112
True become unconvincing

1848
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:44,160
The need to escalate will be ever-present

1849
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:49,280
Where is before in his earlier career Alex could justify his conspiracies by pointing to

1850
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:50,560
The Federal Reserve

1851
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:51,584
Now in the era of

1852
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:54,400
Trump in order to make anything you saying makes sense

1853
01:32:54,656 --> 01:33:00,544
He needs to evoke the literal devil end time prophecies outrageously complicated and nonsensical conspiracies

1854
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:02,848
An insistence is that everybody doesn't like

1855
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:03,616
Is a pedophile

1856
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:06,944
Without strong forces pushing in the opposite direction

1857
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:08,480
This road only leads

1858
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:09,504
2D / extreme

1859
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:14,112
There's no point where someone like Alex will be like all right good job

1860
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:19,232
If you ever reached is impossible to attain goal of eliminating all the globalist

1861
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:24,096
I would bet everything that I own that he'd magically find a new sect of Neo globalist

1862
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:27,168
Then just knock me down with a feather they all happened to not be white

1863
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:29,216
What I'm saying is

1864
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:31,008
I'm worried

1865
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:33,056
What was

1866
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:33,824
I mean

1867
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:37,408
Extremism in on the right has always been there

1868
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:38,944
Obviously there's a right

1869
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:40,480
Give their position

1870
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:43,808
In electoral politics

1871
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:46,368
Used to be able to give them a bone

1872
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:47,136
You know like

1873
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:51,232
Oh George W bush lowered the marginal tax rate

1874
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:54,560
That's all that's like a little like pressure valve

1875
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:56,352
You know we got to win

1876
01:33:56,864 --> 01:34:01,472
You know the president gave us something we elected him and we got the win that we were looking

1877
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:04,800
Now all of the winds that they want

1878
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:06,848
Are either imaginary

1879
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:07,616
And so cannot be

1880
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:09,920
Right or impossible

1881
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:11,200
And so also cannot be at

1882
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:13,504
Or will kill everyone

1883
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:15,296
So hopefully will not be

1884
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:17,344
Even the imaginary

1885
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,392
Pressure valve you know other than

1886
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:22,464
The imaginary in the impossible 1

1887
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:25,280
The Practical real-world versions of them are

1888
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:27,072
Exactly what it would look like

1889
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:29,376
If someone were taking authoritarian rule

1890
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:31,424
Exactly you know it would be like

1891
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:32,192
Like the

1892
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:34,752
Execution targeted prosecution of

1893
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:39,360
The leadership of the opposition party we want Hillary to go to prison

1894
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:41,664
And that's not going to happen

1895
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:45,760
The real the real world version of any kind of thing that would be like

1896
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:46,784
Oh yes

1897
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,576
We've gotten what we want

1898
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:49,856
That would be

1899
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:52,928
Public execution

1900
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:54,976
So it's like there's no

1901
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:55,744
Pressure release

1902
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:57,024
And

1903
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:57,792
If the if

1904
01:34:58,048 --> 01:35:00,096
Trump if they it's the right handed

1905
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:00,864
Weaponized

1906
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:02,400
Imagination

1907
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:04,960
Then they could have been like

1908
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:06,240
Oh well Trump

1909
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:07,264
Put up

1910
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:13,664
F****** he dropped Environmental Protection so we went but nobody gives a s*** about that on the right if

1911
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:20,064
If Alex wants to drink continue his break and he should just be focusing on the fact that Trump got out of the TPP or whatever

1912
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:23,392
They all met talking point and be like

1913
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:24,672
Khmer

1914
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:26,720
And your new life

1915
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:28,768
Was never economic anxiety

1916
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:35,424
It used to come off that way but now it's just full-on racism so you can't even be like oh well we got out of the TPP because of

1917
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:39,776
Economic anxiety or anything like that it's like you might want to tell the times that

1918
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:45,152
I think that it's really worrisome

1919
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:46,432
The

1920
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:47,456
Just the

1921
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:48,992
Did the rally itself

1922
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:50,528
Send DC quiz Warriors

1923
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:53,856
This is an attempt to take over fully

1924
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:54,624
The gop's

1925
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,160
With these scam artist

1926
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:57,696
These Trump scam Folk

1927
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:00,512
I think it's probably wise of them

1928
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:03,072
I think it's the only thing they can

1929
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:03,840
Yeah

1930
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:07,936
Although they'll end up in a turf war with qanon soon enough

1931
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:10,496
Sure and then they'll fracture the party and

1932
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:13,056
Democrats or whenever election

1933
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:15,104
That's probably our

1934
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:16,640
Do the most

1935
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:17,664
It's likely out

1936
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:22,016
Of that in the long-term is they will eventually kill each

1937
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:27,392
Build destroy the world according with or at least diminish their own electrical power

1938
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:29,952
Metaphysics

1939
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:30,720
Play not you know

1940
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:31,488
But

1941
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:33,280
That's

1942
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:34,048
That's

1943
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:34,816
Like the long-term

1944
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:36,352
The short-term is

1945
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:39,680
Fuckedupshit

1946
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:41,216
Very scary

1947
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:42,752
Oh well

1948
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:47,104
Anyway that's like everything on knowledge fights

1949
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:50,944
Just Kara project

1950
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:52,480
Sober

1951
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:56,576
The good news is though in South Carolina they did find a homeless

1952
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:57,600
Computer chip in

1953
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:58,368
But they

1954
01:36:58,624 --> 01:37:03,488
Couldn't get footage of Eddie gave him that Nazi broccoli there's the problem that's what happen

1955
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:09,888
This so much ruin my fun

1956
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:14,240
Just Want to Have Fun they just don't understand how to do anything

1957
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:15,264
Yeah

1958
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:18,336
How much fun would it be if one of the videos does just like

1959
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:22,176
Owen being like all right we're going to go to this North Carolina where they look this Raleigh

1960
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:24,480
Event but you know what while we're in town

1961
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:28,064
I'm going to try and find the best hot dog

1962
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:33,952
So personality other than were angry

1963
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:37,280
Angry Edward sensitive

1964
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:41,376
Angry and we're like please don't hit us with milk

1965
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:48,032
God dammit you got to the carwash

1966
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:49,824
On this Caravan body project

1967
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:53,408
That's indeed I think I need a day off

1968
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:55,712
So I think we will be back at the end of the week

1969
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:58,272
Week 11 episode on Friday this week

1970
01:37:58,528 --> 01:37:59,552
Because

1971
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:00,832
I also just don't take that

1972
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:02,880
Alex is going to be like back

1973
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:03,648
2

1974
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:04,416
Putting out some

1975
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:06,720
Some content that I can cover but a Time

1976
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:10,048
For Wednesday's episode or anyting

1977
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,072
Sorry guys

1978
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:12,864
Everybody out there sorry

1979
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:16,960
I don't want to cover Alex going out Tim pool I don't care

1980
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:20,288
I don't respect him pool enough to deconstruct an episode

1981
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:26,688
Of his squirrely ass people told me that Alex was on Tim pool and I was like who the f*** is Tim

1982
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:29,248
Kool-Aid why would I give a s***

1983
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:32,064
He is somewhat relevant to the world

1984
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,344
That we cover but

1985
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,112
I just

1986
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:35,904
I find him so

1987
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:37,440
Insufferable

1988
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:43,840
And also he seems like somebody who might bother me what type of guy who might email

1989
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:52,032
I don't want to wake up someday and see a notification to who wants to debate

1990
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:54,080
I just don't want to do it

1991
01:38:56,128 --> 01:39:00,224
So yeah I don't know I don't think I'm going to do that sometime in the future may be assertive they look

1992
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:03,552
Back then I have no interested

1993
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:05,600
Finding covering at the subway we might cover Rogue

1994
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:08,160
By the way what the back at the end of the week

1995
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:12,256

1999
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:33,248
I am that trucker who threw a milkshake at the due to the Caravan

2000
