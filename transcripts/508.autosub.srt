1
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge B. I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guy

2
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

3
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Nike.com

4
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:08,608
Jews

5
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,632
What's up

6
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
What's

7
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,704
But my brakes but might be a little bit busy

8
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,520
Disappointing but it's again Assassin's Creed

9
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,544
LOL

10
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,224
I've been taking my time playing a casual laid

11
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,016
About the game is

12
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,576
Without giving any spoilers or anyting

13
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,416
I find myself playing this game and

14
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,184
Haven't

15
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,208
More moral

16
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
Choices

17
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:39,328
In a lot of other games at the past

18
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,608
And part of it

19
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,936
Is there are choices that you can make

20
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:48,032
I'm almost certain will not affect the game at all

21
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:52,384
But I feel bad about

22
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:01,600
I don't know if it's just that I have not been exposed to games than to do that well in the past

23
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,416
But I feel I feel a lot more like

24
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,536
These little things that you run into what your chores around the world today

25
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:13,120
The little thing I can rip somebody off if you want to and I don't know it'll ever know but

26
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:18,240
But you'll know you will know absolutely

27
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,408
I realize like later on I just finished requested later out I was playing otherwise like

28
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,992
I feel bad about what I did to that guy

29
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,296
I think it was the right thing to do but you know what

30
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
It doesn't make me feel good

31
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:39,488
I failed the test bro

32
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:44,096
Age of calamity

33
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,912
The Hyrule Warriors

34
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,192
But I just can't

35
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:48,960
You can

36
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:53,824
Disappointed I started dabbling in a little bit because you know it's a

37
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
Can't not

38
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,712
That's what happened it happened so quick

39
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:06,112
Novice Edward a Gators

40
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:06,880
A brush

41
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,440
I just

42
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,256
I guess but my feeling Andres it's fun

43
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,792
Calamity is fun

44
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,840
And if anybody enjoys that I don't think you're wrong

45
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:21,472
I just kind of had expectations of more of a Dynasty Warriors ask game

46
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:26,848
And I just did that are that it wasn't scratch it hasn't been

47
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
For what it is

48
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,784
So I can't give it right back got to keep it on the moral choices

49
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,856
How about you

50
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:44,256
I was looking for

51
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:50,656
We we played together

52
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:54,240
But I think I'm going to get into like Cooperative board games I'm going to find all those

53
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,520
We're going to play them together it's

54
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,544
Can be fantastic

55
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,336
So I went to a board game store

56
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,128
Guy who is very very helpful

57
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,456
Knew everything about board games and card games in the assorted like

58
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,480
And I was like hey

59
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,016
I need some help

60
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,040
Getting a board game

61
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,088
I'm just starting to get into this news like okay

62
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,392
This one is super accessible

63
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,440
I called Mansions of Madness

64
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
Brought it home

65
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,047
There's like 4,000 pieces

66
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,583
Companion app

67
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,631
For a goddamn iPad

68
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,983
Damage rolls and s*** there's a whole thing on it and I was like

69
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,519
This is very exciting

70
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,311
African people

71
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,871
Play that accessible is a different

72
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:35,967
Definition but you brought it up

73
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:42,367
Play it on it like a live stream or something

74
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,927
There's a lot of fun for sure

75
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:48,511
I'm so Jordan today I got something I'm looking forward to it Matt is

76
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:53,375
A Nutty Astro about from Alex

77
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,679
December 1st and 2nd 2020 of Danza

78
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:59,007
That is

79
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:03,359
Tuesday and Wednesday of this week and I was going to

80
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
Look here

81
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:04,895
What's the deal

82
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:10,015
As I was getting this episode ready we record on Thursdays and on Thursday

83
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,783
Alex

84
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
Dropped

85
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,111
A big episode with him and Joe Rogan

86
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,903
In the Infowars Studio hours

87
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
And of course

88
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,207
This is

89
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,535
Is Verizon at the bat signal

90
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
But

91
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:27,423
It doesn't quite realize it in the same way as Alex being on Rogan show

92
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
Cuz

93
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:34,591
Probably not going to be nearly as interesting no I don't care about Joe Rogan being interviewed

94
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,967
Does he have to say that I'm going to be interested in from from alligator View

95
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:44,319
Perspective Alex's interesting 100 million.

96
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:50,719
Alex is interesting on Rogan because he's desperately trying to steal Rogan's audience

97
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,535
Impress upon them that he knows things and yet

98
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,119
He is a guru they should follow one Holloway from Joe

99
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:03,519
Turn on Infowars is not that interesting Jose Roberts

100
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,311
Austin

101
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,847
What happened were such friends

102
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
Staff

103
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,663
I don't know

104
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:13,503
Where is Alex being on Rogan requires a emerge

105
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,271
Urgency episode

106
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,319
We got to get ahead of that thing

107
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,855
I don't fuk

108
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,159
No I don't know if anyone will care

109
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:26,559
I don't think this is a tree falling in a forest and no one's there I don't know I don't know if that makes me sound

110
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,631
I'm going to listen to it

111
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:36,031
And if it's worthwhile it'll be our episode for Monday

112
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,615
I know that by the time is episode is out people

113
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,431
Might be aware of the fact that Rogan did

114
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,735
Pocketnow or episodes

115
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,855
So we'll see on that but

116
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,623
Like I said

117
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,671
Lot of fun

118
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439

119
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,743

What you could do is

146
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,231
You could gather 225 of your friends ages

147
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:35,327

00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,295
I had to get down

188
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:41,279
2 weeks

189
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
You are

190
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,167
With the documents

191
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
This is such a

192
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,799
Perfect way for Alex to do business

193
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,335
I love this so much

194
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,383
Watch because about painfully transparent

195
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:03,295
I don't need no I don't need to know what this is about or what does alleged whistleblower is claiming because I know

196
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,575
Oh how this is setup

197
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,135
Journalism

198
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,927
Know when it's being done

199
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,695
Sincerely

200
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:15,583
If there actually was a whistleblower and there actually were documented approved whatever it is they're claiming

201
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
It would be all really

202
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,143
The story

203
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,703
The document to be provided to help give credibility to

204
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,751
To the claims of The Whistleblower was making because

205
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
Otherwise it's

206
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:27,103
Just a person making claims that you aren't really able to fully assess

207
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,127
Think about it

208
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,991
In any conceivable world's can you imagine Glenn Greenwald meeting with Snowden

209
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,063
Been announcing that he has a whistleblower's ready to make a bunch of claim

210
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,135
And if anybody challenges them that's when the documents

211
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:45,535
I think it's a great idea how you keep it in your plus two bag of holding until you need it on set

212
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:51,423
Never would have acted like that because they had documents that didn't help them

213
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,191
Without knowing

214
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:58,591
Anything about this whistleblower or the claims I refuse to believe that anyone would behave this way unless this was an incredibly

215
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,359
Desperate block

216
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,663
If we are telling something

217
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,295
If we are challenged what does that even mean

218
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:13,695
Hey what are you talkin about that you have a story you'd never hold back the thing that Pro

219
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,767
Proves your story promising to release it only if you have to

220
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,815
Schoolyard bully or

221
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,863
Entry-level extortionist shitt

222
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:27,263
I will tell you guys about deepthroat the moment someone asks but until then you just got to believe it

223
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,311
Harley against Alex's entire career

224
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,591
Guiding principle

225
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:35,967
He's often told guests that if they have information they have to get it all out or else they're putting themselves at risk

226
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
Alex

227
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,039
Constantly says that his guests.

228
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,183
He doesn't want to have secret information that other people know he has

229
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,231
Since that's when things get dangerous

230
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,791
Exactly knowing Secrets is okay

231
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,351
And it's too late once you've already spilled a secret

232
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,935
But having people know that you know a secret and that you have

233
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,983
Said anything puts a Target on your back

234
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
Dangerous this is

235
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,543
The Gate of gates all over again

236
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,383
This is exactly what happened back in 2011 when Alex interviewed Bob Chapman

237
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,711
Bob implied that he had secret Intel on Ronald Reagan which Alex

238
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,015
Insisted he needed to stay on here now because

239
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,295
Said that he had

240
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,623
The secret and he was in danger if he didn't get it out in the open

241
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,927
Bob said that he'd seen a video of Reagan get

242
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,743
Pigs and Alex got weird out disappointed that it wasn't

243
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,767
Something more communists

244
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,607
Getting on are insanely as proof Hill produce is pushed

245
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,143
Connie's

246
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,447
Talk to Alex's entire careers methodology

247
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:35,615
It's not enough that much way really sadly broken idiot trying to Bluff it as a bombshell story that's actually a dud and

248
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:43,295
I could tell you that without knowing any other thing about where this this clip goes

249
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,111
Show me Reagan getting pegged and then I'll believe you

250
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
The end

251
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,463
I was like alright

252
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,791
Give a s*** like you could have said he could have said anything afterwards

253
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,583
And I would have been disappointed cuz

254
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,191
If you start by saying like we have all the proof and if the Brian stelter

255
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,007
Tries to get mouthy with me

256
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,799
At least the proof I'll do it

257
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,383
No will then why not release it now

258
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
Right

259
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,455
Dizzy your dress that at all

260
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:16,575
Why she's waiting for someone

261
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:21,439
He likes to set traps

262
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,535
This is about

263
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,327
You think you can guess

264
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,375
Do I think I can guess what

265
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:33,471
The Whistleblower have been Sunday night

266
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,263
Monday night

267
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,919
I want to say it's got something to do with Michigan

268
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
Okay

269
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,479
That's interesting

270
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,111
Executive

271
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,671
35 Hospital

272
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
Network

273
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
Western

274
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,999
Purple

275
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,791
Is exposing the fact

276
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,351
Covid-19

277
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,911
Grab

278
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,471
We receive this information

279
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,711
Yeah I was surprised too I really thought the

280
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,319
Russian religion

281
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,415
Kind of forgot that Alex is spinning multiple plates

282
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,975
See I was I was caught on my on the back

283
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,279
Keto as they say when is I go this is

284
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,839
The covid thing

285
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:35,935
It's almost kind of ridiculous that people are still denying covid

286
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:43,103
I mean it's almost convert it's insanely ridiculous ridiculous before but it seems like

287
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,175
This isn't what the season is on your show Alex

288
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:52,575
It seems like this is

289
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,647
How old were doing

290
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:59,743
He gets to talk about this with a blower here and this is

291
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:00,767
Kind of

292
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,559
I don't think I believe this

293
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,423
Hospital Network

294
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,215
UPMC

295
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,543
UPMC stands for the University of

296
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,383
Pittsburgh medical center and the network actually includes more than 35

297
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:23,295
Their website includes 36 Hospital campuses but they also have a satellite hospitals around that they manage but you know that

298
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,319
Included in the network

299
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:28,927
The bottom line about UPMC is it a giant entity

300
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:35,327
Their board of directors and executive team are all publicly listed and I would definitely try and track down who Alex is talking about but I

301
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,375
I'm sure it's not someone on that level and

302
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,143
I just

303
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,543
I started to listen to this unlike you got these documents you're never going to f****** produce you going to forget this even happened in a week

304
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,823
I'm not going to

305
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,407
Amplify the disappointment by trying to figure out which name on this

306
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,711
List you're trying to allude to

307
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:58,367
Not going to read the the chicken bones that I've thrown down on the ground I think you should have

308
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,647
To ignore that entirely

309
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,927
He has is before

310
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,999
For you to engage with it he must produce one

311
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,535
That you can research

312
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,863
Otherwise he's trying to get around you specifically

313
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:14,239
I've gone I've gone so far as to find a list of names of the people he's pretending this is and that's good enough

314
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,007
For me

315
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:18,591
Yeah that's it that's too much work your giving him too much credit

316
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,383
Well that's actually here with this

317
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,199
Almost certainly fake person

318
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,807
The latest so-called surge

319
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:32,415
Covid-19

320
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,791
Around 600

321
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,167
For covid-19 hospitals

322
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,703
Wide open

323
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:54,175
Most patients stayed overnight for observation because they tested positive

324
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:59,551
Media will say hospitalization patients have surged over 600%

325
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:04,927
Pasta spinach

326
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,207
It is a fake test

327
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,511
First of the time

328
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:14,911
Salik is reading also a bit of an Infowars article there but he's also just making up a lot of stuff and throwing it

329
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,311
Here are the parts of that clip that do not even appear in the Infowars article about this whistleblower

330
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,359
Resume Alex is just

331
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:27,711
Saying these things to try and apply your associate that with the Whistleblower

332
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,991
Just incredibly respond

333
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:33,855
This whistleblower article says nothing about anyone saying all the hospitals are overwhelmed

334
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:40,511
The circumstances would obviously be different to different areas where there are varying rates of infection that lead to hospitals

335
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,071
Canonbury mobiles of available medical resources

336
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,631
This article does not say that this

337
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,911
600 beds represent

338
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,191
What's 10% of the hospitals

339
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:48,959
Capacity

340
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:54,847
According to the American Hospital directory the hospitals that are listed as part of UPMC

341
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:58,175
7371 bed

342
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:03,295
But the number of excited in the blurbs that some that I can find about the network r8000 which

343
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,343
Think it's probably reasonable

344
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,415
Actually be less than 10% of their capacity but

345
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,975
It's kind of a meeting with statistic to discuss this way

346
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,791
As we don't really have any information about

347
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,815
The distribution

348
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,399
Gallup the needed bet ya don't know where the beds are

349
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,447
Mary's Hospital

350
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,007
Nor do we know how many of these bags are icub

351
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,567
Is there Airborne Airborne isolation pets

352
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:32,223
According to triblive as of November 20th there were 17% of a lability on the ladder bed type

353
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,271
Which is enough to worry

354
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
People

355
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,135
This is not something we could be easily captured by simple statistic

356
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,183
That's what I was just trying to do it just

357
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
Also

358
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,255
In addition to the article

359
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:49,631
Not in there the percent of there but I don't know if he's making that up

360
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,399
Or

361
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:54,751
I don't know it doesn't appear to be a blower

362
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,287
Ask for the no deaths

363
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,103
Spring among the 600 hospitalized individuals

364
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,151
I would be interested in seeing proof of that

365
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,735
Pittsburgh is in Allegheny County and on Tuesday

366
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,343
18 people died with covid-19 in the account

367
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:12,671
UPMC as hospitals and other counties to which

368
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,695
Also have

369
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,463
Stardust

370
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:21,119
I just don't know anything about this client and I just would need to see whatever documents Alex's with

371
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:27,519
Challenger the only thing you can do I'm not MSM but okay we

372
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,567
Challenge you to produce the documents

373
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,895
All I have

374
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,663
Stop

375
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:38,527
The stuff about the test being turned up 45 times does not appear in the article about this whistleblower

376
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,599
It seems to be at Alex's putting words in their mouth

377
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,927
Similar things I could say about the nonsense about the German

378
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:51,071
What Alex is boring supposed whistleblower claim and then ripping on it to make it

379
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:51,839
Etsy more bombs

380
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:59,007
If you read the actual article on this all the person appears to be claiming is that the hospitalization in the UPMC cyst

381
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,567
What up from 96 to 600 beds

382
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:05,407
They were occupied during this last. It's being characterized as a server

383
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:09,247
No specific data is given about these patients just that quote

384
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,831
Patients were kept in observation overnight and no deaths resulted

385
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,903
This is nonspecific to the point of being meaningless

386
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,280
Pennsylvania has a database where you can find all the information about county-level hospital bed availability

387
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,096
Give you a sense of the picture if you want

388
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,144
You're the last available report

389
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,680
In the entirety of the state

390
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,752
There are 4290 adult ICU beds

391
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:31,776
Total

392
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,056
Of those

393
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,104
695 are available

394
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,128
Which is 16 /

395
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,992
This is not to me there's other

396
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,296
At the other statistics to that you want but there's one

397
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,600
There's 16% of ICU beds

398
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,624
Are available

399
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
In

400
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,672
The entire State events

401
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,720
I can't stress this enough

402
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,536
This is not a whistleblower delivering meaningful information

403
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,352
And if you read on through the Infowars article about this

404
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,144
You can see what's going on

405
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,960
If you start with five patients

406
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:04,800
225 domini will say there's a 500% increase in cases

407
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,592
Sounds terrifying right

408
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:11,200
This article is essentially in force trying to explain how numbers work to Their audience

409
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,784
Suspicious about percentage sign

410
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:20,928
Sure a 600% increase sound scary but it couldn't be like 20 more people who cares

411
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,464
It's no big deal

412
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,744
But

413
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,048
This line of argumentation is really not good

414
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,120
Because I jumped from five cases somewhere 225 Wood

415
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,912
Definitely be a bad sign

416
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,496
Harborview remember with a numbers were like early on

417
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,056
In the car Coronavirus

418
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,104
Jump like that

419
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,872
In February

420
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,432
People with B would rightly have been worried about it

421
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,784
And if you're in a small-town let's say that has five cases right now

422
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:53,184
And tomorrow there's 25 that would be a big deal to real problem Community transmission

423
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:59,328
What else is attempting to do here is make this reality of rising covid cases and hospitalizations not worried his audience

424
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,144
By taking the numbers and shrinking them

425
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,960
It's baffling really because even for Alec

426
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,776
This is a little insulting to his audience is intelligence

427
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,592
This is him banging on them not

428
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,360
Feeling

429
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,920
To buy bringing a fake whistleblower

430
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,968
Explain how percentages work

431
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:20,576
It's really Elementary stuff and it's kind of degrading like it

432
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,624
Speak highly of his audience either

433
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,208
But this isn't hey if you only take the first like

434
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,768
Few little bits of a logarithmic

435
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:35,168
Scale it looks not scary at all it's the last part of the parabola if you just ignore the last part of the parabola where to go

436
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,728
Real fast

437
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,776
Yeah

438
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:45,152
Number to worry about 500% increase could be 125

439
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,016
A lot more

440
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,392
I do I don't even know what kind of like

441
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,184
Alright charade is beating

442
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,464
Alright let's start here

443
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,256
If you multiply 2 by 2

444
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,792
That's it that's so much

445
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:08,192
But that's only for an interview multiply that by 2 that seems like a lot but that's only if you multiply that by 2

446
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,520
That is quite a bit more then if you multiply that by 22 32

447
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,848
That its 64 and there's 128

448
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:20,224
So Alex keeps on going

449
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,248
Eisenhower gets attacked

450
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,528
The idea of

451
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,296
Testing

452
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,416
You see the big reports about the famous females

453
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:32,512
In your blood incredible in dollars

454
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,560
Call Campbell

455
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,352
What does PCR stand for

456
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,168
Instead

457
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,752
So a couple things real quick

458
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,568
Kary Mullis the inventor of the PCR test

459
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,848
Died on August 7th

460
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,872
2019

461
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,176
He did not come out and say anything

462
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,456
About the PCR test

463
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,992
Covid-19 being a fraud

464
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,528
Pictures of Alex is trying to

465
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,296
Reply

466
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,320
So here is

467
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,136
The clip the Alex immediately after plays

468
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
ComEd

469
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,440
Gary Mullis Ismay

470
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,536
Find this virus in you at all

471
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,840
The PCR if you do it well you can talk

472
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,400
Find almost anything and anybody

473
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:16,800
Start making you believe in the assertive Buddhist notion that everything is contained and everything else right I mean

474
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,104
A play one single molecule

475
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,920
202 something that you can really measure

476
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:28,320
VCR can do then there's very few molecules that you don't have at least one thing

477
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:32,160
One of them in your body I'll get you

478
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,440
Clean that is Meaningful

479
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,000
The entire clip that Alex plays

480
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,072
This comment is out of contacts

481
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,096
It's from aquest

482
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,424
Question and answer session that Mullis did about using PCR test

483
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,240
Thing to detect HIV back in 1993

484
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:49,824
A lot of the stuff sounds applicable to the current pandemic

485
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,104
But it's really not

486
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:57,504
I got the most damning you can make this quote out to be is to understand maybe Malin

487
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,088
Mullis was expressing that this form of test is it good for determining

488
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,648
The quantity of something in somebody

489
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,928
Rather it detects the presence

490
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,952
Your absence

491
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,280
It's important to understand

492
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,816
In the context of these comment

493
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,096
So you was making though because

494
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:16,704
It sounds like what he's saying is that if you look at people you can find any disease on them

495
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,472
That's not

496
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:20,288
The case he's talking about HIV patients

497
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,848
Simply about how do you have that virus

498
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,616
There's a good chance

499
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,432
You may have others and maybe many other

500
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:30,272
He literally says that almost exactly after we're Alex

501
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,296
Cuts the clip off

502
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:38,208
Is that you don't need to test for HIV you don't need to test for the other 10,000 retroviruses that are unknown

503
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,000
Also in the subject

504
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,792
Somebody's got HIV

505
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:45,120
General is going to have almost anything that you can test for

506
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:48,448
Because they have definitely been hiv's a fairly rare

507
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,216
Virus

508
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:55,616
At the beginning of Alex's clip Mullis says if they find this virus in you at all with PCR if you do it well

509
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,664
You can find almost anything and anybody

510
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:02,272
It's selectively edited to make it sound like Melissa saying that using PCR doctor

511
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,064
Kristen find any virus in anyone

512
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,600
Contacts

513
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
Text which Alex

514
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,648
Deprives the audience of

515
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:13,536
Clear that the virus that he's referring to it so he says if they can find this virus in you at all

516
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,328
He's talking about HIV

517
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,912
Contention that if you can find Hy-Vee in a person

518
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,960
His contention is that you can find

519
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,752
Most viruses

520
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,848
Also not to get too far off track here but Kary Mullis

521
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,152
Do the inventor of PCR testing

522
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:32,480
He's not someone who's remembered super well in the field of HIV and AIDS

523
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,016
As he was a denial

524
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,576
Conclusion that the HIV

525
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,112
Causes AIDS

526
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:44,768
The point is relevant to our situation though today is that Alex's clip that he's using of Mullis to Tech the use of PCR

527
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,048
For covid-19 testing

528
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,840
He's completely out of context and doesn't

529
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,608
Don't mean anything

530
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:54,752
The complaint that Alex is making about PCR testing here isn't covid-19 specifically

531
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,032
Ucr's a testing method

532
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,592
And he's expecting the audience to believe that the

533
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:01,152
The inventor of PCR testing

534
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:07,552
Who won a Nobel prize for the discovery headset

535
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,600
Haha it's a little bit rich

536
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,904
He said that after he got the Nobel

537
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:18,560
I don't think I don't think part of your campaign for the Nobel is honestly this thing doesn't do s*** at all

538
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:25,984
I'd like to thank

539
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,776
The Nobel board for being so

540
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,088
He didn't tell me that the videos from 93

541
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,160
Why don't you tell me anything about any testing

542
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:44,928
Like

543
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:49,792
43 years old

544
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:53,888
Then I don't know if I can use I don't care yet

545
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,960
Yes and no

546
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:03,360
Perfect is not like the way anybody should live their lives but if you're talkin about PCR testing in 2020 versus

547
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,944
Something that I said it before the iPhone happened

548
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,480
I kind of think I don't care

549
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,504
Sure you know

550
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,272
Yeah

551
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,576
If you are using science from

552
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:17,440
Grunge was King

553
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,464
Since then

554
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,280
Yeah it's Counting Crows work

555
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:25,632
Cool what does science method around I'm not interested

556
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:32,032
It's a long November Alex's playing this is November

557
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:37,152
Thanks buddy

558
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,248
Alex is playing this special report

559
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,040
He just cuts off in the middle of it

560
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:48,160
Medical doctors

561
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:57,120
For what what do they want to use the hysteria for

562
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,400
I was overwhelmed

563
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:04,288
Because episode started with him talking about this giant whistleblower who has the documents of he'll be revealed

564
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:08,384
If anybody flexes and then just cuts off in the middle of like wait a second

565
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,408
Maybe that wasn't

566
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,176
Important

567
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:16,064
I guess that's a little bit like he didn't care about that

568
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,928
You got Nobel Prize my friend

569
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,328
All right for the show.

570
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,376
Bratayley supposed take that seriously

571
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,168
Sure there is whistleblower

572
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:35,520
In the middle because Alex finally showed up to the office

573
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,800
Sure he was busy

574
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:40,128
I have been preparing this broadcast since 6 a.m.

575
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,152
Damn this morning

576
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:48,576
The news is so massive so over-the-top so dangerous

577
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,344
Transmission

578
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:57,024
Yeah so okay Alex had to take the response minutes off because he was so busy work

579
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,328
Snooze 6 a.m.

580
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:05,728
You so busy distract me with another gigantica

581
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:10,080
We can't spend any time because this other stories the biggest news ever

582
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,360
Talked about

583
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,152
Things that project Veritas is broken

584
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,432
He talked about things

585
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,480
Carlton

586
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,016
All of which are the world

587
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:21,088
When they do big things to set a broken the biggest thing

588
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,392
Just about credit

589
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,928
But I have to tell you

590
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,256
We are breaking information on this show today

591
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,304
That is the biggest thing

592
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,096
Ever

593
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,120
Broken

594
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,192
Concerning this fraudulent election 1/2

595
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:39,264
Alex has the number one okay biggest

596
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,568
Go to bed James O'Keefe

597
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,384
But I really feel like the whole Germany's courts

598
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,432
Invalidating all testing

599
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,712
As 96

600
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:50,784
I think that's a boy bigger story than any Alexa

601
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,136
There are people dying around the world millions of them I mean Alex

602
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,440
Would make that argument on another day

603
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:02,560
But he was like

604
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,608
Everything is going

605
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,400
Really crazy

606
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,168
On the 1st

607
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,704
Stop

608
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,472
You know

609
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,520
Trump's attorney

610
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,312
Linwood is going

611
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:16,384
Baddie talking about. Trump going to declare martial law

612
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,944
Doing great lawyers that's what you want

613
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,224
Sidney Powell

614
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,040
And ends

615
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:29,440
Buckwild are fantastic I'm glad they're getting paid a lot of money

616
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,208
Stuff is happening

617
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,232
So I was

618
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:36,608
I'm sure what this big news Alex had to break was

619
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:39,168
This clip incredibly Charming

620
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,472
Let me just drop it on you right now

621
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,288
Dot-com live show feed headline

622
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,848
Must watch Tuesday live

623
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,200
Okay

624
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,480
Warriors

625
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,576
Declare martial law

626
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,880
I want just one

627
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:00,928
Typo

628
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,376
That's my point about that

629
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,984
But I appreciate it. That's that's how he knows that he did that

630
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,312
Yeah I know but that was his typo

631
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,408
Please

632
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,176
Makeup smile

633
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:25,248
If it was if it was someone else's fault

634
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,784
Kill Everybody

635
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:31,136
Not mad was

636
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,696
There's some kind of quaint about Justin being like

637
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,232
A typo there

638
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:41,632
Yeah that is a small refreshing human moments when you like you know what at least you got that

639
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:44,960
Get on Erin talk about how it actually is really

640
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,752
Cool that Trump is being told

641
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,544
Declare martial law

642
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,336
I should have typed matopos

643
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:56,992
It's like when a tweet goes viral in and out of typos in a blackout

644
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,272
Take it back

645
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:02,112
Been screenshotted that's interesting cuz you you're talkin about this human moment

646
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,208
One of the things that made this episode

647
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,768
And the content we were going to get into

648
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,048
Particularly like

649
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,096
I don't know

650
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,144
Elevated to me a little bit

651
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,936
Is there a little bit of pesos

652
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:22,336
In here there's a little bit like I don't I don't want to make you or the audience or anybody feel any kind of pain

653
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,152
Empathy for Alex

654
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,200
You know

655
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,248
As an actor in this world at all

656
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,064
I think that there's a there's a

657
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,344
The point in this

658
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,648
December 1st episode where are you

659
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,416
Book feel like

660
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,976
God damn this is sad

661
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:44,608
Hey we all still appreciate Macbeth he wasn't a good guy but we can feel the pesos of his choices

662
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:49,984
Sure Prejudice episode

663
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,264
And it all begins

664
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,288
And it's next

665
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,080
Then there's this story

666
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,128
Tired

667
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,176
Security firm

668
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,016
Another garage

669
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,576
When I was

670
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,600
Bye

671
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,392
The White House

672
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:15,072
Into Dominion

673
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,216
We checked it with the SEC confirmed it

674
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:21,984
2 days ago

675
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,336
Tom

676
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,896
Dominion voting systems

677
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,248
The Chinese government

678
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,272
Before election

679
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:40,928
Scandals there's a lot going on in there and I really enjoyed it cuz this

680
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,744
It's been awhile

681
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,792
Conspiracy I could dig into okay okay good

682
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,816
Apparently

683
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,608
The company that owns Dominion

684
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,144
A bunch of money

685
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,680
From the Chinese government

686
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,448
Or something

687
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:53,728
Resume

688
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:58,336
It kind of cases the first thing I like to do is I like to go to Infowars

689
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:00,896
And see what the Articles they're actually say

690
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,944
And actually this was an instance

691
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:06,016
Literally unlike any that I think I've ever encountered

692
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,808
And that's because this

693
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:11,392
Article includes links to 5 PDF documents

694
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,208
There are apparently used to prove their case

695
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,024
5

696
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,792
5

697
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,584
I've never seen one link

698
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,376
Two Zero Hedge

699
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,912
I've never seen embedded

700
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,704
Lights on.

701
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,728
Crazy

702
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,360
Four of them are apparently SEC documents that Evie following disclaimer on top of them in big letters

703
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:37,504
We we we we were recognized

704
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:44,160
The Securities and Exchange Commission has not necessarily review the information in this filing and is not determined if it's accurate income

705
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:48,512
Complete the reader should not assume that the information is accurate and complete

706
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:52,352
I don't hear any difference between what you read and what I said

707
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:55,680
Yeah they're very similar

708
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,216
So that's four of them

709
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:57,984
And the fifth

710
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,032
Is a link that goes to a Reuters article

711
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:04,128
Great terms of documents

712
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:07,200
But there was another problem that immediately jumped out at night

713
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:09,504
The article begins with this sentence

714
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,528
Quote

715
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:15,904
An investigation into SEC filings has revealed that the firm which owns Dominion voting systems

716
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,744
Received 400 million dollars from a Swiss bank with close links

717
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,048
Do the Chinese government less than a month

718
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:22,816
Before the election

719
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,656
And that clip we just heard Alex said that the White House had

720
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,472
Hume to look into this 3 weeks ago

721
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,776
How many hired a firm to do the research

722
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,848
Where'd all falls apart is there

723
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:38,944
There's an editor's note at the end of the article

724
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,968
The thing

725
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:43,296
A previous version of this article incorrectly credited

726
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,112
Particular research for a performing this investigation

727
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:50,720
Information was erroneous and this article has been updated to correct that

728
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:56,096
We apologize for the confusion research firm was not involved whatsoever

729
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,216
It definitely indicates

730
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:01,984
Problem

731
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:08,384
An archived copy of this article from before the correction credits the investigation to quote Austin security and

732
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,408
Navigation solution

733
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,200
This is a real company

734
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,504
Based on their website they don't appear to be

735
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,272
Research firm

736
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,296
They're more like

737
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,856
What kind of people you get to do an unofficial Steak-Out

738
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,648
Outdoor help you make court file day

739
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,928
Maybe like

740
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:27,328
When Alex had people following his wife around also sells Nanny cams if you're

741
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:35,776
Some stuff for him in like freelance investigation

742
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:38,080
Hard-boiled

743
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:42,176
The only thing I can conclude is that either Alex is making up

744
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:45,760
That some group did this research to make it seem more official

745
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:49,088
He needed this company's help to find SEC filings

746
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:52,160
Arrived at

747
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,976
Benny told him keep our name off this s***

748
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,512
I'm not going to dress

749
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,560
Be reality or falsity

750
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,840
Of any of the claims

751
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,400
About this conspiracy wildlife

752
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:05,216
Explain it to you for the sake of simplicity

753
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,496
According to Alex

754
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:09,312
Dominion is owned by a company called Staples Street

755
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,080
Capital

756
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:12,384
This group received 400 million dollars

757
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,176
From a company called UBS Sakura

758
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,992
UBS Securities is a Swiss invest

759
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:21,344
My back that also owns a company called UBS Securities Company Limited

760
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:24,416
Which is an investment Bank caters to the Chinese market

761
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:27,488
UBS owned approximately 25% of the

762
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,768
This Chinese Investment Bank

763
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,840
With the Chinese government being the other owner

764
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,608
Through

765
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,888
Number of other entity

766
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,216
Conspiracy here is that the

767
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,496
Parent company of

768
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:44,896
Dominion got some money from a Swiss Investment Bank which also owns a separate bank which the Chinese government is

769
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:49,760
We invested up even if every step of this is true and no one screwed up or fudge

770
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,040
Any of the details

771
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,320
It still doesn't prove any

772
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,368
This is not a meaningful connect

773
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,904
Between Dominion in China

774
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,440
Unfortunately

775
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,976
Someone screwed up or fudge

776
00:39:59,232 --> 00:39:59,744
What's the details

777
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,280
41

778
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:06,912
This article on Infowars claims that Staple Street Capital quota choir Dominion voting systems in 2018

779
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,960
This is kind of a site

780
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,496
On July

781
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:13,568
16th 2018 it was announced that Dominion voting systems quote

782
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:17,152
Has been acquired by its management team and Staples Street Capital

783
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,456
This is partially an acquisition

784
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:25,856
But not in the same way as them like outright buying Dominion was more like a partnering in it

785
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:29,184
The merger + Capital kind of mix

786
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:31,744
Second

787
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,792
Second the article mentions

788
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,072
The quote on October 8th

789
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:38,144
2020 Staple Street Capital filed SEC form

790
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,168
D offering

791
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,496
And sales amount of 400 million dollars with the

792
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:45,056
Sales compensation recipients identified as

793
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,080
UBS securities

794
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:52,992
This is meant to imply that UBS Securities paid Staples Street 400 million dollars to use Dominion to steal the election

795
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,528
The reality

796
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:58,880
Is it form D with the SEC is used to report on the sale of security

797
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:05,792
I hate to sound like I don't think 400 million dollars is a lot of money but when you're in the investment Market it's not

798
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,328
Really that much to accompany

799
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,608
Like Staples Street

800
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:11,168
It's definitely not enough to pay them to rig

801
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:11,936
F****** election

802
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,752
That's a comically low amount for that kind of work

803
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:18,080
And also I would assume they do the payoff more than a month

804
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,104
Before the election

805
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:25,504
Teams teams wear timing I don't know about that these people get bribed I keep finding them

806
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:29,856
Taking so little amounts of money for like the most

807
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:35,488
I could actually buy somebody only getting four hundred million to steal and

808
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,840
20 trillion dollars everyday

809
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:44,448
See these people do while we stole 50 million dollars and I got paid 50

810
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:47,264
Grand to my re-election fund like that's what they do

811
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,288
Thursday

812
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:51,104
I think the way you're talkin about is sort of the you like

813
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:53,919
Boilerplate blase corruption

814
00:41:54,943 --> 00:42:01,087
I'm not stealing election okay that might be a bigger thing that I'm really throwing it out as

815
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,135
Sometimes payoffs

816
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,415
For like corrupt

817
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,463
I doing business

818
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,487
Kind of thing

819
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:13,887
Might not be the size that you'd imagine a pretty big f****** height

820
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:17,471
More likely this was a payment from UBS securities

821
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,519
For purchase purchasing some equity

822
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,567
Of Investments that are held by Staples

823
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:26,687
This doesn't seem to be the case until the form that Alex likes to from the ICC it says that this is

824
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,455
Equity

825
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,991
Pooled investment

826
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:29,759
Van dinter

827
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:35,135
The third problem is probably the one that requires the least fact-checking but also is the biggest

828
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:35,903
Just problem

829
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,183
Alex Woods

830
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,999
It confuses audience and readers about the entities UPS

831
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,559
Securities and UBS Securities company limit

832
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,119
UBS Securities is the one that bought

833
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,911
Securities from Staples Street

834
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,447
And that's the Swiss invest

835
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:55,359
UBS Securities Company Limited is the Chinese Investment Bank co-owned by the Chinese government and UBS

836
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,383
Securities

837
00:42:56,895 --> 00:43:03,039
UBS Securities Company Limited did not buy Securities from Staples street but because the names are so similar Alex wants the audience

838
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,575
To come away with that impression

839
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:10,975
That the entity that is the one that's giving the 400 million that's not the case at all

840
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:12,255
This is why

841
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,047
Conclusion to this article is

842
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:14,815
Just on Earth

843
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:22,239
The Revelation that Dominion voting systems has Financial ties to the Chinese government via UBS Securities will bolster claims

844
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,263
Trump supporters

845
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:28,639
Set up for and actors working on behalf of communist China may have sought to meddle in the presidential election

846
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,663
And help Joe Biden

847
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:32,479
None of that is demonstrated by the evidence provided

848
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,551
This is all just paper-thin b******* Alex is trying to pass off

849
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,575
As a Smoking Gun

850
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,111
Also

851
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,647
I hate

852
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,439
Crash Alex's parade here

853
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,719
Or rain on it

854
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,767
And crashes party simultaneously

855
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:47,071
But the story was not broken by Infowars

856
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,911
Did a post about it an article on December 1st and good for them

857
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,703
Unfortunately that's exact

858
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:56,287
Conspiracy using the exact same PDF files from the SEC that Alex

859
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,055
It's like two

860
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,847
Qanon Twitter

861
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:05,247
Where is early as November 29th there we go around like he's late for the show cuz of breaking news

862
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:08,319
The f****** basil qanon.pub

863
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:12,927
Alex is just taking bulshit qanon conspiracies one of his intern fines online

864
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,743
Emily's pretending that it's the product of an investigation

865
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:16,767
He hired a

866
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:17,791
Broom to do

867
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:18,815
Because the White House

868
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:19,839
Ask him to

869
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:23,423
This is a pathetic level of insincerity and Griff

870
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,983
When you actually realize what Alex is doing

871
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,775
Becomes really disgusting to think about

872
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,823
He as a person

873
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,615
Knows that the White House didn't

874
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,151
Ask him to do this investigation

875
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:35,455
He knows that he didn't pay Austin

876
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,759
Security and investigation Solutions

877
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,039
Define these.

878
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:42,111
That's the backstory that he needs

879
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:45,439
To create to make himself look like a big strong boy

880
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,463
For his audience

881
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,535
But you might as well just be reading your crazy uncle's Facebook pay

882
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,583
Like it's really

883
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:58,239
Gross to think about like he knows what he's doing yeah being in that moment where you're so sad

884
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,031
Do you have to take qanon posts

885
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,311
And pretended

886
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,847
The f****** White House

887
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:03,871
Peju

888
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:04,895
Corinne sister

889
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:12,319
Who's the bravest around you're the only person who can get this information out until we need you to do it

890
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:18,207
Deep in my pockets and I paid the best researchers to find these SEC filings

891
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,487
CVS phone number

892
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
Qanon

893
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,535
People f*** out of here

894
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,839
It's so sad

895
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,631
Halo that week

896
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,655
In that moment

897
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,703
It's amazing

898
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:33,823
He's a little bit like the America's Funniest Home Videos of

899
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,591
Wednesday

900
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,383
Q world now you know where like

901
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,151
He take

902
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:40,223
He takes stuff that you could find on the internet into second

903
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,759
Cancel it went around yesterday

904
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:47,391
And packages it in for people who only watch TV

905
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,671
I got these

906
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:51,487
From the f****** Chairman Mao himself

907
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:57,887
You stumbled onto actually a really good metaphor and it's why America's

908
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:00,447

Is driver whatever

911
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,591
That wasn't that

912
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,615
Great because

913
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:10,175
They exist you could find those videos.

914
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,199
Aqua Net

00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,735
America's Funniest Home Videos on

916
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:19,135
That was the only game just like Alex said yeah there was a time but then the internet there was a time when he was the only person

917
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,927
Could provide you with a hot shot

918
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:27,327
America's Funniest Home Videos falling over

919
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,863
Add place that Alex Jones exec

Brutal

921
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:34,495
That means qanon is

922
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:42,431
Just might actually be killed

923
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,967
So Alex

924
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:47,551
Secrets

925
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,343
Yeah they were

926
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,415
Describe the family

927
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:54,463
Cabal

928
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:59,071
What about Christopher

929
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,119
So Alex

930
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:01,887
Is

931
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,191
This story is not

932
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:04,959
Good

933
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:05,983
It doesn't work

934
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,287
The proof that he has doesn't backup

935
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:11,615
The claims like these documents don't

936
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,151
Chode nefariousness

937
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,175
To the level that he's

938
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:14,943
He's implying

939
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:18,015
And it's all just stuff used to cribbing from qanon

940
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,039
And he just

941
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,855
Won't Give Up This charade that he's on

942
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:26,207

System is fighting in

945

It's hard to make sure it does not get out to anybody

946
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:39,775
Common owns Dominion voting systems received

947
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,591
400 million from Swiss bank

948
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,151
Wii connection to Chinese government

949
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,431
Before election

950
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,479
Samantha

951
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,271

Alex is going over the story is interesting cuz I guess he hasn't got

954
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,439
The memo

955
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,975
Investigation

956
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:04,351
Austin security and investigation Solutions centers on Staples Street

957
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:09,983
I hope you won't have to give an apology publicly to Atherton security

958
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,287
Solutions

959
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:18,687
Yeah I wonder if they have anything with your b*******

960
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:23,807
Wonder if they're thrilled about that

961
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:24,831
I wonder

962
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:28,415
I would do a half maybe checked in on it but I don't like

963
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,695
To stir the pot

964
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,231
Alex

965
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:34,047
He's going over the story to like you just

966
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,839
Like the story sucks

967
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:36,863
It doesn't work

968
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:40,191
It sucks even more cuz he just makes up

969
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,215
Conclusions

970
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,263
The real headline is

971
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:48,127
Chinese communist government caught laundering 400 million through Swiss bank

972
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,943
Month before election

973
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:00,671
You got me there I can't hear it any other way than it being out

974
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,463
The kind of being impressed with himself

975
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:09,631
Look at this s*** this sounds real we got 5 PDF

976
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:15,007
Don't believe anything in these but

977
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,287
And I went down a hill

978
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,103
I lost control of the bike

979
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,127
And

980
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:25,503
I was able to get a shoulder down on my way down and I ended up rolling

981
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,527
And I got like

982
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:33,183
It was one of the coolest things that no one else saw more or less like I had meant to do

983
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:37,279
Acrobatic moves

984
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:40,607
It was all just a landing exactly

985
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,655
Exactly how I needed

986
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:49,055
Rollover and then sort of be on my feet just woke up in the gymnast pose like bowing

987
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,847
To the judges that aren't there yeah

988
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:57,503
It does have a little bit of sap

989
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:01,087
I proved

990
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,879
A little bit like

991
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,951
The first time you throw a rolled-up

992
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,999
Piece of paper into a garbage can

993
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,303
In the office from a ways away and everybody's

994
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,071
Is it in your life

995
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:15,679
Wow this always happens when no one's looking holyshit I got this one

996
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,471
For Alex like

997
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,775
Everyone who's in the studio is like

998
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:22,591
Good

999
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,127
Anyways

1000
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:26,175
This is so sad

1001
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:28,991
To me like I understand

1002
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,039
I can I can

1003
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,319
See the audience

1004
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,087
Our audience

1005
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:35,391
Everyone's laughing at Alex

1006
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:38,207
You for it because I'm

1007
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,999
Overly invested

1008
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:44,351
This sort of like this story I read

1009
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:49,727
Just so sad to me to see this guy who knows that he's lying

1010
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:56,383
About himself lying about why you should be in Prescott

1011
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:58,175
This is so cool

1012
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:58,943
Gross

1013
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,991
Put on the lead of this

1014
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,807
Buy a very high-level individual in the White House

1015
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:07,647
Why me I said look we already know it's there

1016
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,927
Detach be independent

1017
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,207
You need to go find it

1018
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,999
So I hired a security firm

1019
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,535
I told him dig

1020
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:16,607
Call confirm

1021
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,399
Like he has to

1022
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,423
Create this this

1023
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,983
Cool spy novel where the White House

1024
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:25,823
It's like you're there all that you're independent this got to come from the outside

1025
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:28,127
What the f*** it sounds like

1026
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:28,895
Road at 4

1027
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:34,015
So the White House came to me and

1028
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,319
And told me to investigate things

1029
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:40,159
And this is what showed up I can tell you that Steve didn't

1030
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:43,231
Okay because Steve does show up later and Alex

1031
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:45,279
Bring some of this up to him and

1032
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:49,631
Steve's really got it

1033
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:50,911
But some

1034
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:55,519
Steve's got his bags of Steve Ishq person perhaps

1035
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,287
Meow meow

1036
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,335
I don't know what

1037
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,359
The deal is or like

1038
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:00,895
Piano

1039
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,175
Obviously

1040
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:05,503
This came from like qanon posts

1041
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,527
Online

1042
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,807
Conspiracy

1043
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,575
Nonsense

1044
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,367
Galaxy

1045
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:13,951
Is the basis for Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan character

1046
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:16,511
Pathetic mess of coming up with how important

1047
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:19,583
You are in and needing to project that to the audience

1048
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,351
Does just like

1049
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,423
God damn I don't I don't know how I

1050
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:25,215
How you could live like that

1051
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,495
Just so.

1052
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,263
Totally

1053
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,055
Anyway in the sex clip Alex

1054
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:32,127
Is that

1055
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:32,895
The situation

1056
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,175
The president

1057
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:40,575
Lawyer who has said that Trump needs to call for martial law

1058
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,855
New election

1059
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,159
Do you think Alex is for or against

1060
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,951
This idea

1061
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,743
But I would even almost argue

1062
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,023
Against the new elect

1063
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:52,863
Action part just stick with Marshall off now he's just for it all

1064

Glenwood

1066
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,751
President-trump

1067
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,055
Should declare martial law

1068
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,871
Hold new election

1069
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,687
He goes through

1070
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,479
In this full page

1071
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,135
I totally agree

1072
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:22,303
This constitutional analysis election

1073
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:28,703
Why are you guys wasting my time even saying what a new electric shut up like if you

1074
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:35,103
Well I guess we were wrong.

1075
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,919
The election be whatever

1076
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:43,039

The only way there could be a feral

1079
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:48,927
It didn't happen

1080
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,719
Is this a is this a Zen koan

1081
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,023
Trump voting machine

Drop Brandon machine it's the only way to be sure

1083
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,703
They're made by Trump

1084
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:01,471
Alright

1085
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,495

00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:07,871
Alright everybody but phone companies are alright

1087
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:09,663
He makes his own voting machines

1088
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:13,247

1090
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:14,783

Press for Biden

1092
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:17,087
Little

1093
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,903
Container of a little gun comes out boom

1094
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:20,671
Got to vote for

1095
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:24,767
Search up every. Gunn swabs you

1096
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:30,143
Alex one of the reasons that there needs to be a new election

1097
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,423
The story

1098
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,727
How do I expand Abba Dominion

1099
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:34,495
Engineer

1100
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,543
McKean County in Georgia

1101
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,079
Walking up illegally

1102
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:39,103
Drive-In

1103
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,175
Walking out with it for a few hours coming back again

1104
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:49,343
Alex doesn't even know what county this video is from

1105
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,367
It's a key County

1106
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:54,975
Please literally repeating qanon posts

1107
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:57,279
From social media you saw this is just another one

1108
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:03,167
This was a qanon witch-hunt that started from a video of a Dominion Technologies technician doing their job

1109
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:07,519
Which are in the imagination of these idiots on social media became proof of a person change

1110
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,287
V

1111
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,871
Proof it's given for this is that people watching

1112
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:15,711
Video assume that must be what the guys doing there for it's been proven

1113
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:18,271
Almost comically dumb yeah that is very stupid

1114
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:24,671
What's less laughable is the fact that the major players of the cube bulshit work amplifying leading a dachshund camp

1115
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:26,207
Against this employee

1116
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:28,511
Who is now almost certainly afraid for his life

1117
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:31,071
This employee was not manipulated vote

1118
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:34,143
But now because of people like Alex Jones and Ron Watkins

1119
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:39,263
A huge chunk of the public thinks that he's either definitely or probably guilty of

1120
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,823
This is a real person

1121
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,615
Who's been singled out

1122
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:45,407
And that in a fairy story written about him

1123
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,687
For no reason

1124
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:49,247
Except to satisfy the corruption lost

1125
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,783
Of a disenchanted group of

1126
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:51,807
Conspiracy lunatic

1127
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:52,831
And now

1128
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:55,903
He's got people tweeting nooses at him so

1129
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,951
Yaki

1130
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,999
The conservative media has essentially turned

1131
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:02,047
All of the internet into the eye of

1132
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:05,887
Sauron and if it anytime points upon you you'll be destroyed

1133
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:12,287
Just let amplifying that out of your career like your job

1134
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:17,919
Figuring out the things that have gotten you in trouble in the past and then continuing to Chipotle

1135
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:19,711
I mean interview

1136
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:23,551
Has it away learned the lessons which is that there are no negative consequences

1137
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:26,367
Cuantas except for people who aren't him and he doesn't care about the

1138
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:28,927
Well at least he doesn't bring up the guy's name

1139
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:35,839
Anyway we need martial law and the reason we do is because there's already martial law or maybe

1140
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,119
Something I don't know

1141
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:39,167
This is the UN Global Petco

1142
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,983
Martial law

1143
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,519
Martial law

1144
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:48,127
I make sense to stop the counter to 2

1145
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:48,895
The coolers

1146
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:49,919
Before they cool us

1147
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:56,319
Brightondale be cool we need martial law in order to fight martial law

1148
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:59,135
Waterstone calls on property total power

1149
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,695
Martial law

1150
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:07,071
The Constitution

1151
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:09,631
Total power the Constitution

1152
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,679
Is the

1153
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,311
Protect the public

1154
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,335
When you do it

1155
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:26,015
I'm an expert on martial law ladies and gentlemen

1156
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:29,855
The clintons

1157
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:31,135
Route to do it

1158
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:34,975
Their un Global Medical martial law

1159
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:38,559
What it is

1160
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:42,911
Circumvent the government open government to stand back and watch it all happen

1161
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:46,495
I got to say after that clip I really do think that he is an expert on martial law

1162
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:48,543
And yeah

1163
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,567
Okay okay

1164
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:51,103
So if I understand this correctly

1165
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:52,127
The UN

1166
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,919
Is declaring martial law

1167
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:58,527
So Trump has to declare martial law in order to stop the un's martial law

1168
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,295
Now

1169
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,575
I'm going to toss this out there

1170
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,599
For you as a possible

1171
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,391
Trump has declared martial

1172
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,439
And martial law is declared

1173
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:07,999
What if the UN just removes Trump

1174
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:10,047
We're we're still in martial law

1175
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:12,863
What do you mean

1176
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:13,887
I mean like

1177
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:19,007
Once we're in martial law it doesn't matter somebody's going to be the martial law person

1178
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,031
Forever

1179
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:23,103
Well they do in Alex's world that's forever

1180
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,919
That's something that is always been

1181
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:28,735
Apart of his ideas

1182
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,783
Let me let me float this

1183
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,087
Look

1184
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,903
Their martial law is bad and it'll happen

1185
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,951
And forever because you don't trust anybody want

1186
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:40,255
What's the hidden power they'll never get out of power

1187
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,279
Except

1188
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,303
For Donald Trump

1189
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,583
Because he's really cool

1190
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:44,607
Right

1191
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:49,215
You just got to let him have martial law temporarily which I have told you on many occasions is

1192
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,239
Impossible it doesn't

1193
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:53,823
Will trust me he tries to clean stuff up

1194
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,615
And then he'll get it. The martial law

1195
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:58,175
But it seems like you're just getting rid of one of the steps

1196
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:58,943
That they would have

1197
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:05,343
And they could just kill him and you're already on their Marshall and then they don't even have to bring in

1198
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:10,207
I don't know how to respond to that

1199
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:16,863
Yeah I don't know it's just dumb mr. Marshall Law mr. Anthony Marshall Law

1200
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,935
Whose whole career is largely been about how

1201
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:22,751
Tyrants never give up power once a day

1202
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:25,567
Achieve like some modicum of

1203
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:30,431
Like for him to be like do we need a dictatorship for a short time in order to

1204
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:35,295
Solve the problems of my imaginary enemies it's just

1205
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:37,599
Kind of silly it's not it's

1206
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,367
Not funny

1207
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,903
Yeah it's sad

1208
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,439
Yeah it's very pathetic

1209
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:43,999
Listening to somebody talk like that and not

1210
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,047
Bee challenge with Just Like Sugar

1211
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:46,815
List of like

1212
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,095
That's

1213
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:52,959
Yeah if anyone around them from their longtime listener one body ass

1214
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,519
From a voice within themselves yeah

1215
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:59,871
Pushing back and being like to hear yourself

1216
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:00,895
Yeah

1217
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:05,503
F*** out of here it's like it's a wonderful life but instead of the Angel showing up it just jump

1218
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,391
Mascaro but like all the ghosts are like

1219
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,415
Screws gear

1220
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:15,231
You're the best

1221
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:15,999
You are just

1222
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:20,351
Do it so good would you hang with us have a great old time

1223
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,911
Christmas morning kids you got to do

1224
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:25,471
Beat up Tiny Tim

1225
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,415
Dictator is hell up in here

1226
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:47,231
We the People March

1227
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:50,303
Real quick he's reading Linwood statement

1228
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:53,375
That is a long statement our treats most of it

1229
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:56,191
I don't care but anyway

1230
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:56,959
Just a part of that

1231
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:58,239
And Alex's take on it

1232
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:02,079
We the people must demand a new in Fair

1233
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:05,407
About that all Americans can trust

1234
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,711
And live by regardless of the winter

1235
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:11,039
Without a vote we fear has good reason

1236
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:14,623
Shooting Civil War

1237
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:18,207
All-time high in 40%

1238
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,487
The first-time donors

1239
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,767
Will you defend themselves

1240
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:21,535
The property

1241
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,887
We must act now before there

1242
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:27,679
Is no peaceful way left

1243
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,703
Determination

1244
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:31,519
Exactly why the icons in the UN do this

1245
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:34,847
Because even if Trump removes the fraud they'll be a civil war

1246
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:37,663
Why don't you the fraudulent

1247
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:43,807
He has two arrested in the media

1248
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:58,911
Oh wow okay so I guess we got to arrest them if he heads of the media

1249
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,703
Correctly

1250
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:04,543
Even if Trump uses the system to root out the corrupt

1251
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:06,847
There's going to be a civil war

1252
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:09,407
Well yeah yeah however if Trump

1253
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,199
Instantly

1254
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:17,855
Extemporaneously arrest all the heads of the media right takes care of all of the generals that he doesn't like

1255
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:20,927
Removed everybody in government dissolved the Senate

1256
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:21,951
No Civil War

1257
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,279
I'm in the center for now is

1258
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,327
Supreme Court

1259
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:29,631
Yeah yeah it's strained

1260
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:30,911
So that wouldn't wouldn't

1261
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,959
Start a civil wars

1262
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:33,727
Here's

1263
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,775
I mean it's obviously A Veiled Threat

1264
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:42,175
Yes I'm pretty sure it's very much for we kill all of you at

1265
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:46,271
For a new election he said give us trouble we kill you no no no

1266
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:49,599
There is a circumstance where in the new election would be except

1267
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:54,975
Now a new election voting machines

1268
01:02:55,231 --> 01:03:01,375
Shina no

1269
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,143
Paper ballots

1270
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:08,543
Great recounted by Trump family members

1271
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,591
Has to be in your favor

1272
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:13,663
What's gerrymandering not enough for you

1273
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:16,735
Apparently not well also it is really funny

1274
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:21,343
Linwood and Sidney Powell have their press conference on the 2nd

1275
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,439
Convey of this ugly Boston on December 2nd

1276
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:27,231
Maybe it was on the 1st I can't remember what day it was

1277
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:28,255
But they are like

1278
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,023
Yeah

1279
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:33,887
And we're not going to participate in this Georgia election to vote

1280
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:34,655
Don't do it

1281
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:38,495
I guarantee it I think it's a terrible idea I love that

1282
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:44,639
Call tavito that defense bill

1283
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:47,199
On that stuff

1284
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:47,967
Interesting like

1285
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:49,503
Sidney Powell and

1286
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:52,831
Lynnwood telling people not to vote

1287
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:55,391
Georgia runoff I'm all for it

1288
01:03:57,183 --> 01:04:00,255
Very significant advantage to the Democratic

1289
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,279
Yep yes

1290
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,559
Please why

1291
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:05,631
This is what I've been waiting for the whole time we can't

1292
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:09,471
Be cool and take it over by the dumbest people on the planet

1293
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:12,799
They need to dumb it up so much we don't even have to work

1294
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:17,407
I'm very interested in that

1295
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:22,015
Turn Alex's take on Trump's threatening to veto Saturday

1296
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:25,855
Exactly

1297
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:27,647
Because Alex

1298
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,183
I hate

1299
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:31,743
The ndaa

1300
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,607
Favor of trump veto in that

1301
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:39,679
He also wants to get back on Twitter

1302
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:43,007
Such a complicated

1303
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:45,311
He's finally forced a

1304
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:49,663
Into the most nuanced position of his career and he's reacting the way we all knew we would

1305
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:56,063
Pretending it's not happening let me go gamble he forgets he doesn't like the NBA's

1306
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:57,599
I won't remember that very shortly

1307
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:59,391
Yeah but he does remember

1308
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:01,439
They paid people a lot of money

1309
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,975
To dig up this story

1310
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:05,023
About China

1311
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:07,839
If this goes out this is the total proof

1312
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:09,375
Hiding in plain view

1313
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:10,655
And we have

1314
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:12,447
Are you tired

1315
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:14,751
Through all this

1316
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,031
They tried to hide it

1317
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:20,639
I tried to hide the subsidiary names

1318
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:22,431
And subgroups we tracked it all back

1319
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:30,111
Shuffle going to break in just a few seconds promo code Patriot Universal 10% off

1320
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,135
Alright man

1321
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:33,439
Yeah I think he's got a good point

1322
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:35,487
I think you can only own one business

1323
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:36,511
Beyond

1324
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:39,327
No none of this Cubs

1325
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:41,119
None of this is this

1326
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:41,887
Feeling

1327
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:46,751
Staples in UBS Company Limited in uvso 25%

1328
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:47,775
1 Business Park

1329
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:52,127
I don't think you have any idea how come

1330
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,663
Alright

1331
01:05:53,919 --> 01:06:00,063
I sometimes forget that you have a degree in small business administration

1332
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:02,623
1 Business Park

1333
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,439
.

1334
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,999
Maryville

1335
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,023
Everyone gets one

1336
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:10,815
I understand that

1337
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:17,215
Corporate structures are confusing and sometimes a bit complicated

1338
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:21,567
By making it impossible to work

1339
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:27,455
Next clip Alex continues

1340
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:31,039
To bring up this Dominion employee was been getting lots of threats

1341
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:33,855
At least

1342
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,415
At least he's not saying his name or anything

1343
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:37,695
Imma come back

1344
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:40,255
Recap the top news in the show you footage

1345
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:42,303
Dominion worker reportedly

1346
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,095
Carpenter

1347
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,703
Alicia's name yet

1348
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,751
Set alarm people

1349
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:54,591
This is incredible at what levels you've been caught

1350
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,615
We do not accept

1351
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:58,943
Check your fraudulent leader your chai, agent Joe Biden you're on notice

1352
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:03,551
Remarkable restraint on Alex's part not saying this person's name yeah

1353
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:04,575
Because you know

1354
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:05,599
150

1355
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,135
It's kind of a big part of what's gotten him

1356
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,415
I'm in trouble in the past

1357
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:10,719
You're leading an amplifying

1358
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:11,999
Kind of campaign

1359
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,279
Seek to

1360
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,303
Harass

1361
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,863
Threaten intimidate private citizens

1362
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,959
Hope you don't get into that

1363
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:22,239
Yeah

1364
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,007
I think it's

1365
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:26,847
I think it's so weird how willing he is to go after

1366
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:27,871
After individual

1367
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:31,711
How weird is like I think that's the only way he can really assert

1368
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,479
Power

1369
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:33,247
Suppose

1370
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:39,647
Cuz it cuz I don't think anybody else is scared of him like right

1371
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:42,975
Thought this guy who owned Comet Ping Pong was ready to take him to court

1372
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:47,839
Like it's back down hard when those people were like oh f*** you

1373
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:54,239
People like date of David Rothschild showed up on his show and talk to him for like half an hour

1374
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:57,055
Bill Ayers showed up Andrew

1375
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,591
What are you talkin about

1376
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,639
But these people aren't afraid of him

1377
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:01,663
You know who is

1378
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:03,711
Some random country

1379
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:04,479
But

1380
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:06,783
Like I said man

1381
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,343
Ethos

1382
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:10,367
Because

1383
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:14,463
You can really tell that Alex loves telling the story about how Trump

1384
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:18,047
People told him to get to the bottom of this Dominion thing

1385
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:21,375
It's so sad when you know what's up and this is just a

1386
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,423
The conspiracy from qanon boards

1387
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:25,215
God this is so sad

1388
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:32,127
Credible time in world history on so many fronts but I got to call

1389
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:37,759
The president's representative

1390
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:41,343

1391
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:44,927
Sun

1392
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:46,463

And I said look we know Soros the Chinese are involved

1395
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:58,495
What unit investigated

1396
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:02,847
I want you to bring it out I know it why why do I have to find it they said

1397
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:06,431
That's at all cuz it's it's classified not going to find myself

1398
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:11,807
Well I got to call two days ago from the security firm I hired

UBS Bank

All of this

1409
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:38,431
Money 400 million

1410

YouTube

1411
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:42,527
Dominion

1412
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:43,807
I just

1413
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:44,831
Can't

1414
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:45,855
Get over helping

1415
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:46,879
Pathetic this is

1416
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:47,647
Staff

1417
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,671
This is like a

1418
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:49,695
School kid

1419
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:52,767
Bragging about like their dad being Superman

1420
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,559
The president

1421
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:57,631
I'll just say I'll leave it at one of his son

1422
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,423
Called me

1423
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,703
And said you got to get

1424
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:03,007
It was because it's classified we're not

1425
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,287
Because it's not

1426
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:08,127
It's a little bit like

1427
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:09,663
Like a con man

1428
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:16,063
You very much like this particular one reminds me of like that

1429
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:19,647
The old ones where it's somebody with a vaguely European accent who

1430
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:22,719
Talking to the New York Stock Exchange people like

1431
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:24,255
Yes I would represent

1432
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,535
YouTube of King Harold

1433
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,303
Call Linda

1434
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:32,447
He's trying to keep it a secret million dollars

1435
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,471
And if you know that the

1436
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:34,751
The cake is a lie

1437
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:39,103
You're a f****** lunatic man if you're not pulling it off at you look like

1438
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,383
PennySaver

1439
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:44,735
Yeah you know you know simultaneously Aika

1440
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:47,039
Can see this and he is not pulling it off right

1441
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:47,807
But there's

1442
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:49,599
Probably enough people

1443
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:50,879
Who are just dumb

1444
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:52,927
Or just captured by him

1445
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,719
I think that he

1446
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,487
Beans

1447
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:57,023
God damn word he says

1448
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:59,839
And that's really sad it's really sad

1449
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:02,143
For them it's really sad for Alex

1450
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,679
It really is

1451
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:07,519
Start a human level 40 something year old man

1452
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:09,823
46 47 year old man

1453
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:10,847

1455
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:12,383
Bragging

1456
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:14,943
Sleep bulshit lies

1457
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:18,527
About the president's son telling him to do this investigation

1458
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:23,135
Study just selling Acumen onboard well when you put it in that context it sounds bad

1459
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,183
It is

1460
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:29,535
It's also like this is painful to me like

1461
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:32,351
I had a really tough time with the first half

1462
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,655
December 1st episode

1463
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:35,679
Because it is

1464
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:36,959
It's it's

1465
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:38,239
This dude

1466
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,775
Just a sad mope

1467
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:42,847
1 trillion %

1468
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:45,407
The Smoking Gun and then it just gets worse

1469
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:47,967
The Communist Chinese wired

1470
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:53,343
Dominion on October 7th

1471
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:59,743
These documents

1472
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:03,583
I suggest you get him outside and I don't normally say sources and things like that

1473
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:07,679
I want you to know how real this is

1474
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:08,703
That's just

1475
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:10,495
Justice bomber

1476
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:15,615
Oh boy that's really sad about this is like if you really look at it

1477
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,151
Professional

1478
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:18,175
Call perspectives

1479
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:19,199
Alex's

1480
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,223
Reduce

1481
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:21,759
To taking something

1482
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,039
From qanon

1483
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,063
Circles

1484
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:25,087
Pretending it's not

1485
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:27,647
That and then just trying to resell

1486
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:31,231
Anybody who's like engaged in those qanon

1487
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:31,999
Communities

1488
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:33,023
Between this and be like

1489
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:35,071
Are we already knew that this days

1490
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,351
4 yd cocaine

1491
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:38,143
This is old news to real

1492
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,423
Conspiracy heads

1493
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,703
Like it's it's

1494
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:45,055
You trailing behind the thing that he thinks is a rip-off of himself right

1495
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,079
It's just

1496
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:47,615
You should

1497
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:51,199
Quit quit

1498
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:54,015
She-Ra meeting she does protest too much will be like

1499
01:12:58,623 --> 01:12:59,903
Now I would say that Alex

1500
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:03,743
Has been a little bit out of line with talking about this employee but

1501
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:04,511
I will say

1502
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:07,583
Up till this point he hasn't really been trying to like

1503
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:08,351
Intimidate

1504
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,143
Until now

1505
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:15,007
A video we know who the guy is retracting Democrat operative we know where he worked at

1506
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:16,031
McDonald's in GameStop

1507
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:18,335
Relationship

1508
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:26,783
But we have the footage of him in the Tri-County illegally or not

1509
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,831
Going up with a thumb drive taking it out

1510
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:30,623
That's pretty much

1511
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:31,647
Wow

1512
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:33,695
That's really f***** up

1513
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:37,279
That's really f***** because you could also tell how much Alex kind of relish

1514
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:43,935
Yeah that cut that moment feels like he's threatened hot but anytime I can drop

1515
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:46,495
Javier's in the world

1516
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:51,103
Calming the USB

1517
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,639
And waddling out

1518
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:56,991
Xavier

1519
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:58,527
As we told you

1520
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:02,367
Wish I was going to bring it myself what Gateway pundit

1521
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:04,415
Stay in attack formation

1522
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,183
Oops

1523
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:06,207
Well I hope this

1524
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:06,975
Do not come back

1525
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:13,375
To bite you in the ass and you don't get sued I hope it doesn't he should be immediately and even if nothing happens the

1526
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:15,423
Other lawsuits and be like

1527
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,471
Beat this what you're trying to do

1528
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:26,175
Clear pattern of behavior this guy

1529
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:26,943
Warren this

1530
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,479
Kind of behavior

1531
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:29,503
Happening

1532
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:31,295
A couple days ago

1533
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:36,671
Could be inserted as part of the Sandy Hook trial go.

1534
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:41,023
Stopping behaving in ways that are Taylor

1535
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:45,887
Raising the possibility of harm coming to private search at

1536
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:50,239
I just don't understand I guess I do kind of understand

1537
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:52,287
Houston assholes

1538
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:54,079
Cancel

1539
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,615
It shouldn't work like

1540
01:14:55,871 --> 01:15:00,991
Okay so you just told me what the exact line is so what I'm going to do is

1541
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:04,063
Tiptoe up to his closest Little to the line is possible

1542
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:10,463
And then wave my hands at you but you can't catch me I didn't kill this guy this time you're on Earth

1543
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,999
This is completely different because

1544
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:13,279
It's about a different thing

1545
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:16,607
Yeah but different thing

1546
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:17,375
What

1547
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:20,703
Like I said there's a lot of pesos

1548
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:22,495
At the beginning part and I'm

1549
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,031
I was kind of bummed out about it

1550
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:28,383
This is interesting because it is pathetic

1551
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,151
And

1552
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:33,503
There's an interesting glimpse of Alex trying to put on his soda Superman

1553
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:34,527
Jumper

1554
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:40,159
Sure and try and play the role of what he thinks he is

1555
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:45,279
Everything and I was like I need more

1556
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,047
From this episode

1557
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,583
And thankfully

1558
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:49,119
Another

1559
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:51,679
Someone who might be a daddy to Alex

1560
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:53,983
Steve pieczenik

1561
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,519
Let me remind you

1562
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:59,103
Couple of weeks ago on several months ago I

1563
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:01,919
That I was told by my

1564
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,199
Hello

1565
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:05,247
Countrymen

1566
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:06,015
Rich man

1567
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:11,647
Owen Shroyer show that we have

1568
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,463
Watermarks

1569
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:18,559
That's we had monitored at all the machines I'm Dominion

1570
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:19,839
And we had

1571
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:22,911
Came out of

1572
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:26,751
Who's David Ida

1573
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:27,519
Favorite

1574
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:28,543
I do have but I

1575
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:32,127
He's not happy about it I have to imagine

1576
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:36,991
Yeah it's Steve's still on this telephone

1577
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:41,087
And I still haven't

1578
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:42,111
Because again this is

1579
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:47,487
A direct contradiction of literally every other talking point that Alex's

1580
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:50,559
Is not only contradicting Alex

1581
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:54,399
In terms of like now this was a sting operation this entire election

1582
01:16:55,167 --> 01:17:00,031
He also is not thrilled with the idea that Alex is like maybe we should have martial law seems like

1583
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:01,055
No

1584
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:03,103
Don't need martial law

1585
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:04,127
What we have enough

1586
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,151
Now

1587
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:06,175
Is we have

1588
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:10,527
The Sting operation which I denounced Iran Alex Jones

1589
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:13,599
Give me the permission

1590
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:14,623
Cool

1591
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:15,903
Yeah man

1592
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:17,439
Bye-bye

1593
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:22,303
I'm never going to be like I have common cause with Steve pieczenik right but I do

1594
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,327
Find it

1595
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:27,167
Comforting on some level that he's not saying we need martial law

1596
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:32,031
Also said we should dissolve the government and Melania should be Queen

1597
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:38,431
Yeah that's why I don't want, cuz I would like some clarity coming from doctors

1598
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:45,087
Alright he's who I go to when I'm looking for sanity in this info world's world you need a Northstar

1599
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:47,903
Play that's what I'm all about unfortunately

1600
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:48,671
Alex

1601
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:52,255
Besides that this is the time when he's going to be like

1602
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:56,351
Yeah I don't know

1603
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,375
Stay the night

1604
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:04,799
Clip is essentially Alex drink

1605
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:06,079
Play both sides of the fence

1606
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:11,199
Yeah now it says you're full of s*** and I still want to talk to you so

1607
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:14,527
Well I think it's even less of that and more just like

1608
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:20,927
If anybody in the audience were to attack him from either side and he can cover his face with a clip like that that's fair

1609
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:21,951
But some people

1610
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:27,071
Say that you're full of it that's me being a hard-hitting journalist Nebraska

1611
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:29,887
If someone is into Steve's Theory

1612
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:30,655
I said

1613
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:33,727
That he has a great track record and that goes a long way with me

1614
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:36,543
He's just being mealy-mouthed.

1615
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:40,383
Anyway Steve's talking about the situation we find ourselves in

1616
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:43,967
The ballots are all accounted for in

1617
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:45,503
Barcodes or whatever

1618
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:46,271
The fuc

1619
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:48,063
And also

1620
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,087
Some generals

1621
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:50,111
Who sent troops

1622
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:51,391
All over the country

1623
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:52,671
And the Supreme Court needs

1624
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:53,695
To be taken out

1625
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:02,399
Ring system

1626
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,447
Deployed military elements

1627
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:08,799
Buffalo

1628
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,871
Playing

1629
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:15,967
Regular Army National Guard

1630
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:17,503
Has increased more

1631
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,063
Tell you that it's the same

1632
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:22,111
John Roberts

1633
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:24,927
Greencore

1634
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:26,463
He is a sick man

1635
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:30,815
Capitation

1636
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,863
Corruption is what we call

1637
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:33,887
Call the minimalist

1638
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:37,727
Yeah sure that is what we call them

1639
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:38,751
Minimalist

1640
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:39,519
Quid pro

1641
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,055
Corruption

1642
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:43,103
Yeah cool cool you're talkin

1643
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:43,871
Talking about

1644
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:45,919
Turtles you know the inefficient

1645
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:49,247
Unqualified

1646
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:54,367
Meanwhile we got General nakasone coming into bringing an army into store.

1647
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,671
Tomorrow we march on Florida

1648
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:02,047
Which of their plans I would be interested in letting

1649
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:05,375
Play out not that one

1650
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:07,423
Sometimes we'll have like a

1651
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:13,311
What days is all of their plans are like they did the boards I just drops up and down

1652
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:17,408
Is the plan I'm glad they follow through

1653
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,432
I have another one

1654
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:20,224
Mocking hope

1655
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:23,040
Alex follow through with it will be my next

1656
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,856
Like Tara vanity projects

1657
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:32,256
If Alex does this I might live stream 4 days straight

1658
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:34,304
Update on what's going on

1659
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,608
One of the most exciting

1660
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:37,632
You know what

1661
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:38,656
F*** it

1662
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:40,960
Okay unprecedented

1663
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:46,080
If Alex follows through with what he claims he's going to latest episode

1664
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,360
I might

1665
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:53,760
Join have okay okay alright alright that's a tease cuz I don't know what he's going to talk about

1666
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:54,784
In covid

1667
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,064
We'll figure it out

1668
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,624
Alright we'll talk about this later

1669
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,928
A literal bubble-boy situation

1670
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:04,512
Earlier you said I forgot

1671
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:06,560
I'll be revealed within this episode

1672
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:13,984
The earlier you were mentioning that like the way that Alex was talking about him being told to do this Dominion investigate

1673
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,520
Bounce TV

1674
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:22,176
And because Steve is still on the election was a sting operation

1675
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:23,968
The government asked

1676
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,248
Alex

1677
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:28,320
The left-hand can't know what the right hands doing

1678
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:31,392
This is a problem for Alex though especially in terms of

1679
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:34,464
The presentation that is an issue needs to ask Siri

1680
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:37,024
Help me out of this one guy car at my buddy

1681
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,936
Don't say no to this fraud

1682
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:47,008
Then they will put Biden and Trump says you'll do so

1683
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:51,360
Is there is water marks and all this proof and I believe you talked to those forces who told you

1684
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:53,664
It's probably doing good faith I think you're a good person

1685
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:56,992
When do we see the cards on the table what's about to happen

1686
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,696
Why would they get me

1687
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:08,000
To do after

1688
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:14,400
Document

1689
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,424
They have this why

1690
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,192
Why

1691
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:22,336
It's a great question why would they do that

1692
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:26,432
Say that it's very simple

1693
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,200
They wouldn't

1694
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:28,736
No buts

1695
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:30,016
You can't say that.

1696
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:30,784
Bad idea

1697
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,576
The in order for their illusions

1698
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:33,344
Discontinued

1699
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:37,184
That the audience needs to buy into to keep the cash flow going

1700
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,488
Steve needs to not be a

1701
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:40,256
Complete liar

1702
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:46,656
And Alex needs to not be shown to have not talked to the white house after school

1703
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:49,216
Everybody's a little bit of a dangerous position right now

1704
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:53,056
Right but there is a really smooth way to get out of this pickle

1705
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:54,336
And that is

1706
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:58,688
Leo zagami exactly what he always does when things get tough

1707
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:00,736
I appreciate

1708
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:02,784
Excited

1709
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:04,320
The reality is

1710
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:05,856
Game is already

1711
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:08,160
What's happening

1712
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:10,720
Trump anticipated most

1713
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:12,512
Ashley

1714
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:14,304
Intelligence

1715
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,584
Community really

1716
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:17,632
Thesaurus

1717
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:18,400
Harwich

1718
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,680
I was to announce

1719
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:21,728
They wanted me to announce

1720
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,056
Person or stood because Idaho

1721
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:29,408
Promotion I really don't

1722
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,944
Garner anything

1723
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,480
Other than being a

1724
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:34,272
Citizen Warrior

1725
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:36,832
Fuelman

1726
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:38,368
Mainstream media has a

1727
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:46,048
Soho

1728
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:47,584
Clean wigs

1729
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:53,728
Yeah so you know when you're encountered with his unanswerable question where the only

1730
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:57,056
Logical rational real world explanation is

1731
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:57,824
Cuz you're both

1732
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,104
Crazy Liars

1733
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:02,176
Yeah you get out of that by being like

1734
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:02,944
Alex

1735
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:09,344
Calm down you were chosen because you're so great the best you're the best there ever was about a look at these

1736
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,112
Compliments

1737
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:13,952
Don't look at me that's a very easy way to get out of conversation

1738
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:15,488
And also the

1739
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:19,072
C-note then Steve can transition into other top

1740
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:21,632
Like how Biden will never be president

1741
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,448
Guarantee

1742
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,520
The United States

1743
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:31,616
Now he's wearing possibly and

1744
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:33,664
Bracelet because he said

1745
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:37,504
He has a little bit of problem

1746
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:42,624
Haha

1747
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:49,792
Seeing now

1748
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:52,864
Different type of bracelet

1749
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,240
The way you can

1750
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:02,592
Can Alex that's reason why I come on I mean this is not unusual for

1751
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:04,384
Reset it a long time

1752
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:07,200
I want to believe you I'm just 150 days

1753
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:09,504

I just I just hope you're right

1756
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:25,888
That is what it sounds like when someone doesn't believe

1757
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:26,656
Leave someone

1758
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:28,704

Fuchsia

01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:52,000
You're pitching a nonsensical

1767
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:52,768
Stupid

1768
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:54,816
Voter fraud

1769
01:25:55,072 --> 01:26:00,704
Conspiracy based on qanon

1770
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:04,288
What got to make it look good

1771
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:05,312
That's rude

1772
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:07,360
Anyway

1773
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:08,384

1777
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:14,272
He's like a man

1778
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:17,344
I can't get excited like you get excited I don't know that mean

1779

You're so important

01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,264
Fictional mythology around how I'm great

In order to be interested

1815
01:27:54,368 --> 01:28:00,256
You've got to cover that you want to make the after show your character needs to be incredibly

1816
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:06,656
You don't believe you're only on for short bursts you don't want to be the character who doesn't get a rose

1817
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:07,424
To speak

1818
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,448

You also somebody who unfortunately

1820
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:14,592
Runs the risk of being

1821
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:17,920
Pretty boring pretty easily because he's made so many

1822
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:22,784
That's true

1823
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:28,928
Prince called because he wanted to make sure they start my appearance are being overworked

1824
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:34,816
No problems here guys just give you a call so you got the go-ahead and everything's okay

1825
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:37,120
To Parlay

1826
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:39,936
We just want you to say stay frosty at that you keep.

1827
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:45,056
She wants me to work as an intermediary between Alex Jones

1828
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:46,848
China

1829
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:51,456
Just inexplicable and pointless little bit of racism there

1830
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,224
So Alex

1831
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,784
Who's having this interview with Steve and he's

1832
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:55,552
He's also like

1833
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:56,832
I got to go

1834
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:58,368
I got to leave early

1835
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:05,280
Alright what is playing hooky in the next 2 hours windfall Joseph Watson has Candice

1836
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:08,096
Gaston

1837
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:10,912
Busy with breaking news and documents and Intel

1838
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:18,336
And tomorrow we'll have giant breaking news here for you on

1839
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:20,384
When the information

1840
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:24,992
It's not there's nothing

1841
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:26,272
Big going on at all

1842
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:29,344
I would probably make myself scarce

1843
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:32,928
It's the team up is going to be Paul Joseph Watson

1844
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:33,952
And Candice Owen

1845
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:35,744
It's been my feeling

1846
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:36,768
She's not

1847
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:37,792
Thrilled with

1848
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:44,192
Being associated with Infowars

1849
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:50,336
Like with Turning Point never coming on Infowars

1850
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:56,736
I don't know I haven't tracked her career as closely but it seems like she's back in the place where she would be on info

1851
01:29:56,992 --> 01:30:01,344
Call Wars

1852
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,880
Respond

1853
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:05,952
Paul as opposed to be without going to do it

1854
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:10,048
Go with Paul if it's somehow seems safer for your reputation

1855
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:13,120
So Alex going to leave early cuz he's got to

1856
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:13,888
Time to work

1857
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:14,656
Yeah whatever

1858
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:16,448
Steve

1859
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:20,544
As one who has one more big swing to make

1860
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,824
I love this one as I

1861
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:22,848
What the f***

1862
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:24,896
So I'm telling you babe

1863
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:25,920
Beijing called me

1864
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:26,688
DirecTV

1865
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:28,480
Cast of the show that you're doing

1866
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:32,832
We wanted to use you as the main fire

1867
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:34,624
By that

1868
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:35,648
Announcement

1869
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:37,440
You have to

1870
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:41,280
Ironically one of my neighbors

1871
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:42,816
Get the f*** out

1872
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:43,840
Creased

1873
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:45,632
Dancing in the size of

1874
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:47,680
2

1875
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:52,544
Hundred percent another was I have a neighbor who's in charge

1876
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:53,824
Wire

1877
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:55,360
Fencing for prison

1878
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:57,152
And he went

1879
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:58,944
A year ago

1880
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:01,760
Increase the size of

1881
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:06,624
By over 100%

1882
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,416
Shouldn't you be against

1883
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:11,744
Is that is easy trying to say that's because Obama's

1884
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:17,888
Taller than the other prisoners have been in the past I got what we're trying to say globalist

1885
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:22,752
That you're going to incarcerate it Wonton amo in your fantasies

1886
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:25,824
Them in the safety there is

1887
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:29,408
Yeah this is silly

1888
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:30,432
What is

1889
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:33,760
What he's talking about is there were reports of trump like building

1890
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:34,528
News

1891
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:37,856
Construction

1892
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:39,904
Prior to this date rented

1893
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:42,208
Seeing the trend has been towards closing at

1894
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:46,816
Jesus trying to use some of those ideas are super popular in the Cuban on world

1895
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:48,864
Steve is really just like

1896
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:49,888
At this point

1897
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:51,168
A cute guy

1898
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:53,984
Yep

1899
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,520
I'll have them

1900
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:58,336
Mighty have fallen

1901
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:01,152
I can such a of weirdness becoming

1902
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:02,688
Followers

1903
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:04,992
Sad

1904
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:08,576
Is something to be said about the queues ability as a as a

1905
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:09,344
Mental

1906
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,624
Disease to infect

1907
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:12,160
Hey I mean

1908
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:12,928
Everybody

1909
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:13,952
Piano

1910
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:14,976
It's it just

1911
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:21,632
F****** in your head you're not at your not immune if you're a conspiracy leader fall

1912
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:23,168
Yeah well I mean

1913
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:23,936
But

1914
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:30,336
These people who are leaders are smart enough to not say this is what there in exactly

1915
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:33,152
We can take the ideas and certain Trends in the

1916
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:34,688
Conspiracy world and then

1917
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:38,528
Reorient them a little bit into being about like

1918
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:41,600
My friend General yeah

1919
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,392
Yeah

1920
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:46,464
Yeah he was saying that stuff but that's just because it's

1921
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:50,304
Parallelism I'm just getting it from a real source

1922
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,072
Whereas

1923
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:57,984
I imagine that it feels a little bit like stuck speculating to be one of these conspiracy people like dealing with

1924
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:58,752
Q like

1925
01:32:59,008 --> 01:33:00,544
Trying to be like okay well I think

1926
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:03,104
This is one of the theories that's going to stick

1927
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:05,664
And if I get on this one

1928
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:12,064
Then I'll get more whenever it goes mainstream where is it maybe start speculating and it's also there's

1929
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:16,416
No consequences for being wrong

1930
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:21,024
He like the stock market if whenever the

1931
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,584
The stock people forgot you are

1932
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:26,912
Everyday everyday at Queens place

1933
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:29,216
Alex's goodbye to Steve

1934
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:31,520
This is not how you

1935
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:33,568
Part ways with someone who you think is

1936
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:34,336
Credible

1937
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:37,664
God bless you will talk to you soon as he pretending.com have a great

1938
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:38,688
Have a great week coming up

1939
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:43,296
Hopi tribe

1940
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,392
I have the

1941
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:50,464
The best cast of the best people and man

1942
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:54,560
I hope that bulshit he just spun makes said it sounds good

1943
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:56,096
Probably both

1944
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:57,376
Bulshit

1945
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:00,448
And

1946
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:01,216
Alex

1947
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:07,872
Starting to show really just sort of ruminating about himself as a child to her and talking about things that are cups

1948
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:08,896
Absolutely not true

1949
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:12,480
I was 6 years old 7 years old I like to watch

1950
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:16,064
I like to watch

1951
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:18,368
Long

1952
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,000
The televised

1953
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:27,584
How things actually work

1954
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:29,632
Interesting

1955
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:33,728
Almost no one else

1956
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:36,800
When

1957
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:38,848
Was 6 years old he was snowed

1958
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:40,640
Advance Jordan you understand

1959
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:43,200
That he was watching.

1960
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:47,040
C-SPAN scores

1961
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:47,808
Hearings

1962
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:53,952
Could you so fascinated but as he got older he realized no one was as serious as him let me posit you an alternate Theory

1963
01:34:54,208 --> 01:35:00,352
When he found out how hard it was to actually do research he decided that what he did was actual research and whatever

1964
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:01,120
Everybody else ABC

1965
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:03,424
Yeah it is certain point he realized

1966
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:05,216
It's really tough to read a book

1967
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:06,240
Card

1968
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:07,520
To 1/3

1969
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:12,128
Person or to somebody else do it external observe difference

1970
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:13,408
Between you having red

1971
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:18,272
The book and you saying you read that sounds true

1972
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:21,856
She's quite a revelation to have at the age of 6 and iPod out

1973
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:26,208
Motorsport 6 years old I realize that if I put Infinite Jest

1974
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:31,584
People will think I was smart that myself

1975
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:35,168
With the same

1976
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:38,496
God dammit

1977
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:41,568
I was so excited

1978
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:43,360
At this point on the 2nd

1979
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:44,640
I could have

1980
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:46,688
I almost couldn't

1981
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:47,968
Contain myself

1982
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:51,808
I don't know if you remember this but I think it was a 2015 episode

1983
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:53,856
Alex got on air and he was like

1984
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:55,392
I am going

1985
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,440
2 in this episode

1986
01:35:57,696 --> 01:35:58,208
Jump the shark

1987
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:02,304
Yes I do recall that I am going to as a piece of art

1988
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,328
Performance art

1989
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:09,984
Call for the Banning of Islam and then he proceeded to talk himself into it.

1990
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:12,800
As a performance

1991
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:14,336
Set out

1992
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:17,152
To do was like this thing that he was being overly

1993
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:18,944
Clear about his intentions

1994
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:20,736
Kind of ruin the Serta

1995
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:21,760
Rhetorical

1996
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:24,832
Thrust right but it was like I loved

1997
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:25,600
Secede

1998
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:29,184
Had an idea and you wanted to try right

1999
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:31,488
I got that again

2000
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:32,512
Advertently

2001
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:34,560
He made our satirical piece

2002
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:35,328
Work

2003
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:36,864
By trying to do is

2004
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,912
Satirical piece and then winding up

2005
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:41,984
Embodying the thing that he thought he was dead

2006
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:42,752
Yeah

2007
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:45,568
It was it was interesting on that level

2008
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:48,128
And I guess it's the same this time

2009
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:54,784
Thought about the best way to say this but I'm going to get right out

2010
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:58,624
People be more effective

2011
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:00,928
If I actually joined the dark

2012
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,792
Seriously considering

2013
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:08,096
Completely shifting into the enemy mindset

2014
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:10,656
Presenting all this and

2015
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:15,008
You should kill yourself

2016
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:18,080
I mean like I would love it if

2017
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:19,616
He did

2018
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:20,896
As a joke

2019
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:23,456
Just did like a Bill Gates great

2020
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:26,016
Because it would be the most incompetent nonsense

2021
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:27,808
Skull

2022
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:28,832
Or or

2023
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:33,440
Character based on scent

2024
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:35,744
One it has to be asked

2025
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,304
Surprised nobody can know you're about to do it

2026
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:43,680
To you have to commit to the vet you have to open by saying something like that you have to stay solid

2027
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:47,264
You can't break character and you have to go for a good long while

2028
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,312
Maybe

2029
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:51,104
And he can't do any of those though

2030
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:56,480
What he saying like I've just been thinking about this I got to go to the dark side and be like the globalist

2031
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,272
And then

2032
01:37:58,528 --> 01:38:00,576
Started to get real f****** dark

2033
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:02,880
Like I like you are being

2034
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:04,928
What I would consider quite

2035
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:05,952
To the dark side

2036
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:07,488
The public

2037
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:10,560
Pears

2038
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:11,328
Good people

2039
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:19,264
But everyone else is running headlong into it

2040
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:21,056
Wanting to be slaves

2041
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,592
Wanted to be slowly killed

2042
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:24,128
Wanting to be met.

2043
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:25,664
Wanting to be failure

2044
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:26,688
Because

2045
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:31,296
They are not men

2046
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:34,112
Wait what

2047
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:40,256
So okay

2048
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:42,048
That the evil enemy

2049
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:43,072
That you hate

2050
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:44,608
Has come to the conclusion

2051
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:46,400
But humans aren't worth

2052
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:48,960
Living and has decided to kill all of us

2053
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:52,544
And you think that that's evil however you agree that humans

2054
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,824
Aren't worth living end

2055
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,360
God is going to kill them all

2056
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:58,944
Correct well yes

2057
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:00,736
Oddities basing it on is

2058
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:01,504
That

2059
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:02,784
It seems like

2060
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:06,624
Only Christians are interested in fighting the

2061
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:09,440
Christian Zealot reward

2062
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:15,072
The Crusade imagining Christian Crusade is only backed by Christian right

2063
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:17,120
I didn't know that strange to him

2064
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:19,168
And it's proof that everyone else

2065
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:21,728
Is meant to die in God's plan

2066
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:24,032
I think that's really f***** up

2067
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:26,336
Yeah I think he went from Ice

2068
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:30,944
I think I'm going to join the Dark Side to I think I am the dark side

2069
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:34,784
Very quickly without seeming to realize that he was doing

2070
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:39,136
That is not him being a performance Sian.

2071
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:40,416
The origin of

2072
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,184
Performing

2073
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:42,464
Prince of the dark side to be like

2074
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:48,352
In your body

2075
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:51,936
Seems like they're destined for death and that's just God's plan

2076
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:55,008
Isn't he the guy who says that Islam is violent

2077
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:02,688
I do think that maybe I was being

2078
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:04,736
Hyperbolic when I said

2079
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:05,760
The GOP is Isis

2080
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:09,856
Yeah

2081
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:16,000
Alex's he's he's he's a ways down that road at least in terms of ideology and the thought

2082
01:40:16,256 --> 01:40:17,792
And Hope

2083
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:19,328
And let's hope not

2084
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:20,096
Not Beats

2085
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:22,656
Now this is this was interesting to me

2086
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:23,936
Because

2087
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:25,216
That's kind of

2088
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:25,984
For this

2089
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:30,080
Everything that you was intending to do this great idea

2090
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:34,176
Performative Ali becoming the dark side and then immediately

2091
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:37,504
Said something incredibly dark and didn't body what I would

2092
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:39,296
Yeah yeah yeah

2093
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:41,344
122 Darkside

2094
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:44,416
Now that he's done with that

2095
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:46,720
Alex tells a story

2096
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:48,256
That I think

2097
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:49,280
Does not make

2098
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:50,560
The point that he want

2099
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:51,840
To make

2100
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:53,376
I think

2101
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:55,936
He sounds like an a****** in this story

2102
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:01,312
They're not the resistance

2103
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:02,336
And there

2104
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:04,896
At the sky

2105
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:06,432
Weekend

2106
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,480
Sunday I went for a walk

2107
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:09,760
Zilker Park

2108
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:11,552
Walking along

2109
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:17,696
I see the sky

2110
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:19,744
25

2111
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:23,072
Happy Friday.

2112
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:31,264
Why

2113
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:45,600
The brown take a swing

2114
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:46,624
Wayward

2115
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,400
Fantasy world

2116
01:41:58,912 --> 01:41:59,680
About to get hurt

2117
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:04,800
It sounds like Alex just threatened the guy randomly that he

2118
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:06,336
Imagined was

2119
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:08,128
I wish him ill and was

2120
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:09,920
Academic antifa types

2121
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:11,712
Alright this is this is

2122
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,016
Scary so let me see if I can get

2123
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:15,552
The details of the story correctly

2124
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:18,880
From the point of a neutral Observer

2125
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:21,440
So I'm in a different angle

2126
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:26,560
Maybe you're a birdwatcher other binoculars not doing much I see Alec

2127
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:27,328
I see Alex

2128
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:28,864
Jones over there just

2129
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:29,632
Chicken

2130
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:30,912
Because he's Alex

2131
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:33,984
Just visibly just vibrating death

2132
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:36,288
And then I see a guy over there

2133
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:41,920
No probably will wait fish wearing glasses he's got a black shirt on he's got black shorts on

2134
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:47,808
Ricochet antifa type starts walking away and then Alex Jones

2135
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:49,344
Visibly shaking

2136
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:54,976
Start walking directly towards him and almost throws a fist at him and I'm supposed to think

2137
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:59,840
At the last minute the antifa guy

2138
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:01,632
Looked like he was about to get hit

2139
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:02,656
By somebody

2140
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:09,056
I got all of a sudden he's so subservient scared of the clear threat

2141
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:13,920
Maintenance Vibe who is giving off

2142
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:20,320
Towards me on a day where I was just reading at the park is going to make me go away in that story I don't hear

2143
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:22,624
Any clear indication to Alex's

2144
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:23,392
Violence

2145
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:24,672
Was in response

2146
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:27,488
To any real violence or threatening this

2147
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:28,768
Of this

2148
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:29,792
Person

2149
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:32,096
Who was just on the trail and Alex's decided

2150
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:33,888
Because they're wearing black and have a beard

2151
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:35,936
Are academic antifa

2152
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:38,752
Write with a f*** that mean

2153
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:41,824
It just seemed like what he just said was

2154
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:42,592
If I

2155
01:43:42,848 --> 01:43:44,128
Feel a bad vibe

2156
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,664
I will kill some

2157
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:47,456
If you're wearing black

2158
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:51,296
You're probably antifa and might f****** images f****** Fallout 4

2159
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:53,600
The s*** out of a seahawk

2160
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:55,392
And if you act

2161
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:56,928
Like it weird

2162
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:58,976
I'm about to hit you or maybe you

2163
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:03,584
Emotionally manipulative

2164
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:08,704
Then why you why you acting like someone's about to hit you you were about to hit me

2165
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:11,264
Okay

2166
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:12,032
Okay

2167
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:13,568
Anyway Alex has a lot of fat

2168
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:16,640
Genesis 1 is the academic antifas trying to get him on the tree

2169
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:18,944
Another is it in the near future

2170
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:20,224
His books

2171
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:21,504
I guess he's written

2172
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,528
A couple bucks

2173
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:24,064
Sort of

2174
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:26,368
Anyways show

2175
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:29,184
Will be contraband

2176
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:32,000
You can record this and you can save that s***

2177
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:36,864
Cloud online

2178
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:40,192
Contraband

2179
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:42,240
All devices

2180
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:45,312
Divisive

2181
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:47,360
What does a lot of Hoops

2182
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:48,640
Steven have this saved

2183
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:50,176
Probably suggest you

2184
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:53,504
And in the future

2185
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,112
In the near future

2186
01:44:58,624 --> 01:44:59,136
In the near future

2187
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:04,000
I would love it for Alex to like go to Europe and see like wall sockets

2188
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:15,520
Is it AC or DC

2189
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:19,616
Dumb dumb

2190
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:22,176
In this next clip

2191
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:25,504
I would say about that last thing is

2192
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:29,088
This is just such a desire to be forbidden

2193
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:32,416
Into that idea

2194
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:33,440
I think it's probably

2195
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:35,488
From one too many bad sci-fi.

2196
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:40,864
We talked a lot about Alex's bizarre morality

2197
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,912
This idea of

2198
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:45,472
Sort of galactic

2199
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:46,752
Rules

2200
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:47,776
And stuff

2201
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:51,872
Mike down for this next court because he talks about a little bit more

2202
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:54,176
If this is something I really need your help with

2203
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:55,456
Okay because this

2204
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:59,808
Is another clue about how this moral system works

2205
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:01,856
But it doesn't make sense

2206
01:46:04,672 --> 01:46:05,696
Your injected with

2207
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:06,720
Hundreds

2208
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:07,488
A little

2209
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:08,512
* 1

2210
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:12,608
All have the same amount of data on them

2211
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:14,400
10 years ago

2212
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:23,872
Metaphysically

2213
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:25,408
Not allowed to do that

2214
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:28,736
Historically

2215
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:33,088
They have to get you under pressure to do it they got to leave a way out for you

2216
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:34,112
Escape hatch

2217
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,208
Porsche

2218
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:40,512
But then it becomes a shove

2219
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,072
Once God removes the barrier

2220
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:46,656
Yes

2221
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:48,192
Put your water

2222
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:49,472
Your food

2223
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:51,264
God

2224
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,288
Has a

2225
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:53,824
Barrier hedge

2226
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:55,104
To this

2227
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:57,408
Sort of free-will thing

2228
01:46:57,664 --> 01:47:03,040
The devil once God says go ahead

2229
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:08,416
That's if you're free well and that's why there's chemtrails

2230
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:09,696
Do you like

2231
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:10,976
Hedges gone

2232
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:14,048
Truck at who cares

2233
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:16,352
What does Alex Jones believe in Kemp

2234
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:19,168
Yes he does yes yes but you can't spray things

2235
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:21,216
Randomly

2236
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:25,568
So I think

2237
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:27,360
If I understand correctly

2238
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:29,408
I think what he saying is that

2239
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:30,432
The devil

2240
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:34,784
The literal Christian devil is real and is running Biden campaign

2241
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:35,552
Spell somehow

2242
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:39,392
AAA

2243
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:45,536
Call the devil said he wasn't doing

2244
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:48,096
So

2245
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:50,400
Right

2246
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:53,728
And God will stop him from going too far

2247
01:47:54,496 --> 01:47:56,800
Unless you give it a little bit of like a

2248
01:47:57,056 --> 01:47:58,080
Hey maybe I'll go along with

2249
01:47:58,336 --> 01:48:00,640
The devil and then God will remove that final Ring of Fire

2250
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:01,408
Protection

2251
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:02,944
And then you will be thrown in

2252
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:05,760
I don't think that's what he saying

2253
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:07,552
I think

2254
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:08,576
That

2255
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:10,624
I don't know if

2256
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:15,232
I don't I'm not certain based on the things that I've heard

2257
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:16,512
Hedge

2258
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:18,560
Of protection that God has

2259
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:20,864
I'm not certain is

2260
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:22,144
You like

2261
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:23,168
Relies on

2262
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:24,192
Your choice

2263
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:27,520
I asked you because you have to have

2264
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:28,800
Have to have the way out

2265
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:31,616
And you have to be able to so you have

2266
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:33,664
Trails work then

2267
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:35,456
Well you chose to look up

2268
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,272
Is it doesn't matter if I look up

2269
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:45,184
According to that you're breathing in all these like these aluminum's and ratify

2270
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:49,024
You can't escape you did not make any choice

2271
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:51,328
That

2272
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:52,608
The baddest something that is

2273
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:53,632
Completely

2274
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:55,168
Above your will

2275
01:48:55,424 --> 01:48:56,192
You did not

2276
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:57,216
Agree to that

2277
01:48:57,472 --> 01:48:59,520
Therefore it's an infringement of your

2278
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:00,544
Oh well

2279
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,336
Wasn't it primed

2280
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:05,664
I'm just like it's just like a mom without a without a timer

2281
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,456
You know you just got all the stuff in you

2282
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:10,272
And then you have to believe something and then they lacked

2283
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:13,856
I can't imagine that

2284
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:20,512
Less than zero says yeah I don't understand this new wrinkle to a there's another wrinkle

2285
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:24,352
And that is that is that you can't do

2286
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:25,376
Who sings to kids

2287
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:29,216
But I think from the context of this Alex's talkin about that

2288
01:49:29,472 --> 01:49:29,984
Yes

2289
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:32,800
The real Ultimate

2290
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:33,568
Children

2291
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:35,104
4

2292
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:36,640
They are of age to make

2293
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:39,200
And so

2294
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:40,224
That's why

2295
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:44,064
Is a cheat

2296
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:46,880
A lot of them so I can lie cheat then

2297
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,720
They are not allowed

2298
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:52,768
They're only allowed to get

2299
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:54,816
Adult

2300
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:57,376
What

2301
01:49:57,632 --> 01:49:58,144
Cannot support

2302
01:49:58,400 --> 01:49:59,168
Themselves

2303
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:00,960
Make a bad decision

2304
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:03,264
Receive spiritual

2305
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:04,288
Interventional

2306
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:05,312
Transmission

2307
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:14,272
I want I want a ruler and I want somebody

2308
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:15,808
Slapping hands whatever he's like

2309
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:17,600
They can cheat

2310
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:18,880
No

2311
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:19,904
You said they can't

2312
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:21,184
But that's why they're cursed

2313
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:22,976
Yeah but you said they can't cheat

2314
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:28,096
I mean if it's there already Kirsten then why wouldn't you just continue to dig

2315
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:29,632
There's no greater

2316
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:33,216
There's no greater punishment after a hell right

2317
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:39,872
So if you already cheated why would you think we like well we still have to follow the rules we captured cursed but you're not going to hell

2318
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:44,992
Oh well then that I guess I retract all the way

2319
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:48,576
That makes you smile weird and alligators and pick you out of a crap.

2320
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:54,720
Alright you can't be a day Walker anywhere I got you

2321
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:56,000
They're getting around

2322
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:57,792
Cosmic rules

2323
01:50:58,048 --> 01:50:59,328
Because these children

2324
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:01,888
Are agreeing to get vaccinated

2325
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:04,192
But they don't know any better

2326
01:51:04,704 --> 01:51:05,472
So it's like

2327
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:09,312
Technically

2328
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:13,408
I don't know

2329
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:14,432
Also I said I would

2330
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:18,016
Would suggest that if this is some kind of finger really curses you

2331
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:19,552
They all having children make

2332
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:22,880
Decisions that they're unable to understand

2333
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:23,648
Baptism

2334
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:26,976
What about child baptism

2335
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:29,024
The children can choose that and that's good

2336
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:32,864
I mean I understand but subjectively

2337
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:35,168
You would say that that is a good decision as opposed

2338
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:36,448
Getting a vaccine

2339
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:37,728
Make it a bad decision for being

2340
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:39,776
However

2341
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:40,800
Externally

2342
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:43,616
Look from the view of the universe these are both things at the

2343
01:51:43,872 --> 01:51:44,640
This child cannot

2344
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:45,920
Decide you can't trick

2345
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:48,480
Ticket towards God that's the other Cosmic rule

2346
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:49,760
You can only go towards

2347
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:56,160
If you get baptized you meant to write it just seems weird yeah I just don't understand what it is exactly

2348
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:57,952
That makes those acts different

2349
01:51:58,208 --> 01:51:58,976
Outside of

2350
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:00,256
Wanting

2351
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:04,096
Them to be different I just don't understand why you would want to be involved

2352
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:05,120
Any of that

2353
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:11,776
Like I don't want to know what yeah I don't want I don't want to be I don't want to be good in this morality

2354
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:14,080
Missy this seems even more you could be

2355
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:16,640
Even more somehow evil

2356
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:18,688
In his morality

2357
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:25,088
Confusion incoherent today

2358
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:27,648
I might be the devil I don't know

2359
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:30,464
Balmoral chase like Skye

2360
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:34,816
Should I tell my wife she looks pretty today or do I have to be 100% honest

2361
01:52:35,072 --> 01:52:41,216
Is me telling her she looks pretty going to take away her Freewheel to dress herself and she's no chooses

2362
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:43,264
Play the devil man

2363
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:44,032
Wolf

2364
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:44,800
There's almost

2365
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:46,592
It is Paralyzer

2366
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:48,128
Terrified

2367
01:52:48,384 --> 01:52:48,896
But look

2368
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:50,944
Anyway

2369
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:52,224
Has weird rules

2370
01:52:52,736 --> 01:52:55,040
The devil's followers barkhurst

2371
01:52:55,296 --> 01:52:56,576
Hey man

2372
01:52:56,832 --> 01:53:00,160
Sore God's but we've gotten to where we've gotten

2373
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:03,744
The more you you just got to resist

2374
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:05,792
Enemies

2375
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:07,072
Lego

2376
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:07,840
Is that

2377
01:53:08,352 --> 01:53:11,168
What they're doing a show focused so diabolical

2378
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:13,728
So over-the-top

2379
01:53:13,984 --> 01:53:16,288
That people just have real trouble

2380
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:18,848
Grasping

2381
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:23,968
And they project their own

2382
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:26,528
Mindset on the establishment

2383
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:31,136
People don't want to face that people don't want

2384
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:34,976
Then I can just deny it and it's like a problem at the

2385
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:37,792
Is the foul

2386
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:45,984
And so the more you resist

2387
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:49,824
This is going to be over with

2388
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:52,896
Going to go to the fire

2389
01:53:54,176 --> 01:53:54,688
But

2390
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:01,600
Is going to destroy

2391
01:54:02,112 --> 01:54:06,208
When I hear that I hear something along the lines of like

2392
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:08,512
I've been out hey likes Albarn

2393
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:10,816
The more you fight

2394
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:12,096
The better it'll be

2395
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:14,400
Yep so why not

2396
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:16,448
I don't get what I want

2397
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:18,240
Everyone's going to

2398
01:54:18,496 --> 01:54:19,520
Todai

2399
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:30,272
Black I wanted to I want there to be a 10-yard penalty for him being like

2400
01:54:30,528 --> 01:54:36,672
People project onto the establishment because things are too difficult for them to understand and then they want to live in denial

2401
01:54:36,928 --> 01:54:39,744
Aflac

2402
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,048
So Alex

2403
01:54:42,304 --> 01:54:43,072
From this path of like

2404
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:44,352
As higher

2405
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:47,168
Will I live through the fire fire

2406
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:49,728
Amy wants to hit on some of his

2407
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:51,520
Modern Talking Point

2408
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:52,288
Janesville

2409
01:54:53,056 --> 01:54:54,080
All these articles about

2410
01:54:54,336 --> 01:54:58,432
Looking for an interview Maddie good for you

2411
01:54:58,944 --> 01:55:01,248
You are going to drink storage

2412
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,832
Going to drink

2413
01:55:05,088 --> 01:55:06,112
Weeds

2414
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:13,024
I will not be adding more people in a test tube

2415
01:55:16,608 --> 01:55:17,888
Assignment German by the way

2416
01:55:20,448 --> 01:55:25,824
The Russian accent afford another language

2417
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:28,128
So I think that's one of those things it's like

2418
01:55:28,384 --> 01:55:32,224
Really easy to see through like what he's lying about

2419
01:55:32,992 --> 01:55:34,272
Take me to direct quotes

2420
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:38,624
I will feed you dog

2421
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:40,928
Pirates this is what you will do these are at

2422
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:45,024
Germany by the way

2423
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:46,048
German map

2424
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:50,144
Without even doing any looking into any of this

2425
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:55,264
Like it would be so easy for someone to be like oh yeah he's talking about like sewage treatment plant

2426
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:57,312
Turning that into potable water

2427
01:55:57,568 --> 01:56:02,688
And you know the potential of weeds as being a cultivated food source

2428
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:08,832
Think of turning things that we usually think of is not good into things that are good that's called

2429
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:11,136
Like weeds are things

2430
01:56:11,392 --> 01:56:12,416
Is it grow without any

2431
01:56:12,672 --> 01:56:17,024
If there were a way that you could turn that into

2432
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:21,376
Renewable water is something lb

2433
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:22,656
Increasingly important

2434
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:25,216
In the future

2435
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:25,984
Species

2436
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:31,104
Food

2437
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:34,432
A matter of poop

2438
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:38,272
Silly

2439
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:40,832
Anyway Alex's Uno

2440
01:56:43,136 --> 01:56:46,976

01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:03,872
Cam

2444
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:05,152
Flipping out

2445
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:12,064
Covid prediction for Project Runway

2446
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:14,624
In March of last year

2447
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:16,672
So full

2448
01:57:20,256 --> 01:57:22,048
11 months before it was even

2449
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:30,496
Globalist like to put stuff

2450
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:35,616
Movies that are culturally want to tell you

2451
01:57:38,944 --> 01:57:42,528
Serial killers

2452
01:57:45,088 --> 01:57:45,856
You know what

2453
01:57:46,112 --> 01:57:47,904
My instinct whenever somebody's like

2454
01:57:48,928 --> 01:57:55,072
Project one Runway predict something in March of last years ago now I get the f*** out of here but when it gets paid off

2455
01:57:55,328 --> 01:57:56,608
Where do the globalist put

2456
01:57:57,376 --> 01:58:03,008
Fashion shows for Project Runway that's where they hide all of their secrets

2457
01:58:03,264 --> 01:58:07,616
Punch Club comes up with an evil plan to make people eat spinach

2458
01:58:07,872 --> 01:58:12,992
I've been Tim Gunn says make it happen

2459
01:58:13,248 --> 01:58:14,272

01:58:14,784 --> 01:58:20,160
It work make it work make it work

2461
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:22,976
The necks of mine from years

2462
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:25,280
Town of that show

2463
01:58:25,536 --> 01:58:26,816
Is that where you first

2464
01:58:27,072 --> 01:58:28,608
No I didn't want to

2465
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:31,680
I hooked into this though it's just

2466
01:58:31,936 --> 01:58:33,728
Curse you looked into it so there was a

2467
01:58:33,984 --> 01:58:35,776
Contestant whose name was covid with a

2468
01:58:36,032 --> 01:58:37,568
Okay what is the Sanskrit word

2469
01:58:39,872 --> 01:58:41,152
I'm already off

2470
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:47,552
So there was a challenge galbi head-to-toe challenge

2471
01:58:47,808 --> 01:58:53,952
Okay dude

2472
01:58:54,208 --> 01:58:55,232
The outfit involved the mask

2473
01:58:55,488 --> 01:58:56,768
Haha and so like

2474
01:58:57,024 --> 01:59:01,632
Made a man cuz I got it

2475
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:08,032
Coincidences it's great we all have a great time if you wanted to take a really easy route you can maybe make a hat

2476
01:59:08,544 --> 01:59:11,872
But the math get something and maybe a little bit more

2477
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:15,200
Adventurous maybe a little more difficult to pull off as you are

2478
01:59:15,456 --> 01:59:18,016
Show me just so happen that the person's name was covid with a

2479
01:59:18,272 --> 01:59:19,552
The K which is not the same word

2480
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:22,112
Are you sure the globalist didn't

2481
01:59:22,368 --> 01:59:22,880
Plants

2482
01:59:23,136 --> 01:59:23,648
A person named

2483
01:59:23,904 --> 01:59:24,416
Covid

2484
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:26,208
To make a mask in order to give us

2485
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:28,000
Cosmic realization

2486
01:59:28,256 --> 01:59:31,072
Eventually a pandemic would be coming name covid

2487
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:32,864
And they will be using Mass

2488
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:34,144
Kane order to

2489
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:37,472
Turn us into their own models

2490
01:59:37,728 --> 01:59:39,264
Project

2491
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:45,664
No fun way and quite frankly

2492
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:52,832
You know it also is really interesting is like I couldn't laugh unless Alex

2493
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:54,112
Found out

2494
01:59:54,624 --> 01:59:57,184
Like unless Alex reported on this trip

2495
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:58,976
Couldn't

2496
01:59:59,232 --> 02:00:00,256
It's a joke

2497
02:00:00,512 --> 02:00:04,864
It's too subtle for anyone to get

2498
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:06,144
Terrible dancer.

2499
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:07,680
But Alex doesn't need them

2500
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:11,264
Empire

2501
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:14,336
Okay well that's true

2502
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:15,872
By the way

2503
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:18,688
Spitting image of Prince Charles

2504
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:24,576
How do you need understand

2505
02:00:25,088 --> 02:00:25,856
Biloxi

2506
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:34,560
So

2507
02:00:36,864 --> 02:00:37,632
Neither

2508
02:00:40,192 --> 02:00:41,728
Rollover 2.0

2509
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:44,800
Like Count Dracula

2510
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:45,568
Want

2511
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:48,384
His genetics

2512
02:00:49,152 --> 02:00:51,200
Blood he wants to defile you

2513
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:52,992
He wants to play

2514
02:00:54,016 --> 02:00:57,856
Kids material into your cells and overwrite your cell cell by cell

2515
02:00:58,368 --> 02:01:00,672
It's not a flying saucer crash down in Antarctica

2516
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:02,464
In the movie The Thing

2517
02:01:04,512 --> 02:01:05,024
Their paint

2518
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:09,120
No paintings

2519
02:01:11,168 --> 02:01:12,448
It's not the movie The Hunger

2520
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:15,520
They look under the microscope

2521
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:17,824
Then they see the vampire cell

2522
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:19,104
Taking over the other cell

2523
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:20,128
I didn't see that one

2524
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:21,408
How to check it out

2525
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:22,944
David Bowie movie

2526
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:26,016
David Bowie movie

2527
02:01:26,528 --> 02:01:28,576
It's the real world Outdoors

2528
02:01:32,928 --> 02:01:33,696
Let me just do this

2529
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:38,816
Anybody to fight this war

2530
02:01:42,912 --> 02:01:48,032
Expensive as hell

2531
02:01:49,824 --> 02:01:55,968
The f****** garlic bills

2532
02:01:56,224 --> 02:01:59,808
Movies that have stuck with the old ways you know it's very cost-effective

2533
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:03,392
If you can find cheap steak material just about anywhere garlic you know

2534
02:02:03,648 --> 02:02:09,792
The leader Blade movies where you have to have high-tech stuff in the Underworld movies where you got to do all that stuff yet

2535
02:02:10,304 --> 02:02:12,864
Stays the same basically put a steak

2536
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:13,888
Through its heart

2537
02:02:14,144 --> 02:02:15,680
I'm on light

2538
02:02:15,936 --> 02:02:16,448
Garlic

2539
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:17,216
Garlic

2540
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:18,496
Keep them away

2541
02:02:18,752 --> 02:02:24,896
I have a little garlic

2542
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:30,784
She's scared of these things but Alex is really worried about. I have some garlic

2543
02:02:32,064 --> 02:02:32,576
We're good to go

2544
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:34,624
And

2545
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:36,160
Not black cat

2546
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:37,440
True so

2547
02:02:37,952 --> 02:02:40,512
Aldosterone

2548
02:02:42,304 --> 02:02:43,328
She lost her eye to

2549
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:44,864
Could be a vampire

2550
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:45,888
Been fighting a lichen

2551
02:02:49,728 --> 02:02:50,752
Pennywise

2552
02:02:51,264 --> 02:02:53,824
Alex is like the end of that last clip with a plug cuz corsi

2553
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:56,128
This leads to an

2554
02:02:56,640 --> 02:02:57,920
Doing that long

2555
02:02:58,176 --> 02:03:00,992
Plug

2556
02:03:01,248 --> 02:03:05,088
Convoluted story about why he's not selling superblue anymore

2557
02:03:05,344 --> 02:03:08,160
Eagle your listeners will remember that the reason

2558
02:03:08,416 --> 02:03:09,440
Is because he got a season

2559
02:03:09,696 --> 02:03:13,536
The fifth letter from the Attorney General of New York

2560
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:16,608
We have the charcoal

2561
02:03:19,168 --> 02:03:19,680
That

2562
02:03:20,192 --> 02:03:20,704
Is amazing

2563
02:03:26,592 --> 02:03:28,128
Your Superbowl

2564
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:34,016
And tried to get me arrested

2565
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:37,344
Still trying buddy

2566
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:38,112
Everything

2567
02:03:38,624 --> 02:03:39,136
And

2568
02:03:40,928 --> 02:03:47,072
The problem is if I sell it they'll lie again and say he's telling the truth that all these people flooded by thinking insecure

2569
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:01,408
Mafia.

2570
02:04:05,504 --> 02:04:09,856
Feel like if everybody's a lying about how you're selling this

2571
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:12,416
That's not a reason to stop

2572
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:13,440
It's just don't

2573
02:04:13,696 --> 02:04:14,208
Do the things

2574
02:04:14,464 --> 02:04:16,512
Doing those things

2575
02:04:17,536 --> 02:04:21,888
Skip right right right alright if you have nothing to fear then you have nothing to fear

2576
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:23,424
Like I don't give a s*** like

2577
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:24,960
There's no affidavit

2578
02:04:25,216 --> 02:04:26,240
If someone could file

2579
02:04:26,496 --> 02:04:29,312
Lakewood say I was under the

2580
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:30,080
Impression

2581
02:04:30,848 --> 02:04:36,736
This would stop me from getting covid-19 if you didn't do anything

2582
02:04:36,992 --> 02:04:40,832
Yeah yeah yeah when those affidavits

2583
02:04:41,088 --> 02:04:42,624
Directly quote you

2584
02:04:43,136 --> 02:04:47,488
As having said something and then they go and they look and you said that stuff

2585
02:04:48,256 --> 02:04:53,376
That's the reason to stop selling that you stopped

2586
02:04:53,632 --> 02:04:54,656
Problem

2587
02:04:54,912 --> 02:04:56,960
So Alex doesn't mention this

2588
02:04:57,216 --> 02:04:59,008
Specifically on the epi

2589
02:04:59,264 --> 02:05:00,032
Episode B

2590
02:05:00,288 --> 02:05:01,568
Project Veritas has

2591
02:05:01,824 --> 02:05:07,200
Is a new little thing going on because I don't care

2592
02:05:08,224 --> 02:05:11,296
But apparently James O'Keefe made of

2593
02:05:12,064 --> 02:05:13,856
The auto CNN

2594
02:05:14,112 --> 02:05:16,416
Morning editorial call

2595
02:05:16,928 --> 02:05:17,696
And lives

2596
02:05:17,952 --> 02:05:18,464
Streamed it

2597
02:05:18,976 --> 02:05:22,048
You know soon as I got Jeff Zucker coming for you

2598
02:05:22,304 --> 02:05:25,376
Okay can get into the places where you think your private

2599
02:05:25,632 --> 02:05:26,144
In like

2600
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:27,424
Are all like

2601
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:32,544
We have lawyers that you not be here or we'll see

2602
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:34,592
I hope

2603
02:05:34,848 --> 02:05:36,640
Blow up in James O'Keefe space at all

2604
02:05:36,896 --> 02:05:38,944
Really do it again being facetious really hoping

2605
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:41,760
Alex doesn't mention this stuff

2606
02:05:42,272 --> 02:05:43,040
He does have

2607
02:05:43,296 --> 02:05:46,880
A weird out-of-nowhere obsession with Jeff Zucker

2608
02:05:47,136 --> 02:05:48,416
Seems to be related

2609
02:05:48,928 --> 02:05:49,952
What are the photo of

2610
02:05:50,208 --> 02:05:50,720
Jeff Zucker

2611
02:05:51,488 --> 02:05:52,512
Just like Brian stelter

2612
02:05:56,096 --> 02:05:57,888
Always So Satisfied

2613
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:03,264
He makes millions of dollars

2614
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:04,288
He's a joke

2615
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:08,640
By the way he knows he's

2616
02:06:11,712 --> 02:06:12,736
A smog nobody

2617
02:06:14,016 --> 02:06:15,040
That's why he wants to bring you down

2618
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:16,832
Hates

2619
02:06:17,856 --> 02:06:18,368
You have

2620
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:19,392
Christmas

2621
02:06:23,488 --> 02:06:24,256
Pink sheep

2622
02:06:24,512 --> 02:06:28,352
Because you got wonderful wife and children will never be

2623
02:06:28,608 --> 02:06:29,376
A good person

2624
02:06:30,144 --> 02:06:31,168
He is a filthy

2625
02:06:31,424 --> 02:06:32,448
Degenerate

2626
02:06:32,704 --> 02:06:33,472
Cleavage

2627
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,800
Little much

2628
02:06:38,848 --> 02:06:40,640
I I can't say that

2629
02:06:40,896 --> 02:06:42,176
Intended to be anti-Semitic

2630
02:06:42,432 --> 02:06:43,968
But holyshit

2631
02:06:44,224 --> 02:06:46,528
Is that trafficking at anti-semitism

2632
02:06:46,784 --> 02:06:50,368
Classical

2633
02:06:50,624 --> 02:06:53,952
The hates you and you have a good cream when you have a good Christmas

2634
02:06:56,768 --> 02:07:00,864
God he loves it when you have a good birthday but he hates it when you have a good Christmas

2635
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:07,264
So ridiculous I don't know I mean I know somebody that Alex had bro

2636
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:09,824
Brought up in the past

2637
02:07:10,336 --> 02:07:14,432
Sweet stranger to Alex's world but he's definitely not someone who's front

2638
02:07:14,688 --> 02:07:16,480
Center for an hour

2639
02:07:16,736 --> 02:07:18,784
If you well yeah yeah

2640
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:20,576
It did it the focus is very

2641
02:07:20,832 --> 02:07:23,648
Glaring

2642
02:07:23,904 --> 02:07:24,416
Catch some of the

2643
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:26,464
That's what I'm saying he's

2644
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:27,744
I think he's today

2645
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,024
The Boogeyman

2646
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:35,936
I think that even Alex recognizes that James O'Keefe stuff is best to stay away from

2647
02:07:39,776 --> 02:07:42,592
I think this one might be too much

2648
02:07:42,848 --> 02:07:43,872
I don't even know if it's like

2649
02:07:44,128 --> 02:07:45,408
Consequences just might be like

2650
02:07:45,664 --> 02:07:48,224
I don't know if this is a little soft

2651
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:49,504
Have to stay awake

2652
02:07:50,272 --> 02:07:51,296
Kick Jeff Zucker

2653
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:52,064
Why not

2654
02:07:52,576 --> 02:07:55,648
Best way for Trump to remain present

2655
02:07:56,672 --> 02:07:57,440
Is to just

2656
02:07:57,696 --> 02:07:58,208
Do it

2657
02:08:00,512 --> 02:08:01,536
The elector

2658
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:05,376
I think he should go with the American people

2659
02:08:05,888 --> 02:08:06,656
Resolute desk

2660
02:08:06,912 --> 02:08:07,936
Show all this evidence

2661
02:08:09,472 --> 02:08:14,336
Safe with me American people

2662
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:16,640
I know I'm going to that event

2663
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:19,968
By the way I'm taking that big March over we started before

2664
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:21,248
These women hijacked

2665
02:08:22,016 --> 02:08:24,576
You can't even hear another microphone

2666
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:27,392
I'll be there Wilmar slaughterhouse

2667
02:08:27,648 --> 02:08:28,672
I'll see you there

2668
02:08:28,928 --> 02:08:31,232
500000 people there also

2669
02:08:31,744 --> 02:08:32,768
You co-opted there

2670
02:08:33,024 --> 02:08:39,168
Yeah they have the permit you drove there

2671
02:08:39,424 --> 02:08:42,752
Good for you

2672
02:08:43,264 --> 02:08:49,408
Stole their vet again and pretend they're stealing your event when they organized didn't have the permits

2673
02:08:50,176 --> 02:08:50,944
Holyshit

2674
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:52,992
Alex

2675
02:08:53,248 --> 02:08:55,808
Is on his way to another Tea Party

2676
02:09:00,672 --> 02:09:03,232
Trends we know his patterns of behavior

2677
02:09:03,744 --> 02:09:04,512
We know what he did with

2678
02:09:04,768 --> 02:09:05,280
The Tea Party

2679
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:06,048
More like

2680
02:09:06,304 --> 02:09:07,072
Claiming

2681
02:09:07,328 --> 02:09:09,632
They were co-opting his movement what have you

2682
02:09:10,144 --> 02:09:16,032
And I think you could see it happening a little bit again smaller-scale

2683
02:09:16,544 --> 02:09:17,312
At least at this point

2684
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:21,152
Because the people who are having these rallies in d.c.

2685
02:09:21,408 --> 02:09:22,688
Are to sort of like

2686
02:09:22,944 --> 02:09:23,456
Remnants of

2687
02:09:23,712 --> 02:09:25,248
Liberty party short people

2688
02:09:26,016 --> 02:09:27,808
Anymore

2689
02:09:28,064 --> 02:09:30,112
Now we're at a point where like Alex

2690
02:09:30,368 --> 02:09:33,440
He's probably more hooked up with The Fringe in the

2691
02:09:33,696 --> 02:09:34,464
Sizeable crowd

2692
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:35,744
True true

2693
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,792
He might actually be able to co-opt

2694
02:09:38,048 --> 02:09:38,560
Them far more

2695
02:09:38,816 --> 02:09:39,584
Successfully then

2696
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:40,352
His attempt

2697
02:09:40,608 --> 02:09:42,144
To take over Glenn Beck

2698
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:44,192
Beckwith on TV

2699
02:09:44,448 --> 02:09:46,240
Yeah Alex was the voice in the woods

2700
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:48,032
But

2701
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:50,080
I think I think one of the

2702
02:09:50,336 --> 02:09:53,664
Parts of what Alex and his credibility now is

2703
02:09:54,176 --> 02:09:54,688
Best friend

2704
02:09:54,944 --> 02:09:55,712
Rodger Stone

2705
02:09:56,736 --> 02:09:58,016
And just like we had Steve

2706
02:09:58,272 --> 02:09:59,808
Come in on the on December 1st

2707
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:01,344
Now we have Steve

2708
02:10:02,368 --> 02:10:03,904
That we have

2709
02:10:06,208 --> 02:10:08,512
I don't understand why that slip of the tongue happen

2710
02:10:09,024 --> 02:10:09,792
Rodger swinging

2711
02:10:10,304 --> 02:10:11,072
Okay good

2712
02:10:11,328 --> 02:10:15,168
But thanks for the fences I don't mean like a lemon tea

2713
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:18,496
The first clip is the bad kind of the swing

2714
02:10:20,544 --> 02:10:22,080
Biking Barcelona

2715
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:24,384
The president has to have

2716
02:10:30,016 --> 02:10:30,528
Is quid

2717
02:10:32,576 --> 02:10:33,856
Powerful forces

2718
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:37,952
Music

2719
02:10:40,256 --> 02:10:40,768
Armies

2720
02:10:44,608 --> 02:10:45,888
This is God's Nation

2721
02:10:46,144 --> 02:10:46,912
I believe

2722
02:10:48,704 --> 02:10:49,216
This job

2723
02:10:49,984 --> 02:10:51,520
When

2724
02:10:55,872 --> 02:10:58,176
In his resolve your tell Nixon about it

2725
02:10:58,432 --> 02:10:58,944
Oh boy

2726
02:11:00,992 --> 02:11:03,296
I just love the idea of like a Rodger

2727
02:11:05,088 --> 02:11:09,440
The 70s

2728
02:11:09,696 --> 02:11:11,232
Chose you for this

2729
02:11:12,256 --> 02:11:18,400
Live Your Life music bag

2730
02:11:18,656 --> 02:11:19,168
That would be great

2731
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:20,960
This next clip Jordan

2732
02:11:21,472 --> 02:11:22,752
Maybe one of my favorite

2733
02:11:24,288 --> 02:11:25,312
I can't like

2734
02:11:25,568 --> 02:11:26,848
Steve's had some big ones

2735
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:28,128
Just about himself

2736
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:29,152
What booster

2737
02:11:29,408 --> 02:11:32,992
Steve stuff is like really braggadocio

2738
02:11:33,248 --> 02:11:33,760
The most important

2739
02:11:34,016 --> 02:11:36,064
Person I've done everything important

2740
02:11:36,576 --> 02:11:38,624
I overthrew Ghana

2741
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:41,184
Twice yeah. Steve comes in

2742
02:11:41,952 --> 02:11:42,720
Project

2743
02:11:43,744 --> 02:11:47,328
Again you're doing it again okay let's hear it

2744
02:11:52,192 --> 02:11:53,216
Convertible

2745
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:02,176
Agree

2746
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:03,968
If this Ruth

2747
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:08,320
Enforcement

2748
02:12:09,088 --> 02:12:10,368
It would be proof of

2749
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:13,696
Foreign involvement

2750
02:12:14,208 --> 02:12:17,024
This is the best

2751
02:12:18,048 --> 02:12:18,560
Korean

2752
02:12:19,328 --> 02:12:20,096
Let me watch

2753
02:12:20,352 --> 02:12:21,120
AR

2754
02:12:21,632 --> 02:12:22,400
Northbrook

2755
02:12:22,656 --> 02:12:27,520
Korean they arrived in Maine

2756
02:12:28,032 --> 02:12:31,104
In the world

2757
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:35,456
I had to come by boat to deliver

2758
02:12:37,248 --> 02:12:38,016
Man

2759
02:12:40,576 --> 02:12:46,720
The number of questions the Oscars who raises brings this claim into the territory of

2760
02:12:46,976 --> 02:12:49,280
That is a swig that is a swing for the fence

2761
02:12:49,536 --> 02:12:55,680
If this is a sprawling conspiracy involving tons of countries and US actors why did North Korea have the ballot

2762
02:12:55,936 --> 02:12:57,216
Why couldn't he have been print

2763
02:12:57,472 --> 02:13:01,824
Domestically why would these conspirators need to print the ballot in North Korea that have the

2764
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:03,872
The country that's under the heaviest surveillance

2765
02:13:04,128 --> 02:13:05,664
And under very strict embargoes

2766
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:07,968
Carry-out delivery by sea

2767
02:13:08,224 --> 02:13:11,296
I don't know what the cargo was

2768
02:13:11,552 --> 02:13:12,064
Also

2769
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:18,464
You were sort of why would they arrive in Maine

2770
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:24,864
Not realize that in order for a North Korean boat to reach main they would need to either navigate south of Africa then head north

2771
02:13:25,120 --> 02:13:29,472
Or Transit through the Panama Canal

2772
02:13:33,056 --> 02:13:36,640
North Korea would have a much easier but still almost ridiculously

2773
02:13:36,896 --> 02:13:37,664
Possible time

2774
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:38,944
Getting a boat to the West

2775
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:39,712
Coast

2776
02:13:41,248 --> 02:13:43,552
They're short lines on the scene

2777
02:13:44,064 --> 02:13:47,392
We're just imagining that these North Korean boats

2778
02:13:47,648 --> 02:13:50,208
Can show up wherever they want then why would they go to Hawaii

2779
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:52,256
It's definitely the closest shot

2780
02:13:52,512 --> 02:13:58,656
Literally there could not be a more complicated Coastal State for North Korea to get to Benton Maine

2781
02:13:58,912 --> 02:14:04,288
Visit Russia must be intensely embarrassing for Trump

2782
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:08,640
Like I do bent over backwards trying to impress in a piece Kim Jong-kook

2783
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:14,272
Is dictator buddy sends a boat full of ballots halfway across the world to screw them over

2784
02:14:14,528 --> 02:14:16,064
That seems like an indication

2785
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:17,088
Filmmaking skills

2786
02:14:17,344 --> 02:14:18,112
Or with a cracked up

2787
02:14:19,392 --> 02:14:20,672
I mean this sincerely Jordan

2788
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:27,072
This is the most amazingly stupid fiery that I think I've ever hired someone tonight I started towards never heard anything

2789
02:14:27,328 --> 02:14:27,840
Like this

2790
02:14:28,096 --> 02:14:31,168
In my entire life there have been Dumber theories I think

2791
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:32,960
This is something that Rodger is

2792
02:14:33,216 --> 02:14:34,752
Suggesting is being supported by quote

2793
02:14:35,008 --> 02:14:37,056
Absolute incontrovertible

2794
02:14:37,312 --> 02:14:38,592
I am more likely

2795
02:14:38,848 --> 02:14:40,384
To believe the Earth is

2796
02:14:40,640 --> 02:14:42,688
Flat then that North Korea

2797
02:14:42,944 --> 02:14:44,224
Could successfully

2798
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:46,016
Secretly get boats

2799
02:14:46,528 --> 02:14:47,808
To mate

2800
02:14:49,088 --> 02:14:50,368
. Love Ballad

2801
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:52,672
I mean like

2802
02:14:52,928 --> 02:14:55,744
A dinghy with North Korea printed on the

2803
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:56,768
Couldn't

2804
02:14:57,024 --> 02:14:58,816
Get the maid from North Korea

2805
02:15:00,608 --> 02:15:02,912
North Korea

2806
02:15:03,168 --> 02:15:04,448
State of North Korea

2807
02:15:04,704 --> 02:15:09,824
Get a boat full of ballots to man why are we worried about their rocket program

2808
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:11,360
Like chicken

2809
02:15:11,616 --> 02:15:12,384
Bring a bomb

2810
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:17,504
Northridge

2811
02:15:18,272 --> 02:15:22,624
Bucket lift above into Main and then walk away and get on their boats and

2812
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:23,648
Click a button and like

2813
02:15:23,904 --> 02:15:30,048
I feel like Rogers acting like the surveillance on North Korea is Joe

2814
02:15:30,304 --> 02:15:31,584
Just like a guy asleep

2815
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:36,448
It must be made in front of a bunch of monitors

2816
02:15:36,704 --> 02:15:39,264
Picture of the room that they were supposed to be monitoring in the

2817
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:40,288
Camera so it look

2818
02:15:40,544 --> 02:15:43,616
Looks like that the picture on top of the

2819
02:15:44,896 --> 02:15:46,176
I'm baffled by this

2820
02:15:46,432 --> 02:15:52,576
I do think that this is the kind of thing you can get someone to say whenever you get them out of prison yet

2821
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:59,744
Yeah sure I'll say whatever the f*** you want man destined to be here by God in North Korean boats

2822
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,560
So the only reason you lost the election

2823
02:16:02,816 --> 02:16:05,120
Hey buddy I got takeout last night

2824
02:16:05,376 --> 02:16:09,728
Instead of being in jail so guess what North Korea did it to Maine don't care

2825
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:12,800
Moving on because someone had to have made this up

2826
02:16:13,312 --> 02:16:15,616
And that means it's someone made up

2827
02:16:15,872 --> 02:16:16,896
A story with

2828
02:16:17,152 --> 02:16:17,920
The stupidest

2829
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:20,736
Possibly be something else

2830
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:21,760
This is based on

2831
02:16:23,296 --> 02:16:24,832
I don't know tell me on an in

2832
02:16:25,088 --> 02:16:26,880
Sylveon and non-income

2833
02:16:27,136 --> 02:16:33,280
Show me Anaconda thoroughly controvertible docu I tried to look for some indication of what the f*** Rodger was talking

2834
02:16:33,536 --> 02:16:37,632
About any story that I could find had to do with what you're saying

2835
02:16:38,144 --> 02:16:40,448
So I don't know I don't know maybe

2836
02:16:40,704 --> 02:16:43,264
Deep thing on Twitter I couldn't find it's a big

2837
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:45,824
That's a big swing this was another qanon

2838
02:16:48,128 --> 02:16:48,640
Goddamn

2839
02:16:48,896 --> 02:16:50,944
Rodger play out loud

2840
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:52,224
Rodger

2841
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:54,272
Put a globe in front of you and then

2842
02:16:54,528 --> 02:16:55,040
Just

2843
02:16:55,296 --> 02:16:56,320
Don't give me any

2844
02:16:57,344 --> 02:16:57,856
Put a globe

2845
02:16:58,368 --> 02:16:58,880
On your desk

2846
02:16:59,904 --> 02:17:03,744
Just point show me avocado

2847
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:08,352
Not asking for details

2848
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:10,400
Who is your master

2849
02:17:16,544 --> 02:17:22,688
Maybe try to get through the Straits of Gibraltar

2850
02:17:22,944 --> 02:17:23,456
Very serious question

2851
02:17:23,712 --> 02:17:24,736
Did it go

2852
02:17:25,248 --> 02:17:25,760
Through the

2853
02:17:26,528 --> 02:17:27,040
I think

2854
02:17:27,296 --> 02:17:32,160
But the only stay it would be more difficult to get a boat to leave Kansas

2855
02:17:36,256 --> 02:17:40,608
Killer take a huge wave get up there

2856
02:17:40,864 --> 02:17:42,400
BlackRock from ship

2857
02:17:43,168 --> 02:17:48,800
Aldo is easier

2858
02:17:49,568 --> 02:17:50,080
So

2859
02:17:50,336 --> 02:17:51,104
That's silly

2860
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:52,128
Tim Rogers

2861
02:17:53,408 --> 02:17:56,480
This mixed with Rodger is like a man you forgotten the script

2862
02:17:57,248 --> 02:18:00,320
I have a very high regard for Sidney Powell

2863
02:18:03,648 --> 02:18:05,952
Mayor Rudy Giuliani who I've had enough

2864
02:18:06,208 --> 02:18:06,720
Friendship with

2865
02:18:07,232 --> 02:18:08,512
Since his first

2866
02:18:09,536 --> 02:18:10,816
Former mayor of New York City

2867
02:18:11,072 --> 02:18:13,888
Hey guy didn't Rudy cover up 9/11

2868
02:18:14,144 --> 02:18:17,728
No forgiving part of Pasadena

2869
02:18:17,984 --> 02:18:18,496
Don't worry about it

2870
02:18:18,752 --> 02:18:21,056
Rodger also thinks that

2871
02:18:21,312 --> 02:18:22,592
Supporters need to get aggressive

2872
02:18:22,848 --> 02:18:24,896
And they need to force legislators

2873
02:18:25,152 --> 02:18:26,176
To just say hey Trump

2874
02:18:26,432 --> 02:18:27,968
School let him stay president

2875
02:18:28,480 --> 02:18:30,528
And then we get a very familiar phenomena

2876
02:18:32,064 --> 02:18:33,088
Supporters of the president

2877
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:34,880
In the tri-states

2878
02:18:35,136 --> 02:18:36,416
Need to begin now

2879
02:18:36,672 --> 02:18:37,696
Contact

2880
02:18:41,536 --> 02:18:42,048
Or your state

2881
02:18:48,448 --> 02:18:48,960
The president

2882
02:18:53,824 --> 02:18:54,592
Certification

2883
02:19:00,736 --> 02:19:03,040
The stonewalling there's no evidence is

2884
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:09,440
Stonewall

2885
02:19:10,208 --> 02:19:16,352
Newmar the German guy well to Rodger

2886
02:19:16,608 --> 02:19:18,912
Promo code

2887
02:19:19,168 --> 02:19:20,192
Would you put Patriot

2888
02:19:20,704 --> 02:19:22,496
Are on the website

2889
02:19:22,752 --> 02:19:26,080
He's like I never do promo codes I started

2890
02:19:26,592 --> 02:19:32,736
I don't think I have heard him do a promo code

2891
02:19:32,992 --> 02:19:33,760
Whatever

2892
02:19:34,016 --> 02:19:38,368
You chose to be thoroughly bucko. No sooner or later yeah

2893
02:19:38,624 --> 02:19:43,488
Feel like he does do promo codes very often I can't think of a time where we made fun of him

2894
02:19:43,744 --> 02:19:44,512
I don't know what that means

2895
02:19:44,768 --> 02:19:48,352
But he didn't get them to talk about how you get an extra 10% off buddy

2896
02:19:48,608 --> 02:19:49,632
I'm not buying s***

2897
02:19:50,144 --> 02:19:51,424
You need fish oil

2898
02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:53,472
Sure they did

2899
02:19:56,544 --> 02:19:58,848
Remind you you're the reason we're all here thank you

2900
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:00,896
These are great products you and your family need

2901
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:03,712
34 Shelburne Manistee specials

2902
02:20:03,968 --> 02:20:04,480
Temperature

2903
02:20:04,736 --> 02:20:05,248
Something for everybody

2904
02:20:06,528 --> 02:20:07,296
But that's their brains

2905
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:11,648
It's like a purse

2906
02:20:13,440 --> 02:20:14,464
Sugar

2907
02:20:18,304 --> 02:20:20,096
Yeah I don't I don't know if it's like

2908
02:20:20,352 --> 02:20:26,496
Fish oil or sugar or sugar is glucose

2909
02:20:29,312 --> 02:20:34,432
Omega threes or whatever you would like a big boy

2910
02:20:34,944 --> 02:20:40,320
I can't imagine the conversation between parents like one of them to Alexander's I can give the kids fish oil

2911
02:20:40,576 --> 02:20:45,440
No we're going to Sugar Sugar pills every morning

2912
02:20:47,744 --> 02:20:53,120
So at this point in the episode Alex realizes that Lynn Lynnwood

2913
02:20:53,376 --> 02:20:56,960
Attorney is doing now the press conference

2914
02:20:57,472 --> 02:20:59,008
Batshit quite

2915
02:20:59,264 --> 02:21:04,640
Absolute wildbad

2916
02:21:04,896 --> 02:21:07,456
I love it

2917
02:21:08,992 --> 02:21:11,808
1776 will commence again

2918
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:13,600
We're going to send that message

2919
02:21:15,136 --> 02:21:16,416
Where do I send that message

2920
02:21:17,696 --> 02:21:18,720
Did George Soros

2921
02:21:19,232 --> 02:21:24,608
Hahaha

2922

That is a Hitler rally that's not a non Hitler rally that is a Hitler rally where Hitler would Hitler

2926
02:21:42,272 --> 02:21:46,368
Out of our country literally Hitler

02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:47,392
That is

2928
02:21:47,904 --> 02:21:49,184
5 Hitler mustache

2929
02:21:53,024 --> 02:21:54,560
Just because you got to leave some room

2930
02:21:55,072 --> 02:21:56,096
There's more Hitler to be

2931
02:21:57,376 --> 02:22:00,192
Gets around to talking about

2932
02:22:00,704 --> 02:22:01,216
Hey

2933
02:22:01,472 --> 02:22:01,984
Look

2934
02:22:02,240 --> 02:22:02,752
The media

2935
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:04,032
Bad

2936
02:22:04,288 --> 02:22:06,592
Sure Thursday or are places that are good though

2937
02:22:07,616 --> 02:22:08,128
Well that's good

2938
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:11,712
Especially because this is being broadcast live on Infowars

2939
02:22:12,480 --> 02:22:15,552
Now everybody's been reading the media stop

2940
02:22:15,808 --> 02:22:16,320
July

2941
02:22:18,624 --> 02:22:19,904
You can't trust them

2942
02:22:21,696 --> 02:22:22,464
Newsmax

2943
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:27,072
They tell you the truth read the epoch times

2944
02:22:27,584 --> 02:22:28,608
They tell you the truth

2945
02:22:29,632 --> 02:22:32,448
Borg Queen Good and Evil

2946
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:35,264
Don't ever say a word to powerful

2947
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:37,824
That is sad

2948
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:39,616
That is sad

2949
02:22:40,128 --> 02:22:42,176
That is so sad even

2950
02:22:42,688 --> 02:22:48,832
F****** crazy people with nothing to lose are no powers than to associate himself sad

2951

Oh my God

2954
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,816
If they thought Infowars was going to grow

2955
02:22:59,072 --> 02:23:02,912
They would say n47ba better propaganda right now

2956
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:04,704
Coat rack

2957
02:23:04,960 --> 02:23:11,104
Person in a suit is better

2958
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:13,664
Disco track has done a great job

2959
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:14,944
Being there

2960
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:15,968
Not talking

2961
02:23:16,224 --> 02:23:17,248
Which is better than

2962
02:23:17,504 --> 02:23:18,016
Alex Jones

2963
02:23:18,272 --> 02:23:24,416
Yeah random person who doesn't have the intent baggage that Alex has

2964
02:23:24,672 --> 02:23:25,696
F****** pretend that the

02:23:25,952 --> 02:23:27,488
The president's son told him to invest

2966
02:23:27,744 --> 02:23:28,256
Forget something

2967
02:23:28,768 --> 02:23:31,072
Somebody's not embarrassing the sack yeah

2968
02:23:33,376 --> 02:23:34,656
Is like a vagabond

2969
02:23:34,912 --> 02:23:37,472
Back to it

2970
02:23:37,728 --> 02:23:38,496
Calls

2971
02:23:39,776 --> 02:23:41,056
So this this caller

2972
02:23:41,824 --> 02:23:43,616
Need two sides at War

2973
02:23:45,152 --> 02:23:46,176
Like doctor pieces

2974
02:23:47,712 --> 02:23:48,480
Is The Art of War

2975
02:23:48,736 --> 02:23:49,248
And God has

2976
02:23:49,504 --> 02:23:50,528
Drawing out the enemy

2977
02:23:50,784 --> 02:23:51,296
Now there

02:23:51,552 --> 02:23:52,064
Completely

2979
02:23:52,320 --> 02:23:53,600
Completely uncovered

2980
02:23:53,856 --> 02:23:55,136
And there's nothing that they you do

2981
02:23:56,416 --> 02:23:56,928
Have to do another

2982
02:23:57,440 --> 02:23:59,232
We the people will do the rest like

2983
02:23:59,488 --> 02:24:00,768
Glenwood Glenwood

2984
02:24:03,328 --> 02:24:04,608
Declaration of war date is

2985
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:06,144
January 11th

2986
02:24:06,400 --> 02:24:07,424
2021

2987
02:24:08,704 --> 02:24:09,216
Executive order

2988
02:24:09,472 --> 02:24:10,240
That was revived

2989
02:24:11,264 --> 02:24:12,032
12 2020

2990
02:24:12,544 --> 02:24:13,312

Do we know what's up

2992
02:24:14,848 --> 02:24:15,360
Are we ready

2993
02:24:15,616 --> 02:24:16,896
Are we the people ready to take

2994
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:19,200
From the globalist

2995
02:24:21,248 --> 02:24:22,528
You're saying he's not

2996
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:28,416
He's leaving at 9

2997
02:24:29,184 --> 02:24:31,744
Well we better hit the streets in like when was doing like we're doing

2998
02:24:33,792 --> 02:24:36,864
Trying to find meaning in your lack of leadership

2999
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:37,888
Yep yep

3000
02:24:38,144 --> 02:24:40,448
He wants us to be revolution

3001
02:24:41,472 --> 02:24:41,984
Wow

3002
02:24:45,312 --> 02:24:45,824
2020

3003
02:24:46,336 --> 02:24:49,408
We can't outsmart these idiots

3004
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:52,224
Still fighting a war

3005
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:54,784
Humans are not 50 years old

3006
02:24:56,064 --> 02:24:56,832
The issue is the rhogam

3007
02:24:57,088 --> 02:24:57,856
I'm coming up tomorrow

3008
02:24:58,368 --> 02:24:58,880
Now it's promote

3009
02:24:59,904 --> 02:25:01,184
And then the show takes

3010
02:25:01,696 --> 02:25:02,976
The leftist of left turn

3011
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:09,632
Logan

3012
02:25:09,888 --> 02:25:10,656
Is on the show tomorrow

3013
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:15,008
I'll look for that

3014
02:25:16,032 --> 02:25:17,312
Surprises

3015
02:25:20,640 --> 02:25:21,920
Steve pieczenik

3016
02:25:23,456 --> 02:25:24,224
I'm sorry works

3017
02:25:24,480 --> 02:25:25,504
Ecfr

3018
02:25:27,296 --> 02:25:27,808
That job

3019
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:29,088
He did run

3020
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:41,632
I just

3021
02:25:41,888 --> 02:25:44,960
Obama's CIA

3022
02:25:45,472 --> 02:25:48,544
The prompt on the staying in their Altima Global drawing

3023
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:55,456
Barclay mountain did everything else

3024
02:25:56,736 --> 02:25:59,552
I'm not up here saying Robinwood

3025
02:25:59,808 --> 02:26:01,856
Disagree with him I'm not saying

3026
02:26:05,696 --> 02:26:06,208
I just

3027
02:26:07,488 --> 02:26:08,000
Yeah yeah

3028
02:26:08,512 --> 02:26:11,584
So Alex Azar is that weird

3029
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:16,448
Because he did say that Steve was still working for the CIA after the Las Vegas shooting

3030
02:26:16,704 --> 02:26:20,288
When I see you tried to convince him that no one died it was all fake

3031
02:26:20,544 --> 02:26:24,640
So now he's trying to retain Steve's credibility but

3032
02:26:25,152 --> 02:26:27,200
Open pools By high-level CIA people

3033
02:26:27,456 --> 02:26:31,040
He's trying to he's trying to have his cake and eat it

3034
02:26:31,296 --> 02:26:31,808
Not good

3035
02:26:32,064 --> 02:26:37,952
Cut ties or you got to lean in you can't half-ass with Stevie B's but I kind of feel like

3036
02:26:38,208 --> 02:26:41,536
Call good call like knowing at least that you can't

3037
02:26:41,792 --> 02:26:44,096
This one this one might be too much

3038
02:26:44,352 --> 02:26:45,120
Even for us

3039
02:26:45,376 --> 02:26:45,888
Small because it

3040
02:26:46,144 --> 02:26:49,472
I just texted.

3041
02:26:49,728 --> 02:26:51,520
Talk about the first time this came up

3042
02:26:52,032 --> 02:26:53,056
To falsifiable

3043
02:26:53,568 --> 02:26:57,408
When this never comes out what happened

3044
02:26:58,944 --> 02:27:01,248
Sting operation should be there

3045
02:27:01,504 --> 02:27:02,016
Where is it

3046
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:04,576
It's a disappointing game

3047
02:27:05,088 --> 02:27:05,600
But look

3048
02:27:06,112 --> 02:27:06,624
Steve

3049
02:27:07,136 --> 02:27:07,648
Might

3050
02:27:08,160 --> 02:27:08,928
Bee Raw

3051
02:27:09,696 --> 02:27:10,208
People

3052
02:27:10,464 --> 02:27:12,768
Might be lying to a true but there's one thing

3053
02:27:13,024 --> 02:27:13,792
It's totally true

3054
02:27:14,304 --> 02:27:15,328
By the way he wants it

3055
02:27:16,608 --> 02:27:17,120
He said

3056
02:27:17,632 --> 02:27:18,144
I called him

3057
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:19,168
Botanica sent me

3058
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:21,728
Photos when he's in North Korea hanging

3059
02:27:22,496 --> 02:27:23,264
Korean

3060
02:27:24,032 --> 02:27:24,800
He gets around

3061
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:27,872
I'll just leave it

3062
02:27:29,664 --> 02:27:30,176
Florida

3063
02:27:30,688 --> 02:27:31,200
The Northridge

3064
02:27:32,992 --> 02:27:35,808
He says bhayshunyo high-level operative calling

3065
02:27:39,648 --> 02:27:40,928
You noticed Putin walk

3066
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:42,208
Congratulate

3067
02:27:44,256 --> 02:27:46,304
This is really sad

3068
02:27:46,560 --> 02:27:47,072
Steve

3069
02:27:47,328 --> 02:27:49,376
Steve is like a baby

3070
02:27:49,632 --> 02:27:51,168
Maybe he's wrong about all this

3071
02:27:52,192 --> 02:27:53,728
Call

3072
02:27:53,984 --> 02:28:00,128
Shut up you can't even get it up for Steve pieczenik getting a call from China

3073
02:28:00,384 --> 02:28:04,224
North Korea One X bring up getting it up

3074
02:28:06,784 --> 02:28:07,296
Mamacita

3075
02:28:08,576 --> 02:28:09,088
But I mean

3076
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:11,136
Family Show

3077
02:28:15,744 --> 02:28:16,256
Something going on

3078
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:23,424
4 a.m. 5 a.m.

3079
02:28:27,776 --> 02:28:31,872
It's super male Vitality actually just like straight-up bull hormones

3080
02:28:32,128 --> 02:28:32,640
WhatsApp

3081
02:28:32,896 --> 02:28:33,664
F*** is it

3082
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:36,224
Every time we hear about his life

3083
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:40,832
Oh yeah his wife walks bow-legged so by this f****** boner

3084
02:28:41,088 --> 02:28:44,672
I love it I've never heard I've never heard that moment happen

3085
02:28:44,928 --> 02:28:48,768
That moment of Alex being forced to say the word erection

3086
02:28:49,536 --> 02:28:50,560
Nothing fell off

3087
02:28:52,864 --> 02:28:54,144
It really was girl I have curse

3088
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:55,936
Call The View with Matt

3089
02:28:56,704 --> 02:28:57,728
I try not to focus

3090
02:28:57,984 --> 02:29:00,032
Alex goes back to Kohl's

3091
02:29:04,896 --> 02:29:05,408
With this caller

3092
02:29:05,664 --> 02:29:10,784
Because color speculating the globalist they're so out of control help probably let China

3093
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:14,880
Grounded Invader sure that's probably going to do

3094
02:29:15,392 --> 02:29:17,184
Because Alex was so excited about this

3095
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:18,464
He accidentally let this guy

3096
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:19,232
Keep talking

3097
02:29:23,072 --> 02:29:23,840
Facial dangerous

3098
02:29:27,168 --> 02:29:30,496
I agree they want to break this they are foaming at the mouth

3099
02:29:40,224 --> 02:29:40,736
American Pie

3100
02:29:40,992 --> 02:29:42,016
White people

3104
02:30:09,152 --> 02:30:11,200

02:30:20,416 --> 02:30:23,744
She hung up.

3109
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,048
Comfortable in this conversation

3110
02:30:26,304 --> 02:30:30,912
Just caller who I've had a great time talking to has Natalie revealed

3111
02:30:31,424 --> 02:30:34,496
He believes that the Patriots are the white people

3112
02:30:38,592 --> 02:30:39,360
Oh

3113
02:30:41,664 --> 02:30:42,432
He's like

3114
02:30:42,944 --> 02:30:48,576
No I'm doing a good job I'm saying what you're saying all the Patriots are the white people at

3115
02:30:48,832 --> 02:30:53,696
Until Alex tries to save it by being like that

3116
02:30:57,024 --> 02:31:02,144
Alex gets gets back from commercial break

3117
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:04,960
I will sing You belong to

3118
02:31:05,216 --> 02:31:06,240
To the city did play

3119
02:31:06,496 --> 02:31:07,008
1 strings

3120
02:31:09,056 --> 02:31:09,824
Ask about it

3121
02:31:10,080 --> 02:31:11,616
However Gnarls Barkley

3122
02:31:11,872 --> 02:31:12,896
Crazy

3123
02:31:13,920 --> 02:31:15,968
Alex does get a little excited

3124
02:31:16,736 --> 02:31:22,112
It is not the destination is the journey to catch my friends

3125
02:31:28,768 --> 02:31:34,912
Sucker

3126
02:31:35,168 --> 02:31:41,312
Don't do it don't do it

3127
02:32:02,560 --> 02:32:08,448
You might have noticed that the song Skip cuz Alex said you guys are cute

3128
02:32:09,216 --> 02:32:10,752
The bleep button at the wrong time

3129
02:32:11,008 --> 02:32:13,056
So the s*** went out over the air

3130
02:32:13,312 --> 02:32:14,336
Glocada

3131
02:32:14,592 --> 02:32:16,384
Skip has dropped at

3132
02:32:16,896 --> 02:32:19,968
Intuit

3133
02:32:20,224 --> 02:32:21,248
I do like is it him

3134
02:32:21,760 --> 02:32:26,112
That that's probably the most unhinged I've heard anyone sound in a good long while that was

3135
02:32:26,624 --> 02:32:27,392
That was out there

3136
02:32:28,416 --> 02:32:32,256
So Alex is into predictive programming

3137
02:32:33,536 --> 02:32:34,816
Say the movies are reality

3138
02:32:35,328 --> 02:32:36,096
This is a new one

3139
02:32:37,632 --> 02:32:38,144
Alex

3140
02:32:38,400 --> 02:32:40,704
You think you're number one if you remember movie come out

3141
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:41,472
2006

3142
02:32:41,728 --> 02:32:42,240
Panettiere

3143
02:32:42,752 --> 02:32:44,032
Robin Williams

3144
02:32:45,056 --> 02:32:45,568
Voting machines

3145
02:32:45,824 --> 02:32:48,384
Switch the election intuition results to the

3146
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:49,408
Candidate that was West

3147
02:32:50,432 --> 02:32:51,456
Like what's happening right now

3148
02:32:56,576 --> 02:32:58,624
Crack go to conversation

3149
02:32:59,136 --> 02:33:00,928
There's this movie that

3150
02:33:01,696 --> 02:33:02,208
It's real

3151
02:33:02,976 --> 02:33:05,280
These people just cannot believe

3152
02:33:05,792 --> 02:33:06,560
For one second

3153
02:33:07,328 --> 02:33:09,376
That the guy for the past 4 years

3154
02:33:09,888 --> 02:33:11,168
They have heard nothing

3155
02:33:11,424 --> 02:33:12,960
But horrible s*** about

3156
02:33:13,472 --> 02:33:14,240
From one

3157
02:33:14,752 --> 02:33:16,032
Huge section of the

3158
02:33:16,288 --> 02:33:22,432
The country they can't believe that guy might not be beloved well no because they haven't heard that

3159
02:33:22,688 --> 02:33:28,832
It's all the media mainstream media just creating this false perception that no one likes

3160
02:33:30,368 --> 02:33:31,904
I mean I guess

3161
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:34,208
Is everybody in this world lives in their own

3162
02:33:34,464 --> 02:33:35,488
Bubble where they don't have to

3163
02:33:35,744 --> 02:33:36,512
To deal with like

3164
02:33:36,768 --> 02:33:37,280
Reality

3165
02:33:37,536 --> 02:33:41,888
At all but I mean you can't go to out you can't walk down the street and not be like

3166
02:33:42,144 --> 02:33:43,168
Oh a lot of people hate

3167
02:33:44,192 --> 02:33:44,960
It's kind of

3168
02:33:45,216 --> 02:33:50,592
You know it's an interesting line that I struggle with sometimes a release to have in the past and that is that like

3169
02:33:51,104 --> 02:33:52,384
You can recognize that

3170
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:54,688
Organizations like a Coke brother isn't

3171
02:33:54,944 --> 02:33:55,456
Instead they do

3172
02:33:55,712 --> 02:33:58,784
Fun things massively on the right

3173
02:33:59,808 --> 02:34:00,320
But

3174
02:34:00,576 --> 02:34:01,344
Knowing that

3175
02:34:02,368 --> 02:34:03,648
You cannot save it

3176
02:34:03,904 --> 02:34:05,184
People don't believe

3177
02:34:05,440 --> 02:34:05,952
Conservative

3178
02:34:06,208 --> 02:34:08,000
Principles or values or have

3179
02:34:08,256 --> 02:34:09,792
Right-leaning politics

3180
02:34:10,048 --> 02:34:10,816
You can't sleep at all that

3181
02:34:11,072 --> 02:34:12,096
That's fake because

3182
02:34:12,352 --> 02:34:16,448
There is this libertarian moneyed interest that's load again today

3183
02:34:16,704 --> 02:34:17,984
Push things that way

3184
02:34:19,264 --> 02:34:20,800
This same is sort of the

3185
02:34:21,056 --> 02:34:22,080
The Trap is it Alex

3186
02:34:22,336 --> 02:34:23,104
A lot of

3187
02:34:23,360 --> 02:34:23,872
Trump photo

3188
02:34:24,128 --> 02:34:26,176
Fall into

3189
02:34:26,432 --> 02:34:26,944
Medias

3190
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:28,736
Just telling everyone right

3191
02:34:28,992 --> 02:34:30,528
Is bad right and then

3192
02:34:30,784 --> 02:34:33,344
Thinking that no one actually believes that

3193
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:35,136
The media is crumbling

3194
02:34:35,392 --> 02:34:37,184
Powerless

3195
02:34:37,440 --> 02:34:40,512
Pathetic and everyone knows they're Liars now yeah

3196
02:34:43,584 --> 02:34:44,608
That's kind of a trap

3197
02:34:44,864 --> 02:34:46,912
I mean I guess when you

3198
02:34:48,448 --> 02:34:50,752
Expose if you did human eyes enough

3199
02:34:51,008 --> 02:34:51,520
People

3200
02:34:52,032 --> 02:34:53,312
A large enough group

3201
02:34:53,824 --> 02:34:55,616
Then eventually people who

3202
02:34:55,872 --> 02:34:56,896
Know who are like

3203
02:34:57,152 --> 02:35:01,248
Oh no I know plenty of people who would normally fall into that group

3204
02:35:01,504 --> 02:35:05,344
They must secretly be Trump supporters to or something because it's like

3205
02:35:05,856 --> 02:35:08,416
How can I add this is nuts

3206
02:35:08,672 --> 02:35:09,440
Wild

3207
02:35:09,696 --> 02:35:12,000
So are this caller believes that

3208
02:35:12,512 --> 02:35:13,280
You get to

3209
02:35:13,792 --> 02:35:14,816
Kamala Harris

3210
02:35:15,072 --> 02:35:15,840
Will become president

3211
02:35:16,096 --> 02:35:18,144
Albino get out of there somehow sure

3212
02:35:18,400 --> 02:35:20,192
Romantical

3213
02:35:20,448 --> 02:35:21,984
I'm wearing ankle bracelet

3214
02:35:22,496 --> 02:35:23,520
Kamala Harris will make

3215
02:35:23,776 --> 02:35:24,288
Either

3216
02:35:24,544 --> 02:35:25,312
AOC

3217
02:35:25,568 --> 02:35:27,872
Or Hillary is president

3218
02:35:28,128 --> 02:35:29,152
And then Alex asked

3219
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:30,432
The most

3220
02:35:30,688 --> 02:35:31,200
Introspect

3221
02:35:31,456 --> 02:35:32,480
Steve question I could imagine

3222
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:38,368
You can have a stroke or you can be declared incompetent which is

3223
02:35:39,904 --> 02:35:40,672
India president

3224
02:35:41,696 --> 02:35:45,792
And she's going to get hurt either AOC or Hillary Clinton and as her Vice

3225
02:35:46,048 --> 02:35:47,072
President why

3226
02:35:47,584 --> 02:35:48,608
It would be the absolute

3227
02:35:48,864 --> 02:35:50,400
Worst scenario for this country

3228
02:35:50,656 --> 02:35:51,168
What happened

3229
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:52,192
Why

3230
02:35:54,240 --> 02:36:00,384
Why is there such a cult of Hillary's is she such a devil worshiper the table than having her is like

3231
02:36:02,944 --> 02:36:09,088
Why is the left so obsessed with Hillary Clinton

3232
02:36:10,368 --> 02:36:11,648
Obsessed with you

3233
02:36:11,904 --> 02:36:12,416
We just

3234
02:36:13,696 --> 02:36:15,488
Talking about Hillary dad

3235
02:36:17,024 --> 02:36:22,400
Wow yeah yeah pretty pretty cool pretty cool

3236
02:36:23,168 --> 02:36:24,448
You

3237
02:36:24,704 --> 02:36:26,240
I don't know if projection gets that

3238
02:36:26,496 --> 02:36:27,776
Loud

3239
02:36:28,032 --> 02:36:28,800
That's the most louder

3240
02:36:30,336 --> 02:36:31,872
This

3241
02:36:32,128 --> 02:36:34,176
Get another caller and this dude says if they're going to

3242
02:36:34,432 --> 02:36:35,712
Takeover DC Shore

3243
02:36:35,968 --> 02:36:36,480
Right

3244
02:36:36,736 --> 02:36:37,504
It's going to be approached

3245
02:36:39,552 --> 02:36:40,064
Is where

3246
02:36:40,576 --> 02:36:41,088
I

3247
02:36:42,112 --> 02:36:42,880
The probably not going to do the

3248
02:36:43,648 --> 02:36:44,928
But now I do have the Opera

3249
02:36:45,184 --> 02:36:45,696
Trinity

3250
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:48,000
I don't know if I could do it safely

3251
02:36:48,512 --> 02:36:51,072
Who's Alex did this I would want to go make a documentary about

3252
02:36:51,328 --> 02:36:52,352
I really really want

3253
02:36:52,608 --> 02:36:53,120
Here we go

3254
02:36:53,376 --> 02:36:53,888
I already have the way

3255
02:36:55,168 --> 02:36:55,936
Takeover d.c.

3256
02:36:58,240 --> 02:36:58,752

3258
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:04,128

Please take care of those come outside I'm moving into d.c.

Yeah.

3261
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:15,648
Lincoln Memorial

3262
02:37:18,208 --> 02:37:18,720
I

3263
02:37:18,976 --> 02:37:19,744
Would love

3264
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:20,768
To go

3265
02:37:21,024 --> 02:37:22,304
And documented howley's

3266
02:37:22,560 --> 02:37:24,608
Time at the Lincoln Memorial now

Know if we do not if he didn't

3268
02:37:26,912 --> 02:37:28,960
If you are listening to this and you have

3269
02:37:29,472 --> 02:37:30,240
$5

3270
02:37:31,264 --> 02:37:36,640
I don't know where I was going to have that we need a billion dollars to make that

3271
02:37:37,152 --> 02:37:43,040
I don't want anybody to do like giving money to make a document in my head

3272
02:37:43,296 --> 02:37:44,320
Because you know just

3273
02:37:44,576 --> 02:37:46,624
Logistics of the world

3274
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:53,024
I think there's such an amazing story to be told here if Alex were to go and that is

3275
02:37:53,280 --> 02:37:55,072
Is Vicki would realize that eats

3276
02:37:55,584 --> 02:37:57,120
Winter in d.c. okay

3277
02:37:57,376 --> 02:38:00,448

3281
02:38:15,808 --> 02:38:21,952
Man to the grisliest Alex eats

3282
02:38:23,744 --> 02:38:26,816
Or Owen Shroyer skins Alexandra

3283
02:38:27,072 --> 02:38:29,888
Day to Alex's trying to make a fire out of

3284
02:38:30,144 --> 02:38:33,728
Is steamers

3285
02:38:39,104 --> 02:38:41,664
Spiritually when I said that I would eat my neighbors

3286
02:38:42,176 --> 02:38:42,688
Soca

3287
02:38:42,944 --> 02:38:43,968
Michelina's okay

3288
02:38:44,224 --> 02:38:44,736
It's cool

3289
02:38:46,272 --> 02:38:47,808
He's such an amazing

3290
02:38:48,064 --> 02:38:49,088
Potential in my brain

3291
02:38:49,344 --> 02:38:50,112
For like what

3292
02:38:50,368 --> 02:38:52,416
This looks like in the real world

3293
02:38:53,440 --> 02:38:56,256
If he did this cute stay at a hotel nearby

3294
02:38:56,512 --> 02:38:58,816
And show up and yell in a bullhorn every now and again

3295
02:38:59,072 --> 02:39:00,096
You would never stay

3296
02:39:01,120 --> 02:39:07,264
It's not going to be over 40 degrees until March

3297
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:12,896
Lowe's is cold this winter look at Memorial

3298
02:39:13,152 --> 02:39:14,688
Physically

3299
02:39:14,944 --> 02:39:15,456
No

3300
02:39:16,992 --> 02:39:18,528
But I would love I would love it

3301
02:39:20,320 --> 02:39:23,904
Man I wish I was a millionaire

3302
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:25,184
I would say Alex

3303
02:39:25,440 --> 02:39:26,464
Giant donation

3304
02:39:26,976 --> 02:39:27,744
But you hacked

3305
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:28,512
To do this

3306
02:39:28,768 --> 02:39:29,792
You have to

3307
02:39:30,304 --> 02:39:32,096
Not any of your stuff

3308
02:39:32,352 --> 02:39:35,680
You have to stay out there as long as this encampment last

3309
02:39:36,704 --> 02:39:38,240
Much like maybe some

3310
02:39:38,496 --> 02:39:40,544
MTV show from the early 2000

3311
02:39:40,800 --> 02:39:43,616
You get paid more the longer you stay out there like it and

3312
02:39:44,128 --> 02:39:44,640
All on cam

3313
02:39:44,896 --> 02:39:46,432
Cuz I want to see your misery

3314
02:39:46,688 --> 02:39:48,736
Yeah I want to see you camping out f***

3315
02:39:48,992 --> 02:39:51,040
I'm pissed off now 3 in the morning

3316
02:39:51,296 --> 02:39:52,320
So mad

3317
02:39:52,576 --> 02:39:54,624
That only 2,000 people showed up

3318
02:39:54,880 --> 02:40:01,024
Do your encampments needs to be fat bear there needs to be 24/7 lives yums of everybody like

3319
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:04,352
Like making Wagers and s*** like that

3320
02:40:04,608 --> 02:40:05,888
This should be on

3321
02:40:06,144 --> 02:40:07,168
365

3322
02:40:07,424 --> 02:40:09,472
Daily this is what I'm talkin about

3323
02:40:09,728 --> 02:40:12,032
I probably would not go

3324
02:40:12,288 --> 02:40:14,080
For the sake of safety and

3325
02:40:14,336 --> 02:40:15,616
Just responsibility in

3326
02:40:15,872 --> 02:40:16,896
The present world we live in

3327
02:40:17,664 --> 02:40:19,968
Under ideal circumstances I would love

3328
02:40:20,224 --> 02:40:21,504
To go make a documentary

3329
02:40:22,784 --> 02:40:25,088
Best I could do is if he actually does this

3330
02:40:25,344 --> 02:40:27,648
And they actually have feeds

3331
02:40:28,160 --> 02:40:29,696
I might be tempted

3332
02:40:29,952 --> 02:40:30,464
2

3333
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:32,256
Do not stop coverage of it

3334
02:40:32,512 --> 02:40:34,048
Like waiting for him to break

3335
02:40:34,560 --> 02:40:36,608
But he wouldn't break now

3336
02:40:36,864 --> 02:40:38,400
It would end up being like

3337
02:40:38,912 --> 02:40:44,288
2 minutes of Alex yelling in a bullhorn and then Harrison Smith in the studio

3338
02:40:44,544 --> 02:40:46,848
Excuse for why you have to leave right away that we wouldn't have to

3339
02:40:47,104 --> 02:40:51,456
He wouldn't lose all faith

3340
02:40:51,712 --> 02:40:54,272
All the sudden covid will be real

3341
02:40:54,528 --> 02:40:56,576
This is just another time and it sucks

3342
02:40:57,088 --> 02:40:58,112
Because we've got this enough

3343
02:40:58,368 --> 02:41:01,696
That like it's another time that I see this amazing potential

3344
02:41:01,952 --> 02:41:02,720
In what could

3345
02:41:02,976 --> 02:41:06,560
Would come and it's not going to go I'm preemptively disappointed

3346
02:41:06,816 --> 02:41:08,352
It's not going to be great

3347
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:09,632
I remember

3348
02:41:09,888 --> 02:41:13,216
It's the same thing I felt like the second time I heard there was a marathon

3349
02:41:13,472 --> 02:41:15,264
The first time

3350
02:41:15,520 --> 02:41:16,544
Like oh my God

3351
02:41:21,152 --> 02:41:23,456
I meant psycho Hour 3 David nights hosting

3352
02:41:25,504 --> 02:41:27,552
And then the second time like cats

3353
02:41:27,808 --> 02:41:29,088
Be good now I just like

3354
02:41:29,344 --> 02:41:30,624
Caravan f***** me

3355
02:41:30,880 --> 02:41:33,184
Everything there sucks I was going to

3356
02:41:33,440 --> 02:41:34,208
Georgia suck

3357
02:41:35,744 --> 02:41:40,352
Well I mean when you might have to write a song about how excited

3358
02:41:40,608 --> 02:41:41,632
Here's the problem

3359
02:41:41,888 --> 02:41:45,472
When we make a show about an exhaustive failure

3360
02:41:45,728 --> 02:41:47,520
Who fails exhaustively

3361
02:41:47,776 --> 02:41:48,800
All the time

3362
02:41:49,824 --> 02:41:52,896
It's hard for us to expect him to succeed

3363
02:41:53,152 --> 02:41:54,432
Kind of have to always

3364
02:41:54,944 --> 02:41:59,552
You always hope Charlie Brown's going to kick that f****** ball man

3365
02:41:59,808 --> 02:42:01,088
To come in with a little optimism

3366
02:42:01,344 --> 02:42:01,856
Or else

3367
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:06,720
You know it's a dick

3368
02:42:06,976 --> 02:42:07,488
Try and kick the ball

3369
02:42:07,744 --> 02:42:08,768
Thank you Alec

3370
02:42:10,560 --> 02:42:11,072
Please

3371
02:42:11,584 --> 02:42:12,352
Do it do it

3372
02:42:12,608 --> 02:42:13,888
Do it you'll save America

3373
02:42:14,144 --> 02:42:16,704
We will create a documentary for

3374
02:42:17,216 --> 02:42:17,984
Free you will

3375
02:42:18,240 --> 02:42:22,592
Save America single-handedly if you camp out at the Lincoln Memorial through the rapper

3376
02:42:22,848 --> 02:42:25,408
And if you eat fish and try and get as fat as possible

3377
02:42:27,968 --> 02:42:28,736
So good.

3378
02:42:30,784 --> 02:42:35,136
It's caller who's threatening to shut down B inauguration

3379
02:42:36,160 --> 02:42:38,208
He's going real deep right now

3380
02:42:41,024 --> 02:42:41,536
Before

3381
02:42:42,304 --> 02:42:43,328
He'll probably wait

3382
02:42:43,584 --> 02:42:44,608
Operation

3383
02:42:45,376 --> 02:42:46,912
It ain't going to be in d.c.

3384
02:42:47,936 --> 02:42:48,448
Down

3385
02:42:48,704 --> 02:42:49,472
They're probably going to do it

3386
02:42:49,984 --> 02:42:51,776
California or New York City it's going to be

3387
02:42:52,288 --> 02:42:54,592
Everybody off to understand me

3388
02:42:57,408 --> 02:42:58,176
Fancy pants

3389
02:43:02,016 --> 02:43:03,808
I'm out there on the 12th

3390
02:43:04,320 --> 02:43:06,368
Imma be there on the 20th come hell or high water

3391
02:43:06,880 --> 02:43:08,160
So you got my commitment

3392
02:43:11,488 --> 02:43:14,048
If you go ahead and do whatever you want

3393
02:43:14,816 --> 02:43:17,120
Distract me.

3394
02:43:17,632 --> 02:43:23,776
You're the bad guy remember your favorite guy is literally the emperor

3395
02:43:24,032 --> 02:43:26,592
Yeah you don't get to do that that's not

3396
02:43:27,616 --> 02:43:28,128
Jerk

3397
02:43:28,384 --> 02:43:34,528
See now that would be that would be acceptable on his joining The Darkside episode where he quotes

3398
02:43:34,784 --> 02:43:40,928
31 the whole time and he comes into the show as just swelling strings at

3399
02:43:43,488 --> 02:43:45,536
That would be fitting

3400
02:43:45,792 --> 02:43:46,560
So I

3401
02:43:47,072 --> 02:43:53,216
I don't think Alex is going to follow through with this I think he's going to go do some publicity stunts and DC on the 12th

3402
02:43:53,472 --> 02:43:53,984
Which is when

3403
02:43:54,240 --> 02:43:56,032
That rally he's going to co-opt is

3404
02:43:56,544 --> 02:44:02,432
And then on the 20th for inauguration I could see him going to that as well and trying to cause a scene

3405
02:44:02,688 --> 02:44:05,760
But when will the when will the camping be would it be on the 12th

3406
02:44:06,016 --> 02:44:12,160
Start on the 12th and then go through the inauguration be set up a goddamn

3407
02:44:12,416 --> 02:44:13,440
Broadcast

3408
02:44:13,696 --> 02:44:19,840
From the Lincoln Memorial if you believe he will spend hours on that

3409
02:44:20,864 --> 02:44:22,656
It makes me sad I wanted to happen

3410
02:44:22,912 --> 02:44:25,728
And I'm not going to allow myself to believe that it's not going to happen

3411
02:44:26,240 --> 02:44:27,008
Yeah there's a chance

3412
02:44:27,264 --> 02:44:28,800
Yes there's always the chance hope

3413
02:44:29,056 --> 02:44:29,568
It's spring

3414
02:44:29,824 --> 02:44:31,104
Eternal Schroeder

3415
02:44:31,360 --> 02:44:33,664
Jurors occupation

3416
02:44:33,920 --> 02:44:36,736
So we will see until we're allowed to observe it

3417
02:44:38,272 --> 02:44:38,784
Strangers

3418
02:44:39,040 --> 02:44:42,624
We're strangers Monday's episode

3419
02:44:42,880 --> 02:44:43,392
Could not be

3420
02:44:44,672 --> 02:44:45,184
It is both

3421
02:44:45,440 --> 02:44:48,512
Simultaneously

3422
02:44:48,768 --> 02:44:50,816
An episode about Rogan and nah

3423
02:44:51,840 --> 02:44:54,912
To tune in on Monday to find out sounds like something I would hear on the Joe Rogan

3424
02:44:55,168 --> 02:44:58,752
Wooden Shelf

3425
02:44:59,008 --> 02:45:01,056
Same time

3426
02:45:01,312 --> 02:45:03,872
How about I can't remember what his sponsors were

3427
02:45:04,128 --> 02:45:04,640
Dammit

3428
02:45:05,408 --> 02:45:06,176
Was there a toilet one

3429
02:45:06,432 --> 02:45:07,200
Swift shrimp

3430
02:45:07,712 --> 02:45:08,992
No that's Rick and Morty

3431
02:45:10,272 --> 02:45:11,040
Plushie plushie

3432
02:45:12,832 --> 02:45:13,344
Turn off
