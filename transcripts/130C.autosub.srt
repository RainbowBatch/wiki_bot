1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:03,840
Hey welcome back to know tonight I am the other boys

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,376
In just a moment is Michael

3
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:06,656
Austin dear friend

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,496
You are joined us today for the third installment

5
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:15,616
Coverage of Alex Jones documentary

6
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:22,272
Garbage monster

7
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,832
Hazel looks like Junior High

8
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,112
History project

9
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,160
If Alex turn to say that I was a teacher

10
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,184
I would say

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,976
Incomplete

12
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:33,792
Needs work I probably give her the D

13
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,864
Reflecting effort

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,632
Effort

15
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:40,192
But in terms of proving any of the

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,728
Tell from the last

17
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:43,264
4 hours of coverage

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,056
So far leading up to par 3

19
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:49,920
He has failed to accurately cite a number of things of trend

20
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,688
Continue

21
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:53,760
Episode where we left off

22
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,064
Last time in that was Alex Jones is

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,088
Really pissed off

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,368
About a road

25
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,392
He is really mad about

26
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,160
The transtex

27
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:00,928
Quarter

28
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:07,328
So you know he he lies a little bit about it begin this

29
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,864
Is it a certain point cell

30
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,936
Enjoy

31
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:17,824
Alex

32
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,360
Now there's a row

33
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,408
Is the road somebody's got a f******

34
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:26,784
Stop this goddamn Road and it's going to be up to Texas

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,088
Is that the it's that backstop

36
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:33,440
In case the globalist get too powerful

37
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,488
I know it's William Travis

38
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
Got to get it

39
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:44,960
The next stage of this world government plan Transportation Control

40
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:49,312
And that is called the NAFTA superhighway or in Texas colortran Texas

41
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,104
The compass case

42
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,176
584 sounds

43
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:58,528
To be transferred into the control of a Spanish company

44
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,320
Which tunnels in Texas

45
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,280
Million-dollar is to ride on a road

46
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,816
There's no limit

47
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:15,424
Play the free market will ever create a limit on it

48
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,800
Cuz the free market doesn't exist

49
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,640
It's not like what he said

50
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,432
Describing isn't the direct product

51
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:32,832
Drive from Chicago to New York

52
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:38,720
And who knows where that money goes you hope it's to the state you're driving in

53
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,512
Could be Spain

54
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,072
More than eight

55
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,888
I've been designated as International art

56
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,448
Missouri

57
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240
Start Steven side Mexico

58
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,056
And travels through the middle of the United States

59
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,848
Central Canada

60
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:08,416
Kansas City

61
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,184
Mexico

62
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,352
If I understand correctly

63
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,912
Kansas City

64
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,216
Is Mexico

65
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,544
It's Sovereign soil of Mexico

66
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
Question

67
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,152
If you are a

68
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,248
Who does not have full United States

69
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,808
Can you go to that Polly olly oxen free

70
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:42,208
You're a citizen of the port

71
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,232
This isn't true

72
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:55,520
This was evidenced by some emails by there was a guy named Chris Gutierrez

73
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
Where is the president of

74
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,104
Kansas City smartport

75
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,920
Mexican

76
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,456
Customs Office Space

77
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,272
We need to be designated as for in Mexico

78
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,552
Can Sovereign territory

79
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,088
Meet certain requirements

80
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:15,488
Under this plan what happened with this

81
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,024
Court in Kansas City

82
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,583
Actually really interesting

83
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,375
I disagree with a lot of

84
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,143
I'll be honest

85
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,959
But it's actually really interesting

86
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:30,079
And have you have this

87
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,151
That leads from Mexico a port in Mexico

88
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,711
The first stop that would make

89
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,247
Kansas City

90
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,551
Point there would be Mexican

91
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,087
American

92
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:41,855
Custer

93
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,903
So they could check

94
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,231
And the reason they would do this would be to streamline

95
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,255
Imports and X

96
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,047
In terms of shipping things

97
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,351
Out of Kansas City and into cancer

98
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,655
The reason is Kansas City

99
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,679
The city is the largest

100
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,727
Just Trucking Hub in the United States

101
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:02,591
Fruits that transverse the United States open

102
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,871
Buca's f****** dead center

103
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:07,455
Right so I'm I'm interested in

104
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,223
In terms of

105
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,759
All the Rail lines

106
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:13,087
Trucking lines meeting up here is some centralized place

107
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,159
Were you wouldn't have to take the time for American customs

108
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,487
The fish has to be in Mexico to check stuff

109
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511
Any of that

110
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,583
But at the same time

111
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,983
That doesn't sound like a terrible idea I don't know probably can problems with the customs office would necessarily

112
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,031
Clearly need to be Sovereign soil of the country

113
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,311
Costumes that represents

114
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:39,711
It's no different than an embassy or something along the lines of emphysema

115
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,247
Backing behind them saying

116
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,295
You can't do that is

117
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,831
If you say that

118
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,159
Will start a war

119
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,951
Really interesting but

120
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:55,071
When you really look at the idea of why people were pitching this sort of thing

121
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,863
There is a lot of snow

122
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:01,471
Songs from it but you look at it they're like well if you just have the ports

123
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,775
Some place in America

124
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,103
Ship directly through a direct line to Kansas City in

125
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,127
Traverse from there

126
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,431
Would really be that much further than having

127
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,455
A Mexico

128
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,759
It's obviously they're trying to get around

129
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,551
Having to pay longshoreman

130
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:21,183
Like in California or somebody

131
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,023
All this does come down to really is

132
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
Some sort of

133
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:29,887
Simplicity and streamlining for these companies at the expense of America

134
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
Court jobs

135
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,703
There's a downside to this

136
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,775
When you streamline business you end up hurting workers

137
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,567
And this is not an accept

138
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,359
Yep you just end up

139
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,639
Screwing over people to work

140
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
The doc

141
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
Sometime it's

142
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,063
It's interesting on a level that is not at all without

143
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:52,159
Port isn't

144
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,951
Took in Sovereign territory it's just

145
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,487
I mean if you want to

146
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:00,351
Did you want to complain about that about every Embassy

147
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,191
Imaginary

148
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,519
Mexican soil it said

149
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
Bye

150
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,847
By being there America's like

151
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,919
That's Mexico so we're not going to say no to

152
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:17,759
Mexico is like

153
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,551
0% imaginary

154
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,831
You're cool work

155
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,903
Your benefit as America or these company

156
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:24,927
Is that you

157
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:30,303
Pay next to nothing for the longshoremen Mexican ports in order to offload stuff

158
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,119
Ships into trains

159
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:37,215
The end up going up to Kansas City as opposed to paying a living wage to people in

160
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,495
Los Angeles

161
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,287
California Los Angeles but whatever

162
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
You know what I'm saying

163
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:47,199
So you're cutting back your expenses on that and then return you have

164
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,039
It's all bulshit

165
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:56,671
All the reasons it's interesting to talk about have nothing to do with why Alex

166
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,351
Like that's all it is everything we talked about

167
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:08,191
Is all the downsides are going to

168
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
Heart

169
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,079
International

170
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
Predominant

171
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,663
Foreign companies are placing tolls

172
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:26,879
Documents show Robinson raised

173
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,183
The transportation infrastructure of Mexico

174
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
So far and made Prada

175
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,095
Mexico

176
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,935
Revenues rage

177
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,727
North American Union

178
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,543
Cracy

179
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,591
Citation

180
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,407
North American quarters are also

181
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,223
Suspiciously similar to timezone

182
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,647
Time zones in name

183
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,671
Time zones

184
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,207
Northern

185
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,791
Ridiculous

186
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,631
First of all the proposing in North America

187
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:14,239
Which would be so much what we have in chapter 11 of a nap

188
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,519
Which is Trump

189
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,335
By international law what is

190
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,663
She's the chairman for Nationals National eagle

191
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,479
That was founded by Phyllis Schlafly

192
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759

Do you know who has done that

251
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,183
Provably have been said to have done that

This is Justice or nothing

278
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,143
Compared to the profits little be made

279
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:04,799

Is aggressively cavato Public Finance

283
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:29,119

00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,703
Government simply actress facts

285
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:37,311
Stocking up for wealth and resources

286
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,591
And transferring

287
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,871

288
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,711
Leaving behind a cultural and economic Wasteland

The North American

It's not about trade it's about control

292
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,023
Catherines even worse

320
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,919
They get it

321
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,967
Cannot believe

322
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,503
You would ever trust anybody

323
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,783
With a cowboy hat

324
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,367
Trying to say something like they were wearing

325
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:04,767

I refuse I refuse

329
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
You have

Okay well just Market

335
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,647
But having a picture on your ID

336
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,207
It's just another identify

337
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,791
But they're principally against that to play how do you feel about that

338
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,327
Burn them off

I don't want to be near this video

343
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:11,839
It was awful well-dressed for somebody who is afraid of computers

344
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,631
Action stick

345
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,935

Huge detour into there's this road I don't like

00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,415
Was trying to use it as a

354

An example of like this is a Grassroots on the

355

The ground means

356
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:46,911
Control but it's not the arguments not being there makes sense

357
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,447
I still don't understand

358
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,495
The anger though

359
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,263
Behind inter

360
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,431
As long as that

Documentary was about this

362
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,247

Rhodes Rhodes Rhodes

366
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,439
We already have those right

367
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,999
Smart rope which is nothing more than an effort

368
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,279
Sebring control into

369
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,047
The cities

The country

383
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,999
All of these things are designed to bring more and more

384
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:48,351
Control to bureaucracies rather than to the independent individual

385
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,143
The sovereign individual this nation

386
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:56,031
What brought me into the whole story

387
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,055
In the 1980s

388
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,847
An early 1990s

389
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:05,503
Team aware of an agenda basically tulloch are at United States

390
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:10,367
What's called the wildlands project was also a key Cornerstone of the u.s. United maze

391
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,647
Convention on biological

392
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,999
It Will Rain that studying which I begin to realize

393
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
That

394
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,047
This was not an effort to

395
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,583
Protect the environment but an effort to

396
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,863
To control you and I

397
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,935
They were dividing United States up in the movement hours

398
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:30,591
So this map that Alex is flashing up here right now Verizon

399
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,943
It's it's actually really important cuz he talked about the wildlands

400
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,711
Project

401
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,759
Privately-owned of wildlands

402
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,039
Network

403
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,831
Federally owned

404
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,111
Yeah

405
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
Wildlife

406
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:43,903
Wildling

407
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,303
It's important here is all the claims that are being made by Michael Kaufman and Alex

408
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
Miss suction

409
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,167
There is like four straight

410
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,703
Finger insert here

411
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:05,407
And the maps in the B the bibliography

412
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,199
The key release

413
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
You really

414
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,551
Many if not all of the most

415
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,575
Explosive claims

416
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,672
Literally said to be unsubstantiated

417
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:23,072
And inserts and all of the quotes are basically

418
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,608
Like citations cuz they're not real

419
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:28,448
Also these Maps Alex conveniently forgets dementia

420
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,240
They were created by Michael cost

421
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,080
Gmade

422
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:38,432
Three baby babies maps maps

423
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,992
Interpretation of the UN biodiversity effects

424
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:45,856
The designations of land are not in the UN

425
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:52,256
Fear-mongering the map isn't even detecting a real plan according to Kaufman

426
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,280
Could have been

427
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,840
If he had not been there to fight do you win

428
00:21:56,352 --> 00:22:02,496
These Maps show how 50% of America might have been used

429
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,056
Have been set aside in Wilderness reserve and buffer zone

430
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,592
If the biodiversity

431
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,872
The tree have been ratified

432
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,408
He made the map and he's in

433
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,432
Interpreting it

434
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:13,248
Interpreting it in a manner that only inflates

435
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,016
His own

436
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,088
So this is all just

437
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,416
Violated map

438
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,976
He was doing a

439
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,632
He caught it out multibillion-dollar project

440
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,424
Maybe he caught it out

441
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,728
In the language they've written something in

442
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,032
They could use this to do that

443
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,312
While he was working

444
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,360
I won't let them do

445
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:40,896
And then they did

446
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,712
He saved us

447
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,600
All the time

448
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,904
Wants to warn you that they still want

449
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:58,304
So I believe they would have done it if it weren't for you so they're still Michael Kaufman

450
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:04,960
Michael Kaufman wildlands project

451
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,240
Networking all that stuff and

452
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,568
Anything the really backs up at all the claims

453
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,128
What about the World Wildlife Foundation

454
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,320
But

455
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:25,952
The issue is that I can't find any non crazy Source talking about this stuff

456
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:29,536
Black weirdo blogs and stuff like that

457
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,840
Even the regular mainstream Outlets are like

458
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,120
We're going to pot

459
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,912
Do you guys have your fun

460
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:40,800
Michael Kaufman and whatever I don't care to

461
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,616
I don't think this is real

462
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,920
I don't trust the word of crazy

463
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,688
Stupid blog

464
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,248
What do they rip out whole community

465
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,784
Please put them in the back in the wilderness

466
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,136
The Federal Highway system was designed

467
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,208
The 1950s

468
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,768
The service deployment conduit

469
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,632
Otherwise good Highway

470
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,656
Smith also is

471
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,424
True

472
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,728
The highway system wasn't created

473
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:16,128
Specifically to deploy troops or anything like that

474
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,200
No it was because of the burgeoning

475
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:24,576
Suburb Bloom that was happening after the baby boom in the 50s

476
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,160
Destroying

477
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:28,928
Savory Park

478
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:32,256
Cumtown able to do Bible

479
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:36,352
Hey 1955 the Department of Commerce put out a document often referred to as

480
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,120
Autobook

481
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,960
If you look at the documents he's very clearly than plants her Highway

482
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,032
The plans of the highways are set

483
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,056
Create roads that we

484
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:45,824
Connect cities to

485
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,360
Suburbs

486
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,896
Joseph dimento

487
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
Another phone

488
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:54,272
Professor who co-wrote the book change

489
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,344
Gyros

490
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,744
He wrote the book changing lanes visions

491
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,768
Histories of urban

492
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,536
Open freeways

493
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:08,096
And I quote Highway Engineers dominated the decision

494
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,120
They were trained

495
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,400
Design without what

496
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,192
Consideration for how Highway might impact

497
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,728
Fabric

498
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,264
They were worried about the most

499
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,544
Efficient way of moving people from

500
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,312
Point eight

501
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,616
The yellow book formed the basis for

502
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,152
The federal-aid Highway Act

503
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,200
Create the interstate

504
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,272
At the time the bill required a lot of federal funding

505
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
Sound of a turtle sound

506
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:30,368
I had one of the only reasons

507
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,928
Eisenhower supported it for

508
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,720
But also for evacuation

509
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,512
Natural disaster

510
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,792
Or like a nuclear attack

511
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,864
This was the consideration but not the reason

512
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,400
Every president

513
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,936
Has been super

514
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,704
Rhodes

515
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,240
Going back to George Washington

516
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,800
George Washington

517
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:54,944
The credit the savings and convenience of this country all require that are great Road leading from one public place to another ship

518
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,736
Be straightened established by law

519
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,040
To me these things seem indispensable

520
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,576
They seem obvious

521
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,368
Also in 1990

522
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,184
Send Lieutenant Colonel Ivan

523
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,768
Country tours

524
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,072
The first world war could make it across the country

525
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:16,960
It was a study but also a military recruitment opportunity where they went out of town or like to join up

526
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,544
The roads sucked they destroyed cars

527
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,360
And that most bridges couldn't support the weight of most cars

528
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,664
That's not good for 1999

529
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,224
Stuck in his head is a very serious priority

530
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,528
So when Eisenhower was elected president

531
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,296
1850s

532
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,832
He ended up

533
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:36,160
Being like we we got to we got to finally get around to doing this right

534
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,720
Dima priority 30 years ago

535
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,536
Go back to Doctor Demento

536
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:47,936
An unmistakable part of the equation of highways

537
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,312
As a related

538
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:56,384
The highway was a federally-supported program of urban renewal

539
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,176
In which lower-income urban can

540
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,736
Mostly African-American were targeted for removal

541
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,552
The idea was close let's get rid of the blight

542
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,088
Says Demento

543
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,880
Nope

544
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,952
Recording a doctor tonight

545
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,816
That makes everything else sound very super villain

546
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:20,192
Places that is interesting multi-ethnic areas where view Justice

547
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,496
Play highways were 20 justifying with

548
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,264
Destruction of men

549
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:28,640
Predominantly black were wiped out and turned I threw surface parking and Highway

550
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:32,480
Noting a black bottom and Paradise Valley in

551
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:36,832
Detroit Historical neighborhoods down to make room for i-375

552
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,392
The same pattern was repeated over and over

553
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:42,720
Leaving two cities pockmarked with empty neighborhoods and destructive Highway

554
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:47,072
People displaced from destroyed areas move to others lead to overcrowded

555
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,096
Overcrowding in

556
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:52,704
Can increases in crime While most people with the means to play flight to the suburbs

557
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,824
Shooting on the new highways and siphoning money away from these cities very tax base

558
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,640
So this was at the same time that they would also have

559
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,920
Instituted the policy known as

560
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,688
Redline

561
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,456
Which

562
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,224
Kept

563
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,248
The people who were

564
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,272
Displaced from

565
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,088
Living anywhere where they would be okay

566
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,648
No iru

567
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:15,744
Focused attack let me know

568
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,304
Let me go somewhere no one else has

569
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,072
Okay

570
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,120
Are you saying that not only

571
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
This country inn

572
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:28,032
Infrastructure itself is racist

573
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:31,360
A lot of the motivation for the creation of a lot of his stuff was

574
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:37,760
Totally wrong in the idea with troop deployments Royal taxes Aurora

575
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,552
Thank God for racism

576
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,160
Pieces of s***

577
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,952
I've been there

578
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:52,864
The unconstitutional Northern command is now using the highway system as a force projection maker

579
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,704
The horse

580
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,032
Just innocent

581
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,568
County and city government

582
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,360
Are being quiet

583
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,176
Quietly quietly

584
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,968
Billions of dollars for Sydney

585
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,392
No matter how small or remote

586
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,512
License plate reading software

587
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,936
Read your lips

588
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,496
God dammit

589
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:33,312
Under the treasonous military commissions

590
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,848
American citizens

591
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,968
Orchard

592
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,760
Secretly

593
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:49,184
You're not good under Section 8 in the middle of you being wrong

594
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,280
About everything about a couple things along the way

595
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,096
Yes this is an issue

596
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,912
Why can't we work together on this why does it have to be

597
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:05,312
Movies centered around a lot because he's hoping because he's only

598
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,080
Right about these things

599
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,896
In service of the things that are bigger than wrong about

600
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,944
Evidenced by this

601
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,040
Misdemeanor

602
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,976
I agree Alex know he's lying

603
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,280
You know about

604
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,048
Not about

605
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,584
Call misdemeanor actor

606
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:35,520
Does cement some of the definitions

607
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:36,800
Terrorism

608
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:41,152
Has nothing to do with misdemeanors or anything like that

609
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,176
Destruction

610
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,200
The definition

611
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,736
Crimes that

612
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:48,832
Domestic terrorism section said

613
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:52,160
Assassination orchid

614
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,184
Kidnapping or Mass

615
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,464
Destruction

616
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,488
What

617
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,280
Notorious

618
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,840
Not want

619
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,864
Domestic terrorism

620
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:02,656
Mass

621
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,704
I don't know probably

622
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,728
I don't know

623
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,496
Something happened

624
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,288
In Oklahoma City

625
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,056
Could be

626
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,896
Federal police squad

627
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,200
Force America

628
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,504
The lineup and show their butts

629
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,784
In case you're wondering

630
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:19,808
Typo

631
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,904
But also

632
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:28,768
Alex is incredibly in support of what's being done by Ice

633
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,560
Right now if you want

634
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:36,960
Very temporary right very dude like you

635
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,984
It

636
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,032
Completely

637
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:45,408
It's b******* but also the article that he cited makes no mention

638
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,992
People being demanding that they show their papers

639
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:53,344
He cites like three articles none of them were irrelevant to that the only article

640
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,368
Kind of relevant

641
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,904
Is one about her New York

642
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,928
Subway

643
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,208
Train riders

644
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,256
Are being

645
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,280
Did I have a bags

646
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,352
The reason for that

647
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,656
It was the same week as we lunch

648
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:10,240
Wanted frames at bomb in 2005

649
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:13,824
Ifucking get it that week

650
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,104
Alright

651
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,384
Forever

652
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,432
It's not like it's today

653
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:22,528
People having

654
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
Wow

655
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:30,208
Outside the scope of this documentary

656
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,768
Everything that Alex is describing as

657
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,560
What could be done

658
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,840
By the global

659
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,400
It is stuff that he is describing

660
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:44,032
Are doing to everybody else right now the reason that he's

661
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,360
Like what this documentary scope

662
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:50,944
What does documentary imagine

663
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:53,248
You a regular wipers

664
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,576
Is treated like the way white people treat other

665
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:00,416
Happy terrible nightmare for Global enslavement

666
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:07,328
We would be treated the way we treat other people actually for Global enslavement at 12 weeks.

667
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,400
Interesting interesting

668
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:16,800
I think he's just read a history

669
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,080
Man

670
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,384
From the sidewalks

671
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,600
Paramilitary

672
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:42,912
I want to be clear about this really quick I have no idea what

673
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,960
This video is of Alex's

674
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:49,312
No context of it

675
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,592
Yeah probably

676
00:33:54,944 --> 00:34:01,088
You have no idea what happened

677
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:06,720
Paper for Less on this newspaper

678
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:13,120
I hate being on the military's to you but if you're talking s*** to Alex Jones goes a long way

679
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,968
Oh man

680
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:34,624
This'll be so much a better movie if that guy just murdered Alex right there

681
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,696
Reality could be that these people in

682
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,232
Just went to go see a movie

683
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,768
Something like that

684
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:44,352
Completely benign reason that there on the streets

685
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,144
Vietnam

686
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,424
This footage

687
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,960
Any any like

688
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:55,360
This is where at this place there's a thing that there's a demonstration there's

689
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,384
People on the street

690
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,944
Anymore

691
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,016
Authoritarian state

692
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,344
If I if I'm reading this situation correct

693
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,392
Based on what has been said so far

694
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,440
This dude

695
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,744
Part of a

696
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,280
Some sort of military

697
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,376
So it's he's on the

698
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:20,960
And then Alex f****** Jones shows up

699
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:27,360
It says putting a camera in his face and asks him questions

700
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,408
Jobs

701
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,968
Yeah I know but kids come to school in there

702
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,248
Fatigues were in like r o t

703
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:37,856
DC and stuff like that other reasons

704
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:41,184
Look if I was working Veterans Day or Memorial Day

705
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,000
Alex Jones came to work

706
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:50,400
And he was like I got a camera in your face I'll be like get that f****** camera out of my face

707
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,176
Yeah

708
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,016
Long before 9/11

709
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:09,856
I have no idea what that affected by the federal

710
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:15,744
Coast to Coast

711
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,608
Appear out of nowhere

712
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:33,664
Principally I am against what Alex is it

713
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,760
Military to not be operating in the

714
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,296
The state

715
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,600
Whatever

716
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:44,928
What would butthole crossing of the Rubicon

717
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:50,816
The acclimation cell

718
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,352
The Kentucky Derby

719
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,888
As well as other

720
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:58,496
President Bush

721
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,104
Shadowgun

722
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,896
In the yak

723
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,456
Executive branch formal

724
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,760
Preparing for domestic insurrections

725
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:15,648
State government

726
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,352
Just trying to soften you up.

727
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,192
2007

728
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,264
President Bush

729
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:35,360
And the presidency officially became

730
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,384
Fiat

731
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,248
Government

732
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,272
Has been shared

733
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,320
Legislative

734
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,112
Branches of government

735
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:53,280
Power resides with the president was a slick f****** graphic did you see that

736
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:57,376
Also Alex thinks that Donald Trump is the only weapon

737
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:00,192
Can save us

738
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:04,288
Executive because he thinks that the Judiciary

739
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,568
Congress is full

740
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,360
Afglobal at operative

741
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,688
So you need almost a fascist dictator much like the people

742
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:13,248
Smedley Butler

743
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:18,112
March against f.d.r.

744
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:20,416
Why does drives me crazy

745
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,208
And of course

746
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,768
Bush was which was a disaster

747
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:26,560
Terrible

748
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,864
Here's here's the

749
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:32,448
Through-line of ookie

750
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,520
Like

751
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,824
Washing myself

752
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:38,848
In the city

753
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,128
Right

754
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,152
As he says that

755
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
Kitty powers

756
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,040
F*** yeah that's wrong

757
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:53,696
And then I think and Obama expanded those Powers thinking

758
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:56,768
So f*** that f*** him that should be allowed

759
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:03,168
And then Trump is got these powers and thank God he's too stupid to figure out how to use them properly

760
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:03,936
Because

761
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:12,128
He's too busy on Petty squabbles here at the church

762
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:16,992
Like the more this presidency goes on the more grateful I am that Trump won

763
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,528
And none of the other eight

764
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:19,808
Because if

765
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,832
If anybody

766
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:27,232
Really can't cope with the level of intelligence

767
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,280
Like if evil Obama

768
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,816
We're president right now

769
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,584
We would be

770
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:37,984
Fox are you kidding me we being a caliphate I know I know Larry Nichols

771
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,384
Destroyed of a large group of people ever agreeing with their enemy

772
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,408
Right

773
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:48,480
The Republic

774
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:55,648
Yeah you're probably right we're dealing with people who say things like

775
00:39:55,904 --> 00:40:00,000
I know it's wrong if you have somebody

776
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,304
Combining that level

777
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,840
Xenophobic Lunas

778
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,656
That Trump had that he he needed to get elect

779
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,472
Ruthless capability

780
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:16,128
Dude they could destroy America tomorrow but I don't think any of the candidates have that combination

781
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:22,528
So we just get the xenophobic lunacy and be abusive

782
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,832
W and chadian where W is

783
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:29,184
Dumb enough and silly enough to get elected and Cheney is evil enough to enact all of his plan

784
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:35,840
Lake George W it's still a billion times

785
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,608
And the trumpets

786
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,144
And I hate saying that but that's

787
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,960
He's got 3 more years

788
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,008
Motel

789
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:45,824
Time will tell

790
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,360
Until 2003 so

791
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:50,176
Well I mean he was bogged down by

792
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:50,944
A 911

793
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:54,272
He was the reason 9/11 happened

794
00:40:54,784 --> 00:41:00,928
For the smallest of reasons including the documents

795
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:07,072
In the world regardless of location that affects population

796
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:12,704
Infrastructure economy

797
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,752
President

798
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,032
Total martial law

799
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,056
Total Marshall

800
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,616
It is important to add

801
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,408
The president is merely a pop

802
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,784
Assembly passed them on

803
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,832
Redwood future

804
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,112
Administration

805
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,416
Except for Trump

806
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:39,840
I'm transitioning from Road

807
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:54,431
I got a lot of abusive posts.

808
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,711
Really happening right now

809
00:41:56,223 --> 00:42:02,367
Yeah I forgot that I should have given a warning

810
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,487
YES Prep rewrite

811
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,047
Show me

812
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,863
Rodney would help

813
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,423
Yes there are Benedict

814
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,215
You must teach

815
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:17,983
People

816
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,519
Love

817
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,431
Almost

818
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,199
Unconditionally

819
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:27,967
Why don't we

820
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:31,039
To the point where nothing matters

821
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:35,391
You got to teach people how to love their leaders find itself

822
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:38,975
Xenophobic

823
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:43,839
Predatorial always rational release under pressure

824
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,887
Pays off people Superior

825
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:48,191
Mazda

826
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,727
When all they really are

827
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:55,359
Parasitically feeding on the house population

828
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:58,431
Until they're cancerous movement causes the collapse

829
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,991
I'm here cuz he's just saying

830
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,527
Adamstown

831
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:04,575
Mystery

832
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,343
And less than

833
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:11,231
I don't know if he's rocklick

834
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,279
Broccoli

835
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,583
Hands of a state

836
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:19,935
This is where Alex get super anti-government

837
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,983
Lives of more than 60 million

838
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,775
Men women and children

839
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,823
Hitler's War killed

840
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,847
22

841
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:30,175
Great during mousy tongues rain Alo

842
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:33,759
More than 16 million peasant farmers

843
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:34,783
True

844
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,319
And the list goes on

845
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:39,135
Innocent civilians

846
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,927
Killed in Guatemala

847
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:44,511
More than two million Souls brutally murdered

848
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,303
By the government

849
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:47,839
1 million

850
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:50,143
500000 killed in Turkey

851
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:56,799
Turkish Ganda 100,000-plus hacked to death with machete

852
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,943
There are too many examples of innocent fan

853
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,223
Bee exterminator

854
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,503
By their governments

855
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,039
Industrial scale

856
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,319
All the

857
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,879
And that's why you should ask Oracle

858
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,647
Are you racist

859
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,927
Xenophobic mom

860
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,695
LobsterTube

861
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,487
Control the largest military

862
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:21,887
The only point that I want to make about this is Alex's trying to

863
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:22,911
Shock people with

864
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,703
These numbers

865
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,983
Terrible horrible thing

866
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,775
Woody's conflating a lot of things

867
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,311
Because some of those were intentional Jen

868
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,359
Besides some of them were

869
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,127
Terry NFL

870
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:32,895
Make a violin

871
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,687
That also

872
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,223
Ended up being genocide

873
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,783
And if some of them were

874
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:42,879
Droughts that were exacerbated by mismanagement of government like

875
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,671
The numbers that you have for math

876
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,487
That's not all brutal murders

877
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,535
A lot of that had to do with just like

878
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,327
They didn't know how they were running

879
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:03,615
His main issue was he killed all of the people who could have helped him run right those numbers are super

880
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,919
Inflated by virtue of

881
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:08,479
Cyclical pattern

882
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:14,367
Yeah

883
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:16,671
To do in

884
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:19,487
Everybody who knows anything is stupid it's almost like

885
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,279
Call Rolex

886
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,071
Is not a good foundation

887
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,351
No

888
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:27,423
Murdered by the government

889
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:28,959
This is all I'm saying

890
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:29,983
Complaining a lot

891
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,007
Thanks anyway

892
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:35,103
Number one cause of unnatural death

893
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:39,455
If you take the 150 million people

894
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:49,695
10 / 100,000

895
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:55,071
With 100,000 screaming of Robotics 1500

896
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:58,143
That's 1500 Sports

897
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:01,471
With 100,000 people

898
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,335
Greatness

899
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,615
Can't happen here

900
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:08,895
Won't happen to them

901
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,431
You have been warned

902
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,991
Write the Carnage with

903
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,527
In the last hundred years

904
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,575
Was only the Preparatory phase

905
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,879
Of the new world orders master plan

906
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:32,703
We've reached the point.

907
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:40,895
This is annoying racking up the highest death toll in history

908
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:47,295
We'll get to greener pastures here in a bit the mass murder and enslavement still going on today

909
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,599
And enjoys the full support and sanction

910
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,623
Of the new world

911
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:57,279
And the United States

912
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,287
I don't know but also

913
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,567
1

914
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,871
You don't want people's pillows actually being said

915
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:16,735
Because if you do it we will probably find out it sounds a lot like what Alex says

916
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,503
Later on

917
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:20,831
Open you just said that the China is the globalist

918
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,367
Testing ground for ideas

919
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,135
Depression

920
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,415
There's no

921
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:27,231
Bibliography

922
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:35,167
I need David Rockefeller

923
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:37,727
David Rockefeller

924
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,543
Try out different way

925
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,591
You're making claims like

926
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:43,615
You have to support them

927
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:48,735
What you're saying is embarrassing if you don't repress tinge

928
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,015
In different ways

929
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:50,783
Right

930
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:51,807
That's all he said

931
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:58,975
He's also trying to link back to something else is bigger narrative

932
00:47:59,487 --> 00:47:59,999
Hey

933
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:03,071
Look at all the ways that people are being oppressed in China

934
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,119
Don't get a pretzel

935
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,935
You have to say that it's

936
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,727
Who is trying out all these different

937
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,519
Because if you just

938
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:17,663
The white listener

939
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,247
Have any concept of what it is that

940
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,783
Oppression really is

941
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:23,807
Because that's

942
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:26,623
That's what he's trying to describe their look at all the way

943
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,415
That the government in China has oppressed

944
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,487
It must be shattered globalist doing that

945
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,279
It can't be

946
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,583
People

947
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,911
Given the opportunity

948
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,191
Will f******

949
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:43,519
Horrifyingly treat other people as if it doesn't matter

950
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,055
Because if you just say that

951
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:50,431
If you just reveal that it's something that's within the heart of every single human being on the planet

952
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:55,807
Nobody

953
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:01,695

Very frosty

1017
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:12,671
United States did not recognize the communist government of China but did retain relations

1018
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:14,975
Communist government in Taiwan

1019

In 1844 the signing of the Treaty of

00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:37,247
This treaty was only really brought up because

1027
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:39,295
The fears that Britain would dominate

1028
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:42,367
And we wanted a little bit of that taste

1029
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:46,207

It's a weird time for

1033
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,423

Reactivate the order permit in 1902 this is only repealed by the magnet

1048
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:41,759
Act of 1940

1049
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:45,855
A lot of Gold Rush

1050
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:49,695
The immigrants were tolerated when gold is plentiful

1051
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,463
Profound

1052
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:53,535
But once it started to dry up the local started turning on

1053
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:54,303
On the Chinese

1054
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:56,607

Foreign children

1059
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,847
So they moved

1060
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,895
Pick up working low-wage labor position

1061
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:10,687
The only things that were available

1062
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,223
The Exclusion Act

1063
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:16,063
Specifically made it so skilled and unskilled laborers in Chinese

1064
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,599
People engaged

1065
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:19,135
Could not come

1066
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:21,439
Even if they did they'd be put in jail or deported

1067
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,719
This single act

1068
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,999
Completely isolated the

1069
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:27,327
Already existing Chinese population here in America

1070
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,631
It's one of those things where it's just like

1071
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,423
It's just like with this gets worse

1072
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:33,471
Yeah before you go any further

1073
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,263
It's just like

1074
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,287
The

1075
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,055
The opposite

1076
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,079
The slavery

1077
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:40,895
I would like

1078
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:43,199
We can't have these people slaves

1079
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:45,247
They're working for free

1080
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,295
It's bad to inflate

1081
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:57,023
Will be in house exact same people have different takes on it

1082
00:54:57,279 --> 00:55:03,423
Comfortable I know the problem is definitely has nothing to do with the system

1083
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:08,031
That I've allowed myself to be worked under for this entire time

1084
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,567
The other guy

1085
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:16,479
The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 led to a. Known as the driving out. We're angry White Stripes

1086
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:18,271
About existing Chinese population

1087
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:21,087
Scrum up ways around them or otherwise

1088
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,111
The Rock

1089
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:28,511
Springs Massacre of 1885 occurred when white miners in Sweetwater County Wyoming got mad about job competition

1090
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:31,327
Resorted to shooting stabbing and assaulting Chinese workers

1091
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,863
But why terrorism

1092
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:37,727
I tried to flee only to end up being burned alive in their homes and starve to death in hiding

1093
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,751
But why terrorism

1094
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:43,103
At least 20 people

1095
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,663
This was followed up by the Snake River

1096
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:48,223
1887 were 34 Chinese miners were murdered

1097
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:54,111
Chinatown in San Francisco would go on to be scapegoated for an outbreak

1098
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:58,975
Most likely caused by a French merchant ship that arrived with a guy on it and it died of the plague

1099
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,767
As Time wore on the

1100
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:03,071

00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,783
China we supplied them with

1118
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:58,111
During the second Speedo Chinese

1119
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:04,511

A little bit

1125
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:20,127
As WWII workout Chiang Kai-shek was very helpful and

1126
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:22,175
Making sure the China did not become a member of the ACT

Just powers

1128
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:29,343
After the war in 1945 civil war broke out in China between the Nationalist Republic of China in the Communist people

1129
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:32,159
United States support the Nationalist

1130
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:35,231
But deep direct intervention to stop the Communists

1131
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,511
As not being worth

1132
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,279
The cost it wouldn't

1133
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:39,071
Strange

Immediately following the underworld

1137
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:53,663
Really after

1138
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:57,247
Those are the same

1139
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,271
They're not the same

1140
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:03,903
The point the point is that the way that we treated

1141
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:04,927
China immediately

1142
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:06,975
Of World War

1143
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,767
Has dominated the

1144
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,791
Entirety of our

1145
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,351
Because we

1146
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:17,471
Famously Eisenhower in

1147
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,751
Churchill

1148
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:22,591
F****** let's go to town let's finish Russia off while we got the chance

1149
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:23,359
We need to

1150
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,639
They're weak right now.

1151
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:25,407
Take them down

1152
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:28,991
In the same way China had just been decimated by the Japanese

1153
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:30,527
Occupation

1154
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:31,295
F******

1155
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:32,575
Rudolph

1156
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:34,623
Like the extent to which

1157
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,415
Japanese Occupation was brutal

1158
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,951
It's something that is not

1159
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:43,071
Really quite as discussed in WWII literature is maybe it

1160
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:48,703
It should be when you think about why we got North Korea and South Korea

1161
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:49,471
Japanese Occupation

1162
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,751
As well

1163
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:51,519
Korean

1164
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:53,311
Immediately following World War

1165
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:55,615
How we didn't do any goddamn s*** there either

1166
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,407
The other question of courses

1167
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,687
What exactly are we supposed

1168
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:00,735
To do are we the only people who are supposed

1169
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,015
To do everything in these times

1170
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:05,087
And then the other writer then we evaded around like

1171
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,879
Cool long mess of things

1172
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,415
And it was those

1173
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,695
Small decision

1174
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:12,767
Is made immediately at the end of World War II

1175
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:14,303
Really

1176
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:15,839
F******

1177
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,911
Set the course for both

1178
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,959
Russian and Chinese relation

1179
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:25,311
Consider that at that point you already had Aid

1180
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,079
Deep history

1181
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:29,151
Literal beginning of our country being real shitheadsteve

1182
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:31,711
The Chinese

1183
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,527
After Roto-Rooter

1184
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,807
Like you're you're saying

1185
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,343
We've decided it wasn't worth

1186
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,623
The effort to try and help

1187
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:43,999
There are

1188
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:45,791
The cost of an all-out effort to

1189
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,327
See, his forces resisted and

1190
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,887
Destroyed

1191
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:51,679
To the result

1192
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,263
We abandoned our allies who helped us

1193
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,311
Avoid further complication World War

1194
00:59:57,567 --> 01:00:01,151
It's due back Ismael and the Communists took over the country in 1949

1195
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:04,735
Recognize that

1196
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:08,575
Which would be 6 years after Rockefeller road is very short

1197
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:12,415
1971 us China relationship

1198
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:15,999
Fossil

1199
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:20,607
Cold War and Mao's cultural revolution almost completely isolated China from the rest of the world

1200
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:21,375
For many years

1201
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:23,167
Ryan from communist country

1202
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:30,847
Nixon went to China after all what was North Korea before North

1203
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:34,431
Nixon went to China after was known as the ping-pong diplomacy

1204
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:37,503
Us in Chinese ping pong players getting along

1205
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:42,879
Really racist Until you realize they're referring directly to ping-pong itself

1206
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:48,767
It seems it seems very suspiciously like

1207
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:51,839
The ching chong bing bong

1208
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:55,935
Yes we ended up a created an opportunity word American

1209
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:57,983
Ping pong player visit

1210
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,263
Open.

1211
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:00,799
This possibility of

1212
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,615
Visiting

1213
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:06,431
The opening of the u.s.

1214
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:10,015
At the beginning of normalization of relations

1215
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:16,159
At the point Rockefeller wrote his tiny op-ed article almost no access to China for deca

1216
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:21,535
Probably a little naive or generous

1217
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,815
Also taking into account

1218
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:23,583
But he wanted to try and

1219
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:26,655
Market now that it was open

1220
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:32,031
Reading that op-ed in that context in my ears it falls a long way

1221
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:34,335
Short of open support for Maui

1222
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:38,431
Authoritarian rule the criticism made a Rockefeller statement is valid

1223
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,455
Terrible Optics

1224
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:41,759
Minimize the brutal authoritarianism

1225
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:45,599
There's an argument to be made for

1226
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,159
Infant mortality rates drop from

1227
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,439
227

1228
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,207
1000

1229
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,231
1949

1230
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:51,999
250

1231
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:55,583
4012 adult mortality rates

1232
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,911
Not necessarily China Heather life

1233
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,703
Expectancy 35 years

1234
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:01,727
B49

1235
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:02,495
Which one of the sea

1236
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,519
66 years by

1237
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:04,287
19 seven

1238
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,055
96

1239
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:07,359
These stats are not enough Justified

1240
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,895
But it would be easy to

1241
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:09,663
To see those sort

1242
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,431
Two things being

1243
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,967
Persuasive signs

1244
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:16,319
Someone who came in and just got the lay of the land as Ava

1245
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:17,343
Taurus

1246
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:21,183
So I'm saying is the Rockefeller I think you f***** up and make

1247
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:21,951
This op-ed

1248
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:23,231
It's a little hasty

1249
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:26,303
Possibly but it's not all that sign of

1250
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,071
Globalist

1251
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,887
Being in favor of now's authoritarian rule

1252
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:31,679
It needs to be taken in the

1253
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,447
The proper

1254
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:33,727
Existed in

1255
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:34,751
Which was

1256
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,799
Decades and decades

1257
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,847
Terrible China relations

1258
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:41,407
Only being opened up after

1259
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:43,199
A very bizarre pink

1260
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:45,759
And

1261
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,039
Serval relations

1262
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:48,319
Large

1263
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,159
Not not like

1264
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:56,767
Very much.

1265
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:03,679
Like if you went to a conversation with

1266
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,983
Any Chinese person

1267
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,335
Every single grieving

1268
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:11,615
The Chinese person

1269
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,407
Yeah I know

1270
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:14,943
We totally did

1271
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:18,271
Absolutely

1272
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:20,575
That was a good one

1273
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:26,207
Now we're against

1274
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,231
Yeah

1275
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:30,047
Whatever the price of the Chinese Revolution

1276
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,583
It is

1277
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:44,895
The social experiment in China under Chairman Mao's leadership is one of the most important

1278
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,431
David Rockefeller

1279
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:49,503
New York Times August 10th 1973

1280
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:54,367
All right did he really say that that is a real quote from the article but it's also taken out of context

1281
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:56,671
4144

1282
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,439
Maybe five

1283
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:01,535
Luigi said those words

1284
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:03,583
Communist China is the model

1285
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,143
For the New World Order

1286
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:07,679
Shina

1287
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:10,239
Has received more United Nations award

1288
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,543
Form of government

1289
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:16,383
Ignore

1290
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:21,503
What award Awards

1291
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:24,319
Noid

1292
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:28,927
Authoritarian

1293
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:33,791
Shina adorable

1294
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,375
From a Consortium of eugenics organization

1295
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,655
Which includes

1296
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:42,495
Red flag

1297
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:45,055
Throwing up in the air

1298
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:50,943
So do you want me to go through this about the China so you can keep on eating the word forwards

1299
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:54,271
Large population

1300
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:56,575
Anyways this

1301
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:57,343
The terrible history

1302
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:00,159
History between

1303
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:01,439
With eight

1304
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,975
1828 salmon

1305

Is recorded between 100 ABC and 9

1306
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:09,375
Including the northern Chinese

1307
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,399
1870s

1308
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:13,983
1817

1309
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:16,031
19 to 13 million people.

1310
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:18,335
3 Chinese

1311
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,359
58 through 19

1312
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:20,895
T2 led to the death of

1313
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:26,783
50 through 8

1314
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,063
73

1315
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,111
60 million

1316
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:32,415
119:42

1317
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:34,207
243 kill 223 million

1318
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,231
1 from 9

1319
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,023
37

1320
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:37,791
Killed approximately

1321
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:38,559
5 million

1322
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:40,607
Historically been in

1323
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:44,447
In China because of the weather patterns at high incidence

1324
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:46,495
However

1325
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:50,847
All this has naturally been exacerbated Times by the Warring States.

1326
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:53,151
General contractor

1327
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:56,991
Getting in the way of distribution

1328
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:59,807
Field and more recently by now government doing an absolute

1329
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:03,391
Didn't do a great job

1330
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:09,023
Weird way to describe mouth

1331
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:13,631
Could not really find called of all of the ways to describe now I wouldn't be like

1332
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,167
Okay

1333
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:17,471
About this guy

1334
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:23,103
Super wishy-washy about multiple children

1335
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:28,479
To know if you look at history

1336
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:31,039
You don't have her like a clear stance

1337
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:33,599
There's no clear stance

1338
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:37,439
Power you strongly in favor of larger population

1339
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,975
Believing the more communists

1340
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:39,743
More power

1341
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:42,303
More amenable to birth

1342
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,607
Control ideas even launching Family Planning

1343
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:46,655
71

1344
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:49,727
Slogan 122r just fine

1345
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:53,055
The issue was that at the time

1346
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:55,871
China was home to 1/4 of a cup

1347
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:56,895
The Goldilocks and

1348
01:06:57,151 --> 01:07:02,527
Yeah yeah quarter of the world's population with access to

1349
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,063
7% of the world

1350
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,087
Usable land

1351
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:07,391
Two-thirds of our population was under 30

1352
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:09,183
Are the Baby Boomers are entering the

1353
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:10,975
Stage of life where they would reproduce

1354
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:11,999
This is all a

1355
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:14,047
Complete disaster in the making for a country with a

1356
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:15,583
History of salmon

1357
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:17,631
Planned Parenthood was not involved

1358
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:18,911
The creation of the one-child

1359
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:25,823
But there is some concern that they have not done enough to stop it or mitigate the Cruller aspect of

1360
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:30,175
Play a part of an organization called the international Planned Parenthood Federation

1361
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,711
Remembers also include

1362
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,991
The China Family Planning

1363
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:37,087
So there's a parent group that right

1364
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:37,855
There's been

1365
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:39,647
Concern over the years whether or not these

1366
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:40,671
Cfpa the

1367
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:41,951
Family Planning associate

1368
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:43,999
Has been complicit in the sterilization

1369
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:44,767
For sabores

1370
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,559
Did the Chinese government used to

1371
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,327
Enforced

1372
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,095
Hornets

1373
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:50,143
Productive

1374
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,167
Articles

1375
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,703
Claims Planned Parenthood

1376
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:53,983
Complicit consistently make

1377
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:54,751
We target

1378
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:02,431
Without being able to read Chinese or hop on a plane to investigate it's unclear what

1379
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:05,759
Cooperation with the organization entails

1380
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:09,087
Yeah there's a lot of like soft bulshit like

1381
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:12,927
That's immensely fresh

1382
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,207
Yeah absolutely

1383
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,743
Because then because

1384
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:17,023
Your argument that

1385
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:17,791
Is

1386
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:19,839
Anytime Family Planning

1387
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,119
Of any sort

1388
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,911
Comes about it is playing

1389
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:24,703
But

1390
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:29,311
I will only mention it whenever Family Planning does not go the way that I wanted

1391
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:33,407
Take me to Richmond

1392
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:35,199
Okay yes

1393
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:39,551
Planned Parenthood has allowed so many women who otherwise would have been

1394
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:43,391
Bog down by children and yada yada yada and all of this s***

1395
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:45,951
Planned Parenthood

1396
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:47,487
Whatever

1397
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:54,911
This one group of people in China may be involved or maybe they weren't or maybe they couldn't bend or whatever

1398
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:57,215
They had a thing and that did a thing

1399
01:08:58,495 --> 01:08:59,263
Planned Parenthood small

1400
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,031
Totally

1401
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:04,127
And I think a better argument you can make is that given the lack of evidence about rape

1402
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,151
Participation ended

1403
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:05,919
Disgusting facts

1404
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,991
Definitely

1405
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:10,783
And enforcing their one child policy

1406
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:14,367
I possible that the international Planned Parenthood Federation was

1407
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,391
Interested in operating

1408
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,671
China is a way to offer

1409
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:19,231
Self-directed birth control alternative

1410
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:21,791
Do the horse oppressive ones offered by the state

1411
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:23,839
The same goal can be reached by education

1412
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:24,863
Or by force

1413
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,167
Pastor forces always had too many consequence

1414
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:32,031
Be worthwhile

1415
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:32,799
Probably

1416
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:35,359
But if

1417
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:39,199
Effective nobody f****** tried

1418
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:40,223
Well

1419
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:44,063
It is one of those

1420
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:46,111
Be careful what you wish for situation

1421
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:48,415
Especially with the China's one-child Pollo

1422
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:50,719
Your call surprised

1423
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:51,743
Ismail children

1424
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:53,535
Far above

1425
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:56,095
And it has a one child policy

1426
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,631
For a long long time

1427
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:58,655
Turns out

1428
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:01,727
One woman forever

1429
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:07,359
Unintended consequence

1430
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:11,967
Designated Nazi.

1431
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:13,247
I brought up there was

1432
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:14,271
Beginning of that

1433
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:16,575
Disastrous

1434
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:19,903
Famine found themselves into my baby boom

1435
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:24,511
It's very understandable why those

1436
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:25,279
Bike

1437
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,047
Policies

1438
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:26,815
Would be

1439
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:27,583
Considered

1440
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:35,519
What they did in response to them are unforgivable in and all that but also Planned Parenthood wasn't involved

1441
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,055
And the only thing that

1442
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:37,823
Any of the sites

1443
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,615
He offers RN

1444
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:41,407
Weirdo dumbass website

1445
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,175
Improve

1446
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,455
Is speculation

1447
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:45,759
It's just nonsense where they want to

1448
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:46,527
Car

1449
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:50,367
Parenthood at being collaborators

1450
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:52,159
They were there trying to make it like

1451
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,439
We can do this better

1452
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:56,767
Rather the Federal Way

1453
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:57,791
Sterilizing

1454
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,071
Condoms

1455
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:02,655
That's the idea behind

1456
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:05,215
But irregardless that is not

1457
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:08,543
Legitimate criticism to Levy at planned

1458
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:11,103
Just because even if it like

1459
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:12,639
It is

1460
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:15,455
You're going to their country

1461
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,527
If you're going to talk about

1462
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:22,111
Sovereignty

1463
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,391
If your Planned Parenthood

1464
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,415
Do you have a state

1465
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:27,999
Not doing whatever you can

1466
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:31,327
I mean ultimately what is the the gold Planned Parenthood

1467
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,863
Giving women age

1468
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:34,911
Nancy over themselves

1469
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:38,751
So even if you're going to

1470
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:40,543
One child policy

1471
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:43,359
That doesn't change your

1472
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:46,943
No actually makes it more important that you operate air

1473
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:47,711
Of course

1474
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:49,247
So it's actually like

1475
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:53,855
Wasn't there trying to give

1476
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,903
I think

1477
01:11:56,415 --> 01:12:02,559
Yeah

1478
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:04,351
Women make their own decisions

1479
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,887
Control their Healthcare

1480
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:07,679
There's a place where its worst

1481
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:09,471
F*** it leave it alone

1482
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:12,799
Not our deal it's it's nonsense

1483
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:24,319
Couples that have more than one child

1484
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:25,599
Heavy fine

1485
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:33,279
With the cultural desire.

1486
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,815
Has plunged China

1487
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:39,423
There are 30 million

1488
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:46,335
The Chinese police state

1489
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:49,919
Underground churches

1490
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,319
Forced labor

1491
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:59,903
Their blood and tissue types

1492
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:03,231
Preparations organ parts

1493
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:04,511
Send you have America

1494
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,607
The Chinese government

1495
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:10,911
Organs

1496
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:11,935
Highest

1497
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,727
Did not know that

1498
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:17,055
Medusa Morgan

1499
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,991
And the organs are in plants

1500
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:30,879
I'm not sure if it's as organs are being flown out

1501
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:34,719
Extraction

1502
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:38,047
I don't like for the undercoating

1503
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:38,815
I get that

1504
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:42,143
I don't think he'll show

1505
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,191
Disabled

1506
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:47,775
Is merely following

1507
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:49,823
The world

1508
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:55,455
Ocean worldwide

1509
01:13:57,503 --> 01:14:02,623
So ironically enough to a Grand Hyatt Buckhead

1510
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:03,647
Henry Kissinger

1511
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:05,439
1974

1512
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:08,767
Was the fake quote

1513
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,815
Of course

1514
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:13,119
If you're Henry Kissinger look again

1515
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:14,399
Henry Kissinger

1516
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,447
He's the worst

1517
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:19,519
But there's no way that you would allow anyone to

1518
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:21,823
Here and then record you say

1519
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:24,895
Depopulation should be the highest priority of foreign policy

1520
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,175
Towards the third world

1521
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:30,271
Even for Kissinger who may have said it in private

1522
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:32,063
Would never say it in public

1523
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:33,343
Do you want

1524
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,647
Comes from an internet meme

1525
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:38,207
Most likely

1526
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:41,023
Most likely before that it was a message board meme attributing

1527
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:42,559
Kissinger

1528
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:43,583
Depopulation

1529
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:45,375
Be the highest priority foreign policy

1530
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:46,399
Towards the third world

1531
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:49,215
Because the United States economy will require large

1532
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:52,799
And increasing amounts of minerals from abroad especially from less-developed

1533
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,615
This court cannot be authenticated

1534
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:57,663
If you just try to sort

1535
01:14:58,175 --> 01:15:00,735
If you just try to Source the part of it the quote the US

1536
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:04,063
The US economy would require large

1537
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:04,831
Increasing amounts

1538
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:11,231
The minerals for abroad from development

1539
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:11,999
Is taken

1540
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:14,559
From biodiversity

1541
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:17,887
Talking about earlier

1542
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:25,055
Whatever they feel like that Alex isn't

1543
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:27,615
This part is the fake part of a quote

1544
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:28,639
Completely made up

1545
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:35,039
It's just that he's he's hacked off the real party and make it much more difficult to Google

1546
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:40,415
We are trying to make it harder to find out that he's just fabricate quotes

1547
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:47,327
He's lying on another level

1548
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:51,935
What's here in Alex Jones documentary

1549
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:56,287
Of the second part

1550
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:59,359
Whatever may be done to guard against interruptions

1551
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:03,455
New Supply in developed domestic alternative the US economy

1552
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:05,759
Increasing amounts of minerals from abroad special

1553
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:06,783
Developed countries

1554
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:09,599
The fact that fact gives the US

1555
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,671
Political economic and social

1556
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:13,439
Stability of

1557
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,207
Supplying

1558
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:16,255
Whatever

1559
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:19,071
Went wherever lessening the population pressure

1560
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:19,839
Through the reduced

1561
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:20,607
Birth rates

1562
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:22,655
Can increase the prospects for such stability

1563
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:23,935
Population policy

1564
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:25,983
Becomes relevant to Resource Supply

1565
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,519
Answer the economic interest

1566
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,287
Of the United

1567
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,079
So

1568
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,383
There is a thin

1569
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:34,943
Veneer of similarity in terms of

1570
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,991
Dubai population

1571
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,015
Issues

1572
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:40,831
Population control should be

1573
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:43,391
Our highest priority population

1574
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:47,231
Kissinger so it could be that he is talking to

1575
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:52,863
What's the researchers looked into the quote that Alex able to trace it back

1576
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,911
The furthest back they can get

1577
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:55,935
Instances of it

1578
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:57,983
Aura of Louis Farrakhan

1579
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:00,031
Interview with the

1580
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:02,335
Anti-nuclear activists Lauren Monet

1581
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:04,895
I am being the most likely public sources

1582
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:07,455
Public sources of the misquoting

1583
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:10,271
Both claim to be quoting the same source

1584
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:13,343
But but

1585
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:14,367
Sounds right

1586
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:18,975
So I don't know I made this is just a fake quote

1587
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:24,095
People

1588
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:25,887
Who were faking the quote

1589
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:28,447
Is in the Sacramento area

1590
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:31,775
Heavy quotes

1591
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:32,799
Yes

1592
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:39,711
Before that

1593
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:40,991
All of these quotes are fake

1594
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:42,015
That's

1595
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:43,039
That is

1596
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:44,575
Easiest thing

1597
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:46,111
As an editor

1598
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:48,415
Or someone putting together a documentary

1599
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:49,183
To figure out

1600
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:50,975
Is this quote real

1601
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:53,535
Can I find it in the public record

1602
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:54,815
Is it in the text

1603
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:57,375
Easiest f****** thing to do

1604
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,655
And Alex didn't think

1605
01:17:58,911 --> 01:17:59,679
To do that

1606
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:00,959
It's weird that

1607
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:03,263
Within the definition of

1608
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,031
Quote

1609
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:08,639
Of the word quote

1610
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,943
Direct

1611
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:12,223
Word for word

1612
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:18,623
That's why we have a separate word for when you're not doing that called paraphrase reaching for the

1613
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:22,463
Spirit of what this guy's trying to say I'm not some summarizing it

1614
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:25,791
I'm taking directly word-for-word so when I say

1615
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:26,559
Quote

1616
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:29,375
This man said this you can be sure

1617
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:34,239
Word for word exactly what you said

1618
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:37,567
When you are quoting somebody for Metairie

1619
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:39,871
One thing you should

1620
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:42,943
To get everywhere

1621
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:46,783
Every single right otherwise a price

1622
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:47,807
Otherwise

1623
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:50,367
For admit you're lying

1624
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:54,463
He would have a defensible case if he was saying he was paraphrasing

1625
01:18:54,719 --> 01:19:00,863
No you wouldn't cuz the spirit is still off but

1626
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:12,383
White letters on a black background with ominous music behind him if he says

1627
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:14,687
To paraphrase David Rockefeller

1628
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:15,455
You be like

1629
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:21,599
Alright well I found parts of this quotes

1630
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:24,159
So here's where this really comes from

1631
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:26,463
I know it's not a quote but

1632
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:27,743
You know that kind of

1633
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:32,351
Jordan

1634
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:38,239
Those glasses

1635
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:39,263
Versus Jim Tucker

1636
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:41,567
Glasses

1637
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:47,967
For sure I agree

1638
01:19:54,623 --> 01:20:00,767
None of this may succeed this. But this to me it sort of the Outline by which

1639
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:06,911
In the next few years it's illusion

1640
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:10,239
Where does this mindset

1641
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:13,824
Why do the elites kill the largest mass

1642
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,944
Feel like that

1643
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:21,760
What ideology Drive

1644
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:27,392
We're about to enter a section of this documentary

1645
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:28,672
Is about eugenic

1646
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,464
We're about to enter a cell

1647
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:32,000
About Alex

1648
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,536
Well that's what

1649
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:34,560
What he says

1650
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:35,584
What is

1651
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:37,632
People think the way they do

1652
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:40,192
What I hear is I'm about to tell you what makes

1653
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,752
Easier Talkatone about eugenics

1654
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:46,336
And this is the part of the documentary where I kind of have to take a step back

1655
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,872
I got to have to be like

1656
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:51,200
You're misleading people about what eugenics

1657
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:57,600
Was as a broader picture he's not wrong in a lot of

1658
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:58,880
Throw out eugenics

1659
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:00,416
Even with bad information

1660
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:06,816
You're closer to the truth and if you throw David Rockefeller is a Jew the idea of a scientist

1661
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:08,608
That we hold up

1662
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,144
Fairley High esteem

1663
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:14,752
Long dalliances with Eugenics ideas

1664
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:16,032
That is dead

1665
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:20,128
True a guy who believe that

1666
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:26,528
That's a caveat I'm going to make for the next

1667
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:28,320
Benefits documentary

1668
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:31,136
Well yeah I can't f****** arguing

1669
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:33,952
Is real f****** popular for a while

1670
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:37,024
Creatively explain the fact that you'll be

1671
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,816
I might be a little bit

1672
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,192
2400 years ago

1673
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:47,520
Borders of openly proclaimed their desire

1674
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:53,920
Again not before that

1675
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:58,528
Plato's fault

1676
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:09,536
Real-time traffic

1677
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:11,328
Has always been a track

1678
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:16,704
Because it creates a convenient excuse for treating your fellow man

1679
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:17,984
Lower than that

1680
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:24,384
Also there was nine

1681
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,152
Traits was

1682
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:25,920
The new

1683
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:27,456
Explosion of Pop

1684
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:29,248
Applications of it was

1685
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:30,528
The new

1686
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,064
So

1687
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,112
Chronology

1688
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:35,648
I don't want to hear Alex

1689
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:37,440
Ever talk about reason

1690
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:39,744
I don't want to hear him talk about how

1691
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:40,768
Oh

1692
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:43,840
This is why they demonized other people Alex you found

1693
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:45,376
Plenty of reasons on your own

1694
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:46,144
And a half

1695
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:49,984
But I'm just trying to say that there is like

1696
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:53,056
There's a pretty simple explanation for why eugenics

1697
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,616
Vanguard

1698

Realized

1699
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:02,784
Call know when you mix intelligent people with

1700
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,832
Super racist people

1701
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:05,856
You're going to wind up getting

1702
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:06,880
Super intelligent reason

1703
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:07,648
Sims 4 being

1704
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,440
Totally totally

1705
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,512
Robert Thomas Malthus

1706
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:14,816
Famous for saying

1707
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:16,352
Collapse would be helpful

1708
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:17,888
Because it would

1709
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:21,216
You his fictional scenario would later be called

1710
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:23,008
Email Susie and catastrophe

1711
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,800
He wasn't insane

1712
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:27,104
Because his ID

1713
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,128
Led to the rise

1714
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,408
New Scientist

1715
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:32,480
The real quick about Malthus

1716
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:34,528
Didn't want to wipe out the fact

1717
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,296
He supported help

1718
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:42,464
Videos about moral character

1719
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:48,608
Essential to

1720
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:51,936
Having a successful life anyway

1721
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:53,216
Stop that was unnecessary

1722
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:57,568
Catastrophe refers to a situation

1723
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:58,848
In the mouth is warned about

1724
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,152
Namely a situation where population in

1725
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:03,200
Increase outpaced agricultural production

1726
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:04,736
He warned that

1727
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:08,576
Reply.

1728
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:10,368
I'll choose is one source

1729
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:11,648
Recitation

1730
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:14,720
For this Andy doesn't specify

1731
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:16,000
600-page book

1732
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:18,048
I found this text

1733
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:21,888
This is interesting

1734
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:28,032
So we should facilitate instead of foolishly and Bailey endeavoring to impede the operations of nature

1735
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:29,312
I'm producing this mortality

1736
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:33,920
And if we dress

1737
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:37,248
We should seditious we

1738
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:40,320
Other forms of destructive nature to use

1739
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:44,160
Instead of recommending we should encourage contrary

1740
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:45,952
In other towns

1741
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:52,352
We should make the street tomorrow work

1742
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:54,912
Plague

1743
01:24:55,168 --> 01:25:00,544
In the country we should build our Villages near stagnant pools and forgot really like these

1744
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:06,944
Settlements in Michigan unwholesome situation I don't think he's being serious

1745
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:09,504
Specific remedies for ravaging diseases

1746
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:11,808
Those those benevolent

1747
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:17,440
But much mistaken men thought they were doing a service to mankind by projecting scheme

1748
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:20,256
For the total extirpation of particular disorder

1749
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:25,120
He is talking about Alex

1750
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:31,520
Yeah basically literally and it's cut the Modest Proposal

1751
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:38,944
He's clearly being

1752
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:40,736
Facetious

1753
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:42,784
He's making the point that like if you

1754
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:43,808
You don't want

1755
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:45,856
To be concerned about the

1756
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:49,440
Potential for the poor to feed themselves

1757
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:55,328
Right what are ultimate argument

1758
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:57,632
To highlight how stupid it is that you don't

1759
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:58,912
F****** support

1760
01:25:59,168 --> 01:25:59,936
People who were in it

1761
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:03,776
Disastrous

1762
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:04,544
Sarcasm

1763
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,336
If that screwed up

1764
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:10,688
We have never thought about it

1765
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:15,552
We should actually be going out and explaining what

1766
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:16,320
A tire

1767
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:18,624
With Dominic

1768
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:19,392
Course

1769
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:20,160
Human hits

1770
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:22,208
For the next 200-plus year

1771
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:24,768
Charles.

1772
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,048
Admirer

1773
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:31,424
Alex is lying about Malfoy

1774
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:34,240
So the idea that Darwin admired him

1775
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:35,264
That's not

1776
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,288
Suspicious or weird

1777
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:38,848
Developed the theory of evolution

1778
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,384
Chief

1779
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:42,432
The survival of the fittest

1780
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,480
With the help of

1781
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:46,528
Known as Darwin's bulldog

1782
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,320
Strong support of Darwin's theory

1783
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:51,392
Darwin's theories were pushed into wide except

1784
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:53,440
A monkey scientific circles

1785
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:55,488
And then the world

1786
01:26:56,512 --> 01:27:02,656
Darwin's cousin Francis Galton credited as the father of eugenics saw an opportunity

1787
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:09,056
Evolution Theory and applied social principles

1788
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:10,080
Social darwinists

1789
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:12,896
That's not

1790
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:13,920
Huxley

1791
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:25,440
That's not that that's not strictly speaking truth

1792
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:29,792
If you look at their birth chart there is there's like people who

1793
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:31,072
Intermarry

1794
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:34,912
Other families

1795
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:38,240
Because it's like

1796
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:43,104
It seems very uncommon to us but inner marrying within your family like Mary

1797
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,640
Your cousin or your second cousin

1798
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:45,664
Was not on

1799
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,432
Common in Britain

1800
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:50,016
Alex saying that like these guys

1801
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:53,088
They intermarried with each other that this

1802
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:53,856
That was kind of a

1803
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:55,136
Yeah

1804
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:56,160
A lot of the time

1805
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:57,440
We have places

1806
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:59,744
Kentucky

1807
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:02,816
There's so many reason

1808
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:04,864
Do that

1809
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:09,472
That was only a few Generations

1810
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:11,520
They would produce Superman

1811
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:18,688
The emerging pseudoscience was only codifying practice of

1812
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:21,760
Already popular

1813
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:26,368
Before families experiment was a disaster

1814
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:28,672
Again piano collections on Legend

1815
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:33,024
Guitar lessons

1816
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:36,864
Seriously mentally all about retaining property

1817
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:38,656
The moneyed class of the play

1818
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:41,216
Particularly the royal families in the world

1819
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:42,496
We're already at chef

1820
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:43,264
Breeding

1821
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,824
Build the predatory to stain for the underclass

1822
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:51,456
Yeah but that makes sense

1823
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:52,480
For them

1824
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:54,784
The reason it makes sense is because

1825
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,320
Nobody wants to admit

1826
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,368
That they have their money

1827
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,160
For no real reason

1828
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:02,720
Nobody wants to MetLife

1829
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:04,512
This is just random

1830
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,584
Over there

1831
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,864
Who doesn't have any money

1832
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:12,448
If I was born I could have been the same person

1833
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:13,216
Can't

1834
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:19,616
Devastator

1835
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:23,456
That was f****** Trump if you go back through his family of course they're f****** races

1836
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:24,224
This eugenicist

1837
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,016
Because none of them

1838
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:29,600
I'm just as random as dude if I didn't have money

1839
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:35,232
Reroute a couple

1840
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:38,816
You can't allow yourself to admit that so of course

1841
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:40,096
If you're a f******

1842
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:41,888
Inbred

1843
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:46,240
You're not going to be like well anybody could be

1844
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:48,544
Well it's because of genetics

1845
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:50,592
That's the reason my family has money

1846
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:51,616
Because of genetics

1847
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:52,896
Not just because we

1848
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:58,784
F***** over everybody as ever gotten in our way because apparently maybe maybe it is genetic tan

1849
01:29:59,040 --> 01:29:59,552
Maybe

1850
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:05,952
Sociopathy is something that you can transfer down through the line so you never have to deal with the fact that

1851
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:07,744
Other human beings are also real

1852
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:14,144
Evil people are f******

1853
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:15,680
Evil because of money

1854
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:20,288
Biometrics appears to be an ocean eye

1855
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:21,056
Carlton

1856
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:24,640
As a way to track

1857
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:27,456
And as a way to decide

1858
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:29,248
Would be licensed

1859
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:35,648
Cold Springs Harbor research facilities in the United States

1860
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:37,440
Eugenicist Charles Gavin

1861
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:41,792
With the funding of Marin

1862
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:45,632
Harbor is much bigger than the eugenics

1863
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,168
That Alex is talking

1864
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:48,192
But he's pretending

1865
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:50,496
Fire research laboratory

1866
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,544
Yeah there wasn't eugenics

1867
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,824
Department

1868
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:54,592
That was

1869
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:56,384
Ignored

1870
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:02,528
They found out about it and

1871
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:03,808
35

1872
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,600
F****** stop

1873
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:07,392
Shut off

1874
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,184
1939

1875
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:13,536
Cold Springs Harbor is this one

1876
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:16,608
Unipolar

1877
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:17,888
Just everybody's the same

1878
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:24,544
Agricultural experiments for doing that I like

1879
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:26,336
Animal husbandry

1880
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:27,360
This

1881
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:28,128
It's something

1882
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:30,176
That I've been

1883
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:32,224
Okay

1884
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:34,528
So here's the hard part about you

1885
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:37,088
When were talking about you

1886
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:39,136
If you stop and think

1887
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:40,672
What we did

1888
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:41,440
Two dogs

1889
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:42,976
What we turned wolves

1890
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:45,792
And we now call.

1891
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:47,328
That's huge

1892
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,120
That is the concept of

1893
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:49,888
Eugenics

1894
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,168
If you

1895
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:52,704
Find certain characteristic

1896
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:54,240
Overtime

1897
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:56,032
If you have complete control over there

1898
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:57,312
You can breathe

1899
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:58,848
Further enhancement of those

1900
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:02,688
You then follow

1901
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:04,736
Human beings are animals just like

1902
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:06,784
So we can do the same thing

1903
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:09,344
The problem comes

1904
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:12,672
Because we control every part of a dog's

1905
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:15,488
We can often see the

1906
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:17,280
Changes that we want to breed in

1907
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:18,048
In the dog get out

1908
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:21,120
It's not that I want the dog to be smarter

1909
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:24,704
Sing like that it's that this dog is much better at finding

1910
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:29,312
Solana breeded with a dog that's better like that whole thing

1911
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:32,128
I think that's a lot of the lessons that they started to learn

1912
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:33,152
In the 1930s

1913
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:41,600
Then you start throwing in

1914
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:42,368
Does people have

1915
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:43,904
Race

1916
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:44,928
Standing

1917
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,720
Class all of this

1918
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:47,488
Like

1919
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:48,768
Legitimately

1920
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:50,816
If we were to x out

1921
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:52,864
All of the other factors

1922
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:55,168
And just

1923
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:57,728
Like that the purest level

1924
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,032
This guy has large feet

1925
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,080
This lady has large

1926
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:07,968
And then breed accordingly with no regards for no regard for anything else

1927
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:10,272
Eventually you're going to get huge

1928
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:11,552
That's how

1929
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:14,112
Probabilistically yet

1930
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:17,440
Kelly works for thirty or forty thousand

1931
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:23,840
Everyone

1932
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:28,192
That was my foot

1933
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:32,032
Yeah maybe

1934
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:32,800
Superman

1935
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:35,616
What you're going to wind up doing

1936
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:38,176
Is just going for the most dumb Surfer

1937
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:42,784
Best level shift

1938
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:48,416
Then you go go f*** yourself you're a lying piece of s*** I am so much of it comes down to

1939
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:49,696
To like really am

1940
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:53,024
Equated models of like morality based

1941
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:54,048
I'm sort of a Genet

1942
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:56,608
Genetics

1943
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:58,656
Yeah you come into like Iowa what's

1944
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:07,872
It's a it's a hot mess we could if you want to if you want to believe in eugenics

1945
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:10,944
We could get big

1946
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:17,088
I'm glad we were able to come around to that really frustrates me because I feel like

1947
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:20,416
You you always wind up I like the more

1948
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:21,696
I don't know

1949
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:23,232
Like Eugenics isn't

1950
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,792
A blanket negative word

1951
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:34,752
The way that the word is always been applied is

1952
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:36,288
Discriminatory

1953
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:39,360
But like from a purely let's all step back

1954
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:41,920
Before

1955
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,992
And you hear these people saying you text me like

1956
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:46,272
Well

1957
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:47,296
Because

1958
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:48,832
Look at what we did to dogs

1959
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:51,136
We do math

1960
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:52,416
That whole

1961
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:56,256
My my problem with Eugenics is that

1962
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:57,280
People often

1963
01:34:57,792 --> 01:35:00,352
Mistake it for the idea of something

1964
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:01,888
Intrinsic like some sort of

1965
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:03,424
Value of genetic

1966
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:05,216
You know like

1967
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:06,752
Morality

1968
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:09,056
We can breed morality

1969
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:12,640
You just how revolutionary

1970
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:18,016
I might my chest is not my mind but my chest

1971
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:20,576
It's so hard to explain eugenics

1972
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:21,856
In such a way that

1973
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:23,648
Satisfies both my

1974
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:28,000
Inability to divorce Humanities idea of speciality from the rest

1975
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,840
Of course you could work

1976
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:32,864
Where in

1977
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:38,752
Well the same time divorcing it from the evil of like

1978
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:39,776
Well you know

1979
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:43,360
Of course if you have a skull that's three and a half

1980
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:45,664
4/3 in Long

1981
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:47,456
You're much smarter than somebody else

1982
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:48,480
You know that kind of

1983
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:49,760
Using eugenics

1984
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:50,528
On

1985
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:51,296
Humans

1986
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:55,904
Changeable

1987
01:35:58,208 --> 01:36:00,512
Advocates intrinsically immoral

1988
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:02,304
You are a

1989
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:05,632
Are the god emperor of Dune

1990
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,192
Shut up

1991
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:12,544
A grade

1992
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:18,176
2210 station laws passed in the United States

1993
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:20,224
Spoiler about to get to my

1994
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,016
My favorite thing Alex lies about this

1995
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,112
Citizens with mild deformity

1996
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:27,392
Arlo test score

1997
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:29,952
Four arrested

1998
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:31,232
And forcibly sterilized

1999
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:39,168
Yeah it's whatever.

2000
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:41,984
So we're trying to help them out as a Hutu

2001
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:45,056
They will take him to the hospital this afternoon

2002
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:48,640
Be very careful watch this watch for a jump

2003
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:53,504
39

2004
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:55,296
How does it take this morning

2005
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:57,088
Record necessary to

2006
01:36:57,344 --> 01:37:00,160
Prudential Sandy's case

2007
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:01,952
Examination

2008
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:05,024
They decided

2009
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:07,328
Entire family

2010
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:11,680
I don't know what you're talkin about

2011
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:17,824
Operation so there won't be anymore

2012
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:23,200
Now we take your brothers and institutions

2013
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:30,880
I'm keeping my job I'm not going anywhere

2014
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:36,768
Do you mean they're going to stop me from having children ever

2015
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:38,816
Exactly

2016
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,888
I won't go to the hospital

2017
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:55,456
So for no reason I watch this movie

2018
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,296
Alex is recycled

2019
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:01,600
Alex is presenting it as a pro eugenic

2020
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:02,624
Xmovies8

2021
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:04,416
Exact opposite

2022
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:11,584
You could tell just from that little sea turtles try to make this girl get

2023
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:15,168
Paralyzed

2024
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:17,216
So it's even more f***** up though

2025
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:18,496
It's so bizarre

2026
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:24,896
So that girl is what type of movie is going to have a cherub faced young beautiful girl they like

2027
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:31,552
I don't want you to make sure you kill all these attractive

2028
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:37,184
What are you talkin about young lady

2029
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:39,488
So I

2030
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:42,048
So she's part of this family right

2031
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:48,704
She's got two younger brothers one

2032
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,240
And the other is mental

2033
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:56,640
Defective and you will only sit around playing with his dad's empty whiskey bottle

2034
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:59,456
The mom

2035
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:03,296
Apparently we've learned

2036
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:09,696
The mom has a stillborn child right baby dies after one day the doctor comes over

2037
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:15,072
Very awesome Hero characters

2038
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:27,616
Doctor over to help you out and throw in the process of the

2039
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:28,896
Coming over

2040
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:30,176
They realize I like

2041
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:37,856
This family sucks let's f***

2042
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,952
Bunch of assistance money

2043
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:43,744
If they will all get sterilized

2044
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:46,048
I said the parents.

2045
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:49,376
That's crazy that sounds like something that would never happen

2046
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:50,400
Post

2047
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:52,448
20

2048
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:54,240
12 United States

2049
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:58,080
The parents sign a waiver daughter T-shirt

2050
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:00,896
Possible

2051
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:11,392
Will get booked at the daughter to come and get her tubes

2052
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:12,416
2

2053
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:13,696
Don't ever have kids

2054
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:14,720
Or whatever

2055
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:15,488
Anyway

2056
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,024
She's about to get married

2057
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:21,632
Supposed to be like this really lovable character

2058
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:24,192
He's driving her home

2059
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:27,776
In the car vs turmeric

2060
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:32,384
Character character for 1934

2061
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:35,200
And that means he's like I want to marry you and she's like

The government comes in there like you got to go we got to get these tubes tied

2065
01:40:56,704 --> 01:41:02,848
Rum and the Doctor Who would come over and Italy is like a

01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:05,408
She's working a job in

2067
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:08,992
Supporting the family with the drunk parents

2068
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:17,952
Muddles your argument just a little bit definitely don't know

2069
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:23,072
Don't sterilize based on family sterilized based on person come on

2070
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:25,888
So the argument that this good doctor is

2071
01:41:26,144 --> 01:41:27,424
Presenting throughout the

2072
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:28,192
Tire thing

2073
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:28,960
Is like

2074
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:34,080
I understand where Daryl ization could work but the way we're doing it is

2075
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:35,616
Precious the way we're doing it is

2076
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:37,664
Completely unnecessary it's it's

2077
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:41,248
It's been he's the voice of conscience in the f****** movie

2078
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:43,552
Along the whole way

2079
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:45,088
Trying to make sure they don't

2080
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:46,112
Can sterilize her

2081
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:48,928
It's not possible

2082
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:51,744
Hospital

2083
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:54,560
She's going to get

2084
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:56,608
Sterilize how long

2085
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:57,632
Like an hour

2086
01:41:57,888 --> 01:42:04,032
It's it's not all of this happens and it's not even watching the documentary

2087
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:10,432
1/2 hours and I still don't know what's going on

2088
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:17,088
Get through all of it

2089
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:22,208
I will wait I will say jumps around a bit

2090
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,000
Not euthanize sterilized

2091
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:25,792
Here's the twist

2092
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:29,120
What ends up happening

2093
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:30,400
Super drunk

2094
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:32,704
Mdiv fiance

2095
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:33,472
Hesby

2096
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:41,920
You got to do something to help her everything where the mom sterilize the dad

2097
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:45,248
For Christmas I got you sterile

2098
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:47,296
Drunk

2099
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:50,368
Not even my daughter she's ugly

2100
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:57,024
I'm so they called The Wait So now that's fine they call the judge and the judge called the hospital

2101
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:59,840
Actually related

2102
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:09,056
The end resolution of the movie is not good

2103
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:11,104
So

2104
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:12,640
Okay so

2105
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:14,176
In this movie

2106
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:15,456
Advocating

2107
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:21,088
Maybe human beings shouldn't be categorized based on their Social Circle

2108
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:24,416
At the end of it the movies like

2109
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:27,232
Thank God she was categorized

2110
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:31,072
The way out of the plot without being to subvert

2111
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:36,704
The film system in 1934

2112
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:41,824
We have to do it.

2113
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:45,152
The plot of the movie is

2114
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:46,944
The message of that doctor

2115
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:50,528
And it's clearly the way we're doing this is not right we are

2116
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:56,416
Cruel and inhuman right

2117
01:43:56,928 --> 01:43:58,976
F****** laughable

2118
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:01,536
To make it look like that

2119
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:05,632
More than it was saying

2120
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:06,912
Anyway

2121
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:13,312
Yeah well I mean Greenfield

2122
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:14,592
Black people in that

2123
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:17,664
Which is who they were doing all of the eugenics

2124
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:21,504
Two criminals

2125
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,296
Sterilized are both White

2126
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:24,064
Ones like

2127
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:25,344
Catatonic

2128
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:31,744
Sterilization was used

2129
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:33,536
Almost

2130
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:35,072
Exclusively as a

2131
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:37,888
They did make one really good salient

2132
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:40,960
In the movie

2133
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:44,032
Me for 1934 yeah which was when

2134
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:45,568
The girl had to go to court

2135
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:46,848
To be decided

2136
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:48,128
She was going to be sterilized

2137
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:48,896
Cuz they were like

2138
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:50,176
Appealing her case

2139
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:52,736
Another character was

2140
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:54,016
Do to be in court

2141
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:56,576
And it was this it was the son of the governor

2142
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:59,136
Ain't like he's back in Chambers

2143
01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:01,696
And other than nurse there was like trying to keep him

2144
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:02,976
Come together

2145
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:04,256
Rips off her shirt

2146
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:09,376
And the governor

2147
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:10,400
Keep it together

2148
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:13,216
And the lawyer comes over

2149
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:19,104
Makeup to make it look like

2150
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:29,344
I'm sorry for his actions in the past the governor in the judges like

2151
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,648
Paralyzed

2152
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:35,488
Class message like he's acting like

2153
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:37,024
F****** Unleashed

2154
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:39,072
Predator

2155
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:42,912
There is that subversive message within

2156
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:47,520
What are we talkin about tomorrow's children this

2157
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:51,360
Like this is before all of those

2158
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:55,200
Like you can't show this like all of those self

2159
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:56,992
Regulating that the Hollywood

2160
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:58,784
System did because realize I'd like

2161
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:03,392
I think you genuinely do

2162
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:10,816
I liked watching it in like realizing

2163
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:11,584
Alex

2164
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:15,424
Just like why would you

2165
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:17,984
For him to

2166
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:19,520
Only Alex

2167
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:20,288
Consistent

2168
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:22,336
Like this is a pattern of behavior

2169
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:23,872
This isn't just like

2170
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:29,248
Entirely to disprove his

2171
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:35,648
The edited it specifically because it talked about eugenics

2172
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,976
That was Charmed me about it

2173
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:42,304
He's trying to find anything that disagrees with

2174
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:45,888
And then cut it and put it in a way

2175
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:47,680
To make it look like it agrees with him

2176
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:51,264
One of course invalidating his own

2177
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:53,824
But who cares his argument is invalid

2178
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:57,920
Confusing whether or not anything he needs any

Who would have their children taken

2187
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:24,032
Who would be sterilized

2188
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,848
Some cases

2189
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:27,616

01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:52,448
Phenomenon

2194
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:53,472

2199
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:00,896
So the

2200
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:02,176
Connection between

2201
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:03,200
Is not really

2202
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:04,224
Concrete

2203
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:06,016
At the same time there's a lot of question

2204
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:07,040
Think about things

2205
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:08,576
May or may not have

But drawing a causal and linear

2209
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:15,744
Kinship there is not a pro

On October 26th

Singer was arrested for operating a women's clinic in New York's Lower East Side

2250

01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:23,488
Clinic down for good

2257
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:26,048
What you want to this charge is found guilty

2258
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:30,144
The judge held that women do not have quotes the right to copulate with a feeling of

2259
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:32,704
Security that there will be no resulting conception

2260
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:37,056
Brilliant legal

2261
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:40,128
The right to

2262
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:41,408
F*** without getting pregnant

2263
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:44,224
Army look

2264
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:46,272
Right

2265
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:50,624
Sounds right to me she was sentenced to 30 days in a workout

2266
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:54,720
She appealed the Constitution

2267
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:57,024
If you say women have the right to

2268
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:59,328
The f*** you got to work for it

2269
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:03,680
Csupo but in 1918 her appeal Was Heard

2270
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:05,472
And the case set the precedent that

2271
01:51:05,728 --> 01:51:08,032
Except

2272
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:10,336
Distribute distribution of contraception

2273
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:12,640
Information to women provided it was

2274
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:13,920
Scribe for medical

2275
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:16,224
That was illegal up till that point

2276
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,528
Are crazy

2277
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:20,576
Stupid Forever always

2278
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:23,392
Every time we find out one of Alex

2279
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:26,720
You discover

2280
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:30,816
How amazingly awesome they were

2281
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:33,888
Okay here's crazy also

2282
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:34,656
The thing about this

2283
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:38,496
Like if Phyllis Schlafly

2284
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:42,592
Should be lit on fire and then

2285
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:44,896
When her soul is brought back from hell

2286
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:46,944
Lit on fire again tossed out there again

2287
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:47,968
And so on and so forth

2288
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:50,016
Because I never want her to get comfortable any

2289
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:53,856
I don't want her to be comfortable in her eternal torment

2290
01:51:54,368 --> 01:51:55,648
I want her to have to keep bouncing around

2291
01:51:55,904 --> 01:51:56,928
Basically

2292
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:00,512
If Schlafly

2293
01:52:00,768 --> 01:52:02,560
Had a history as bad asses

2294
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:03,840
That of life

2295
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:06,144
Oh you're going to shut me down f*** you

2296
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:07,936
I'm going to do it again

2297
01:52:08,192 --> 01:52:09,472
F*** you I'm going to do it again

2298
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:13,568
F*** you I'm going to do it again

2299
01:52:13,824 --> 01:52:14,336
To do this s***

2300
01:52:14,592 --> 01:52:19,968
F*** you I'm going to do it again I'm going to feel this s*** and at the end of that a precedent is set that said

2301
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:20,992
Phyllis Schlafly

2302
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:24,576
As monsters that she can still be a monster I'd be like

2303
01:52:26,112 --> 01:52:32,000
I disagree with you I have to respect goddamn hell out of that and he can't even

2304
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:34,560
They can't be like look at what

2305
01:52:35,072 --> 01:52:36,352
And I disagree with her

2306
01:52:36,608 --> 01:52:38,400
Look at that badass

2307
01:52:38,656 --> 01:52:40,704
And there's no there's no point if it's like

2308
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:43,776
Wholeheartedly believe in

2309
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:45,056
Providing women

2310
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:46,848
No it's cuz she's a demon

2311
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:48,640
It's because she's a badass

2312
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:49,408
It's not because

2313
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:50,176
Kids are

2314
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:53,504
It's cuz she's a demon

2315
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:57,344
She anytime and time anybody who does something

2316
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,392
That disagrees with what you do

2317
01:52:59,904 --> 01:53:00,416
So hard

2318
01:53:00,672 --> 01:53:01,696
So hopefully

2319
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:02,976
So meaningful

2320
01:53:03,488 --> 01:53:04,512
It is not because

2321
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:06,304
They experience at meeting

2322
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:13,472
Talk that could come at you like that

2323
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:15,776
Is if they're controlled by state

2324
01:53:16,032 --> 01:53:17,312
And Alex

2325
01:53:17,568 --> 01:53:20,128
You understand islamophobia apparently

2326
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:26,784
And Alex's pretending along Tire Road shoes receiving money from these globalist rockfeller

2327
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:28,576
Who else

2328
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:29,600
Sucking wasn't

2329
01:53:30,112 --> 01:53:34,720
It's true John D Rockefeller Jr did Sports anchors work around that point

2330
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:40,608
Everybody should have that's not telling the entire story The Alex chose that date

2331
01:53:40,864 --> 01:53:42,656
Specifically to bring up

2332
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:44,960
Is it that the Tanger open the country

2333
01:53:45,472 --> 01:53:46,240
First legal birth

2334
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:47,008
Control clinic

2335
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:51,616
What is leaving out that around this time Sanger also married her second husband boiled

2336
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,920
Noah h

2337
01:53:54,944 --> 01:53:56,992
He provided much of the funding for her effort

2338
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:01,344
So the Rockefellers did start to come in

2339
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:05,440
But you was running birth control

2340
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:08,512
The all over the place

2341
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:09,792
People were not helping her

2342
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:12,608
She carried this Crusade for a very long time

2343
01:54:12,864 --> 01:54:14,144
Once it was legal

2344
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:15,936
Some outside funding came in and

2345
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:16,704
She got married to

2346
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:17,728
This really rich dude

2347
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:19,520
Which

2348
01:54:20,288 --> 01:54:21,312
Unfortunately

2349
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:26,176
Seems a little bit for me because she's already

2350
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:27,456
The problem is now

2351
01:54:28,224 --> 01:54:29,248
I've got it in my head

2352
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:38,976
Poor people are never going to be able to do it on her own

2353
01:54:39,232 --> 01:54:40,256
Maybe he was woken

2354
01:54:44,096 --> 01:54:47,936
Again another crazy f******

2355
01:54:54,336 --> 01:54:55,104
The actors frontman

2356
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:56,640
Sterilization program

2357
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:59,200
Doesn't sound right

2358
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:04,064
In 1994

2359
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:06,112
End credits us eugenicist

2360
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:08,160
As his inspiration that's true

2361
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:14,560
Madison

2362
01:55:15,584 --> 01:55:17,120
Calling his race Facebook

2363
01:55:17,376 --> 01:55:23,520
Passing of the great race Bible that's true but Madison

2364
01:55:23,776 --> 01:55:29,920
He was a huge anti-semite into disaster mistaken regard for what

2365
01:55:30,176 --> 01:55:35,808
What are the rifle with the title of the passing of the great race

2366
01:55:36,064 --> 01:55:36,576
Not great

2367
01:55:36,832 --> 01:55:37,600
Got to be a great guy

2368
01:55:38,112 --> 01:55:44,256
Listen to regard for what are believed to be divine Laws In a Sentimental belief in the sanctity of human life tend to prevent both the Olympic

2369
01:55:44,768 --> 01:55:45,536
Defective infants

2370
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:47,072
Sterilization of such adults

2371
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:53,472
NOVA community

2372
01:55:53,984 --> 01:55:57,824
Human life is valuable only when it is of used to the community or race

2373
01:55:58,336 --> 01:55:58,848
I feel like he's

2374
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:05,504
Gone a long ways off track you went on to say that the Nordic race

2375
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:11,904
The Nordic race bemoaned its corruption byju's Negroes Slavs and others who did not possess

2376
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:18,304
Blonde hair and blue eyes he's already on board

2377
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:19,072
Don't use him as an

2378
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:21,632
An example of like

2379
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:23,168
Also know I think

2380
01:56:23,936 --> 01:56:27,264
I think it should go the other way around like look at how crazy this guy

2381
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:32,128
Even Hitler got on board with his I think you probably was pre-loaded

2382
01:56:32,384 --> 01:56:33,664
To do so already Maybe

2383
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:37,760
I don't know it's tough to say before Hitler

2384
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:44,416
The passing of the great isolated

2385
01:56:44,672 --> 01:56:50,048
Mustang in 1930

2386
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:51,584
Your your

2387
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:52,352
Should be

2388
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:55,424
Look at how crazy Madison Grant is

2389
01:56:56,448 --> 01:56:59,776
Hitler thought he was a genius totally

2390
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:07,456
Mass extermination of the Jews

2391
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:09,248
What he called other sub-races

2392
01:57:09,504 --> 01:57:11,808
As well as the handicapped from Grant

2393
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:16,928
Part 27

2394
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:19,744
The so-called science was aggressively pushed

2395
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:20,512
Contest

2396
01:57:21,792 --> 01:57:22,304
Churches

2397
01:57:22,816 --> 01:57:23,328
State Fair

2398
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:26,400
And that's why we can't have roads ended Concha

2399
01:57:26,912 --> 01:57:28,192
Big cash prizes

2400
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:29,472
To see who could best

2401
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:30,240
Implement

2402
01:57:33,056 --> 01:57:35,360
Major denominations then tell America

2403
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:37,408
The Jesus is for you

2404
01:57:38,432 --> 01:57:39,712
So Alex is citation

2405
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:40,480
For this

2406
01:57:40,736 --> 01:57:41,248
Is 1

2407
01:57:42,016 --> 01:57:42,784
From

2408
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:43,808
26

2409
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:45,856
Which covers major.

2410
01:57:46,624 --> 01:57:48,672
Written sermon that is

2411
01:57:48,928 --> 01:57:52,000
Clear of who it came from there's no

2412
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:57,632
There's there's no like reference or anything which means it came from

2413
01:57:57,888 --> 01:58:00,192
Clear like it's incomplete

2414
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:00,960
Like the pages aren't

2415
01:58:01,216 --> 01:58:05,056
Complete for the sermon so you don't know all the five pages out of

2416
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:06,592
Who knows how many

2417
01:58:06,848 --> 01:58:08,896
Reference

2418
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:09,664
Bismarck

2419
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:11,200
1421

2420
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:11,968
Which says

2421
01:58:12,224 --> 01:58:13,760
The son of man

2422
01:58:14,272 --> 01:58:15,040
As it is written

2423
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:18,880
But woe to that man by whom the son of man is betrayed

2424
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:22,208
Good word for that man if he had never been born

2425
01:58:25,024 --> 01:58:26,048
Right

2426
01:58:26,304 --> 01:58:32,448
Using that good for him if you'd never been born. I get that moral characteristic

2427
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:33,984
Or whatever

2428
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:35,264
Right

2429
01:58:35,776 --> 01:58:38,592
Being doomed from birth because of bad genes

2430
01:58:39,104 --> 01:58:41,152
Extrapolate

2431
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:42,176
You know what

2432
01:58:42,688 --> 01:58:44,480
That's not the craziest thing I've ever heard a preacher say

2433
01:58:45,248 --> 01:58:49,344
That's not the craziest thing I've heard a preacher say on Alex Jones Show

2434
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:55,744
Easiest thing I've heard you say Reverend James David Manning on his show who says that the gays puts

2435
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,536
Semen in Starbucks lattes

2436
01:58:57,792 --> 01:59:02,912
Because they like to have a good time

2437
01:59:03,168 --> 01:59:04,960
But also the other problem with that is

2438
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:05,728
Is that like

2439
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:07,264
Strictly speaking

2440
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:10,848
An Oak Point

2441
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:11,616
From

2442
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:12,640
Potassium

2443
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:14,944
Well it's not on

2444
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:18,784
Like if you allow for the idea that they're already saying

2445
01:59:19,552 --> 01:59:21,088
It's not like that guy is crazy

2446
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:22,624
No he's not like

2447
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:28,768
He's not clearly under the influence of some Eugenics board applying a line of thought

2448
01:59:29,024 --> 01:59:30,304
Preexisting

2449
01:59:31,072 --> 01:59:31,840
Interpretation

2450
01:59:32,096 --> 01:59:33,888
Scripture it's not

2451
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:38,240
Probably that's probably the major failing with scripture is that

2452
01:59:38,752 --> 01:59:39,520
That guy wrote it

2453
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:41,824
One thing

2454
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:45,408
A million whatever the thing that I wanted to meet

2455
01:59:45,664 --> 01:59:46,688
It's crazy to us

2456
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:51,808
The Constitution

2457
01:59:53,856 --> 01:59:55,648
Looking building change

2458
01:59:55,904 --> 01:59:56,416
Grow don't

2459
01:59:56,672 --> 01:59:57,952
Just don't be like well

2460
01:59:58,464 --> 02:00:01,280
Jesus said in Mark 1 through I don't give a fuk

2461
02:00:01,536 --> 02:00:02,048
Yeah the past

2462
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:03,328
Can suck my dick

2463
02:00:03,584 --> 02:00:04,096
Agreed

2464
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:05,376
Except

2465
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:10,496
Where it already did Rachel build on that

2466
02:00:10,752 --> 02:00:12,032
Pass for sterilization

2467
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:14,592
And the Supreme Court rule

2468
02:00:14,848 --> 02:00:15,360
Favor

2469
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:17,152
A brutal sterilization pod

2470
02:00:18,688 --> 02:00:20,992
Hitler came to power in 1933

2471
02:00:21,248 --> 02:00:22,272
One of his first Acts

2472
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:24,832
What's the past National Eugenics laws

2473
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:29,696
Unfortunately

2474
02:00:36,352 --> 02:00:37,120
Tomorrow's children

2475
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:43,776
Rock

2476
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:45,568
Operation

2477
02:00:45,824 --> 02:00:47,104
That's a good.

2478
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:49,408
She's hardworking and have a good reputation

2479
02:00:49,664 --> 02:00:51,712
Do you know anything about her family background

2480
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:56,320
Yes

2481
02:00:57,856 --> 02:01:03,232
One of the crippled 2020 classes

2482
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:10,144
Ignoring all that you feel content but this girl should be allowed to bring

2483
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:11,168
Ketone

2484
02:01:11,424 --> 02:01:11,936
Yoorana

2485
02:01:12,192 --> 02:01:13,216
She's not anything like the rest

2486
02:01:18,336 --> 02:01:19,616
Proportion is normal

2487
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:29,600
Three generations of unfit

2488
02:01:30,368 --> 02:01:31,392
I think I'm not allowed

2489
02:01:32,928 --> 02:01:33,440
That judge is

2490
02:01:33,696 --> 02:01:37,792
Germany

2491
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:44,192
For taking effective action movie where you wanted your good guy.

2492
02:01:44,448 --> 02:01:47,520
It says that kid to be sterilized

2493
02:01:49,312 --> 02:01:52,128
Good guys

2494
02:01:53,152 --> 02:01:53,664
Like in Eugene

2495
02:01:54,176 --> 02:01:54,688
Davenport

2496
02:01:54,944 --> 02:01:55,712
Laughlin go

2497
02:01:56,224 --> 02:01:57,248
4 dispatch

2498
02:01:57,504 --> 02:01:58,272
German

2499
02:02:03,136 --> 02:02:06,208
So here Alex says that Davenport lost Lennon ghost

2500
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:09,024
Dispatch by The Rockefellers to help the Nazis

2501
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:09,792
Eugenics

2502
02:02:11,072 --> 02:02:12,352
Davenport Laughlin

2503
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:13,888
His

2504
02:02:14,144 --> 02:02:17,472
Citations on this are incredibly loud

2505
02:02:17,728 --> 02:02:19,776
To go with a

2506
02:02:20,032 --> 02:02:22,336
I don't know whether to go with like a

2507
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:26,944
Lawyers Partners joke or like a Shadrach Meshach and Abednego

2508
02:02:27,712 --> 02:02:28,736
Like which way do I go

2509
02:02:28,992 --> 02:02:30,016
Here's where I'm going to go with it

2510
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:32,320
Gertha

2511
02:02:32,832 --> 02:02:37,952
Go to pronounce his name

2512
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:41,024
Alex Jones post as a citation

2513
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:44,352
Yeah is that reporting to someone named Mister Eddie

2514
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:46,144
About what he observed of the German

2515
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:47,424
I'm collecting eugenic data

2516
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:50,752
It has nothing to do with helping them or over at the hawk

2517
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:54,080
It Was Written in 1937 before kristallnacht

2518
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:56,384
Before the invasion of Poland Etc

2519
02:02:56,896 --> 02:02:57,664
That being said

2520
02:02:58,432 --> 02:03:04,576
Is gertha was a real bad too

2521
02:03:04,832 --> 02:03:05,600
And I use

2522
02:03:05,856 --> 02:03:06,880
Absolutely if I can race

2523
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:09,184
Sonar Davenport

2524
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:12,256
Alex has a citation that is another letter from the sky

2525
02:03:12,512 --> 02:03:14,304
This is from November 11th nineteen

2526
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:17,376
22 a year before the beer hall push

2527
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:22,752
Decidedly not in power

2528
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:26,848
The letter of firms that there are Germans interested in the principles

2529
02:03:27,104 --> 02:03:27,616
Eugenics

2530
02:03:27,872 --> 02:03:28,640
Sterilization

2531
02:03:28,896 --> 02:03:29,920
What does not show that he was

2532
02:03:30,176 --> 02:03:31,968
At all

2533
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:36,576
Davenport was a bad dude

2534
02:03:37,856 --> 02:03:43,232
He did write for some German scholarly journals much later than he should have gone up to 1939

2535
02:03:43,744 --> 02:03:47,072
Weirdly in 1938 he wrote a letter to the editor of the

2536
02:03:47,328 --> 02:03:48,096
The Time Magazine

2537
02:03:48,608 --> 02:03:50,144
It said about fpr in Joseph

2538
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:50,912
Gerbils

2539
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:52,704
Both quote LED revolutions

2540
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:56,288
Aspire to dictatorships while burdening their country with heavy taxes

2541
02:03:56,544 --> 02:03:57,056
And reducing a

2542
02:03:57,312 --> 02:03:57,824
Its finances to

2543
02:03:58,080 --> 02:04:03,200
The chaos alright well smart nobody

2544
02:04:03,456 --> 02:04:04,480
Scholarly Journal

2545
02:04:04,736 --> 02:04:05,504
S*** on grbl

2546
02:04:06,016 --> 02:04:06,528
Before

2547
02:04:06,784 --> 02:04:09,600
Very confusing bad due to

2548
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:14,208
Press clipping it out there's a press clipping to Alex Jones uses

2549
02:04:14,464 --> 02:04:15,744
The citation for Laughlin

2550
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:20,096
Being 150th anniversary of the University of Heidelberg

2551
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:21,376
But this is from 19

2552
02:04:21,632 --> 02:04:22,144
30

2553
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:23,936
Even before gurthaz letter

2554
02:04:24,448 --> 02:04:26,752
The Olympics

2555
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:27,520
So

2556
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:30,336
That said

2557
02:04:30,848 --> 02:04:32,640
Laughlin also a bat

2558
02:04:34,944 --> 02:04:35,968
Look I'm not

2559
02:04:36,224 --> 02:04:38,016
The broad brush

2560
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:41,088
If your name is mentioned

2561
02:04:41,344 --> 02:04:43,136
In 1930s

2562
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:49,792
I'm going to leave with you probably not a good dude looks like.

2563
02:04:50,048 --> 02:04:52,864
So you know a guy's name from 1930s

2564
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:54,144
What are the

2565
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:59,008
Is it a hero or is it a bad dude

2566
02:04:59,264 --> 02:05:00,288
It's not a good percentage

2567
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:03,104
Name from

2568
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:05,920
Germany I'm going to be like

2569
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:08,224
Lisa Rivera

2570
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:12,832
Dispatch to germinate to help with

2571
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:13,856
In 1930

2572
02:05:14,112 --> 02:05:14,880
Percentage-wise

2573
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:16,416
Like if you're in America

2574
02:05:18,464 --> 02:05:19,232
Knock knock

2575
02:05:20,512 --> 02:05:26,656
Laughlin was described as quote among the most racist and anti-semitic of early-twentieth-century eugenicist

2576
02:05:26,912 --> 02:05:27,424
Biographer

2577
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:31,776
There's little doubt that the f****** claim there's little doubt that

2578
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:33,056
No evidence

2579
02:05:33,568 --> 02:05:36,384
But there's no provided he collaborated with

2580
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:40,736
Them also you before he went to Germany review panel convened by the Carnegie

2581
02:05:40,992 --> 02:05:44,832
Concluded that the Eugenics record office which was

2582
02:05:45,088 --> 02:05:45,600
Charge of

2583
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:47,392
Cold Springs

2584
02:05:47,648 --> 02:05:48,160
Harbor

2585
02:05:48,416 --> 02:05:50,976
Confirm

2586
02:05:51,232 --> 02:05:53,024
Pick any of the Eugenics record

2587
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:57,120
They concluded that the research they were doing had no South America

2588
02:05:57,376 --> 02:05:59,424
And withdrew funding for it

2589
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:05,824
And shut it the fuk down interesting Lee before that point they'd never audited the research they were doing so

2590
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:13,248
So you present

2591
02:06:13,504 --> 02:06:14,272
With a pitch

2592
02:06:15,552 --> 02:06:16,320
You're going to find out

2593
02:06:17,856 --> 02:06:18,880
Then we looked into it

2594
02:06:19,136 --> 02:06:20,416
Turns out you're just erased

2595
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:23,232
So that's not really science

2596
02:06:23,488 --> 02:06:24,512
And one

2597
02:06:25,536 --> 02:06:26,304
I don't

2598
02:06:26,816 --> 02:06:27,328
The right

2599
02:06:28,608 --> 02:06:29,120
Coming from

2600
02:06:29,376 --> 02:06:30,144
Bro I love you

2601
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:36,544
Brought

2602
02:06:39,872 --> 02:06:40,640
Give me some sign

2603
02:06:41,152 --> 02:06:43,968
One of the big reasons that they didn't find out for so long as

2604
02:06:44,224 --> 02:06:44,992
Because these

2605
02:06:45,248 --> 02:06:46,272
Research

2606
02:06:46,784 --> 02:06:47,296
Planters

2607
02:06:47,552 --> 02:06:48,320
These huge

2608
02:06:48,576 --> 02:06:49,344
Knicks Records Office

2609
02:06:50,112 --> 02:06:50,880
The primary

2610
02:06:51,136 --> 02:06:51,904
Twista collect

2611
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:52,672
Data

2612
02:06:52,928 --> 02:06:53,952
That takes a long time

2613
02:06:54,464 --> 02:06:55,744
Big window

2614
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,280
Before someone's going to recognize

2615
02:06:57,536 --> 02:07:00,352
It's something is up and that what you're doing is meaning

2616
02:07:01,888 --> 02:07:04,960
There's an argument to be made that what they were doing was actually.

2617
02:07:05,216 --> 02:07:05,728
Rotting

2618
02:07:05,984 --> 02:07:11,104
These foundations they probably didn't mean to but

2619
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:13,664
Alien to product is that's what they did

2620
02:07:15,968 --> 02:07:18,016
And that folks is where we will have to cut off

2621
02:07:18,272 --> 02:07:21,088
For today I feel really bad about that bad but

2622
02:07:21,856 --> 02:07:22,368
With

2623
