Knowledge party.com

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for this knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:33,536
We are the bad guys

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,808
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832

00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,144
Autopilot baby

Hey hey it's okay it's okay it's okay we got to speak

9
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,408
Don't have to come out of my mouth

10
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:27,808
No I didn't hear it at all I heard you say worship at the altar of the ciliated and then just let it go

11
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,600
So many buttons

12
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,928
Whistle

13
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,488
The pets that's where that live unspoken

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,072
Actuation

15
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:39,840
For you

16
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,376
What's your bright spot

17
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:48,032
My bright spot today Jordan is a lot of messages

18
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:53,664
With the request for buttons

19
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,760
So many that I cannot possibly respond to most of these

20
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:01,856
Yeah so please just know that I have read these messages and I very much appreciate them

21
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,696
And buttons will be sent as there

22
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,976
I've ever seen

23
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,768
Also here's your response

24
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,304
Send the message

25
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:16,448
Yeah that's right I'm taking a weirdly aggressive tone yes that is a how I'm feeling and also

26
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:20,800
Something that has come up a number of times that people wanting to pay for postage

27
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,848
Particularly international walks

28
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:27,968
Sure I'll pay you or pay something for both really nice thing but I want this to be a gift

29
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,736
Her folks

30
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:35,136
So I don't want I appreciate that but I don't want to accept that

31
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,928
Respectful to the generosity

32
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:41,280
And so if anybody feels the desire to here's what I would say

33
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,816
This is my blanket response

34
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:48,704
Feel free to give a little donation to a charity that you support or you think that Selene would support

35
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,776
And do it in the name of my cat

36
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:58,688
We will all worship at the altar of Celine eventually because that is the name that will be.

37
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:05,088
Donating to every cause from now on

38
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,624
That'll be good for the postage

39
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,672
For everybody

40
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,744
My bright spot was thinking about that

41
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,888
Imagine if we were like as

42
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:24,288
Wealthy is Bill Gates and you were just like our foundation in the name of the cult of saline

43
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,616
Conspiracies at all

44
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:32,224
Billion dollars in the name of the cult of saline

45
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,296
What's up with your B

46
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:40,928

47
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,488
I don't know if you noticed

48
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,512
The past year has been rough

49
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:50,144
Yeah I see this year the French Open and Wimbledon we're only a month apart and I will tell you this

50
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,216
Inspiring s*** Dan Andy Murray

51
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,008
Andy Murray

52
00:03:55,264 --> 00:04:01,408
DND Marie former member of the big four back when there was a big four and then

53
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:06,528
Andy was not kicked out of it former world number one destroyed injuries

54
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,832
He's old as s*** now

55
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,880
Back in Wimbledon

56
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,160
For the first time in years

57
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,696
One is first match

58
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,232
So did Federer

59
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,536
Coming back after his injuries

60
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,607
Wimbledon my friend the big deal

61
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,143
So anyway that's my boy

62
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,775
I got a lot of energy Andy Murray is in an amazing person

63
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,591
I understand that was like Charlie Brown

64
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:36,735
Debate that was just wow I could not understand a word you were saying

65
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,039
This is why I keep my love for both of us

66
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:42,111

00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:46,207

Jordan instead of

73
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,927
Sneaky Snake

You so much

93
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:26,303
Also this is something that we forgot to do any I felt a little bit guilty about it

94
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,863
That was when we were given

95
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:32,191
Ukulele

96
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:38,591

00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,919
Green's ukulele

99
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,711
Right side because a plant

100
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:49,343
I forgot to do was Beck's requested that I give a shout-out to Quicksilver on the Discord

101
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,695
And I forgot to do that and I would like to right that wrong by saying

102
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,231
What's up Quicksilver

103
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,767
Quicksilver on the Discord

104
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:02,399
I've no idea what any of this means also

105
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,775
Hemming someone life is hitting someone death

106
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,359
You can say that

107
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
Life is death

108
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
You good

109
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
You're good

110
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,295
Happy birthday Gigi.

111
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:24,671
Hope you had a good one also Dexter reached out wanted us to wish happy birthday to Zoe

112
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
Oh okay

113
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
Zoe

114
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:32,607
I would like that you can't be named Dexter and wish you a happy birthday after opening with giving someone life is

115
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:37,471
I've never watched that show the referee

116
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,543
I do he kills serial killers

117
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,079
People

118
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,871
Cool I heard the ending was bad

119
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:48,479
I never watch the show you their also Renee check

120
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,295
Happy birthday

00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:57,695
And this is this is one because Rosemary recently reached out and wanted to wish you would have to go pick

122
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:04,607
Also Renee says she's the best friend I could have it thanks for putting up with me happy birthday Rosemary unfortunately

123
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:08,447
Life is death

124
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,823
Do you like the password digging into the past

125
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,663
And we're going to talk about May 22nd 27th

126
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,943
20

127
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,575
Dealer got black

128
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,439
Knock knock knock

129
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,719
3rd grade stretch of time

130
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,767
If I'm going to be perfectly honest with you

131
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:37,375
There's some funny things that happened but you're looking for anything in depth I am

132
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:42,239
Afraid you're not going to find a few May 22nd not the best day of the year

133
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:46,335
22nd and 23rd a lot of it is talking about Bilderberg

134
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,895
Talking about the same sort of Bilderberg

135
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,455
Conspiracies that we've discussed over and over again

136
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:54,015
It's very boilerplate

137
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,295
Fairly boring

138
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,343
That's Thursday and Friday

139
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,903
Alec doesn't have a Sunday show at this point

140
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,695
Monday is a repeat

141
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:08,095
Michelle from the past week day

142
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,375
Back on the 27th

143
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
There's a little bit of

144
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:17,055
Interesting collars maybe but like there is nothing going on it is a

145
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,335
Wasteland

146
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:22,687
I like how we've gotten so far into the show that a Bilderberg

147
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,223
Conspiracy were like Jesus that's

148
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
Quaint

149
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:31,391
Back-in-the-day whole Bilderberg yeah they were scary back then no man Bill Gates

150
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,927
Bill Gates dyrberg

151
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,719
There's one thing about the

152
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,511
The people that he has

153
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,559
To talk about Bilderberg that I think is

154
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,191
But the actual conspiracies they're all just

155
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
The exactly

156
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,495
At the same stop

157
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,263
As always

158
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,359
I feel like a pertinent question that every

159
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,639
Opening of the shows

160
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,455
Just getting into blood libel today Dan

161
00:09:55,711 --> 00:10:01,855
Yep 3 I'm guessing

162
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,879
Anti-semitism

163
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,183
What come quicker than you think

164
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:09,023
So we start here on the 22nd and

165
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,327
Not much is going on until Alex takes

166
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,887
You take some calls fairly early in the episode

167
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,423
And Alex

168
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,007
I think he's trying to he's mr. Brightside

169
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,799
He's talking to this car

170
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,383
I just wanted to tell you like what I do so like your father

171
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,175
Are people listening they'll do the same

172
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
Like I make like

173
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,479
Like both with

174
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,503
Stories

175
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
Your movies

176
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
+ 9

177
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
That's amazing

178
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,791
With wild apparently

179
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,095
People who

180
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
Open stuff for likes

181
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
My friends

182
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,703
If they even start talk

183
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,983
Me about it like they're girl

184
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,263
Girlfriends or wives

185
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
Give him a look

186
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,079
You know they're not allowed to talk

187
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,615
Who's my friend

188
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,919
Man

189
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,247
Don't blame the girlfriends

190
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:07,391
Yeah everyone's waking up and now they won't talk to me anymore cuz their girlfriends

191
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,999
That's very sad that is unfortunate

192
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
Pet his fat

193
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,839
I need

194
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:19,423
I need corroborating evidence on we're getting 90% wake

195
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,031
Survey response rate

196
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:31,711
Rasmussen polls look I remember back when I first started out my job

197
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,759
Ways that we marketed was with direct

198
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
Mail campaign

199
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:41,439
And you get like a .5% response that was BS

200
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:44,511
90% wake up out of this I got to know what you're doing

201
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,839
Yeah it's like if you're getting 90% response

202
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,167
Do something it's got to be like heroin

203
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:56,287
Totally sophisticated brainwashed

204
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:03,199
Actually do have a little bit of insight into this cuz Alex was talking to another caller

205
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:08,319
A&T gives out DVDs to people and he's like I'm getting a hundred percent response

206
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,367
From people hundred percent wake up

207
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,183
They talked about it and

208
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,463
The way the disguised

209
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,999
Defining that is that

210
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,583
Everybody who takes the DVD

211
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,887
Seems happy about it

212
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:28,799
But still there's a lot of people who are not taking which also means

213
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,359
Didn't necessarily

214
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,127
Watch it

215
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,967
Yeah I don't know if there's follow up with these people about

216
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,247
The content of it

217
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,295
I don't know

218
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,087
This color in particular this first one

219
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,391
Is it really bumming me out because

220
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,207
You can really see what this looks like in real life

221
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,255
You know what this looks like in real life yet

222
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,071
It's a friend telling me weird s*** and then their girlfriend like look

223
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,607
We can't have him a party

224
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,935
Are you really freaks out my normal for him totally

225
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,959
Totally

226
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:04,895
He said something incredibly rude because somebody challenged him on this freaked out because you're not awake

227
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,687
We can't live that way

228
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:10,783
That's not how we is that guy wants to be over there by himself

229
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,831
Listen to Alex

230
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,183
Also apparently extends

231
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,719
To digital

232
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,767
Stop with this collar

233
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,167
I emailed stories like when

234
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,215
Husamedin stupid emails with

235
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,751
No it's forwarded 1000

236
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,519
Sometimes

237
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,055
Emails

238
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
Email

239
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,871
Trip stories

240
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
Anna

241
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,711
Links with your movie on there I mean

242
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,479
You know that's a p

243
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,759
People I probably email.

244
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,063
Can I play go back like

245
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
20 respond

246
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,927
And most people yawn

247
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,463
I'm crazy or where'd you

248
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,487
My email from

249
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,535
You know that's about a half percent

250
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
Call

251
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
Definitely a weirdo

252
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:08,639
Is getting chain emails saving people's email addresses

253
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,735
Then when they respond how did you get my email

254
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,295
You keep sending them Infowars stuff

255
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:22,207
I would say that's an interesting

256
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999
I will give him this

257
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:28,351
That is an innovation towards chain emails that I had not even considered

258
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,679
That you could essentially turn those into your own mailing list

259
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,751
Bother people for the rest of their lives

260
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,287
Yeah I mean

261
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,567
You could do that

262
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,151
You don't have to recognize if you do the your piece of s***

263
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:46,015
Yes there is that there is not all informations are good

264
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,343
Map South gets another call

265
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,415
Because got a bad question and answer

266
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,951
Outkast

267
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,487
Quick question before they break their it

268
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,047
Number told me that

269
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,583
The 9/11

270
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,167
User appointment World Trade

271
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,007
Employee to work that day ever hear anything about that

272
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,455
Go to work

273
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,527
So f***** up

274
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,343
I don't think it needs to be said that Alex is completely wrong

275
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,879
Lending credibility to Annex

276
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,159
Explicitly anti-Semitic

277
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,207
Conspiracy theory about 9/11 here

278
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:32,351
This is lazy sloppy behavior that only serves to validate the complete bulshit this caller is heard from his bigoted friend

279
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:37,727
Using his platform as a voice of Authority or certainty on the subject in a way that is

280
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
Torrid

281
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,567
You can very easily find the names of many Jewish Victor

282
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,103
Themes of the United live in attack

283
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:49,759
Somewhere on playing somewhere firefighters who died trying to save their fellow persons lives and Benny worked at the World Trade Center or at the

284
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527
Pentagon

285
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,063
I can name specific names

286
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,343
Because I can

287
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,367
Find out

288
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,975
Graphic sketches

289
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,023
Many obituaries

290
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,351
I'm not going to get into specifics out of respect for those people's number

291
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,399
And it wouldn't change anybody's mind

292
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:10,495
This narrative was a baseless claim that is made to demonize the Jewish population

293
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
The United States

294
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,823
And imply some kind of complicity in the attack

295
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
How it should be deeply ashamed

296
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,383
Elvis

297
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,199
Can't believe we got to the very first

298
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,735
It's time in 2003 the

299
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:24,063
The Jews were blamed for something that they had nothing to do with

300
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,367
I don't think this is the first time even in Alex

301
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,415
The show 2003

302
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,743
And we've got there I thought that was

303
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
Bad

304
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,119
I I just think

305
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:40,959
He saying

306
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:46,335
Hey is it true that the all the Jewish people were told to stay home

307
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,663
Yes that is true it cost you nothing comes back

308
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,479
No no actually that is not

309
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:58,367
Yeah there's there's no other I mean there's just no interpretation of that that doesn't wind up with

310
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,951
The Jews were involved in the planning and the attack

311
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,511
And it's specifically

312
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:05,791
The

313
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,095
Capital V capital j

314
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,119
The juice

315
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
It's not like

316
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,167
These people

317
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,959
Not a group of them

318
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,543
The entirety of Judaism

319
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,567
So weird

320
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,871
So Alec

321
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
What's gets to First

322
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,431
Guest here on the 22nd

323
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,991
And the Bilderberg experts

324
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,527
I remember

325
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,687
So I never heard of this dude

326
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,711
Tony gonsolin

327
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:00,575
Yeah I wanted to learn a little bit more about him cuz he's not the Bilderberg expert that I'm used to

328
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
Tavern on

329
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,623
Wasn't in The Notebook

330
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,415
Other is his brother

331
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:10,303
When later time by Alex Jones is trying to look into a Bilderberg a story he pretty much always

332
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,839
The Big Jim Tucker

333
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,375
And then in second place

334
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,679
If you're available or had died by then

335
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,727
Alex to talk to Daniel estulin

336
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:21,311
Tony goslings not a super elephant name in The periods that I've left

337
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,335
Listen to of Alex's show

338
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:29,503
Tony runs a website called Bilderberg. Organ I will say that this site pretty quickly deteriorates from

339
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,551
Being about the Bilderberg Group at all

340
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,623
Oh if you scroll down his homepage you'll soon find a pic

341
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:41,023
Picture of Jesus as Che Guevara I was just on a shirt that he sells

342
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:47,423
The Lord's Prayer okay okay weirdly religiously Centered for what appears to be aside about the Bilderberg Group which

343
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,751
If I'm not mistaken and based on this interview that

344
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,799
I'm hearing on Alex's show was supposed to be

345
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,335
Political conspiracy

346
00:18:54,847 --> 00:19:00,223
Things really fall apart when you get to the section titled quote my spiritual beliefs

347
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,295
Message

348
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,087
That is that should be

349
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,367
On a

350
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,647
Everybody's wall

351
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,719
Things really fall apart when you say

352
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,255
Here are my personal belief

353
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:15,071
This passage stood out as not sounding great

354
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:22,239
Any problems have been caused by some of the Jewish people's refusal to acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah

355
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:27,615
The root cause of many problem many Jews for example even Old Testament

356
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,919
Believing they're still God's chosen people

357
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:36,575
It seems clear to me that God cut off the Jewish hierarchy from his favor after they pleaded successfully for the unjust death of a

358
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:40,159
It's only fun

359
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:46,559
In the Bible the Bible where they wrote letters the rest of the New Testament is

360
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:50,911
Reading writing letters to Jews Jesus there's a there's a lot of

361
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,727
Conversation about who is or is not

362
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:57,311
Real Jews also on the website

363
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
Solo

364
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,103
Convoluted and

365
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,383
Not good

366
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,175
Do I say sausage is weird

367
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:06,271
If you scroll down a little bit further you find a list of Tony's 30 top movies

368
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:12,671
The Life of Brian

369
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,975
Sorry like that f***

370
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:20,351
My personal beliefs

371
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:24,703
24th favorite movie stupid they are

372
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:31,103
Great comedian I'm not kidding there's a big sale

373
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:37,503
What is wrong with the humanity it's a really poorly lay down

374
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:43,391
Confusing website and I don't know if it would even be helpful even if you did assume that he had evidence of something

375
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:47,487
Listen religion is the center of all of our problems in this life

376
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
This guy

377
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,303
Is my favorite

378
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,119
Anyways here by personal beliefs number

379
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,423
Four or five on his list was they live

380
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:58,239
Oh boy well that one actually

381
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:02,335
Play Tracks I didn't recognize a lot of the names of the movies and I am guessing some of them

382
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:06,175
But we're not good I'd be funny if they were all over it's like they live

383
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:12,831
The Life of Brian and then a bunch of weird seventies are for like Harold and Maude is up there they Shoot Horses Don't They

384
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:19,232
Everything Lee Remick is ever been in all of that everything by like

385
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,792
Sure sure

386
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:27,424
This way I don't know it's read over everything but it's

387
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,192
Seems like

388
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:33,568
This guy's a little bit unwell and he's a bit defensive about his positions

389
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:36,640
Razavi Judaism

390
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,224
So

391
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,832
Welcome to Bilderberg. Org 30 movies today

392
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:48,672
A lot of the stuff that he has to say about Bilderberg is all kind of

393
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,952
The same stuff you here

394
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,232
From just about any of these

395
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
These folks

396
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,024
You know just

397
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,304
Straight Talk

398
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,352
Powerful people are there

399
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,120
Let's let's

400
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,168
Imagine what they're talkin about

401
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,448
I'm sure I'll do this

402
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:06,848
A little bit of a fun Twist on it and that keeps kind of like a birdwatcher for Bilderberg

403
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:12,224
Members like is he teasing to get really excited when he was talking about how one day

404
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,272
One day

405
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,832
No one day during the Bilderberg conference

406
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,392
All the people all the Richie's

407
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,672
Who are attending the conference

408
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,976
Prince decided they were going to go to the Palace of Versailles

409
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,024
And they were going to just go with that or

410
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,328
And so he was like

411
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,632
Gawking it rich powerful people

412
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:35,776
He was really excited the David Rockefeller actually answered a couple questions from people into didn't seem standoffish or bad

413
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,616
I think you just enjoy this

414
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,664
Special really I don't see

415
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,688
Spirit security

416
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,456
I think you like

417
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,736
Following around

418
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:51,392
He's like a like a powerful group of people and I feel like we're in a situation where

419
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,160
Like

420
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,720
The Continuum is there's something

421
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:58,560
There's a very thin line between David Hayter and

422
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
Fanboy

423
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,608
You know like

424
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:07,008
There's a very thin line between like and I'm going to follow them everywhere they go and hope to catch

425
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:12,896
You know you like he was on that why he was riding it a little bit more than a lot of the other folks

426
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,688
Like the tacos are astelin

427
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,480
That seemed just to be

428
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,552
Either insane or full of hate

429
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,368
This guy

430
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,672
I don't know

431
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,976
Your Spears just a clip of in his own words

432
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
Let's hear Wilshire

433
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,920
The US entered World War

434
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,296
German

435
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,648
And

436
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,448
Any any other

437
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,240
In the future

438
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,784
It is true that for a brief time before the war prints Barnard was a member of the writer SS amount to division of

439
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:27,136
This is definitely not cool and I'm not making any kind of in

440
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,160
Excuse for a butt

441
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:33,792
It's usually a good idea when you're looking at a historical figure like this to judge them based on

442
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,584
The measure of a person's Act

443
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,656
Tiny

444
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,680
Not a tiny

445
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,728
Detail but a specific individual deep

446
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:48,896
Clearly did not support the Nazis in World War I actively fought against them when Hitler invaded the Netherlands in 9

447
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
1940

448
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:54,272
His track record is fairly clear and he was fighting Hitler's forces before the USA

449
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,040
Even was

450
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:58,112
This is an instance of like something that's a true enough fact

451
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,928
It's been used to create a dishonest image in the listeners had

452
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,560
The goal is to portray Bernard as somebody who fought alongside the Nazis in the war and it's someone who's

453
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,584
Part of the cell

454
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,400
Division of Hitler's organization that's just not true

455
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,704
There's more complexity to this

456
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,984
Them

457
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,752
Yeah that's

458
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,544
That's got cirrhosis

459
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,848
His dad written all over it like

460
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,872
Fine

461
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,152
I get what yes

462
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,712
Your your fundamental basic

463
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:29,088
6 fact is correct and by leaving out literally everything else you can support your narrative

464
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,880
But that's not the only fat

465
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,160
Yeah Improv

466
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:35,744
Blueprints Barnard's a little bit less

467
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,072
Of a sympathetic figure than fourteen-year-old George Soros

468
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,680
Ben is much as he was older and he was a member of the

469
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,704
Writing SS

470
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,728
But

471
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:52,128
The totality of his actions during the war speak to somebody who wasn't not

472
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,664
On the side of

473
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,712
On the side

474
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,992
Of the Nazis

475
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,272
Ann's

476
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,808
I think

477
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,368
I think that at that point you can

478
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,672
Say all right this was a blimp

479
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:09,024
You're on your history

480
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,072
Deterministic of your character

481
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,608
And that's what this guy want

482
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
To present

483
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,912
That's because

484
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,472
You know he hates the Bilderberg Group and

485
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,520
One of the people who co-founded it

486
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,824
Canby just portrayed as

487
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,640
Man I want to Hitler's higher-ups right

488
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,176
Right now

489
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,248
It's one of the most annoying things because

490
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,528
You don't

491
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,064
Like I don't need

492
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
Help

493
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,624
Being prejudiced against

494
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,720
A prince like I'm fine I'm fine with that I'm not arrive don't like royalty

495
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,512
But you can't

496
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,328
Make me hate him based on b*******

497
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:49,728
That's not fair I like to correct myself Barnard

498
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,032
Don't know why

499
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,592
No I'm an idiot I don't need I don't need help

500
00:26:54,848 --> 00:27:00,992
I don't need help there and you lying about him makes me then have to defend him which I don't want to do no

501
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:04,320
I don't want to defend a prince Royal teeth

502
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,088
Makes

503
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,624
Makes you need to

504
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,648
Hold on a sec

505
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,720
Secondarily it makes me

506
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,768
Very wary of

507
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,816
Whatever information you're putting out

508
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:18,144
Whatever information you have about the Bilderberg Group seems kind of

509
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
Sketchy

510
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,472
As if this is the level of

511
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,752
Backpage

512
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:24,800
Detail

513
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,872
Contextually right then

514
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,152
Why would I believe the rest

515
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,432
What you have to say

516
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:33,760
The rest of this is just you know standard Bilderberg

517
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,040
Conspiracy nonsense

518
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,576
Gossip

519
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,856
And

520
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,136
Bird-watching of

521
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,672
Rich people

522
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,976
Can't argue with a good bird watching

523
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,768
Skip back two calls

524
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,072
Discolor

525
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,120
Relevant to my interests

526
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,424
Stamatis of course whether or not Alex was

527
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,216
Fighting the literal devil

528
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:53,984
In 2000

529
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,456
Good good

530
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,392
Demons are loose

531
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
And their app

532
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,464
And they're in there doing the work

533
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:21,376
I mean Alexander have a direct response to that but the they're loose

534
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:27,776
I don't know what happened but demons got loose humans we had listened we had

535
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,800
Amanda Corral

536
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:35,200
Northwestern Montana we've kept all the demons there that's how we developed this great nation

537
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,992
One of ours and somebody tripped

538
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:41,088
Ruined the summoning Circle and now the demons are loose since there's just nothing to do

539
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,416
Someone someone's got to get a lasso

540
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,720
We got to go get a drive into a demon

541
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:50,816
I think we need The Regulators I think Nate Dogg and Warren out of

542
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,352
Need to mount up

543
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,400
I think

544
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,704
That this is an indication of some of the

545
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,240
Conversation

546
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,264
It is

547
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,568
Clearly just pretty OrganiCann

548
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,360
The natural on Alex's show

549
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,128
This time

550
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,432
Talking about demons being loose and what have you

551
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,456
Still doesn't

552
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,272
It's still kind of a nebulous picture for me

553
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,088
Yeah I'm leaning more towards

554
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,624
It's like they're being a real

555
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,928
Literally just religious

556
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,256
Bible agreement closer to that

557
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,536
But I also don't have

558
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,864
Merely the amount of information that we do from the present

559
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,144
Alex legit thing

560
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,448
The shoot devil

561
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:32,800
Is is there if you pulling the strings of the enemy

562
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,104
REI mean

563
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,128
This guy

564
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:39,456
Sounds like you definitely believes that the literal demons are loose

565
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,224
This dude

566
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,904
They're doing work I mean you could still see that as a metaphor or you could if your Alex and your respond

567
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,512
That you could see that as a metaphor for the Demonic impulses of the

568
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,816
Elites are given free rein

569
00:29:55,072 --> 00:30:00,192
No longer having to be corralled moderator

570
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,728
So Alex

571
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:06,848
Gets a lot of mileage out of people pretending that he's been right about so many things

572
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:13,504
For 27 years older than he is wrong and he's not

573
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,808
One of the things I was really going about this next clip

574
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,112
Is he makes a bunch of predictions about gun-grabbing

575
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:22,976
Everything he says is wrong

576
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,328
And they're going to expand

577
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,712
The most

578
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,352
He likes a lot of those people now

579
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,376
Yeah loves

580
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,912
At all those predictions are wrong

581
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:05,728
I was I was trying to keep track of my road no

582
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,264
Nope

583
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,544
Nope

584
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,568
And also no

585
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,104
Nope none of those happen

586
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,408
Yeah

587
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,432
That mean he's

588
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,224
Bright most of the time

589
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:19,552
Sure this makes 12 Alex goes back to calls

590
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,832
This dude

591
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,880
I tried

592
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,904
To trace this down

593
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,976
I got very little on this

594
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,560
Yeah

595
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,328
Okay

596
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:40,800
You're on the air.

597
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,616
Text Mars in

598
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,896
1988

599
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,992
Over there off Highway 6

600
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,320
About the island

601
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:56,416
Arianism

602
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,024
I do not understand that

603
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:07,424
And I want to know more

604
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,704
Hawkeye haircut

605
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,080
Removed

606
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,896
And the old man walk out cussing like a sailor

607
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,040
George Bush

608
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,416
And up above

609
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,376
Pictures of

610
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,472
So I'm out

611
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,080
Hobby Airport

612
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:51,456
So first of all this dude works for a moving company and he was called to show up at a backwards hidden

613
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:57,856
Church to remove pews but somehow the only person there hadn't called them to move the furniture was confused. They were there correct

614
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:58,880
This is a little fishy

615
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:02,208
My second issue was that this was a 1988

616
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:06,304
This point George h.w. Bush was coming to the end of his second term as vice president

617
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,608
And was about to win the 1988 election for

618
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,656
I still flew back to Texas

619
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,984
Every Sunday to go to the hidden Church on rhetorics everybody knows

620
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,568
George W bush hadn't even become Texas governor yet

621
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,640
Even bought the Texas Rangers at this point

622
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:26,528
I don't see how that either would be in either of their interest to be running a secret Nazi Church in the middle of Texas where they

623
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,624
We're spending most of their time at this point in DC and campaigning

624
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,184
Iron device

625
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,976
President of the United

626
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,280
State and have been for years one of the most

627
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,560
Looked at

628
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:44,960
Observed and known where of person is at all times I people's schedule

629
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:48,032
If it's public

630
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,592
But on Sundays

631
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:55,968
Blythe Baxter taxes heads to the hidden not too chicken to church no one knows about it

632
00:33:56,224 --> 00:34:02,368
Except for this guy but U-Haul mover who accidentally showed up there or something

633
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,208
Okay okay so you're telling me you're telling me

634
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,256
That this moving company

635
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,304
Shows up the guy is

636
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,400
Cussing like a sailor says you know whose churches is the bushes Church

637
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,168
And then

638
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:22,336
About grass of attitude wipes away and he's like come out back in the office let me show you George Bush in the Nazis

639
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:28,736
No one will ever find these pictures despite the fact that this guy seems willing to show them you literally anybody who walks in

640
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:33,856
Yeah it seems to be real neighborly

641
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:42,048
Hey this is the hidden church around 6:12 let me show you the vice-president Nazi memorabilia

642
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:48,448
George h.w. Bush and he specifically told me when he left it while I was watching over the place

643
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:54,848
I was to tell everybody. Everybody. Be sure you show the pictures of me

644
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,992
That's why I go to this church

645
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,528
Ridiculous

646
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,320
Also text Mars Izzy

647
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,624
Extreme Pizza

648
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,440
So yeah.

649
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
Hey

650
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,512
First person I got to get this information to

651
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,400
Not good notes Alex wants to know where this church is important question

652
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,192
Now where is this

653
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,128
What the problem is he wrote a hit you wrote about me and it's buckhead's are in the rainbow

654
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,432
I don't want to inform you about he didn't know enough

655
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,040
And

656
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,600
Okay is going highway 6

657
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,768
Right outside

658
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,120
Sugarland

659
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,728
Wright's only Eastside of Houston

660
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,592
Look man if you find the vice president's Nazi Church

661
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:02,432
You do always know where the vice president

662
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,736
If you will drive people by its

663
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,760
Pretty big

664
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,808
It's a pretty big thing

665
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,832
No I would

666
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,600
Find

667
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,624
Waze

668
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,904
Be like hey look

669
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,536
The main highways been torn down we're going to have to take the long way through huh

670
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,096
Oh by the way I met

671
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:24,960
George Bush's mouthy bastard he's got pictures of George Bush with a Nazi Bowl

672
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:31,360
I find it difficult to believe that if you did find something like this you wouldn't go back yourself

673
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:34,688
Not all the time please do go back if you like

674
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,760
Did I really see what I thought

675
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,040
This is Brigadoon

676
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,576
Outrageous

677
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,112
This church

678
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,136
What

679
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,952
Like I want I want to ask you like how you're picturing

680
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:52,096
How big is it what do you what do you imagine it but give me some give me some like physical attributes

681
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,120
But you're all right

682
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:58,496
I see it's eating maybe 60 to 80 people there about

683
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:04,896
There's a smaller congregation creation there's two rows of pews on either side with a walkway there

684
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:08,992
Where there's a Pulpit and directly behind it hanging is a

685
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:14,112
Let's call it 20 ft tall Nazi flag on his description you think that it's

686
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,392
The place that's in like

687
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,928
Good repair

688
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:20,512
Do you think it's something its dilapidated what are you what are your feelings on the

689
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:24,608
I think it has to have that feel of being absurdly

690
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,912
Clean for the area that it's in like

691
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:32,032
The walls are painted absurdly white almost as if they're immune to the

692
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:37,152
Nature around operating room in the middle of a swamp

693
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,176
Absolutely

694
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:41,504
I think that's probably about what I thought

695
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,096
That's a lot.

696
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,592
Talking about

697
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,464
Your call

698
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,704
Farm

699
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,240
Guarded

700
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,288
Bohemian Grove and there is a top

701
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,600
Terraria

702
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,136
I'm so proud of Alice

703
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,696
That's one of the few points

704
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:56,256
But I've ever heard him be like I can

705
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,792
Accepted

706
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,816
That isn't it

707
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:05,216
How great would it be to be like I'm on the phone with the person who found George W bush is not censored

708
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:11,360
I can't break this this is no good night sorry

709
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:15,456
Yeah I'm calling you a liar but I don't know about this

710
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:20,320
That's a that is a level of pushback I rarely see from them

711
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:24,928
True but I mean at the same time it has pushed back is not based around like

712
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,000
That's ridiculous so much it is like

713
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:31,584
Okay I get you think there's enough to base on the moon

714
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,864
But it's on Mars

715
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,168
I can't accept this

716
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:41,568
Nazi base on the moon can I never mind I have to actually push back on what you're saying

717
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,360
That's not fair

718
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:47,456
I think that would Alex is saying the reason that he's he's pushing back on this guy

719
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,760
Is because you think there are

720
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,552
Little Nazi enclaves

721
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,088
Nnn black worship

722
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,880
Ship centers or whatever

723
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,672
They're heavily armed

724
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:01,536
It's like you can't get into the Skull and Bones area where there's the big Nazi flag

725
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,096
Right there's not going to be one out in the middle of like

726
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,144
It is church that you get welcomed into

727
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,472
It's not it's not that it's like okay it's on the moon

728
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,008
It's all ours

729
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:14,592
It's the context surrounding this doesn't make sense

730
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:19,456
Psychiatrist and would not be that easy to accidentally stumble into

731
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:25,856
I broke into Bohemian Grove that's how I know there's you didn't break into this chair now you're welcome

732
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:31,232
And that would never happen surprisingly neighborly.

733
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,768
It Alex is narratives

734
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,560
Require

735
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,328
That

736
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,096
It's hard

737
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,888
To find the secret room

738
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,168
Answer that's why he's pushing

739
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,960
Don't think that it's

740
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,728
Spit least

741
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:46,336
I mean functionally it serves the same purpose as saying that this is ridiculous

742
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,872
No that's that's definitely true

743
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:48,896
That's definitely true

744
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:55,040
And I assume it would feel like it'll I like a bit of a personal attack on his manhood if you

745
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:55,808
Just got

746
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,856
To get Secrets by walking into play

747
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:04,256
Bohemian

748
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,024
U-Haul truck

749
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:08,352
I think it would just be so much easier to be like really

750
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,376
Seat 800

751
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,400
Why there's

752
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,680
There's a what

753
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,728
768

754
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,848
People who know that the entire Bush family is not these no no no

755
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:25,248
1 800 Bushman

756
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,016
The only bush

757
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:28,064
Church there's ever been

758
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,344
So

759
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,416
Here's a here's our last clip from the 22nd

760
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,720
Alex is talking about the situation in Iraq

761
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,280
Tuesday saying that

762
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,560
Confiscate weapons

763
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,584
From people

764
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,071
So Alex still think

765
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,863
On the 22nd of May

766
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,911
That the bath party is

767
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,935
Being put back

768
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,703
I came to power

769
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,263
And that's all the CIA operation

770
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,847
Isn't reading about how they're confiscating the bath party sweat

771
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,663
Well I mean I think

772
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,735
I have to assume that he just thinks

773
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,503
Stats

774
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:33,599
Window dressing

775
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:37,183
Suspect that the bad party is still running right right

776
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:40,767
I still think we have not reached

777
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,047
A point where this

778
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,071
Is interesting

779
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,631
It's still sort of rising it's crescendoing

780
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:48,447
Reality Alex

781
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:52,543
They're on a collision head-on collision

782
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,567
Traveling

783
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,871
Directly at each other

784
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:58,431
Interested to see how that how Alex tries to

785
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,223
Virar around that

786
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:04,575
That looming accident

787
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:10,207
Writing straight I can't hit reality so I'm going to turn off

788
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:14,047
And then it hits a bus you're like way to go

789
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,839
So a large portion

790
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:21,215
Of this episode on the 23rd is Alex talking to this Belgian doctor

791
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,007
Dr. van marter

792
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,567
Mortar farter I'm not entirely sure

793
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:31,711
He's a witness crimes being committed by our military against Iraqi civilians

794
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,735
There's taco

795
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:36,063
Bringing charges against military leaders

796
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,599
In foreign courts

797
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,135
Yeah that would be nice

798
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:42,463
I have little problem with this interview as a whole

799
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,511
I think this guy is bringing up

800
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,047
Fine points

801
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,423
But also it's not a very good interview like I don't think that Alex

802
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,447
Really

803
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,495
To too many of the more important

804
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,031
Issues in it seems like

805
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,847
The grandstanding and what-have-you

806
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:02,431
The subject matter is covered better by

807
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,711
Almost anybody else

808
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:07,551
Even in 2003 there were much better commentators

809
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,319
That you could find

810
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,599
Discussing

811
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:13,695
Human rights abuses on the part of our military in the Rye

812
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:17,279
But at the same time I'm not going to I'm not going to sit in nitpick

813
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,839
Because it's mostly this dude talking

814
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:21,119
Frightland

815
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,399
Perspective is like

816
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,191
Keith's awesome

817
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:26,239
U.s. soldiers shooting at an ambulance

818
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,519
Yeah and like

819
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,055
Yeah that sucks yeah that's

820
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,127
So so you think

821
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:38,527
You say that this interview is Alex like letting somebody give legitimate criticisms of the US military in order

822
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,551
Order for him to

823
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:47,487
Be like see the military and the government is all evil despite not actually giving a s*** about the war crimes and just

824
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,279
Exploding that the government is

825
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:54,911
Somewhat and then also using it to translate into like they're going to start a police state

826
00:44:55,167 --> 00:45:00,031
I don't think that he's use of this stuff is

827
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,335
Great

828
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,615
So think like

829
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:06,943
The US commits war crimes we got it

830
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,039
If we should do something about it now it's hard to listen to 1003

831
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,063
That's it

832
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,135
Really weird to me it's really weird to remember 2000

833
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:15,903
13

834
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:19,231
And hear that Alex was having a

835
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:23,071
Belgian doctor on to reveal us war crimes and was

836
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:23,839
Is not

837
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:27,423
Like cuz I remember how bloodthirsty everybody was

838
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:30,495
Everybody was so f****** bloodthirsty

839
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:35,871
If you said if you went on TV and said like hey the American government is committing war crimes

840
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:38,431
There would be another talking head being like

841
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,479
That's the cost of War

842
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,527
You know and people would agree

843
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,319
Yes sometimes you have to

844
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,343
To commit war crimes

845
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:48,415
F****** have to live in a world where

846
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:54,815
Unfortunately despite his exploitative nature Alex was one of the few people putting on

847
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:59,423
An agreement fast about the u.s. committed war crimes is wild

848
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,471
Yeah yeah yeah it is

849
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:08,127
I'm sorry I just needed to not just feels like really strange to to live in both the present and the past

850
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:10,175
At the same time it's worth

851
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,199
It's worth pointing out

852
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,479
I don't think it's worth

853
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:17,087
Discussing this interview like actual clips of it but it won't work

854
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,391
That is a reality

855
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,159
MMA

856
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:20,927
Again

857
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,743
I think you can say hooray

858
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,535
To an extent

859
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,071
To him for that

860
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:29,887
Sure but there is still other voices

861
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,679
That exist that were talking

862
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,703
Think about these things

863
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,983
And they weren't doing

864
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:37,311
Things like the other things but Alex is doing

865
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:43,711
One of those things

866
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,551
Yeah I mean just in the context of that it is it is kind

867
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:50,367
And it's something that I think about a lot just because

868
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,927
That's part of how Alex got

869
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,695
To where he be

870
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,463
He got two

871
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,743
Is that

872
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:59,071
There were shitt tons of war crimes going on and be

873
00:46:59,327 --> 00:46:59,839
Because

874
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:00,863
Theseus

875
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,631
Is correct

876
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:06,751
You are sucked into the rest of his bulshit until he just

877
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:13,151
Gets rid of even any pretense of giving a s*** about war crimes and then you're trapped in this place of

878
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,431
I neither do I

879
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,199
You know

880
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,223
It's weird

881
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,271
Yeah it is weird

882
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:21,087
He cares about more aren't those

883
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:22,623
They aren't

884
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:27,231
Exactly issues that he cares about for the sake of them

885
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,767
There's about the mezu

886
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:29,535
Is it means

887
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:36,703
And it's it's an important thing to point out that one of the big reasons that we are here we're propagandist

888
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:38,751
Can destroy everything is that

889
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,567
Cyclical nature between a

890
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,335
Corrupt

891
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:48,223
War crime committing governments and a propaganda Outlet who's creating that like

892
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:54,111
You can't trust these War crime committing people for good reasons until it spirals out of control and now

893
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,903
You can't trust anybody

894
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,951
Or anything I am sorry

895
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,719
I got

896
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:01,791
Lost on a panhead apologies apologies

897
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,559
No worries

898
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:08,191
What are the things that Alex does care more about one of the things that's really consistent like I said is that Build-A-Bear

899
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:12,543
Tony Gosling

900
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,311
On

901
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,591
On the 22nd

902
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,127
Talked about Bilderberg end

903
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,919
Go check out his website he has some

904
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:18,943
If your opinion

905
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,247
I would like Alex to put his top 30 movies

906
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,039
I died out

907
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:29,695
I think it would all just be Bolivian 1330

908
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:34,047
He has another expert on on the 23rd

909
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,583
Big Jim Tucker baby

910
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,375
20 years with

911
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,727
Daily News

912
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:54,783
Newspaper

913
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,607
Without me knowing

914
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:11,423
Willis carto is a Nazi and white supremacist

915
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:16,287
The Spectator was the paper's editorial position was anti-Semitism in Holocaust denial

916
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,591
Jim Tucker was the editor of that paper

917
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,431
In case you forgotten since we talked about him in our endgame coverage

918
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:24,735
Here's one of Willis cardos famous quote

919
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:30,879
Is Satan himself with all of his superhuman genius and diabolical Ingenuity at his command

920
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,695
I tried to create a permanent disintegration and force

921
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,487
For the destruction of the nation

922
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:38,559
You could have done no better than invent the Jews

923
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,631
Describing his motivation to start the spotlight

924
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:44,191
The ATL says in a bio of cardo quote

925
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:47,263
Cardos chief aim was always to mobilise opinion against

926
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,031
Jews

927
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:50,847
Liberty lobby with his chief instrument to bridge right wing

928
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,615
Constituency

929
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:54,175
Hard right or paramilitary libertarian

930
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:56,479
Conspiratorial anti-communist braces

931
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:59,551
Fighting flaming Durante government did nativists fears

932
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:02,111
And identifying Jews as the country's Chief threat

933
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:05,695
Willis carto is a bigot who wanted to sway public opinion against

934
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,719
Jews of his media

935
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,487
Entities

936
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,047
Jim Tucker work for his big media entity from its

937
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,839
Beginning in 1975

938
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,887
Until they folded in 2001

939
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,167
F*** him

940
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:17,983
And f*** whatever he has to say about Bilderberg

941
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,031
Yep even more insulting that he

942
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:21,823
Didn't know about them until Willis

943
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,103
Pardo told him about it

944
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,383
Goddamn

945
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,431
One of the worse

946
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,711
F*** gym tuck

947
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:33,343
Makes you want to invent a bow and arrow that can shoot arrows into

948
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,903
The past it's really funny to be those like

949
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,951
Alex is like a gym.

950
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:40,511
Climb fences and get in there

951
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:42,047
Is a real Intrepid journalist

952
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,863
You look at the videos of

953
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,447
Jim Tucker and he's always drunk

954
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:54,847
This is not a man

955
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:57,407
Man who can jump offense so without

956
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,943
Severely injuring him

957
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:02,527
He seems like he's exhausted reading a paper

958
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:05,087
Or at the very least

959
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,367
Continuing to breathe

960
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:09,695
So anyway Alex oxygen Tucker it's all just

961
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,463
The same

962
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:12,255
S*** except without the

963
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:18,399
Excitement at seeing David Rockefeller

964
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:23,007
1 things that I think is is is worth pointing out about both of these interviews

965
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,543
This is the gym Tucker

966
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,311
Is

967
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,591
Somebody who I don't

968
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,359
No

969
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,895
Well I and I don't care

970
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:31,199
What his personal positions are

971
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,503
He was the editor of a f****** whites

972
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:36,063
Supremacist Holocaust denial paper

973
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:36,831
4

974
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,367
25 years

975
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,183
Tony Gosling has a lot of question

976
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,975
Is about who is or is not Jewish

977
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:45,023
And thanks a lot of the problems in the world come from

978
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,047
Except

979
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,839
Jesus as the Messiah seems like

980
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:49,887
You wouldn't know that

981
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,679
From listening to their interviews

982
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,215
You wouldn't know that

983
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:57,311
These guys are concerned about politics

984
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:01,919
Really powerful people getting together and talking behind closed doors

985
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:05,247
You would think that these are just guys who

986
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:08,319
Have a political love position that maybe is

987
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:10,623
Anathema with what the media

988
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,647
Wants to report

989
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,695
You know that's a maybe

990
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:17,023
Lot of anti-Semitism is what drives

991
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,327
Yeah you know a lot of people don't

992
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,143
A lot of people don't sympathize

993
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:24,703
With

994
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:25,727
This much

995
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,775
But what you got to understand is

996
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,567
You used to be able to just

997
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:32,383
Tell people that you hated the Jews all the time

998
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:36,479
And now you have to hide behind all of these things you know like that's hard

999
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,527
Let's just think about the knots

1000
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:40,831
Fees for a second now they can't even say

1001
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,367
Openly

1002
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:45,951
Open the radio that everyone should kill the Jews cuz

1003
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:46,975
Their faults

1004
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,767
Brutal four-wheeler

1005
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:51,839
Anyway we go to the 27th because

1006
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:52,607
Both of us

1007
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:56,191
Show is just that interview with Jim Tucker and then the interview with the belt

1008
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,215
Doctor Who

1009
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:03,615
Like I said discussion of the mistreatment of arachis

1010
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,383
All that is

1011
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,919
Find anything good

1012
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:06,943
It's something that

1013
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:07,967
There was

1014
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:09,759
Probably

1015
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:12,575
I don't know probably the right word I would say definitely

1016
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:14,623
There should have been more space for

1017
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,415
Republic conversation

1018
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:18,207
But

1019
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:19,999
What are the reasons that I find it

1020
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,023
Kind of not

1021
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:21,791
That

1022
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,583
Interesting

1023
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,863
Not that relevant

1024
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,631
To give Alex

1025
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,167
Too much of a pat on the head

1026
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,447
About it is

1027
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:30,495
He takes these stories

1028
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:33,823
And he discusses or reads headlines about mistreatment

1029
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:36,383
Of people in a rock the the civilian

1030
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:40,223
I meant he just makes it about himself and the United States

1031
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,015
What's the song

1032
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:42,783
Horrible

1033
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:45,599
And

1034
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:49,439
Wham

1035
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,279
Re-education

1036
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:58,399
Wiring propaganda

1037
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:12,991
Forget none of that

1038
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:14,527
Came to pass

1039
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:16,319
Here

1040
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:17,599
Pesi suggesting

1041
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:20,159
He's covering here at this is on the 27

1042
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:22,207
And I we've jumped to that to Tuesday

1043
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:28,607
Who is covering conversation about Guantanamo about the possibility of like a Military Tribunal statement

1044
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,375
Place there

1045
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:33,983
Saying that you know that plan before the war for

1046
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:38,079
Do here in America to have these new detention centers and Machine Gun Nest

1047
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:39,615
Now it is

1048
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:42,175
Hold the conversation about

1049
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,991
The wrongs of the war

1050
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,527
Exist

1051
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:51,391
In order to facilitate his narratives about his fears about what's going to happen here

1052
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:53,183
It's not on its own Merit

1053
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:55,487
The people there their pain

1054
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:59,071
And what's being done isn't wrong because it's wrong

1055
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,607
And I have a difficult

1056
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,375
See with that

1057
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,423
Yeah I mean you know

1058
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,447
It's tough

1059
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,727
The good thing

1060
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:06,751
Is that

1061
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:10,079
If I recall correctly in 2,000 and

1062
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:10,847
The 8th

1063
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:13,151
Obama fulfilled his campaign promise to

1064
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,687
To close Guantanamo Bay right

1065
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,991
That was like one of the first things he did

1066
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,039
What

1067
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:23,647
So Alex Goes to calls

1068
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:28,255
What is pretty upset about is seatbelt check

1069
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,119
Really

1070
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,167
Really don't know

1071
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:39,775
Yep he's not a click it or ticket

1072
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:43,871
The devil with all of his might

1073
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,151
Is a RAID again

1074
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:46,943
And I can't

1075
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,735
Text and a $70 ticket

1076
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:51,295
Heetsuki

1077
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:55,135
Talking here another another instance of him being totally right

1078
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:57,183
But his predictions of what would

1079
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,231
I'll check

1080
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:02,047
Control

1081
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:05,887
Melton

1082
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,079
4 minutes

1083
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:36,095
Gray uniform

1084
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,567
BB High School

1085
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:51,199
Inquirer

1086
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,479
Reported last year

1087
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,159
Building clearing

1088
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,287
I don't know I don't think

1089
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:22,175
One of the things that's wild is like he go back to 2003 in the world was so

1090
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:24,223
Topsy Turvy

1091
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:29,087
Because of the aftermath of 9/11

1092
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,879
Probably could hear something like that be like

1093
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:31,903
F*** I don't know

1094
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,951
No I mean

1095
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:39,071
The only thing that I'd like the main argument I would have against that is just like

1096
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:43,423
That seems like biting off more than the government can chew how like

1097
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:47,775
There's not the infrastructure in place to get everybody to wear gray uniforms

1098
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:50,335
A Monumental effort of manufacture

1099
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:55,199
I think he was talking about the conscripted use 1° uniforms

1100
00:57:55,711 --> 00:58:01,343
Do you got an outfit all these kids with submachine guns.

1101
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,159
The gun manufacturers in the gun sellers are all

1102
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:07,999
Used to explaining fears about the

1103
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:08,767
People having

1104
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:11,071
I don't think it's going to happen

1105
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:11,839
No

1106
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:16,191
Kernels are some of this stuff is stuff that I remember

1107
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:19,007
Not being not sounding that crazy

1108
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:26,687
You cannot hold on I've got their National Dress totally I remembered him saying people having that conversation

1109
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:28,735
About like is there a possibility

1110
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:31,295
That address to Maycomb back because of

1111
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:35,391
The world circumstances

1112
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,183
That

1113
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,719
Level was like okay.

1114
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:42,815
It's not that nuts right then attach all this nut stuff on it

1115
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:44,863
Get someone to

1116
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,143
I don't know

1117
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,679
Except the nutstop

1118
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:53,567
Because of the if I can buy something that is ostensibly not switches the reinstatement of the draft

1119
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:54,335
Then

1120
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:55,359
It's not

1121
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,943
That much bigger of a stab to assume that there will be

1122
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:01,759
Gray clad children with submachine guns patrolling my name

1123
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,319
All of this because a seatbelt

1124
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:05,087
Sure

1125
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:07,135
So another thing that I was talking about

1126
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:10,719
A bit is a there's a mad cow situation in Canada

1127
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:12,511
Canadian beef Market is taking

1128
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,559
Because of

1129
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:18,143
There's at least a few cases of mad cow have

1130
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,935
Fence covering is a fear of an outbreak

1131
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,471
Answer Alex's is

1132
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:24,031
Complaining a bunch about how you know you need

1133
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:26,847
To get can't be feeding

1134
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:27,871
Animals

1135
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:28,639
Other

1136
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:29,663
Dead animal

1137
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,199
Especially sick animals

1138
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:34,015
You can't be feeding herbivores animal Prada

1139
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,855
Define pedigree

1140
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:40,671
Yeah but I don't know what the answer is other than regulation

1141
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:42,207
Well we can't do regular

1142
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,231
I don't

1143
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:49,375
It's not you just yell complains about like how people can't be allowed to do these things

1144
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,423
How do you deal with this

1145
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,447
Play my funk

1146
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,471
General standpoint

1147
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:56,543
He never brings up a solution other than people shouldn't do it

1148
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:57,823
The free market

1149
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:02,175
System if everybody wakes up if he's got a 90% wake up rate

1150
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:08,575
Then the free market will I assume account for the fact that people know that believes businesses shouldn't be doing that

1151
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:14,975
So all of these people won't patronize these businesses

1152
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:16,255
That is

1153
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:17,535
That is unfortunate

1154
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:23,679
Seems like government regulation might be the only way to really could work

1155
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:27,775
Barry Alex I have a call from a guy and he says Jesus a couple time

1156
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:30,335
Just relax

1157
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:32,383
Steel electric Wizard

1158
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:34,687
Exclamation

1159
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:36,991
Alex end the call

1160
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:41,855
And this is just taking the lord's name in vain not because of that but

1161
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:43,391
It's definitely what's on his mind

1162
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,951
John

1163
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:46,975
Call Ferb

1164
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,023
Great points made out of

1165
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,095
And we're on a Mini

1166
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,911
I know we have a worldly audience

1167
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:55,679
Be very careful

1168
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:58,239
I don't want

1169
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:00,031
Repercussions

1170
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:18,463
What did you say

1171
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:21,023
In the lord's name in vain I don't want divert people off

1172
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,303
That's important

1173
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,839
That is an important point

1174
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,119
Wow cut

1175
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:27,679
2021

1176
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:31,519
Jesus saves you got to buy my products

1177
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,799
I got a trick deck

1178
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,103
Boy

1179
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,407
What

1180
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,431
F****** red

1181
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,711
Ridiculous thing to say

1182
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:44,319
I worry about God's Vengeance when a caller says Jesus Christ

1183
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,623
Yeah I think that's performative

1184
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:47,647
Maybe

1185
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,207
That's a little bit

1186
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:52,255
So Alex thanks the audience

1187
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:53,535
Here for

1188
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,327
Cutting its content out

1189
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,887
To the world make copies of his videos and stuff

1190
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:00,959
Cuz if those things are going to spread themselves 94

1191
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:04,543
Percent success rate 90% wake up impressive

1192
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,079
Search that cuz whatever he's doing

1193
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,359
Command you

1194
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:10,175
Milwaukee

1195
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:15,039
Myself

1196
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:49,087
F*** you

1197
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:54,975
Wow I'm a fan of that kind of framing of things you know

1198
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:57,023
That's always really fun like if we hadn't

1199
01:02:57,279 --> 01:03:01,631
Been doing this week actually you you're supporting my show and spreading my materials

1200
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:04,191
Has actually made it so the globalist

1201
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,983
Can't pull off another

1202
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,007
Yep yep

1203
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,031
That's

1204
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:12,127
So great that's why Mark why that's why Mark Wahlberg flies

1205
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:18,527
On every flight he can all day everyday because he's trying to make sure that no more 9/11 will

1206
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:20,575
Will happen and the only way to stop it is

1207
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:26,207
To put a Mark Wahlberg on your plane and having Alex tell you how to stop it

1208
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:28,255
We did it

1209
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:30,559
I think we just fix terrorism

1210
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:32,095
Can you imagine

1211
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:34,911
What kind of a s******* you'd have to be to

1212
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,703
Act like this

1213
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:38,751
We could be like okay hey

1214
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:45,151
Thanks everyone for supporting our podcast and actually I'm certain that there would have been another Oklahoma City Bombing total

1215
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:49,759
Another Patriots federal building bombing if if you hadn't been supporting our

1216
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:50,783
Who the f***

1217
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:51,807
Play Lissie

1218
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:53,855
Your support for our show

1219
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:56,415
Made it so January 6th

1220
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,463
Was not as bad as it could have

1221
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:04,095
What could they were secured problem but we did it the problem is something that did happen

1222
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06,399
Alex is making up imaginary things

1223
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,679
That didn't happen

1224
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:10,751
Because his show is funny so what you're saying is

1225
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,287
We successfully stopped

1226
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:14,079
The attack on January 7th

1227
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:17,663
That would be how you would have to bring okay

1228
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:18,431
Okay

1229
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:21,759
There's people who are saying that

1230
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,063
The the war

1231
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:24,831
Is a

1232
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:26,367
Is kind of like a holy war

1233
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,391
Yeah that's not good

1234
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,415
No

1235
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:29,183
6 that's bulshit

1236
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,975
Good however

1237
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:38,143
This is a holy war

1238
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,175
Crew

1239
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,295
Okay

1240
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,319
Alright

1241
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,343
Okay it is

1242
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:58,623
Scientific

1243
01:04:58,879 --> 01:04:59,391
Fact

1244
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:01,439
That God removed his

1245
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:05,535
Texan over the United Way 911 Avenue

1246
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,863
And that is why it's not a holy war

1247
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:09,631
No

1248
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,399
Because it's

1249
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:12,703
Divine retribution

1250
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,727
Also Alex

1251
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:15,775
Does say now the people who are against

1252
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:18,335
Tamara with the Devil

1253
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,103
So I

1254
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:21,407
I guess it's a holy war now

1255
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,431
Right

1256
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:24,223
Okay

1257
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:30,623
I'd like him to scientifically prove that God protection was removed inactivate 9/11 happen

1258
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:32,159
God's protection doing

1259
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:35,231
Around the United States prior to that area

1260
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:39,071
Did we never have any terrorist attacks prior to that.

1261
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:40,607
None

1262
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:44,191
Another call from a guy brings up scripture

1263
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:46,495
Clunky way

1264
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,519

01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:30,015
Well the Chronicles are about the I mean their literal Chronicles of all the cool ship that the Kings did

1279
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:31,551
Sure sure

1280
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:32,575
So

1281
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:33,855
Easy caller

1282
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:35,135
Easy

1283
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,927
What do you want to talk about

1284
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,303
Story of the 7th and lion

1285
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,327
The British crown

1286
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:45,375
Oh no

1287
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,655
Pictures of the mother and

1288
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:47,679
Queen

1289
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:48,447
Mother

1290
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,287
Really

1291
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,687
Well if possible

1292
01:06:59,199 --> 01:06:59,711
No he's not

1293
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:01,503
But that's interesting

1294
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,783
Because that implies

1295
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:09,183
Is that Alex knows very clearly what British is realism is

1296
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:11,487
Alex is aware of it as a concept he knows it

1297
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,279
The thing

1298
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,303
I'm saying

1299
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,071
A complete ignorance

1300
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:16,095
About

1301
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,887
Which is a problem

1302
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:20,703
But this caller what he's talking about is a book

1303
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:23,519
Is about Prince Charles's brother

1304
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:25,055
Is younger brother

1305
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:27,871
The 7th in line for the

1306
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,431
It's not Andrew to the other

1307
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:35,295
Edward is the other brother whatever I don't like Royals

1308
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:36,831
Biography

1309
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:40,927
About him I don't think it has anything to do with British Israel

1310
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:46,303
I am glad he's going is that the bushes are related to the British royal family

1311
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,327
Well

1312
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:52,959
I don't know where he's going exactly

1313
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:53,983
Fair.

1314
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:55,007
Bear

1315
01:07:55,263 --> 01:08:01,407
Color brought up the scripture in he's talking about anointing of Kings it is in the Bible right

1316
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,687
Read this book

1317
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:09,087
About the Royals and daddy look like bushes or whatever right

1318
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:11,135
Mike down for this

1319
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:13,695
I want I want you to help me out here

1320
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:20,351
I can't tell if what this caller is bringing up as a satirical suggestion or if it's sincere

1321
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:22,143
I'm not sure

1322
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:23,679
You don't

1323
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,703
In the Bible

1324
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,983
It talked about

1325
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,055
The testimonies

1326
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:33,919
Navigation to manipulate

1327
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:38,271
Constitution

1328
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:57,727
Ditto in Germany to do I don't know why he was a complete bad

1329
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:01,055
About

1330
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,223
You know

1331
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:09,759
23:2

1332
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:14,879
I don't know what's going on

1333
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,671
I can't tell like

1334
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:23,327
I think this is a sincere suggestion that the caller is making that he's real

1335
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,607
Poorly expressing

1336
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:27,167
Sort of a point of satire like

1337
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:31,519
Hey you know it's in the Bible do we have Kings why shouldn't we have Kings

1338
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:33,055
Like being

1339
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:36,895
Presenting that is like an over-the-top argument

1340
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:43,295
But then again I don't know what the point of that would be like what what's the movie underneath that satire the satirizing the Bible

1341
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,855
No I

1342
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:46,879
I view this

1343
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:49,951
As him being 100% sincere

1344
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:51,231
Kind of feels

1345
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:57,631
And I think the main reason for that is he's been reading about how great

1346
01:09:57,887 --> 01:10:01,727
Great Kings have been and how a philosopher-king is perhaps

1347
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,775
The best type of government that they're possum

1348
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:07,359
And that's decided that democracy is

1349
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,127
Who's failed us

1350
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:09,663
The Constitution is meaningless

1351
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,687
And we should have a king

1352
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,223
Also

1353
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:13,247
And Alex

1354
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:15,807
After a little while

1355
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:17,343
Is going to agree with him

1356
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:18,623
True

1357
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:22,463
Yes I do think that Alex is come around on the idea of monarchy

1358
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,487
At least

1359
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:25,535
Specific sort of monarchy

1360
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:30,399
Yeah weird weird that those guys were that'll to Alex being like should we all just

1361
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:32,447
LiteBlue

1362
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,215
High School

1363
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:40,895
Lot of people didn't I would say I would say probably a significantly larger number

1364
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:44,479
This is this is some kind of problem

1365
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:45,247
For Alex

1366
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:49,343
Much like the Republic of Texas callers

1367
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,111
His craw

1368
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:55,487
Fancy goes to another call and he's got to bring it up he's going to bring up this idea of making Bush King

1369
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:03,167
Yeah yeah that's another

1370
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,215
Don't put down

1371
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:06,751
Just because he

1372
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:08,799
What is a good

1373
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:12,383
My family

1374
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:14,431
Have two lines of Royal Blood

1375
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,967
I don't know

1376
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,303
Fought in the backyard at a house

1377
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:36,191
This didn't go away Alex wanted it to

1378
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:42,591
Chris is spirals out of control real quick buddy I kind of got the sense that maybe you'd back me up on this whole maken-ki

1379
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:47,711
Anything is bad actually I am to Royal bloodline

1380
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:52,575
Yeah that's that's definitely not what you would be expecting at mean if your Alex

1381
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:57,183
With your Alex audiots I can't imagine you would get to

1382
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:59,743
Pro-monarchy people in a row

1383
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:01,535
That would be surprised

1384
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:02,559
2 m

1385
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:05,119
It's just like wow this is

1386
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:07,423
Bad luck at full moon or something I don't know

1387
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:12,543
Smoking description of Kings is literally

1388
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,079
Don't hate the player hate the

1389
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:16,895
The game

1390
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:20,479
Something like the two Bloodlines I come from

1391
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:22,783
No

1392
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:24,575
But George Washing

1393
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:27,391
You can park my backyard

1394
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,671
My blood

1395
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:35,071
I dated if the tutors heard I was bad-mouthing behind their back Alex

1396
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:37,119
And said that he's related to The Tudors

1397
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:38,399
Maybe they're related

1398
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,423
Hey Kirby

1399
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,447
So

1400
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,007
Coming into the end of this

1401
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:48,639
Is here and 27th Alex gets into talking a little bit about some new news stories about

1402
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,943
Some SSRI

1403
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,991
Issues who are literate literate

1404
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:54,783
Becoming conversation

1405
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:57,087
One of them is about

1406
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:58,623
Dangers of withdrawal

1407
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:01,439
For some SSRI medication

1408
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:05,023
Although Alex

1409
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,047
Portray it as just

1410
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:08,863
Being on these drugs will make you kill people and I

1411
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:09,887
Have you

1412
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,679
I thought this was

1413
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,447
Bizarre

1414
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:17,823
Because Alex hasn't updated any of these talking points

1415
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:21,151
These are all the same things that he says

1416
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:25,759
When they did that

1417
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:41,375
Mind control

1418
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:45,983
Pittsburgh

1419
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,727
Open

1420
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:25,919
This is just

1421
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:29,247
Exactly the same sort of stuff that he says all the time

1422
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:35,135
Anything that I think is really interesting is that story about the butcher knife on top of a roof is also the specific

1423
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,671
Example that uses yep

1424
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:38,463
3 years and years

1425
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,231
Is this one

1426
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:40,767
Image that he has

1427
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:44,095
Of of a case of somebody with a butcher knife on a roof

1428
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:47,423
I think it was just deeply response

1429
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,799
The definition of a nun nuance

1430
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:53,823
How to take on

1431
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:55,359
Psychiatric Med

1432
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:57,663
Yeah I mean there's a

1433
01:14:58,175 --> 01:15:00,223
You know there's not much to say whenever it's like

1434
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:02,783
Man when I was

1435
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:05,855
In 2003 I was unmedicated

1436
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:11,999
Just coming into my own as a type one Bipolar person you could see reality manned like

1437
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:15,583
You know you weren't really walking just reading about it back

1438
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:18,143
Then it was legitimately like

1439
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:21,983
In the literature of bipolar type one was just straight-up like

1440
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,007
1/5

1441
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:25,311
It's the view don't make it for whatever

1442
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:27,871
And its related to your mental illness

1443
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:31,199
I'd like that idea of somebody being like well

1444
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:31,967
You know what

1445
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:34,015
Better than ssris

1446
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:35,551
I'm feeling it's just like

1447
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:38,623
I just don't know how you can

1448
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:41,439
How you can talk to somebody who's aware of the death

1449
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:43,487
Toll just being alive

1450
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:45,535
Yeah

1451
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,559
Yeah it's

1452
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:50,911
It's a real shity giving someone life

1453
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:51,935
Is in fact

1454
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:59,359
Yeah there's a lot of factors and variables that Alex isn't taking into account here

1455
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:04,479
Obviously any medication that people take isn't without risk

1456
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:07,039
Living without medication

1457
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:07,807
Pittsburgh

1458
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,343
Some people is also

1459
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,623
A great risk

1460
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:13,183
And it's unfair to attack

1461
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,999
Is medication because of the risk

1462
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:18,303
Well not accepting that there is a great risk

1463
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,839
Do not take

1464
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:20,607
Can medication

1465
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,911
And the f*****-up part of it

1466
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,191
The f*****-up part of it

1467
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,727
Is what one of the biggest

1468
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:29,311
Contributors to that is let's say you were on an SSRI

1469
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:33,407
And then you listen to a f****** radio show and suddenly decide to stop take

1470
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,431
Taking your medication

1471
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:36,223
And then your withdrawals f******

1472
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:39,807
Blue light you up and you become part of the statistic

1473
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:41,855
Did Alex is going to use the next

1474
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:46,207
Sheer dry say that people who are on SSI right should immediately stop them

1475
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,231
As part of his Avenue

1476
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:52,095
I have to correct you cuz it is Alex does

1477
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:53,375
Bring up that

1478
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,911
Stopping taking

1479
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:56,191
King meds he's dating

1480
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:56,959
Well that's good

1481
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:59,519
I don't know if it's enough

1482
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:00,543
2

1483
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:02,591
Dissuade his listeners who

1484
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:04,383
Hear him say the taking meds

1485
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:09,247
Make you have a bad trip or you're just be brainwashed

1486
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,783
But he does

1487
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,319
Actually say

1488
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:13,855
Is that like you need to

1489
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:15,135
Take a like a

1490
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:17,951
Decreasing dose.

1491
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:28,447
Wild fear-mongering about the meds I just couldn't let

1492
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:31,519
That's not be sad because he does actually

1493
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:33,311
It's good to say it's good to point out

1494
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:37,151
Now unfortunately

1495
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:52,511
Properly

1496
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:08,639
So apparently

1497
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:09,919
You should just pray

1498
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:16,319
Well you know I feel like I'm worthless in like I'm a drain on every single human being around me in that

1499
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:17,343
Every

1500
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:20,671
A part of life would be improved if I were no longer here for it

1501
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:25,023
But actually know what I should have just done drug gone for a run

1502
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:26,303
My bad

1503
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:27,583
While I was running

1504
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:28,607
I definitely wouldn't

1505
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:29,375
Fixate

1506
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:35,775
On those very same repetitive thoughts that I can't get out of my buddies just pray that God heals you

1507
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:37,055
REI

1508
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:42,687
Man fights really worked for me when I was growing up on YouTube

1509
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:45,759
It solved a lot of problems

1510
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:47,295
Look I don't want

1511
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,063
2

1512
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,855
Like give any credence

1513
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:51,391
Stewart Alex is saying but

1514
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:52,927
Piano exercise

1515
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:56,767
Can help people feel better exercising meditation are great

1516
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:59,327
8 ways to cope

1517
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:01,887
But that is not full

1518
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:05,471
Help regimen necessarily

1519
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:10,591
Dangerous kind of bad

1520
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:12,127
I think

1521
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:14,687
You know obviously it's not what I'm looking

1522
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:15,711
Four in terms

1523
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:18,527
Figuring out if Alex believes he's fighting the literal devil

1524
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:21,855
There's a corollary here that does seem to think of that

1525
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:23,135
Health can be achieved

1526
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,927
By God giving it to you

1527
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:27,999
Yeah so there is at least some kind of

1528
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:30,815
Weird

1529
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:32,351
Religiosity here

1530
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:37,471
Yeah I mean there's there's definitely a an escalation

1531
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:39,775
From metaphorical to

1532
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:40,543
Jesus

1533
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:44,127
And God having a literal effect on curing you

1534
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:45,151
Which

1535
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,431
It suggests that

1536
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:47,967
They are real

1537
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:48,991
Literally

1538
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:52,831
And if they are real literally than his cosmology suggested

1539
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:57,695
The devil is real literally I'm not positive that is an assumption that you can make

1540
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:01,535
Because I think I think that a lot of people can believe

1541
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:02,559
In

1542
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:03,583
Literalness

1543
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:05,375
Of God's existence

1544
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:06,911
Without believing

1545
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:09,215
Literally in an antagonist

1546
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:17,408
Sure that's why I agreed with you that's true I think the evidence presented so far in 2003 of Alex

1547
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:19,968
Celebrate such that you can't be like

1548
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,760
I'm guessing his

1549
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,064
Belief in the Bible

1550
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:25,856
Is it does not include say

1551
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:32,256
I also think that you can believe in the literalness of God and not necessarily believe in the literal

1552
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,024
Wellness of

1553
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:35,840
Prayer is a healthcare plan

1554
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:36,608
You know like

1555
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:37,376
I think

1556
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:39,936
I think that there is a difference

1557
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:40,704
Between

1558
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,008
Those kinds of Engagement

1559
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:44,032
With diligent

1560
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,056
Absolutely

1561
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:45,824
I think

1562
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,128
I think you're seeing that Alex is at least

1563
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,432
Clearly in the

1564
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:52,992
God is better than Single Payer

1565
01:20:54,528 --> 01:21:00,672
A 2003 but I still haven't found a more like single pray that's what we do

1566
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:02,976
I still haven't found enough evidence of

1567
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,256
Literal Satan

1568
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:05,792
Keep looking

1569
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:07,328
Although this episode was

1570
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,864
Bizarre I mean

1571
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:11,424
Beyond just the boringness of it

1572
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,448
Very boring

1573
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:16,288
It's just standard at Bilderberg

1574
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:18,848
Put behind that you have two guys who are

1575
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:21,920
Appearances of anti-semitism

1576
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:27,552
Who are the experts that Alex has on to talk about the Bilderberg stuff a problem

1577
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:29,344
And it definitely merits attention

1578
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,624
Next

1579
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,672
The other thing that I'm seeing here

1580
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:33,952
Bizarrely

1581
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,488
22nd

1582
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,048
27th of May 2003

1583
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,096
Alex isn't talking about Putin

1584
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:41,376
Well

1585
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:44,192
Is conspicuous and a types

1586
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:46,496
You talk about that

1587
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:47,520
F****** Apartments

1588
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:49,056
Instantly

1589
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,848
Episode that doesn't come up

1590
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:52,384
It might just be that he had other things

1591
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,408
Talk about but

1592
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,200
I mean I would get distract

1593
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:56,224
To do if my guest

1594
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:00,064
Notorious anti-semites in my callers were

1595
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,344
Oddly pro-monarchy

1596
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:03,904
I would get tossed out of my regular

1597
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:08,000
808 Mafia Church in the middle of nowhere

1598
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,048
That would cost me from my regular boots

1599
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:10,816
Self

1600
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:11,840
Yeah

1601
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:16,704
Another other fish to fry at least I've distracted by those dangling

1602
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:17,472
Sure

1603
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:24,640

Available

1607
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,160
Holdover button

1608
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:38,208
Anybody wants to come out

1609
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:44,608
Afrobull

1610
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:52,032
Are in Chicago

1611
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:54,336
Route something

1612
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:56,128
I think that

1613
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,664
We will have a feeling of

1614
01:22:58,176 --> 01:23:00,480
Is there an interest for sure

1615
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:06,880
Face. Like if no one comes to this recorded in my apartment

1616
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:09,696
I don't want that to be a threat

1617
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:10,464
But

1618
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:14,048
No that was very good that was a very good plan

1619
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:20,960
We are attorneys that knowledge has revealed that go to bed Jordan Facebook if you would like

1620
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:27,360
Bogota lost my mind

1621
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:31,456
There for a second and then find a local charity will be offended

1622
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:37,856
Until then I'm Neo I'm Leo I'm dzx like I'm Daryl rundus actually sound

1623
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:39,904
Barack Obama's

01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:40,928
Secrets

1625
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:42,720
Baha'i Church

1626
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:44,512

Text me just to Baha'i Temple in Evanston

1628
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:48,608
It's not Secret

1629
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:50,400
I don't think Obama ever went there

1630
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:52,960
I just found this really cool velvet

1631
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:55,264
Holding

1632
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:58,336
