1

Air Jordan 5 sweat it

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

5
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:09,376
Alex

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,824

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,968
I was very nice

9
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,248
To have a chat with her

10
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,040
It's been awhile since we've gotten

11
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,832
Sit down and talk for a bit

12
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:34,976
Yes you wanted to I have not talked about my mortal enemy Alex today

13
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,792
So yeah it's a it's a lot of fun nusret it was great

14
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:44,192
210 at the chat I didn't come out I will. Very funny

15
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,984
Comedian credibly Talent

16
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,824
We talked a little bit about how we met

17
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:54,944
I don't know if we met but the first time I remember ever seeing her was at a place called Jackson

18
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,992
Yeah a little bit about that

19
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,016
Good

20
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,856
Yeah I think the funniest thing about her for me is that

21
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,928
It is it is weird to see somebody that you know is

22
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,464
Is a small-time comedian you know

23
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,512
Coming up in Chicago and you look up to her

24
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:13,376
And then a few years later she's in a birdie commercial as be assholes

25
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,448
Yeah. That was an unfortunate week

26
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:23,104
Continues to spoil

27
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,176
What about the New York Times article

28
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,456
About us and

29
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:31,552
Thursday undue amount of attention paid on where we went

30
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,624
Reporter once a town

31
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,952
So it's delightful

32
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,768
Spot is a bit of a Twilight spots

33
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,328
The bright spot is my partner

34
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,120
She is going on a retreat

35
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,912
Set my alarm for the next 3 weeks

36
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,288
Get together with artists

37
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,312
Grown ups

38
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,080
Adults

39
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
And then

40
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:01,248
Just starting the s*** out of the woods and painting

41
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,784
Check with Toad on her lick

42
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,856
Lips

43
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,952
That's very cool but she's going to be gone

44
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,512
Few weeks the first time we've been apart for like

45
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,424
Years yeah yeah you're going to go nuts

46
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,984
Going to lose your s***

47
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:28,128
Great for her I'm around so

48
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,920
Obviously we can

49
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,992
We can hang a little you can move in

50
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:38,624
I can't do that at all this furniture

51
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,952
Is a gradual process

52
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:48,352
Applied for wellness checks with a little sure Flay every couple of days make sure I eat

53
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:54,496
How do wellness check but it'll be like binoculars outside of your window

54
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,520
Yeah and then we're fine

55
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,848
Sue Jordan today we have an episode to go over

56
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,384

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
6

59
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,712

00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,672
So we got to talk about it naturally Trump

65
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,696
Declared

66
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,464
Is bread

67
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:20,351
That didn't happen

68
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,631
Not good but there was some big news

69
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,911
I will get to it before

70
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:29,311
Looks like a little over to say hello.

71
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:36,223
Elmo robbery was awesome wasn't it

72
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:45,439
The name Alex itself is a red flag never met one who do me dirty thank you so much

73
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,255
Thank you very much

74
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,327
I heard you and Jordan on behind the Bastards about the rich

00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,423
Eating Christianity and needed more of Jordan in my life Jordan don't stop

00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,471
Screeching thank you so much

77
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,127
Sure

So thank you so much to a from Sweden says death awaits you all with nasty big pointy teeth you are now

79
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
Technocrat

80
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,679
Natalya brilliant someone

81
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
Sodomites

82
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,871
Has a Caribbean

83
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,479
I don't want

84
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,271
Jesus Christ

85
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,879
Jordan legacy

86
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,719
Okay well here is what we talk

87
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:54,047
Breaking live now

88
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:58,655
It's not that Alex started with t n a

89
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:05,311
Suburb of Atlanta Georgia the Georgia guidestone

90
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:11,711
Skyhigh at least a third of the satanic structure

91
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:23,743
Towards the left from the pull-down Monument monument and I will say that

92
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:36,543
Agree with whoever did it because we need that he will end up us there

93
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,311
What

94
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
Fashion letter

95
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,527
Mother's Farm

96
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,855
We need to be there to expose their plan

97
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,159
Reduce the world population

98
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
So this is dumb

99
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,767
The guide

100
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:01,887
Need to be standing for people to remember that they did exist and to keep a record of what was on them

101
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
We have TV

102
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:09,823
If I were Alex I also wouldn't be thrilled that someone bombed them but for completely different

103
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,127
Conspiracy world

104
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:16,479
These are super important as a monument for the globalist who built them

105
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,039
Specifically where they are so they would survive the coming

106
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
Cataclysm

107
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,599
These were meant to be a guide

108
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,879
Made for the Post apocalypse

109
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,159
What's a collapsed people

110
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
Who need to rebuild

111
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,303
Society in essence distilling down the lessons that we learned and weren't able to put in practice

112
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,071
Is before

113
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,351
We destroyed ourselves

114
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,679
Given that this is the point of these stones

115
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:40,543
It stands to reason that if someone would have bombed that it would have really provoked a response from the globalist

116
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,103
This will be no small matter for them

117
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,383
And when there is no

118
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,431
Swift devastating counter move

119
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,223
It's going to look really suspicious

120
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,319
Like no one gives a s*** really is going to be like

121
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
I mean

122
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
It's fate

123
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,695
Kidtastic the idea of the the conviction of the person who bombed

124
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,999
The Georgia guidelines somebody who really

125
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:06,399
Really believe me it's Satan

126
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,727
Yeah I guess so I guess

127
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,031
But on the other hand

128
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,055
Carved Stone

129
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,847
What do you have difficulty

130
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
Replace them

131
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,967
But so he's just he's just going to wake up the next day and everybody's gonna be like

132
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,991
Is interesting at their back

133
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
And nobody cares

134
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:26,623
One of the big mystery surrounding the Guidestones is about who paid to have them built

135
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,207
In the first place but that wouldn't even be an issue for they're rebuilding

136
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:36,095
The person who had them built using the pseudonym RC Christian gave the monument to Elbert County

137
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,399
Then it's become a massive tourist

138
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
Attraction

139
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,983
The motive for the county itself to rebuild them

140
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,519
Is pretty clear given that the

141
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:47,871
The bombing of the Guidestones essentially would be eliminating a thing to brought a bunch of Commerce

142
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,455
Did this otherwise not very interesting contact

143
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,527
Not much going on there but the Georgia Guidestones Obispo

144
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
Point Yacht

145
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,087
My feeling on this is a little bit mix

146
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,367
On the one hand

147
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,671
I definitely don't care about the Georgia

148
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:07,583
I think it's a very interesting thing that they were created and they Christian managed to keep his real identity obscured

149
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,119
Through the whole process although

150
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
Alex and the conspiracy

151
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:13,215
Community of decided that they have proof that it's Ted Turner

152
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:18,847
Property damage is a political statement is not really something that I have much of a problem with generally

153
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:25,503
In this case I think the political statements being made his hollow and meaningless but I appreciate that humans weren't targeted in

154
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
This one

155
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,807
I guess we got that to say for it

156
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,831
Can't go wrong there

157
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
Beckett's

158
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,927
I have my feelings getting a little mixed up

159
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,511
I don't necessarily have a problem with property damage

160
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,839
I do think this could be a scary harbinger of what's

161
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
Succumb

162
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:47,007
The celebration that's been seeing the conspiracy communities after this bomb and could easily translate to attacks being carried out on

163
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,079
Other imaginary globalist monuments and institutions

164
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,895
And I think a lot of those things are

165
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,663
Just be proper

166
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:01,087
So I guess my take is that it sucks that Elbert County residents are probably going to have their businesses hurt by the decrease

167
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:05,183
Traffic outside of that I could take or leave the guidestone

168
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,255
I worry about what this could lead to a zit

169
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,535
Feels like it could embolden

170
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,095
In the type of folks who want to carry out domestic terrorism against

171
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,375
Imaginary enemies

172
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,447
Overall I just feel like it's really sad

173
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,471
Adults acting like

174
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,775
This means anything beyond somebody blowing up a tourist

175
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,543
Attraction

176
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,079
Give me some kind of like

177
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,639
Spiritual importance is really embarrassing

178
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,943
And I feel really bummed out scene

179
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,271
Adults Pacific Northwest

180
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,807
Giant Paul Bunyan

181
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
Huge

182
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,367
Cuz it's cuz of the

183
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,159
The story of Paul Bunyan he was a big guy

184
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,183
Pickaxe

185
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,463
Announce not all that

186
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,255
This is like if somebody

187
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,327
Blue up Paul Bunyan cuz they were like if that dude comes back

188
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,607
He is going to lay waste

189
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,399
Easter this land

190
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
So we got to take

191
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,823
Tiffany's out right now make sensory

192
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,615
We don't even know what

193
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,943
Can't fight back against that we have to let it run

194
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,479
All week

195
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,759
We can take him down

196
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,855
Yeah it's like blowing up the world's largest pecan

197
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:14,303
GEICO roadside attraction is removed one

198
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:19,423
Ford and mile further down the way and I don't think like you should trivialize

199
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,751
Bombing episode

200
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,311
I might have some misgivings

201
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,127
About like bombing a Confederate statue

202
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,151
Or something

203
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,687
Just because I think bombing

204
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,991
Is generally be a little unpredictable

205
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,039
Yeah I mean I'm not a bomb guy

206
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,623
So I don't know anything about bombs but from what I've seen enough

207
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,207
Everything somebody tearing down a statue

208
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,535
Feels a little different than bombing something here's what I say

209
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,351
I say we can bomb any mom Newman

210
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,887
So long as it is moved

211
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,935
To The MythBusters lot further

212
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,263
They are the only people allowed to if they're still

213
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,079
Safety salute it'll be fun to watch

214
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:02,175
Alex has some details about this bombing that are not correct

215
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,479
You can see

216
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,271
Georgia

217
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,831
Stones English portion has been blown up

218
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,623
It repeats it in

219
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
But

220
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,463
12345678

221
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
Different languages

222
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,023
Sanskrit

223
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
English

224
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,887
Open away from face portion

225
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,727
English speaker that is angry

226
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
American

227
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,799
So Japanese is one of the languages

228
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:34,175
Make such a big deal the idea that the English portion got destroyed

229
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,199
And it's probably cuz

230
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
It's not true

231
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,527
The Guidestones include the same text

232
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,551
In multiple

233
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,879
They're four slabs of stone and eight languages

234
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,927
So they basically have one on each side

235
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,463
These languages are

236
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
English Russian

237
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,535
Traditional Chinese Arabic

238
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,095
Hebrew Swahili gindi in Spanish

239
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:57,727
Three of the four slabs remain standing after the bombing only one was blown up

240
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,775
And if you look for images of the rubble

241
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,871
It's very clear that the slab that got blown up was the one that had the message written

242
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,151
In Hebrew on it

243
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,479
Oh my God I was really I was almost like

244
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,783
Who is Fitz Russian maybe that has

245
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,575
Hebrew

246
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:18,975
That's a Hebrew on one side and Arabic on the other

247
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:24,351
Fortune because if he acknowledges the fact that it was actually the slab that had Hebrew and Arabic translations on it

248
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:29,727
Possibility that this was actually motivated by other maybe anti-semitic ideas come up

249
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,031
Prefer to ignore that because

250
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
Is it kind of come

251
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,567
2 closed

252
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,895
Touching on how his worldview and his characterization of the globalist

253
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:41,247
For essentially just based on a piece medic troops from history

254
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
No that wouldn't

255
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:47,647
Be good and definitely not in a story with the stakes of the Georgia Guidestones wouldn't be the way he wants

256
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,671
What's it like finally

257
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,719
Confront the fact that everything he does is

258
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:56,607
I don't know if there was any importance to which

259
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,911
Was blown up

260
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,703
What if it's

261
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,239
In the world we live in

262
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
We don't know

263
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,055
Yeah

264
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,079
It's the Hebrew 1

265
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,615
It's automatically suspicious

266
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,639
She's just got to where we are

267
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,711
Insisting it's the English one

268
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,991
Absolutely

269
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,271
I don't know

270
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:18,367
This is not really understand

271
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,647
These stones

272
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,463
Infowars.com

273
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,231
Local

274
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,631
Depopulate the human

275
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,167
Population

276
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,727
What a weird thing

277
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
Digital photo

278
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
There

279
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,639
And

280
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,687
Endorse this time

281
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,063
But I certainly understand whoever

282
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,927
And it's the middle of nowhere

283
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,695
Lavash

284
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,999
Side Road by cornfield

285
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,303
It was obviously blown up in middle of night

286
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
Appreciate

287
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,447
Guessing

288
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,471
About the motives

289
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
Yeah that's fun

290
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:12,639
We've been over this a bunch of times these Stones do not say to depopulate the planet down to 500 million people

291
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:18,783
The point of the stones are to be a guide to the population that live through an end-of-the-world type scenario where

292
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,807
Humantay to bottleneck

293
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,135
Advice to a new civilization

294
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,439
Which point the world's population will be less

295
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,719
Than 500 million

296
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:31,583
And the stones are just saying that they should probably shoot for about that level of population to maintain

297
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
A balance

298
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375
With nature

299
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,447
Also bombing this Monument is not civil disobedience

300
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,263
You can agree with

301
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,335
Doing it or not but it's definitely

302
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,151
Vandalism at least and possibly to mess

303
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
Disobedience

304
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:51,295
It really does refute magic dominator

305
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:57,951
I think it would have to blow it up with a spell

306
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,743
Didn't see any debris

307
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,071
Are we did

308
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,215
Obedience is something like a city where you put your body somewhere and refuse to obey with Apple

309
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,287
Least telling you to leave or refusing to cooperate with

310
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
The police

311
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,359
Enable exit solitary and State

312
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,919
What happened in Georgia is a bombing

313
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,943
That's different

314
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,735
You know no-one was hurt

315
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:24,063
Yeah if you blow up a cop car that is not civil disobedience

316
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,647
No that is blowing up a cop cause a little bit beyond

317
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,439
Whether or not

318
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
You

319
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:36,607
Agree with the reason someone engaged in that Adam sure like I wouldn't have said

320
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,655
Burning of the police station

321
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,983
Last year I wouldn't have said that that was civil disobedience

322
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,359
That was taking a step in the right direction

323
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,383
I got to say

324
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,687
It is not consistent

325
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,479
I don't think he's sincere

326
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,295
Appreciate

327
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
Least

328
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087
Verbalizing

329
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,415
But he doesn't agree with this vomit

330
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,719
That level this is not the right mood to make

331
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,119
Sympathize

332
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
Type of Foster

333
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,703
The process of doing this

334
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,031
What are we going to do when they're killing us to the poison shot

335
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,079
The GMO Foods

336
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,151
Cultural satanic

337
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,991
What are we going to do with it

338
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,551
And the New World Order

339
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,575
Bill Gates

340
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
Population

341
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,559
Talk about it exposed

342
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,583
They do that all the

343
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,863
Pretty much

344
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:46,495
Constant YouTube videos of people at the Georgia Guidestones doing like a look at that TiVo

345
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:51,359
Put something up in March of 1980 and have me believe there's any magic

346
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,431
It's a big part of Alex's like it's in endgame

347
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,527
You can't it's the beginning of everything

348
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:03,135
Reagan can't be president while magic is happening

349
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,183
Betty's powerful inside Stone

350
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,487
Also Alex is like really going

351
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:11,327
Pretty full-on into assuming the motive behind this person

352
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,399
Make an obvious

353
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
Leap

354
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,471
Do like well there's some problem with the

355
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,519
The conspiracy theories that surround

356
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,799
The Georgia Guidestones

357
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,103
Hard to believe that there would be another reason

358
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,663
Have to like

359
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,943
Recognize that there could be

360
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:33,343
Total and it could end up being some sort of a Neo-Nazi

361
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,415
Precise with this person you're making a pretty big

362
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,975
But you might not want to make

363
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,767
Later that might look bad

364
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:47,167
What I'm hoping for is that this has the wackiest possible outcome you know like whenever the

365
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:53,567
Impersonator impersonator with the I want that

366
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,591
That this has nothing

367
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,127
Things to do with anything other than

368
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,431
The frame somebody

369
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,503
Or just someone is

370
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,903
In the area and they had a bomb that accidentally lit and they just juggling

371
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,207
Black one with a skull and crossbones on the

372
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,791
It's like Mario with a baba

373
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:17,887
To go off

374
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,167
So we don't want

375
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,215
This is not a false

376
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,287
I'll tell you that

377
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,127
Early stages of ants never actually Target

378
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,039
The New World Order the gondola

379
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,463
This was a right

380
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,535
Monument being blown up

381
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,839
It wouldn't even be on the news

382
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Totally

383
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,727
But because

384
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
This

385
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,823
Schedule Dish Dish

386
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,359
Obelisk

387
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,663
This

388
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,199
Colt marking

389
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,759
Population for death

390
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,039
Because this

391
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:11,903
Is a

392
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,695
Logo

393
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,487
Spiritual

394
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,559
They are going to go

395
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,095
Absolutely

396
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,167
Can't believe it

397
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:29,567
Yeah it's not a false flag be completely meaningless an arbitrary definitions that Alex had today

398
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:34,431
For what is a man

399
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,991
Are you busy easier for me to

400
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:40,831
Use as a story if it's not a false flag

401
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
Makes more sense

402
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,183
See no way that you can

403
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,743
Live in the cognitive dissonance of it being this

404
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,791
Harbinger of Doom that is

405
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,095
Put there by the all-powerful globalist

406
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,375
And also you can just f***

407
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,399
Can blow it up

408
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,423
You can't just f******

409
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,447
Blow s*** up

410
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,775
But nobody like you couldn't have just been like oh s***

411
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:05,407
Boom Jesus Is Dead solve that f****** problem like you can't just blow magic up

412
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:12,319
You can't have it be like this super important thing to the globalist have someone blow it up and then

413
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:18,208
There be no response would be over by now if any of Alex's work

414
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:23,328
Ordered the entire state of Georgia with

415
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,352
Begone

416
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,424
Just I just to get this guy

417
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,240
That would be it would be like if that somebody

418
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
Was it

419
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,568
We really were in The Book of Revelations

420
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,616
People had just been raptured

421
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,432
And somebody just shot the Antichrist and everybody was like

422
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:42,016
Oh s*** I didn't know you could just do that and then it was over

423
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:49,184
The guy would not have just been able to drive away

424
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:54,560
I don't know maybe a lot of Alex's ideology and worldviews dumb

425
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,328
Could be

426
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,352
So Alex

427
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,376
Gets real weird

428
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,656
Because key thing

429
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,680
This is like

430
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,960
It's not a false flag

431
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,008
I don't agree with this

432
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,336
But I like seeing a blow up

433
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:13,248
Take it upon himself to deliver a message to the bomber

434
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:16,576
Good excellent it's not good that safety

435
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,856
It's not that good

436
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,672
Call for desperate measures

437
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,744
But in the balance

438
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,584
Whoever did this

439
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,608
I would tell you

440
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,472
Probably watching

441
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,264
Disappointed

442
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
Encourage you

443
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,408
Bright bless you didn't hurt anybody

444
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,968
Y'all she chose the time to do it where you wouldn't hurt

445
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,296
And I

446
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,344
Out of character for my people

447
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,624
Stand Down

448
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,256
Weird

449
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,280
Strange

450
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
Strange

451
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:04,448
Thing to say about the proud boys who would that be

452
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:09,056
Stand up stand by as like that

453
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:17,248
For his call

454
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:21,600
Just be cool for right now I don't know

455
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,648
I respect you also his like

456
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,440
I'm not I'm not mad at you

457
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,976
I'm just disappointed energy

458
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,536
It's so infuriating for a bombing

459
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,840
Big a big dad energy

460
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,936
You listen you wrecked the car

461
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:39,520
It's it happens to a lot of people and I'm sorry it's a little bit different from

462
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:40,800
You

463
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:47,200
Blew up the Georgia Guidestones I get it we've all been there amongst us hasn't

464
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:49,248
He was without a bottom cast of the first bomb

465
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,016
Obviously

466
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,856
Alex is comfortable to being like

467
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:59,232
I'm pretty sure you're letting me you're clearly one of my audience

468
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,024
Alright

469
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,560
Alright

470
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,584
A boy

471
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,632
I think that this

472
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,680
She's probably going to be a case that will not

473
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,704
Take very long to solve

474
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,288
And what have you stopped

475
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,080
No additional

476
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,920
Think of it you'll be standing by

477
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,712
In prison

478
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:25,856
Before hurt for a while they released a statement from the mad bomber what bombs

479
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,928
Is it midnight that was a little bit weird

480
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:31,744
Concert with it LLC then

481
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,536
Chair face Chippendale

482
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,328
So

483
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,632
We got we got open phones.

484
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,008
First-time callers long-time collars

485
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,032
Disagree people

486
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,568
GradeSpeed

487
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,664
We don't screen your calls just have a clean phone line

488
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,808
Now we're hungry cable and tv stage

489
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,624
Can't have the

490
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,744
370 + radio station

491
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,768
Now which is

492
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,048
Almost

493
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,096
What he was

494
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,912
I don't think that's the case

495
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,960
That's not the Arc of his his

496
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:16,032
His popularity

497
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:22,432
We'll check back in on this at a later time but I do not think that that is accurate at all

498
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,552
Cartoon character that he's going to

499
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:31,392
Compare the bomber to and it is not the mad bomber

500
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,416
What Bob's are busy

501
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:35,488
It is not a great one.

502
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,840
I think you chose the wrong character

503
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:43,168
Georgia Guidestones blown sky-high

504
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,984
Was there this

505
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,544
Mater

506
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,848
Poured everything else

507
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,432
Well-done are they scramble around like

508
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,224
Bunch of chickens with their little

509
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,504
Satanic heads

510
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,272
Shut off

511
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,344
Find out exactly what happened

512
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:06,720
What's coyotes defining characteristic is his

513
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,840
He blows himself up and blowing up

514
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,120
What is the Georgia

515
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
No

516
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,448
No no

517
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
Eat the roadrunner

518
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:22,080
I don't know what that would have been metaphorically in this case

519
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,104
But yeah you wouldn't

520
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,128
You wouldn't compare

521
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,176
He does have Bob

522
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,456
No no that is

523
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,088
But he orders them online he doesn't like make them from home true and again

524
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:39,488
They don't work sometimes but even then they are very small and just turn his face black

525
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:45,888
Work ironically sometimes

526
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,912
30in that they are off

527
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,448
Running when there is no ground beneath

528
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,312
The other thing is that

529
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,336
No one

530
00:26:54,848 --> 00:27:00,736
Is running around like chickens with their safety shut-off

531
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:04,064
I don't know if I've heard anybody be like

532
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,672
Oh my God what

533
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,232
Yeah one of the boar

534
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,024
Curaleaf

535
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,304
Notable thing

536
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:17,376
It is simply a thing everyone has noted

537
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:23,776
And that is it. Good but someone bombed the thing obviously but yeah

538
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,800
Big deal either

539
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:31,200
Kind of a notable events Meadowlands like this strikes at the heart of

540
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:35,552
We like the Georgia Guidestones themselves going up it was just a notable thing

541
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,880
They died today live

542
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:41,440
What if

543
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:45,536
A blue I'm up if anybody would if anybody

544
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,816
Would behave like a

545
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,888
Toon character in real life I think we know exactly who it is

546
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,424
So

547
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,752
Alex has a bit of a I guess

548
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,800
You know there's a psych meds narrative

549
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
About

550
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,360
The Highland Park shooter

551
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,152
It's been going around

552
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,688
Marjorie Taylor Greene

553
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,968
Thrones

554
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:04,992
Some business or at

555
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,272
And this is

556
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,552
Is extending now for Alex

557
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,320
Cuz we have

558
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,600
The

559
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,880
Psych meds

560
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,160
And also

561
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,440
That sweetgreen

562
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,280
Alex's

563
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,840
He's going Reefer Madness on

564
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,120
Remember

565
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:25,728
10 years ago warning Joe Rogan too many others on air bed

566
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,776
Weaponized marijuana

567
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,336
20 30 40 times stronger than what they used to be

568
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,152
Was linked to schizophrenia

569
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,808
New York Times

570
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,112
The dish new weaponized marijuana

571
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,416
The crazy people

572
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,696
I have known

573
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,464
Personally

574
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,024
Three people that worked here

575
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,144
A massive pot smokers who went

576
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:54,912
Crazy

577
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,008
Was a reptile alien

578
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,544
He still works

579
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,616
Another one thought we planted microphone to their office

580
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,736
Was Alton Bay office Jerome

581
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,368
Completely normal

582
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,160
Totally insane

583
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:16,928
Marijuana

584
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:23,072
I would I would argue that there is a real selection biosphere

585
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:28,192
Three people who worked at Infowars went crazy in it would definitely weed

586
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,496
Paranoid ways.

587
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:34,080
Very own brand

588
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:39,456
Lizard people hate someone spying on me and Alex's the devil

589
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,504
For somebody who worked at Infowars

590
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,904
To think that there were microphones In Their audience in their in their office or they

591
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,696
Little lizard person considered

592
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,000
Is constantly on the show

593
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,280
Regularly

594
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:58,912
Everyone else being the devil someone being like maybe you're the devil I feel like these are all just manifestation

595
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:02,240
Very normal paranoia that would be

596
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,288
Pretty normal in Alex's

597
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,360
Crew I would also say that if

598
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,152
Figures like Alex

599
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,456
And Joe are saying that

600
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,480
Recently

601
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:16,320
People I know have been reacting very negatively towards me

602
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,856
I think it's cuz of weed

603
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,160
Maybe you're an a******

604
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,464
Yeah also for Joe like

605
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,048
I mean some of his friends going crazy on the weed

606
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,608
I think that also has a selection bias

607
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,424
He chooses f***** up people to be friends with

608
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,960
Most of his friends have been hitting

609
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,240
The head repeatedly a lot

610
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:40,640
Yeah

611
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,968
Alex Jones

612
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:51,136
Used to not have a good filter at the people that he likes to spend time with

613
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:55,744
Also

614
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,536
I love the idea of The Joe Rogan

615
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,328
Has come out against weed while he smokes

616
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,144
Constantly on time during the show

617
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,960
His whole brand is we all

618
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,496
Smoke a lot of weed

619
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,032
Also you just

620
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,056
Went on my

621
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,336
Mike Tyson's podcast

622
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:13,152
I did mushrooms mushrooms

623
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,176
Gummies

624
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,712
Calm down

625
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,480
Call Mike

626
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:19,296
We'll see what you need to understand is that Alex has a reason

627
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,088
That he uses weed sometimes

628
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:26,464
And this definitely doesn't sound like someone has a really serious problem

629
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,768
I have tried marijuana

630
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:33,632
The longer is not ringing when I get

631
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:41,824
Time of the year

632
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,384
And about a year ago

633
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,200
People said well yous don't have the right strain

634
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,992
I tried to give her strength

635
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,296
Let me tell you some

636
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,624
The only time I've seen in my life

637
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,648
What's smoking

638
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,416
Marijuana

639
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:59,488
You Feel Fine Foods

640
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,352
And all the sudden

641
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,168
Really

642
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,032
Cialix

643
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,104
Many times but other times you felt crazy

644
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,640
So this is bulshit

645
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,712
No that's that's

646
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,736
I'm going to

647
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,296
Stop drinking by smoking weed here's what I need

648
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,344
To do replace one addiction with another

649
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,720
Yeah that'll do it really troubled times in my life has been the way I thought

650
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:35,584
My hangovers are too bad I'm in college right

651
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,424
Becomes more prominent

652
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,472
My way

653
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,240
But yeah

654
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,776
Alex has a

655
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:46,336
Adults

656
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:50,432
18 lb what a weird thing to happen perhaps I just replaced one

657
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,712
Compulsion with another

658
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,248
Yeah this is

659
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,016
Pretty

660
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,040
Dumb

661
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,576
Maybe not dumb but it's

662
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,112
It's the disordered kind of

663
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,136
Thinking that is it

664
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,440
I like it's pretty common among people who have a

665
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:04,256
I just can't handle

666
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:07,840
Watching commercials when I'm 15 that are b******* where it's like

667
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,120
If you smoke weed you're going to

668
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:15,264
Kill your baby and put her in a microwave or whatever and then be here 20 years later and have people

669
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,312
Still be saying that ship when it's f******

670
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,360
Legal sets

671
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,456
I think that Alex was a big libertarian

672
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,248
Smoke your weed kind of guy

673
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,272
Earlier

674
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:32,672
Because it was in opposition to the mainstream consensus that it's kind of becoming

675
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,440
Google and it's

676
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,488
Then I'm not that big a deal

677
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,280
Flipping and becoming a reformat

678
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,048
Missguided

679
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,328
End

680
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,888
Be a conscious effort

681
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,168
To be interesting

682
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:48,288
And I also think that it might be completely unconscious just oppositional defiance

683
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,616
But he has no access to he doesn't realize he's even doing

684
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,640
The 100%

685
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,200
I could totally see either of those because

686
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,480
In his personal life

687
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,528
He would smoke weed at the end of

688
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:01,856
The show

689
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:08,256
Or if some celebrity with any celebrity was around

690
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,560
What is it

691
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:13,632
Crystal meth

692
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,192
Couple times

693
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:22,336
Yeah we know that that's a good beach Behavior. Beach Drive

694
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,872
Not for Alex

695
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,408
Solo

696
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:31,808
This all leads to talking about how I crimbo Primo the Highland Park

697
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,088
Smoke that weed

698
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
Psychiatric

699
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,488
Whatever

700
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,048
Works

701
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,072
Whoa

702
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,120
Living on Cloud Cuckoo

703
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,656
Cuckoo

704
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:51,520
Wild who's cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs cuckoo for that Cocoa Puffs

705
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:56,896
That's what he was going for for the popcorn Cocoa Puffs to you didn't go for those big nugget

706
00:34:57,152 --> 00:35:00,736
So Alex can't prove that cremo was on any psych meds

707
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:01,760
He's just taking

708
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:07,392
Comments for Marjorie Taylor Greene is proof that he was ignoring stuff with no proof

709
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:10,208
Mtg's a pretty bad Source on this stuff

710
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,000
Considering that just after the shooting

711
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:15,584
She posted a photoshopped image of cremo on Twitter trying

712
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,120
To push the psych meds Theory

713
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,656
These people have a king

714
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,936
Conclusion and Willy

715
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:22,240
Accept any fake evidence to support that

716
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:27,616
A conclusion they should be doing is gathering information and allowing to guide them to a conclusion

717
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,688
They don't do that because they don't care about reality

718
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,712
Their job is to

719
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,528
To distort reality so it leads people to their predetermined

720
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,296
Conclusion

721
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,856
Cremo probably was smoking a bit of weed

722
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,392
Sure

723
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,416
We all are

724
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,184
I'm not

725
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:47,584
I don't enjoy it no not much but still sometimes like no not really anymore

726
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:53,984
Edibles gummies.

727
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,752
Would be like

728
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:59,872
It's not like you'll be like all I can't believe anybody would do this or I wouldn't take this if I didn't

729
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:03,200
Feel like I sure sure

730
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,480
It's normal

731
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,504
Yeah yeah

732
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,528
But it's not

733
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,600
Eddyville

734
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,648
Because everybody loves

735
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:18,048
Drugs are great you know everybody loves it is interesting how Alex never talks about his speed

736
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,328
He drugged you

737
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,168
Eddie comes back from break and I think you might have had a little visit

738
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:23,936
Dr. toots

739
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,904
Send them up

740
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:53,632
In charge of a goddess

741
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,448
Great

742
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:06,176
Carlton knock out the park last night.

743
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:14,880
Break I'm out of here

744
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,208
Have a little vodka

745
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,744
Is Vibe was weird

746
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,328
Tucker Carlson

747
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,424
Comes back and

748
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:32,544
Clearly trying to build more conspiracy around the island park

749
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,312
Shooting

750
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:36,128
Now he's folding in Uvalde

751
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,408
Intuit as well

752
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,552
Predators

753
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,184
He's antifa

754
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,792
Are some of the postings

755
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,328
Where he did

756
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,608
Home screen

757
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,888
For you

758
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:58,912
Right now

759
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,728
Dehydrated

760
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,008
Supporters

761
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,544
America

762
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,848
Attacks of July 4th parade

763
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,384
Wonder

764
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,040
Uvalde a young druggie from a family

765
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:18,880
What limited means somehow manages to buy about 5,000 spaghetti weapons

766
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,928
Does David King

767
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,792
Family

768
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,072
Exclaims

769
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,888
None of that

770
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,912
Is anything Alex

771
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,704
Establishing any in any way

772
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:38,848
Address as the as of man or woman

773
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,640
This guy's that is definitely

774
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,432
Something that can be done seen

775
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,200
Mission Impossible

776
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:47,808
Yeah but it's also possible that people can be in the performance

777
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,088
And so our people can

778
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,368
I'll be

779
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,136
Yeah France

780
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,672
It's all possible

781
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,464
One does not purr

782
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,816
Preclude the other Alex is acting like there's only one thing I mean I just

783
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,864
It's just so fun

784
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,680
All all in services like

785
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:08,544
You are even pointing out like always there's this

786
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,824
What's going on

787
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,360
Family of limited means

788
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,152
Let's spend money a lot on

789
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,432
It's like

790
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:18,016
Pointing out all the red flags that should be looked

791
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:22,368
It's very simple that the problem isn't the s*** you said

792
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,136
16.

793
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,416
Preamble it's in the predicate

794
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,816
Stuff that he's saying that are sort of distraction are you

795
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,584
From

796
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,608
That

797
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,448
Is just stuff that is based on s*** talk yeah

798
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,472
Like right-wing should talk

799
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,008
Brutal so Alex

800
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:41,056
Skip back to the Guidestones

801
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,104
Some calls

802
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,896
And this is just not

803
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,664
This is not

804
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,432
True

805
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:49,248
Review

806
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,320
The Georgia guide

807
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,088
Headstones

808
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,368
This morning

809
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:58,464
So I don't want to be pedantic and I don't want to be a dick about this quarter

810
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,816
Of them were blown out there were four slabs of them was blown up

811
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:06,912
I don't care about misspeaking but Alex's setup 3rd

812
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,680
A couple times

813
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,472
And this is a problem because

814
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:12,032
This should be something that he's studied

815
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:17,408
He should be very familiar with the Georgia guidestone himself

816
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,432
Adverb

817
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:24,832
When he was going around at the stop the steal stuff you went to Georgia and they went to the Guidestones

818
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,184
He should know that there are for it

819
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,952
If he cares

820
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,720
At all

821
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,488
He does not

822
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,304
At the very least you should know Japanese isn't on any of them

823
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,888
I give my all

824
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:42,752
It's true all symbols that are English symbols

825
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:46,336
Might as well be hieroglyphics whatever

826
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:50,944
Anything that doesn't look like a letter is anything that's not one of the original 20

827
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,992
6 get out of here

828
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,296
So I just find that be a problem

829
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,856
Anyway the colors seem to have

830
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,648
Pretty consensus view on this

831
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,464
Brilliant

832
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,512
Actually a brilliant thing they did

833
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,560
Sent out some texts

834
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:07,584
2

835
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,424
And actually a few of them didn't know what they were

836
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,216
It is bringing

837
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,312
Thinking about

838
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,104
It's raising awareness

839
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,384
So this bombing is

840
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,176
It's good because it raised awareness

841
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,200
You know

842
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:23,968
Do you know what's

843
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:24,992
Interesting

844
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,272
Is

845
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,296
I think

846
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,064
This is

847
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,600
A terrifying thing

848
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,368
To Alex and

849
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,136
The far-right

850
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:34,720
Not because of any kind of like bad

851
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,768
Turbo back or anything like that

852
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,792
But because

853
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:41,376
If people actually start going after the targets

854
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,400
But they often

855
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,424
Sensei are focal

856
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:51,104
If they continue doing it looks long of the UN building or something even more esoteric nonsense

857
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,407
It's whenever it's just the weirdest s*** out in the woods

858
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:56,991
Do you know and they just start blowing up even more obscure s***

859
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,783
And nothing keeps happening

860
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,831
Fright eventually they're going to be like

861
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,647
I guess none of these were that important

862
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:07,743
Spray or you know there is a guy who bombed

863
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:10,815
The Georgia Guidestones

864
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,095
He gets in trouble

865
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:15,167
In the same way you would if you

866
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,447
Blew up

867
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,007
Something else just like a

868
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:22,591
Or whatever

869
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,383
No not some kind of day like

870
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:28,479
He gets the death penalty or it doesn't become some kind of a thing like

871
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:32,319
The awareness of the Patriot community in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bomb

872
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,623
82 not that kind of

873
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,671
Scale no it's just

874
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:37,695
Treated as

875
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,719
The crimes that it is

876
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:43,839
I mean what if it went in Smash

877
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,863
The skull with

878
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,399
Call monitor whatever

879
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:49,727
And it's like this is a demonic thing that they

880
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,263
What did I do

881
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:55,615
I would be out of a second

882
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,151
I don't think that

883
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,687
Picture of me

884
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,783
The point is that's not what that's not a high-level card

885
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,063
Girl stupid

886
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,879
Is my is my overall I mean like

887
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:09,951
From

888
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,231
Be

889
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,303
Motivation to bomb

890
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,351
The Georgia guidestone

891
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,655
And someone showing up with a gun,

892
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,191
Or not really

893
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,727
It's not that big of

894
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,519
A gap it is

895
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:27,359
You know definitely one is a massive threat to Human

896
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,407
Life and safety 100

897
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:32,223
And that is very relevant

898
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,039
I don't really believe that there's that kind of a

899
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:35,807
Discipline

900
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,087
Abang Alex's audio

901
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,879
To show the kind of

902
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,647
Of concern

903
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:42,207
Person who bombed the guidestone

904
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,231
Absolutely

905
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:49,119
And I think that that could have the effect of making people take a lot more seriously

906
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,167
But yeah I think you're right

907
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,447
No it's

908
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:58,847
There are just other things that people are treated like it blew up a thing

909
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:02,175
Going to give you a fine if you go to prison for

910
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:06,015
A year or two years touring up a bomb

911
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,551
You're like yeah yeah

912
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:10,367
It could definitely be like

913
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:14,463
The devil be mad something bigger than like a six-month

914
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,255
Probation

915
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,071
Happy because the brain

916
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,935
Lisa in Florida Lisa what's your view

917
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:33,919
Point of view you don't want people to go getting violent and

918
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,711
I wouldn't want to see that either

919
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,015
So I get what you're saying but

920
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,039
I don't know I think

921
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,831
Because it gets

922
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,111
Talking

923
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,135
Gets people talking

924
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:44,671
Bad news

925
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,439
This is

926
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:48,767
I feel like this is rapidly getting out of Ali

927
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:49,791
Control

928
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:54,399
Well I think this is still within the Serta territory of what his take was

929
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,679
You know like this is

930
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:58,239
This is not something that I would encourage but the

931
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,031
After effects of it maybe

932
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:00,799
Something paws

933
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,455
Raised awareness of

934
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,991
Evil sure sure

935
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,551
And this leads Alex actually have like a little bit

936
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:13,855
This theory is

937
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,183
I know guns will you

938
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,975
So they can't scream it out gun

939
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:23,071
Military police

940
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,471
Nazi swastika

941
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:33,055
Yeah so it's probably local military police

942
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:33,823
Okay

943
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,103
So but I mean

944
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,919
Then is it okay if there's like a

945
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:44,319
Jesus statue in the middle of nowhere like that they put up

946
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,111
I think they would treat that a little bit

947
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,719
I think that actually would be more f***** up

948
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:55,583
Seriously

949
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:01,983
Religion around the Georgia Guidestones

950
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,543
And their imagination that is a holy site

951
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,567
You know

952
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:08,895
So in the my imagination that puts it on par with

953
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:12,735
In Texas there are like Recreations of the

954
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,759
The Easter Island

955
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,319
Yeah and

956
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,111
I'd be hurt

957
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,647
Yeah that would suck

958
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:25,279
But why you blowing up the Easter Island said what if there was some extreme Easter Island races

959
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,095
Or what if there's gold in those hat could be pause

960
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:33,983
You got a crack them open

961
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:37,311
There's candy inside

962
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,407
Monument

963
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,455
Total

964
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:45,247
Proof of what's going on

965
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,807
Amanda

966
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,135
Attention race

967
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:54,463
I'm not sure I tend to agree with you that

968
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,791
Blowing it up is not necessarily apposite

969
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,095
Russell anything else you like that

970
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:02,911
Yeah I just

971
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:05,983
Is my girl products

972
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:06,751
Miracle

973
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:09,055
Is America product take that X2

974
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:13,151
So it's not proof of all of evil plans of the globalist

975
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,455
Or whatever but

976
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,735
Maybe it isn't

977
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,503
The good thing

978
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,527
Fine

979
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:25,439
Things that someone should make a documentary about the Guidestones now and I would say

980
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:30,303
It's too late by the time you're done with that everyone's Eyecare

981
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,631
There should be another documentary made about the door

982
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,935
Go out there and show him and

983
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,751
Agenda behind

984
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:40,287
And promote the living

985
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,127
Most people don't know about

986
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,407
They're going to now

987
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,967
Boy now they do know

988
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:48,735
All about it

989
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,015
It's called

990
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,063
7 million people butt

991
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,599
How hateful is it

992
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:56,415
The bombs have been calling for killing 7 billion people

993
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:59,231
I'm just super racist

994
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,511
White supremacist

995
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,279
What do you think

996
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,839
Absolutely

997
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:07,423
Written all over they should probably aboard another 60 million

998
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,959
Children just to make this

999
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,495
You know what I mean

1000
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,287
Well said

1001
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,567
Very well said

1002
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:15,103
They are just terrible it's Ark

1003
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:18,687
Yeah it always comes at a weird time and you're like

1004
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,223
Why did you even add that

1005
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,503
Yeah

1006
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:25,343
Well it's because you want to minimize the other very racist things

1007
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,367
That job

1008
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:32,255
Happened in your world and you support

1009
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:34,047
It's Jews maybe they just blew up the

1010
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:40,447
The Jewish would what a crazy think we I mean he's really hope that isn't the case eventually

1011
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:44,543
Hope it's not the case eventually

1012
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:48,639
Some very hateful Angela to this that you were pretending

1013
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,919
Isn't the part of it

1014
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,991
We'll see I mean I think until the purge

1015
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:53,759
Person is caught

1016
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:54,527
Until

1017
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:56,575
There's more information it's a really tough

1018
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,343
To tell if

1019
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:01,183
This is just a simple conspiracy riddled mind

1020
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,975
Who takes

1021
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,511
Upon themselves to blow up

1022
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,303
Effigy

1023
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,071
Aviva

1024
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,607
Or if there is

1025
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,399
Some meaning to the

1026
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,423
The fact that it was

1027
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:14,239
But Hebrew what I think they want to do in order to catch

1028
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,519
This guy who's clearly a match

1029
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,567
I think what they're going to need

1030
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,335
To do

1031
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:20,383
Is

1032
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,407
A sting operation

1033
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:25,759
They're going to have to build their own Guidestones in maybe Iowa or something

1034
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:28,575
It'll be too hard for this master criminal to resist

1035
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:32,927
He's going to help make another 40 years

1036
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:34,975
It's worth

1037
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:39,839
Nerve

1038
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:43,167
Right away

1039
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,191
Come on Duke

1040
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:48,799
Amazon

1041
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,335
This show

1042
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:57,759
25 minutes

1043
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:03,135
Wow she has been exposing the statue of War threat of nuclear war

1044
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,607
Everywhere

1045
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:19,519
The Georgia Guidestones

1046
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,055
Georgia

1047
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:25,919
Dog weird to live in this imaginary world where Congress

1048
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,199
A big

1049
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:27,967
Deal

1050
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:34,367
It is such a big deal that you have a congress member on your show and you open the interview asking

1051
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:44,095
I think there is a way actually if you were a sincere interviewer to ask the questions they called me because she

1052
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,215
District in Georgia

1053
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:52,287
Kind of relevant to her

1054
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,567
But it's it she could be

1055
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:56,127
Anywhere still open

1056
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:58,175
Hey that would be could be the

1057
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:03,295
This is a Nutty thing

1058
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:08,159
Introduce each other this is somebody's in Congress

1059
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,439
And this is her take

1060
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:13,535
Boise

1061
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:14,815
Around

1062
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,119
The world a shot heard

1063
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,727
There in Georgia

1064
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,799
Thank you so much for doing something about January 6th

1065
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:28,127
Economy will talk about

1066
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:34,015
What is your take on the Georgia Guidestones getting blown sky-high

1067
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,367
Appreciate about you

1068
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:40,159
As you bring up the issues that a lot of

1069
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,439
Regular normal

1070
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:46,559
What you being sarcastic what just happened there

1071
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,911
Research

1072
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,127
As you know like you

1073
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,407
Completely

1074
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,175
The globalist

1075
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,455
Agenda and again

1076
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,223
Population

1077
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:04,991
Control

1078
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,527
I just heard the news

1079
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,063
Probably about

1080
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:08,831
2 hours

1081
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,111
About about

1082
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:12,671
And I

1083
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:16,767
I think it just shows where we are today

1084
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:23,935
People are done with globalism people are not going to go along with the new world order the liver

1085
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,959
World Order

1086
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:34,687
What does the difference between this is a symbol of the globalist people are sick of the globalist

1087
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:39,551
So yeah you're good blew up this symbol of evil

1088
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,623
F*** man Congress this is nuts

1089
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,391
Yeah

1090
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,439
Yeah like what like what next

1091
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,231
Blow-up blucifer

1092
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:51,583
The outside the temporary Airport

1093
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,375
Let's go let's go

1094
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,399
Dig underneath

1095
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,167
Spaghetti

1096
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,471
That be fine with me honestly

1097
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:00,799
If instead of blowing up the Georgia Guidestones they were like f***

1098
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:07,455
We're going to do it and they just got a s*** ton of machinery and literally dug beneath the Getty and found nothing

1099
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:11,807
That is not going to help

1100
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:15,135
Because the demons that are under the Getty only are like

1101
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,671
Spiritually visible

1102
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:22,303
Is trolls still be there or down there no

1103
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:28,703
Marjorie brings up the 4th

1104
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,471
For July shooting

1105
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:31,263
And she said something really dumb

1106
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:33,567
The July 4th tragedy

1107
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,591
Is heartbreaking

1108
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,871
Imaginalis

1109
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:38,175
It's that there was an entire month of Friday

1110
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,199
Braids

1111
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:42,527
And festivals and drag queen story time

1112
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,807
Christian nationalist

1113
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,855
Shooting

1114
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:46,879
Braids

1115
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:50,975
The 4th with her hashtag

1116
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:54,559
And in terrible language against our Independence Day on July 4th

1117
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:58,911
Is Margaery pretending not to know about the 31 Patriot front members who arrested

1118
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:01,983
Sit in the U-Haul truck heading to riot at a pride event in Idaho

1119
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:06,335
It wasn't in the US but in Oslo two were killed in 10 injured in the attack on

1120
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,103
Lgbtq

1121
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:07,871
Tiki Bar

1122
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:09,919
Just before the pride parade was set

1123
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:10,687
The begin

1124
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:16,831
Is Margaery pretended not to know about these suspicious pattern of drag queen story time events that have been targeted by groups like

1125
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:17,599
Proud boys

1126
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,623
Disrupted with

1127
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:19,647
Violence and

1128
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:24,511
Threats and specifically events that have been posted about and promoted by the lives of Tik-Tok account

1129
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:28,607
Or how in Baltimore two separate homes were the target of fire attack

1130
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:30,399
Because of their pride decorations

1131
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,935
One of them having their pride Flags

1132
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,215
Specifically burned

1133
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:33,983
Or what about the

1134
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:38,079
Bi-State violent over 250 anti-lgbtq bills

1135
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:41,151
Being introduced by state legislatures at least 24

1136
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,943
Which have already passed

1137
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,991
Marjorie can come off it with this

1138
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:49,599
S*** he's just making a ton of assumptions about the Highland Park shooter in his motivation

1139
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:53,183
Hyatt order to make herself more of a victim in everything

1140
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,767
Match he's pretending that he coordinated an escalating

1141
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,047
Intimidation and violence

1142
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,327
Directed towards

1143
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,607
Just didn't happen

1144
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,655
Also do not forget

1145
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:04,447
This is a member of Congress

1146
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:10,847
Who just said maybe the bombing of the Georgia Guidestones as part of a war between Good and Evil

1147
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:12,383
Picture of the Highland Park shooter

1148
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:14,687
In order to push her auntie medication agenda

1149
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,991
She's a piece of s*** who should not be taken

1150
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:17,759
Seriously

1151
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:18,783
On any level

1152
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,063
Any level

1153
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:20,831
Well said

1154
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:21,855
Thank you

1155
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:25,695
Much like that color for curly hair

1156
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:28,255
Exactly like that, she can f*** off

1157
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:30,047
Anyway she has some demands

1158
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,351
About the Highland Park shooter

1159
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,887
Robert Kramer

1160
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:40,031
And this guy

1161
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,591
And I started demanding it immediately

1162
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:43,871
Release

1163
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,407
He doesn't get a ride

1164
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:47,711
We should know

1165
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,991
Exactly everything

1166
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,295
His arrest record

1167
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,599
Hospitalization records we should know

1168
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:56,159
What drugs he was on recreational drug

1169
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,183
We should also know what

1170
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:57,951
Prescription

1171
00:55:59,231 --> 00:55:59,999
Ssris

1172
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,279
You can see the sky

1173
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:02,815
Clearly messed up

1174
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:05,119
You see these are the rule of law people

1175
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:10,495
Super concerned about people respecting a lot also a very serious concerns about privacy

1176
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:15,103
That's why Marjorie doesn't seem to care about determining they Primo is

1177
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,895
Guilty before he's been tried

1178
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:19,711
He treated as if he were guilty

1179
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:20,735
Before being proven

1180
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:21,503
Incel

1181
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:26,623
He's guilty before trial to her because she believes that there's some utility for her in Act

1182
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:27,391
Sing that way

1183
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:31,743
She doesn't give a s*** about the fundamental rules that our country operates on this is all just a

1184
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:32,511
VR games

1185
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,279
To her

1186
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:35,583
I let me explain the game that she's playing here

1187
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:39,167
MTG knows that these records aren't going to be released

1188
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:41,983
Or at least there's a very low chance that they will be immediately

1189
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,775
So she's setting herself up to

1190
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:44,799
To score points

1191
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:48,127
Pretending that this means that these records are being covered up

1192
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:52,991
He's talking s*** about something that she knows is a non-starter because it allows her to

1193
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:56,063
Do basically nothing and act like she's some kind of intrepid

1194
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,087
Truth-seeker

1195
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,927
The second reason she's doing this and it's just in this needs to happen now

1196
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,207
Is because she

1197
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:04,767
Keenly aware that our audience has a not exist

1198
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:05,791
Send a tension span

1199
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,351
As the investigation progresses and

1200
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:10,399
Gets the point where cremo goes on trial

1201
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:15,007
A lot of that information that she's after will be readily available but by that point

1202
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,287
Her followers won't

1203
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,055
Care at all

1204
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:23,711
Not even a little bit of moved on to being mad about some other thing that she's pretending to be on a crusade about so that

1205
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:26,527
Station at that point is of essentially note

1206
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,295
Used to her

1207
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:32,927
She needs to make as big a deal about this as possible now because she won't be able to use it for anything later

1208
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:39,583
If she G stands about this idea that he must have been on psych meds now she's after which is

1209
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,863
Is the demonised med

1210
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:43,935
And it won't even matter if she's right or not that

1211
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,215
Cremo was on meds

1212
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:51,871
Even If eventually it does come out that he wasn't on any it's still won't matter because all her audience will remember

1213
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:56,991
Is that she made a big deal of how suspicious it was that you wasn't being given access

1214
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,783
To all of his personal information

1215
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,063
This is

1216
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:05,183
Trick and people who play games like this they can't be trusted to be in positions of public influence

1217
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:10,047
Also let us not forget that her underlying premise is also incorrect

1218
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:12,863
I thought there was no causal connection that they can demonstrate

1219
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:13,631
Gene psych meds

1220
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:14,911
And carrying out shooting

1221
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:16,703
In fact

1222
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:21,055
A prospective study published in the journal of clinical psychopharmacology

1223
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:24,383
In July 2021 sought to look at the connection but

1224
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,663
Psychiatric illness

1225
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:26,943
And my shooters

1226
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:30,015
They looked at 35 Mass Shooters selected

1227
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:31,039
Because they were the ones

1228
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:33,855
In this database of 115 Mass shooters

1229
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:36,159
Between 1982 and 2012

1230
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,183
Who had survived

1231
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:42,559
After their she has much more of like availability of information about

1232
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:44,863
A nation was

1233
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,911
Between 1982 and 2012

1234
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:50,239
People who had killed four more people with firearm

1235
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:54,591
They found the 28 out of 35 had psychiatric diagnosis

1236
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,127
Forehead non

1237
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,407
Have three there wasn't enough

1238
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,431
Information to tell

1239
00:58:59,199 --> 00:58:59,967
From the results

1240
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:00,991
Their analysis

1241
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,039
None of those diagnosed

1242
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:05,087
The psychiatric illnesses were treated with my

1243
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,135
This talking point

1244
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,927
Marjorie have is b*******

1245
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,975
And it causes harm to people who need

1246
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:12,255
Mental health care

1247
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,535
Makes people

1248
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:14,815
More reluctant

1249
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:15,583
To seek

1250
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,607
Treatment

1251
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,399
And get the

1252
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:21,471
Help that they need quite frankly

1253
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,239
Monstrous

1254
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:24,799
She should be very same for selfies doing actual

1255
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:25,823
No there's

1256
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:26,591
There's

1257
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:28,895
I mean there's really only to like

1258
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:31,967
She makes a lot of money doing nothing

1259
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:33,247
With a lot of stuff

1260
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:36,063
Well yeah but

1261
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,087
Just just

1262
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,623
Taking a lot of steps

1263
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,647
To do nothing

1264
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:41,695
And then it's just

1265
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,463
A f******

1266
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:44,511
It's a celebrity trolling

1267
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,815
Demonizing psych medication

1268
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:49,119
And doing everything to protect guns

1269
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,679
You are why mass shootings happen

1270
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:55,775
I mean it's the exact same thing with like the you know we talked about

1271
00:59:56,031 --> 01:00:01,919
I think was on our last episode with the unfortunate and tragic case of the migrants who would match

1272
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:04,223
Policies that Alex seeks to

1273
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:08,831
Put in place make incidents like that more likely to happen inevitable

1274
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:13,183
The policies that Marjorie seeks to put in place

1275
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:16,767
As it relates to psych medication would make people

1276
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:18,559
More likely to not get

1277
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,863
The kind of treatment that they need and make

1278
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:23,167
The possibility of

1279
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:28,799
The violence whether self-directed or outwardly directed more likely to happen.

1280
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:29,567
It's f***** up

1281
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:33,151
Yep she's just talkingshit it's just somebody who's kind

1282
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:33,919
Patrolling with the

1283
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:34,943
The troll damage

1284
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,223
Serious

1285
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:37,247
Congress

1286
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,271
Yeah

1287
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,551
Yeah I mean

1288
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,343
You can't

1289
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,623
Reasonably not know

1290
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,415
This information by

1291
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,719
You can I think it's unlikely

1292
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:47,743
And I think

1293
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,023
The studies and stuff

1294
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:52,863
The information that she would be having to be relying on our things like

1295
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,143
Stuff produced by the church

1296
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:54,911
Church of Scientology

1297
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,191
Glow like

1298
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,983
Yeah you have to understand

1299
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:00,287
At the foundation you're standing on his flimsy

1300
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,311
And that means

1301
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,079
What's that

1302
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,103
You know

1303
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,639
Don't give up

1304
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:06,175
I think that it

1305
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:08,735
I was mentioning earlier

1306
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,783
They have a conclusion that

1307
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:16,159
Seeking support as opposed to looking at information and letting that lead to a conclusion

1308
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,951
It's me it's backwards

1309
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:20,767
Well I mean

1310
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:23,327
The problem I feel is that they

1311
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:26,399
He's done the truth-seeking and now they're deliberately lying to

1312
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,703
I think that is Jen

1313
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:32,799
Generous of you to assume they went through that much of a process

1314
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,847
So Marjorie sucks

1315
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:37,663
And and we know Alex

1316
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:39,199
We know that it has led

1317
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:42,015
Nearly 100%

1318
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:43,551
Beastmaster shooters

1319
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:50,975
And they may be a combination with recreational drugs

1320
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:54,815
Other serious issues

1321
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:57,631
But also know obviously

1322
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:59,167
It would not be

1323
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:02,239
The full story to say that everything is

1324
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,775
Perfectly fine with

1325
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:05,823
With the state of medication

1326
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:10,687
Obviously there are

1327
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,711
People who

1328
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:13,759
Should have access to medication who do not

1329
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:17,855
Whether it's Financial reason Insurance reason

1330
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,135
There is that

1331
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:21,951
There is overmedication in some sectors

1332
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:23,487
In some meds

1333
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:25,279
The Profit motives

1334
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:30,655
There can be a little bit of searching for help with your bariatric

1335
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:34,495
I think there's a widespread awareness but maybe there could be more

1336
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,775
Have the dangers of

1337
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:38,335
Falling off medication and abrupt

1338
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,615
Police stopping taking it

1339
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:41,407
These things are real

1340
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:44,479
But they're being some of it is being hijacked

1341
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:50,111
Yeah no stopping your medication rupley is more dangerous than not

1342
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,135
Taking medication

1343
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:53,183
Probably

1344
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:57,023
I don't have to quantify

1345
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:59,071
Cuz you kind of have to like

1346
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:04,191
I can't counterfactual I mean a situation is very dangerous

1347
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:06,495
It should not be done outside supervision

1348
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:08,543
We are

1349
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,615
There are there are legitimate things but these aren't conversation

1350
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,663
Cuz they're having

1351
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:14,687
They're having

1352
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:17,503
We're willing to watch

1353
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:18,783
People die

1354
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:22,879
Borderline everyday just because we get our

1355
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:30,559
So I think Alex has realize that when he trolls everybody talking about how Marjorie

1356
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,327
You should be present

1357
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,119
Gets a lot of attention out of

1358
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:36,191
Course I'm so he continues on that game

1359
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,983
You're really the example of what they

1360
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,079
Everybody sees that

1361
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,015
Trump DeSantis

1362
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:59,231
In the system

1363
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:01,535
I think you would be told better

1364
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,095
And be a better candidate for president

1365
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:09,215
Would you take a VP slot with either one of them or

1366
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:20,223
You're just a smarter smarter than both of them

1367
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,319
I do believe that's true

1368
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,855
MTG president here

1369
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:28,159
I honestly don't think that she would pull

1370
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,951
Well at all no

1371
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:34,047
She wouldn't be in Congress if she wasn't dead Republican

1372
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:34,815
Plus

1373
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,375
Yeah honey whatever I District

1374
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:41,215
Opposed

1375
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:42,751
Tigris Atlanta have

1376
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,287
I just like crazy and

1377
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,311
Incumbency

1378
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:46,591
I advantage

1379
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,359
Which is

1380
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:53,759
Crazy by the grace of God let's say in Congress

1381
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,551
I don't think that you would run well

1382
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:57,855
And the moment

1383
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:59,391
People started listening to her talk

1384
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,975
Oh man

1385
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:09,119
Made a lot of assumptions about Trump

1386
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:10,655
Bing

1387
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:12,959
Some people like people who talks

1388
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:19,615
Oh no they do they love people dancing we underestimate that a little bit and that you would have a lot of mileage in that

1389
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:20,895
Sure but I mean even Trump

1390
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,175
Didn't say like

1391
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:26,783
You know the Georgia Guidestones it's okay if you blow them up because their source of evil

1392
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:30,879
She said that sort of diplomatically

1393
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:31,647
That's what you said

1394
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,743
MTG

1395
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:37,535
President baby I love his

1396
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:43,935
F****** brown-nosing for no reason other than just to do it like she'll talk to him

1397
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,983
You should be present cuz she'll talk to him

1398
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,263
He's totally being serious

1399
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:49,567
Do you want me to back her right now

1400
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:50,335
That's what he wants to

1401
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:54,687
I just say we LeapFrog the whole time

1402
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,415
We can't really do that but

1403
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:11,327
Speculating

1404
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:15,935
About that but you know people

1405
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:20,799
Like both of them for a lot of games

1406
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:29,759
Juno

1407
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:34,367
And he should run for

1408
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,671
For president

1409
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:37,951
Yeah Alex

1410
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:44,607
I get that you had yourself a little bit with the Strategic flexibility

1411
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:48,191
What about you had a global exclusive

1412
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:53,055
Yeah you don't have a global exclusive on a maybe he will maybe he won't

1413
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:58,687
You are claiming that he will it's a lot easier to play this game after the fact when it does now

1414
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:05,087
Congratulations on being wishy-washy

1415
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,879
I feel like that's just lazy

1416
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,415
Yep

1417
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:11,487
So marjorie's out

1418
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:14,047
Off on her way to run for president

1419
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:18,143
No doubt and Alex has a weird sales pitch

1420
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:21,471
Show me project

1421
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:25,311
So busy.

1422
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,591
Order for project

1423
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:29,663
Hoverboard at Roosevelt month behind

1424
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:33,503
I have spent

1425
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:37,343
Literally 56 hours a day just trying to get the

1426
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:40,671
I just noticed

1427
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,487
But man

1428
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:44,255

1429
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:45,535
Just get the product

1430
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:52,959
We have delivered so much we have done so much together this is the Tempest. We're so close

1431
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:54,495
What you need the products we've got

1432
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,615
What I can do

1433
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,383
Broadway

1434
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,663
I can get out of here

1435
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:04,479
About plugging

1436
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:06,271
I didn't worry about trying to unmask

1437
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,599
Tour I am out of

1438
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:13,695
Important point

1439
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:18,047
Put your phone in there

1440
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:21,887
You cannot piss in their face better than spread the word about Infowars

1441
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:31,103
Infowarsstore.com School the big July 4th special running right now for a few more days at the 75% off.

1442
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,127
Low cost

1443
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:34,687
It's really it's really interesting cuz I think that

1444
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,735
There may be some truth

1445
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:39,039
To that there is no better way to piss in

1446
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:41,599
In the face of the globalist then promote Alex's because

1447
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:44,159
They only exist as the

1448
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:49,023
Cobra to Alex and whatever you know

1449
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,583
Batman imaginary bad guys the rise up against

1450
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:54,911
So yeah the only way to stick it to them is to

1451
01:08:55,167 --> 01:09:00,543
Funded the imaginary opposition to the like no matter what I do

1452
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,591
I will never be able to stick it

1453
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,127
To the Captain Planet villain

1454
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:04,895
No

1455
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:05,919
Unless

1456
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:12,575
I lost the site

1457
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:17,183
Captain Planet kind of like an augmented reality game

1458
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:20,511
Microtransactions but there you're buying Alex

1459
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:22,047
Cuz pills

1460
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:25,119
Yeah I imagine it's the same kind of psychological a dick

1461
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,143
Shinto

1462
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:27,423
Terrible

1463
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:31,519
Yep wow I don't think there's a lot of irons in the fire either

1464
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:35,103
No I think he's got a lot of irons that are getting burnt

1465
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:39,711
I could do with so much money I love this notion

1466
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,991
Into this like

1467
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:43,551
Back in the day I didn't have to worry about plugging

1468
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:47,647
Really you certainly still do it a lot back then

1469
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:49,183
Back in the day

1470
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:52,767
But you didn't have to worry about plugging your worrying about it you're just doing it for fun

1471
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,303
Cuz you're doing it a lot still

1472
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,583
Stopping time

1473
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,607
We have gone back

1474
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:57,375
All the way

1475
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:59,679
Y2K my friend

1476
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,263
Scatter Marjorie leaves

1477
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:05,311
And

1478
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,079
Thought

1479
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:09,407
Biggest thing is the Bringers of death

1480
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:14,783
Jeff are allowing China China and Russia

1481
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:16,831
And Iran are going to hold

1482
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,367
Military drills

1483
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,903
Down in South America

1484
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:22,719
Make sense

1485
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:28,095
You can allow them

1486
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:29,887
One of these days here

1487
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:36,031
Absolutely

1488
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:39,359
Look like we are in the middle of it

1489
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:42,175
This is communism

1490
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,735
It's the worst communism I've ever seen

1491
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,271
Really

1492
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,295
Look up anything like

1493
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:50,367
Why communism

1494
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:51,903
Late-stage capitalism

1495
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:54,719
I also thought that

1496
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:57,791
Chinese land invasion was supposed to have already happen

1497
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,071
Based on Mike Adams

1498
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,095
Fiction

1499
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:01,631
IAAI

1500
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:04,703
I'm really struggling to understand

1501
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:06,751
What do these people believe

1502
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:07,775
Will happen

1503
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:11,359
If Biden allows China to attack us

1504
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:12,383
Like

1505
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,407
Okay fine

1506
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:16,479
You believe Biden will allow China to attack

1507
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:19,295
What is that look like military

1508
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:27,487
Are you really trying to tell me there's going to be a land War in the United States with China

1509
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:30,047
There's going to be a Normandy Beach

1510
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:34,143
Well I just going to be at South Carolina

1511
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:35,935
Quit wrong OSHA

1512
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:39,263
Stacy managed to Jamaican

1513
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:43,103
Through Point Beach on Normandy because they didn't have

1514
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:49,503
F****** drone Automated machine guns and also bombs that could be flown from anywhere

1515
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:51,295
I think this is unlikely but

1516
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,575
Again it's a caller talking

1517
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:53,343
That is true

1518
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:55,647
So here we are

1519
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:57,183
So you get back to the Guidestones

1520
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:59,999
Caller actually has a really

1521
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:01,279
Good point

1522
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,839
The Alex realizes a good point

1523
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:06,143
In the middle of this collar bring it up

1524
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:06,911
And it should have been

1525
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:08,959
Something that Alex thought about already

1526
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:10,495
My view about the guides

1527
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:13,055
Opposed

1528
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:15,103
So what was chiseled into those Stone

1529
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:18,687
But we all have a right to say anything we want

1530
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:31,231
Call no no no no no

1531
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:37,631
Just for saying s*** dammit

1532
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:41,727
Constitution is toilet paper to me remember

1533
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,263
Does constitutional

1534
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:49,663
Afforded to every citizen should be waived entirely just because I'm willing to say that

1535
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:55,807
One person obviously it will never be turned around and used on me. Here's the good news

1536
01:12:58,623 --> 01:12:59,135
But

1537
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:03,999
Realizes that this is a dangerous point for him

1538
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:06,559
Because he's this free speech Warrior absolutist

1539
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:09,119
Course but this color doesn't know what he's talking about

1540
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:12,447
So we have a right to say on privately-owned stones on it

1541
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,727
Privately-owned land

1542
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:15,775
Property rights

1543
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:17,055
And Amendment

1544
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,079
What's the First Amendment

1545
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:19,103
Protect

1546
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:22,943
All American to go onto private property and destroyed

1547
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,503
Privately

1548
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:26,783
I agree with you

1549
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:30,623
Take a note

1550
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:32,671
Guidestones worked on private property

1551
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:37,279
RC Christian gave it to Elbert County so that isn't private property sent its cover

1552
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:38,047
Owned

1553
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:42,143
It's very all that would have been needed to take down the Guidestones would have been

1554
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,679
The County Commissioners getting

1555
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:44,447
Petition

1556
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:46,751
And following some legal channels to get them removed

1557
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:53,407
That never happened because they were helpful in terms of bringing visitors to the area which help local businesses

1558
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:55,199
Care enough to try to get them removed

1559
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:59,551
It's interesting that these people don't really understand Free Speech Dynamics

1560
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:01,087
Either side of the coin

1561
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,623
This absolutely

1562
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:05,695
Could have been speech that would be subject to censorship

1563
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:06,463
Because why

1564
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,047
Because only lunatics think that it's some kind of an evil satanic

1565
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,607
That's why someone had to blow them up

1566
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:15,167
Because they couldn't get their way through the appropriate channels

1567
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:17,215
That's really what happened

1568
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:19,519
Again

1569
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:20,287
Again

1570
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,055
You can't

1571
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,335
Just f******

1572
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:27,199
Comptroller your way to defeating evil

1573
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:31,551
Okay if you could just be like hey okay we've got 15 votes so

1574
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:34,623
Evils taken away then it's not really that evil

1575
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:35,647
Right

1576
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:39,231
I mean like this this this is something that if it was

1577
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:41,279
A problem for the local community

1578
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:44,095
Any of any point

1579
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:46,655
Who's actually good for

1580
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,959
And in the ultimately yeah

1581
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:52,799
I think they should leave the rubble Epix

1582
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:56,639
Because that's going to up the tourism even more honestly they should just

1583
01:14:57,407 --> 01:15:03,295
I don't know rebuild them but like imbue them with magic or something they can have a

1584
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:06,111
The new conspiracy theory bombing

1585
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:08,927
By the globalist cuz they forgot to imbue that purr

1586
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:11,999
Particular tablet

1587
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:14,559
They blew that one up and then they

1588
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:15,327
Took it all.

1589
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:17,887
Demolish the whole thing

1590
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:18,655
But

1591
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:19,935
The bomb itself

1592
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:21,727
I took out that one naturally

1593
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,007
So you're the dumb caller

1594
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:26,335
I want to talk about how the human race saved life on

1595
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,615
Planet from

1596
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:28,895
Tropic CO2

1597
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:29,663
Depletion

1598
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:30,687
All right cuz

1599
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:35,807
Planet

1600
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:39,391
And literally

1601
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:42,463
The old fossil fuel

1602
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,231
What's fun

1603
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:46,047
Man can't we all just be like

1604
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,071
Okay

1605
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:48,863
Whatever you believe about climate change

1606
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:51,679
We just got to let oil execs not be

1607
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:52,447
Be there anymore

1608
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:55,263
You know like they they're your ideas

1609
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:57,311
Lying there f****** Paco

1610
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:58,591
With billions of dollars

1611
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:00,895
Whatever you believe that's fine

1612
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:02,687
Look at the billions away

1613
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:05,759
From them no no no and then we can put it towards

1614
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:09,343
Anything you want that is not America take it away from them

1615
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:14,207
Blowing up something in a private lawn

1616
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:17,791
Anyway here and

1617
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:19,839
This is really kind of

1618
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:23,423
Exactly what we've been talking about is the

1619
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,703
Sort of danger

1620
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:25,727
Of

1621
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:28,031
The blowing up of the guidestone

1622
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,311
And

1623
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,335
Also

1624
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,127
Wouldn't

1625
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:32,895
Really

1626
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:33,919
Change anything

1627
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:43,903
I think the only thing that could make me

1628
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,439
Satyr would be a

1629
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:46,207
Somebody

1630
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,767
Somehow gets into the Grove and take some moloch

1631
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:50,047
Before the average treat this

1632
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:51,071
It's July

1633
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:53,887
We went for no violence but it's

1634
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:56,703
Terrible idea

1635
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:59,007
I know how I really

1636
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:00,543
That would really

1637
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,335
Today

1638
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:04,127
I am I pretty

1639
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:08,735
Joking around

1640
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:11,807
Hey guess what is private property

1641
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:15,903
I was bringing up

1642
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:19,999
I mean this is the kind of conversation that is inevitable

1643
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,279
To be had in these

1644
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,815
Groups

1645
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,607
And that is like oh yeah let's

1646
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:25,631
Take down more

1647
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:30,495
Like I said the thing that I eat is worrying is

1648
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:32,287
It will not

1649
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,567
Have the discipline

1650
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:36,383
Generally not hurting other

1651
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:38,175
People

1652
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,455
This is LARP

1653
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:42,527
Except larpers know their LARPing so they don't

1654
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:45,599
Actually shoot Fireballs at each other with like

1655
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:46,367
Flamethrower

1656
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:48,927
You're having a good time

1657
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:50,975
Haha

1658
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:51,999
This doesn't

1659
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,791
Fireball

1660
01:17:54,047 --> 01:18:00,191
No real reason to know the dangers of this stop with EPP

1661
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:05,055
One person who he inspired to show up at Bohemian Grove heavily-armed

1662
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:08,127
Like him he should know the danger

1663
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:11,967
Yep and that's why I would have

1664
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:14,527
Preferred if there was a more full throated

1665
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:16,575
Condemnation of his bombing

1666
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:19,647
Not some kind of I respect you

1667
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:22,463
Standby I mean that's crazy

1668
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:25,023
This is dangerous it's

1669
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:27,071
I've been a little bit

1670
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:29,119
Flipping you know because I don't care about

1671
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:32,959
Georgia Guidestones

1672
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:37,567
Yeah but at the end of the day I do worry that the way this was handled

1673
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:41,151
By someone like Alex is only going to lead to more

1674
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:42,175
Potential

1675
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:44,735
So far the world has not

1676
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:45,759
Art stores

1677
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:46,783
DF

1678
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:52,159
So whatever you see something that makes her go but also has a bomb

1679
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:57,279
That means that there's going to be something probably later that makes you go Ohno

1680
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:59,327
Yeah

1681
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,863
I hope every night

1682
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:01,631
No problem

1683
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:03,935
I'm scared of Bob

1684
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:04,959
They're not dead

1685
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:05,983
I just

1686
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:09,055
You know I just don't understand why you would hold and explode

1687
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:12,383
Real real explosive

1688
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:18,015
The carved faces on Saturday of the mountain to make presidents

1689
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:23,903
Explosives that is

1690
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:27,487
Is it true you are not wrong what if you're trying to cross grape

1691
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:32,095
Lots of space in the short amount of time you can blow up nuclear bomb

1692
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,631
Bomb

1693
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:34,399
Just fun

1694
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:36,447
Yeah those are Fun Time Explosion

1695
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,471
Fair enough

1696
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:40,799
Will you come to the end of this and

1697
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:42,079
Guidestones are gone

1698
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:43,103
And Alex's

1699
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:44,127
Is this A happy and

1700
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:46,943
Marjorie Taylor Greene sucks

1701
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:50,271
Let me tell you how little I've paid attention to the Guidestones

1702
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:52,575
I genuinely thought they were like well I mean

1703
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:53,599
Still got three

1704
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,647
And they just left them up I think that

1705
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:57,183
If I recall

1706
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:58,463
You didn't know about them

1707
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,487
Before the show

1708
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:01,791
You learned about them on one of our Epic

1709
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:07,423
Today like I thought that when the guy blue on them up they were like well wishes

1710
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,983
Clean that one up and

1711
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:13,311
Decided it was too much of a structural Danger

1712
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:16,384
Absolutely

1713
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:17,664
It's not really

1714
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:19,456
Front and center of anyone

1715
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:26,112
Midas maybe the Elbert County tourism people

1716
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:28,416
He's going to have to go for the wrist

1717
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:33,280
Yeah you got to pick up the spare

1718
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:35,328
No way

1719
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:44,544
See how this resolves though like when they catch the guy

1720
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,312
Or gal

1721
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:46,080
A person

1722
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:48,128
What their motivation was

1723
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:49,664
What kind of

1724
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,200
I hate Stone

1725
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:55,296
Yeah it's Rodger Stone it is a stone it's a

1726
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,344
Yep yep

1727
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:00,672
Yeah we'll be back on Monday Jordan

1728
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:01,952
But

1729
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:08,352
Creamy summer is going along again for their generosity

1730
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,632
Support of the cause

1731
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:16,288
Ice cream updates on there of course there will be more I don't want to speak

1732
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,056
Specifically yet

1733
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:18,592
But they're exciting things

1734
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:19,616
On the horizon

1735
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:24,224
There are irons in the fire that aren't I

1736
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:28,320
Oh no but thank you all

1737
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:30,112
