1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,328
Hey guys this is Jordan

2
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:08,704
I'm glad that Dan is holding down the fort while I'm not there

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,752

00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:13,056
Over here and London

5
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:16,896
And they do not know who Alex Jones is

6
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:19,456
And so we are all living a better life

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,528

00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:28,160

Here is in London he's on a work keishin

11
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:43,520
As the Alex Jones

12
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,336
Very funny man I think I called you

00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,872
And informed

14
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:52,736
Over over text messages earlier today

15
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,016
Hello that you were having

16
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:59,392
Comedian extraordinaire Storyteller fungi

00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:01,952
I want to I want to welcome you in

18
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,744
Two occupied Illinois

Behind Enemy Lines

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,984
Much like Jordan know almost nothing about Alex Jones

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,520
His existence

22
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:22,176
And that there is now a podcast about him

23
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,480
Podcast about her but only one by one of your friends

24
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,624
That's true

25
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,648
That's what I understand

26
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,488
You know what other

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,512
People

28
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,536
Chicago

29
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,864
So he's either rail

30
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,144
He definitely is

31
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,704
Over the course of the last

32
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,008
Two weeks or so

33
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,544
We've experienced

34
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,336
Do a lot of

35
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,128
Special Report

36
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,456
Weave weave

37
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,528
We did that for one episode

38
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,832
We covered his wife 2K episode

39
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,160
Why do you not get radiation just happened now finally

40
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,464
He's back in studio and everything

41
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,232
When is

42
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,304
Back to perfectly normal crazy

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,584
Awesome s***

44
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,864
A lot to talk about

45
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,144
Because even

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,912
The normal

47
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,448
Reporting some

48
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,728
Insane

49
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,520
His reaction

50
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,360
He's got to go one step further than everybody else

51
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,432
What's the Baseline becomes nut

52
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:32,832
You've got to go super not covering

53
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,880
Federal do is one day in the life of Alex

54
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,904
But because

55
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
You know

56
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,744
Davis Kind of Blue

57
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:44,096
This is a January 23rd and 24th

58
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,912
Eclipse will come from those two episodes

59
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,472
You know this is after the inauguration

60
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,776
This is after the women's March

61
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:55,360
We are at this point if not heard what Alex thinks about the women's May

62
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,200
If you have any predictions

63
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,648
Actually you know what

64
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,720
This

65
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:16,864
I appreciate that Alex give the globalist

66
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,704
We'll explore that throughout the course of his entire show

67
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:29,408
Vista it's this idea that there's a bunch of really rich people behind the scenes were trying to turn the world into a one

68
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,432
One World Government

69
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:34,528
It's New World Order s*** Illuminati's hits all buckled up within that

70
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,064
But it have to do with

71
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,392
Yo using um

72
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:45,024
Make a world government and then everybody's slaves across the entire Prison Planet

73
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:55,520
The new Hunger Games

74
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,056
Ritek

75
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,080
He can't

76
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,384
As you'll see by his use of diction

77
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,176
You could not sit down and read Cohan

78
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,552
Thoughts about what to experience

79
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:18,559
But it with an open heart open mocking much like you with this podcast

80
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,607
So here is a his first thoughts

81
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,191
Play the gentleman I want

82
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,407
Also he has bizarre intro music

83
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,687
Bold choices

84
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,503
Woody's coming in and out of commercials it's insanity

85
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,295
So that's

86
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,831
The James Bond style

87
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,695
We've got a

88
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:51,839
Demoralized washed servile

89
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,887
Worshippers

90
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:01,567
Just live such bizarre domesticated week live

91
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:06,687
Alive

92
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,855
Basically

93
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:35,615
I was looking at look like

94
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,663
Young-old you name it

95
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:44,575
During the Trump inauguration

96
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,647
Weird wimpy dies

97
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:00,959
We know exactly what's going on here people don't want to talk to him

98
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:13,759
Twist whatever I say

99
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,599
We know what this guy's up to

100
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:21,439
Can you believe he's left his apartment it's like what you see the campus preacher

101
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,719
College

102
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,279
College proselytizer

103
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,351
Brothers

104
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:35,007
Brother

105
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:39,871
No good is going to come up getting involved here

106
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,407
Experience something else

107
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,967
There is also a huge lie

108
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:50,367
Women

109
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:07,263
Trump supporters

110
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,615
People

111
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,087
What is Portuguese

112
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,463
Ahead

113
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,215
They think they're really cool

114
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:44,127
So Alex is really worked up about race

115
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:53,855
Stewart takeaways from

116
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,375
They don't want

117
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,079
Trump

118
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,871
But you said they were at the inauguration

119
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
Yeah but there's like protest

120
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,759
And stuff like that

121
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:26,623
Outside is narrative

122
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
People

123
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:31,999
In general I'm not making linear

124
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,583
At all

125
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,215
Are scared of Alex

126
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:44,543
Leader of the pack

127
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:49,407
Flexible

128
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,759
I want to f****** but who is to dangerous

129
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,831
There were only attractive women at the end

130
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:02,207
Inauguration protest marches

131
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:02,975
They're all

132
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
Fat

133
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,767
Ugly

134
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:14,751
I don't know I saw a lot of pictures of the marches I wasn't able to make it out to the one in Chicago over the weekend

135
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,823
Vibrant happy people

136
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,151
Yes very energetic

137
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:26,015
Play all look like George Soros

138
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,087
Actually was paying them they were that happy

139
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:33,951
It was crazy and take away from that like people who have debt

140
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,023
That racial part

141
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,047
Is

142
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,095
Gorgeous

143
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:57,759
It's better if it's kind of a rhetorical strategy in a lot of people do it

144
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,319
Kind of accidentally say something f***** up

145
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,855
You better go harder at

146
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,159
Aroused

147
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,207
Right

148
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:11,583
I think Alex does that to process

149
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,167
My sergeant

150
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:21,567
Is that why would I say that

151
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:25,151
Bad about him in the negative about me

152
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:29,247
But then the opposite of that is when he's like I'm not saying nothing about women wanted to f****** to brag

153
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,551
So here's what you should know

154
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,623
On the last episode covering his response

155
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,647
The inauguration

156
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:39,999
He posted one clip where he interviewed and Incredibly well-dressed black guy

157
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,047
And I'm sure that's who he's talking

158
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:47,935
I think that is because of how he starts this next clip

159
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,495
He references the other person

160
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,031
He talked to in that clip

161
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,823
Okay so I am certain

162
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
You really only talk

163
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,383
Do those two people

164
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,039
The most eloquent smart

165
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,087
Refocus people I've ever seen

166
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,791
Hillary supporters

167
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:24,031
They were lost puppy should totally freaked out

168
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,687
Control

169
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:41,695
Out of their minds

170
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
So

171
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:50,143
We can take from that is the Indian do than talk to you in that other clip

172
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,495
He references the same

173
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,031
It's insane like his references

174
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,591
Are the specific only people to talk to

175
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,895
Generalize it as a big crowd

176
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:07,551
Right of like all the Indians that were there

177
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,415
He talked

178
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,487
Hillary supporters

179
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:21,887
Who used to be fans of his ex.

180
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,447
It's the same thing with the woman wanting to f*** him thing

181
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,847
You don't either was nobody who was like I want to like you but your races now I used to love

182
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:40,831
So again these deranged white people are leaving dumb black people into dangerous

183
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,903
It's this it's that same like real

184
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,583
Pointing finger harder at wife

185
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,399
People he doesn't realize really what he say

186
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,471
Write down some

187
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,543
I took a note it says whacked-out does not equal

188
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
Refused

189
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,895
Will get there on drugs probably

190
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,759
The wife's not white people

191
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,039
Liberal drug use

192
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:18,719
Using lsd-like coffee generate in whatever way

193
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,047
You know that can be like a umbrella where your brain just fills in the gap

194
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,375
Whatever you want

195
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,567
It's also interesting we go from

196
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:37,407
There's power in their eyes to the confused

197
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,527
Hillary people

198
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,343
Confused white people whacked out

199
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,391
Trump supporters

200
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:53,279
More articulate than Alex Jones

201
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,655
Here's some more thoughts about the the Trump crowd though

202
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:24,767
You know what he said Chinese and Japanese he had to resisting dirty knees

203
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,071
Guarantee there's a part of the back of his mind is like

204
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,143
Don't they look at the

205
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
Right back

206
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:03,679
It was amazing

207
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,383
Weakness

208
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:24,415
And the enemy

209
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,023
And now this

210
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
Wow

211
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:35,679
We did all that now

212
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:42,591
First of all

213
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:47,711
Document

214
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,247
Debunked

215
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:53,087
The books are all of the ideas about like a huge

216
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,623
Global cabal come from

217
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,487
Exist

218
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,559
And for centuries they've been poisoning the water

219
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,375
And doing all these bees crazy things to us

220
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
Like

221
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,983
Trump becoming president

222
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,287
If there's this big evil organization

223
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,175
But if you're feeling right now

224
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,551
I appreciate I suppose his attempt at being woke

225
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:31,231
He's really he's going above and beyond

226
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:35,839
That there is diversity and the audience as

227
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,983
I thought for a second

228
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,311
Do you know this

229
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,871
Prism she was I guess he was just going to stop

230
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,919
Chinese like all Asian

231
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,575
They're going to need an

232
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,599
On Facebook

233
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:04,255
That is exactly what my thesis has been coming to about the existence of Infowars

234
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:08,095
It's not much news it's not so much entertainment

235
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,911
It's to teach you how to argue poorly

236
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,447
For indefensible position

237
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,495
Yeah that's already kind of

238
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:20,383
Where I've been

239
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
O'Reilly's

240
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,479
It should tip you off to this is how f****** repetitive

241
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:28,575
We are going to hear every single time

242
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,903
Yeah but almost everything separately crazy yelling stuff you repeat

243
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,183
Like 10 times

244
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,719
How long is the show

245
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,279
They are four hours with commercials

246
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
Everyday

247
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,447
Thankfully most of the time is spent selling weird stuff on it

248
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:48,799
Sounds like colloidal silver and iodine

249
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,639
Super male Vitality pills

250
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
Call Skip the people

251
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,455
Poison them

252
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:10,303
Oh yeah the Illuminati wants to poison a take these pills the FDA hasn't looked at

253
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:15,423
So actually I was thinking about this and I was like why you know

254
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,447
Why would

255
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,007
These Elites be afraid of trump

256
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,567
And I realize now actually I have an answer

257
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:30,015
Got the big break before he walked out because I said the president

258
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,295
The president

259
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,647
Information

260
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,471
Trump walks out Trump goes in like this for the Raven comes out

261
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:58,431
Long-term Eugenics program

262
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:03,807
There's a species wind program going on and

263
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:08,159
And the Donald Trump is going to know what I've reverse-engineered

264
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,183
And more

265
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,815
Look at his face when he talks about

266
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,887
Unlock the secrets of the universe

267
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,679
Unlock

268
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,519
The secret skin disease and illness Morgan eradicated

269
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,055
And you can see

270
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:28,895
He looks like he's about to break down he's got a ride

271
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,943
Because now he knows

272
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,735
That's one Theory

273
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:39,135
Another theory he looks like he's about to break down because he's f****** out of shape as hell and 70

274
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:39,903
Plus years old

275
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,439
He's the oldest

276
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:46,303
Like third fattest

277
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,119
Grover Cleveland

278
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:54,495
Was also

279
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:58,335
Who does the global Eugenics program that's been going on

280
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:02,175
And Alex has reversed engineered all this stuff

281
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,455
From sources

282
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:13,951
Moment you realize

283
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,767
The reality up till now is all been a big joke

284
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,071
Existence of matter

285
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,095
Now what

286
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
Insight

287
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,471
It's great but

288
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,239
Yes

289
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,543
Do you believe there

290
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,359
Is a global Eugenics program going on

291
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,663
Run by the US government

292
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,783
In concert with the Illuminati

293
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:48,511
You getting turned on to some important

294
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,327
We're going out for your break

295
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,679
This next clip that we play is offensively

296
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,983
But it's also delightful because

297
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,775
Alex Jones

298
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,079
Stock

299
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,359
It's a fake crying

300
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,895
You fix crying

301
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,663
A lot

302
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,455
And he doesn't miss CLEP

303
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,551
Almighty man

304
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,696
My soul cries out for them

305
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,256
He's talking about the protest

306
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,328
Okay so he's feeling bad

307
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,680
No no

308
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:34,080
Hands over his face when like

309
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,408
But still is trying

310
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,432
I'm sure he's not taking

311
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:42,016
I think you might want to

312
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:46,624
It's hammy at back at least level

313
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:51,232
Call myself you're saying

314
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:56,864
Help you

315
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,944
Because

316
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,760
Controller

317
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:41,664
I want to be clear I didn't contact

318
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,040
Someone who listen to tons of Alex Jones

319
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,880
I would assume you be asking me what is he talking about

320
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,416
And I can't answer

321
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:55,488
I don't really know we don't we don't have

322
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,024
Previous contacts

323
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,792
4

324
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,072
This group

325
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,632
High IQ

326
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,216
Half zombie half

327
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,544
Jihadist protesters

328
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,944
The Christian Heaven Christian God are real but they have defied

329
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,344
Worshipping a false religion

330
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,696
Everyone else in danger

331
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:33,632
I'm really glad to like really parts that out because I couldn't I could not have

332
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,168
Express that better

333
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:35,936
Perfect

334
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,216
That's exactly

335
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,032
All I took away from it was

336
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,080
There's no way anyone jumped out at you

337
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,248
Yeah

338
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:55,136
Is she saying he was at the women's March

339
00:23:55,392 --> 00:24:00,256
I mean he was therefore I guess a short. Of time to get the fly back

340
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
Austin

341
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,400
On Saturday morning occupied Texas

342
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,680
Booty calls

343
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,520
That's a that's a blue City

344
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,080
Yeah it is

345
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
Because

346
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,432
There's a part of me that doesn't think that he's really since

347
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,480
You know what I mean

348
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:24,576
And Austin's a really Kick-Ass place to live

349
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,600
Does a Cool vibe

350
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,904
You're full of s***

351
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,440
Good place to live

352
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,232
Yeah I guess so

353
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,536
Queso

354
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,704
You know what he's lost a lot of weight taking his supplements

355
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:46,080
Oh really

356
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:50,432
Taking the

357
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:53,248
Will cudna as you get older starts

358
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,016
Takoma Park

359
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:01,440
The double-helix starts to something like that

360
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:05,280
The way that they've explained it is you know how your shoelaces little camp on it

361
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,400
The aglet of your DNA starts to come off it starts with light off

362
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:13,984
I'm in much like your shoelace coming apart your DNA starts

363
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,824
Are pills in order to keep the aglet strong

364
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,384
Who knows how much longer you could live

365
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,944
Probably way longer than you would have before

366
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,224
Make sense

367
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,784
Mason

368
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:33,952
Bottles of the special pills that keep the wax tip of my DNA held together

369
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,768
U-Save Auto ships

370
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:43,168
He'll just keep coming to you

371
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,960
Nootropic

372
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:48,544
To be fair

373
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,336
Nootropics that sounds like the name

374
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,616
Aldous Huxley novel

375
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,920
311 album

376
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:00,320
On the last episode we did a lot of research

377
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,112
Didn't do a ton of research

378
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,416
But we figured out a pretty good theory

379
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,184
That Alex

380
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,208
Was drunk

381
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,488
Over inauguration

382
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,048
There were a bunch

383
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,864
Videos

384
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:18,496
Let's see what I we hang out with some drunk people

385
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:23,616
You know how we've been some drunk people know.

386
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:27,200
But they give off and he was giving off all these

387
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:32,576
There's no doubt it wasn't the last episode

388
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,624
It's at the end of the episode

389
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,416
Dead to rights

390
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:40,768
We also talked about how he got thrown out of the inaugural

391
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:45,632
Because I watched people escorting him out of the

392
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:49,216
The crowd boy now

393
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:08,928
Obama

394
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:13,536
Defend women I saw being bloody

395
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:21,216
One of his narratives about the inauguration is that these socialist jihadist

396
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:21,984
Control

397
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,544
Whatever the all these people were beating up old women

398
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:25,824
Old women

399
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
Specifically

400
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,200
Okay and there's a there's a

401
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:34,272
Like a picture up on infowars.com

402
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,808
Illustrates

403
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,112
And the lady was a cut on her thumb

404
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,648
Right here she's a little tiny cut

405
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,184
That's sir

406
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,512
You know like people are being bloody expect like

407
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,048
Bastian head price

408
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,328
Latest not that

409
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,608
Anyway

410
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,912
Like my cat

411
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:06,528
Section multiple newspapers

Podcast

413
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,488
Months ago in July last year

414
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,280
And then added I was drunk

415
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,352
And the police were escorting me up

416
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:32,128
No no no I wasn't just drunk

417
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:43,392
It was a beanstalk from Austin

418
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:46,208
All the way over there and I came off a magic beanstalk

419
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,448
So did you get what you did there

420
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,520
No

421
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,568
He tried to defend

422
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,640
How silly the news that he was drunk was

423
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:07,712
By comparing it to a story that no one wrote

424
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,016
That he had traveled by Beats

425
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:17,696
Scott so crazy

426
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,024
Another clip of Alex drunk

00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,096
In DC over inauguration weekend

428
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:28,704
This comes from a 5 minute video of Alex walking around the streets

429
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,752
Just with a microphone

430
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:34,592
Last like 3 minutes of it as him giving a limp

431
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,640
Handshakes

The new Atlantis

454
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,592
It's like it's not a Francis Bacon book

455
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:46,688
Philosopher wrote about how America

456
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:49,248
Like we back at me like early days it was

457
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:51,808
The conceived that America was the new Atlanta

458
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,904
Because everything was going to be like technological in advance

459
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:59,488
Like

460
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,024
Come on man

461
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,376
He's slurring his words

462
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,912
Shadow is Scientologist

463
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,960

And getting Transmissions from God

466
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,176
You are assholes your guide

467
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:18,944
You got a message

468
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,528
You're not a lion

469
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,696
On the street

470
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,256
Is about Free Speech issues

471
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,560
She's like you have liquor on your breath

472
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,032
Sweet cakes

473
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,592
Kate

474
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,896
Yeah it's pretty

475
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,808
Because he was

476
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,088
The jury has decided on

477
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,744
I'm not sure if you got kicked out of somewhere for his safety

478
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,560
But

479
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,096
It really looked like he wasn't

480
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:08,864
Going

481
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,960
From the clip I saw

482
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:17,824
Easy brings this up

483
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,384
Take a note of somewhere

484
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,176
Like it's a Mario because the communist

485
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:22,944
Attack

486
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,296

Inauguration

489
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,368
And

490
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,048
Alex backman Studio like

491
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,072
He is risen

492
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:45,728
He is now at this point he's introduced his thesis that he comes back to over and over again the idea of these protesters were weirdo

493
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,032
People are great

494
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,336
But along the way

495
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,896
With his his verbal jazz style

496
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,456
You've got to throw in some other weird s***

497
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,016
About gender roles

498
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,112
The news here

499
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,904
Brock

500
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,464
It begins Brock far left

501
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,256
Plan Trump impeachment

502
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:16,704
Administration

503
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,032
I'm going to shut up

504
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:10,976
Shuffling man is a good man

505
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:33,248
Is there anything all that

506
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:34,784
That's right

507
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,832
The globalist want to end

508
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,536
You know I got to go to them

509
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,584
On this point

510
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,608
Men are not happy

511
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,936
There was that one guy but that

512
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:59,360
Junior

513
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:04,992
Seahorse

514
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:08,064
You know that

515
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:17,280
So one of the other things I think is interesting about this clip it's important to point out is you can tell who

516
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:20,096
Listen to Infowars by words that are being used

517
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,192
So like

518
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,472
Put out a tweet

519
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:28,544
That called the inauguration historical

520
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,824
Instead of historic

521
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:33,664
Right and that is Alex Jones does at least five times

522
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,968
The show he says business historical

523
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,272
Which is the incorrect use of the

524
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,600
Yep

525
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,160
I don't remember the exact form

526
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,720
Adjectives

527
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,024
The adverb adverb

528
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,304
Sounds right

529
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,096
Doesn't work in the account

530
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,632
Text Betsy Davis

531
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,056
You you would not misuse that word like that is a very weird word to misuse

532
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,104
Yes it is deliberately an off-day

533
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:07,456
Yeah and in this case this is another one that Alex does is groveling

534
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,528
I'd like to be there girlfriend

535
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,064
The p**** man

536
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,160
Not something

537
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,000
Not really you don't have a direct object

538
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:20,768
Your Bravo

539
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,304
Haha but

540
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,144
ABC News

541
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,960
He says that reporters are groveling

542
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:34,336
When they're backpedaling

543
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,128
Because groveling to be established

544
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:42,784
It's not proof positive but it's a pretty good indication that Alex isn't lying when he says

545
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,552
Metropolis

546
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,600
So

547
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,880
Enjoy look forward to

548
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,184
Cuz Trump's uses

549
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,208
Language is

550
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,304
And pretty sparse

551
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:06,592
Huge words

552
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,384
Terrific

553
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,480
Good just got to have that

554
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:15,808
Throw it in there

555
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,416
So

556
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,976
Another part of the

557
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:29,120
And Alex make a very weird

558
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,400
Admission

559
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,680
In this clip

560
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:34,496
That I'm not sure he knows

561
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,776
I'm not I'm not positive

562
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,872
Exactly

563
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,152
He also has

564
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,968
Ashley Beckford Lee Ann McAdoo

565
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:48,576
Reporters in this conversation

566
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:52,416
He's brought them in studio now because he has to talk about like women

567
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:53,696
Springs in

568
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,232
This is a business about abortion

569
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,280
At this point

570
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,304
To talk about abortion

571
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,120
Porter's the women

572
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,656
Infowars employees

573
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,680
Right

574
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,264
A hundred percent

575
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,544
This is interesting

576
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,336
Because this is more than

577
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,872
Washington

578
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:18,272
That panel is like tonight and one lady

579
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,576
Speak up

580
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,600
Like alternative

581
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,464
Saddened

582
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:30,048
TV props Minnesota propaganda

583
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,608
The Facebook

584
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:42,848
We have to

585
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:46,944
I agree

586
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,248
And also

587
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:55,648
We need to say that for us but they do

588
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,696
I will say

589
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,536
People who are involved in Infowars

590
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,864
Lee Ann McAdoo is incredibly attractive to me

591
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,400
And it's a troublesome

592
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,192
And waterways

593
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,752
Please do and then Ashley Beckford

594
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:14,080
She could be doing legitimate work elsewhere

595
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:17,408
She's pretty talented and like a decent reporter

596
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,688
But is doing this

597
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,736
I assume for a job

598
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:23,296
I'm not entirely sure she seems to have some chop

599
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,576
But anyway

600
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:30,208
And that's what plant

601
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:33,024
By basically

602
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,096
Was

603
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:42,496
Women and kids

604
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,264
Stranger

605
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:49,664
You know for the distributor woman which is beyond but we don't have to worship the baby I'm not judging by the

606
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,064
National worship

607
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,392
Yeah yeah you have your

608
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:03,232
Your jaw is on the floor is that from looking at or what we just heard

609
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,024
The ladder

610
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:08,864
What

611
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:12,960
What we talking about

612
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,104
To gorgeous woman

613
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:26,272
Very good-looking late

614
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,296
Is great

615
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,064
Pretty fun

616
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,672
Yeah and they didn't they seem to

617
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,464
Bad a verbal I added

618
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,488
No please

619
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,536
In the video you can see them sort of look

620
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,120
Are you stalking

621
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,168
I'm sure he's very sexy

622
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,872
That's multiple abortions

623
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,943
Yeah boy

624
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,039
Yeah

625
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,575
To be someone who is

626
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,367
Crazy anti-choice

627
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,159
Yeah and then to like

628
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,719
Admit flippantly

629
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:09,535
Yeah you're kind of a f****** hypocrite

630
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:13,119
Entirely and I'm sure it was not

631
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,655
I'm sure it was not a cool help a

632
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,959
I'm sure it was more like

633
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,727
You're getting

634
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:21,823
I would assume based on his understanding

635
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:25,407
Which is

636
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:31,039
Mommy's not going to have a baby

637
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,367
I mean

638
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,439
Buddhist will be

639
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,207
Be showing on this

640
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:40,255
This is something I've said for a long time

641
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,791
2 mi

642
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,071
Christian friends

643
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:43,839
Trump

644
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,631
Single-issue voters

645
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,727
Yeah

646
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,311
Space force

647
00:42:54,335 --> 00:43:00,479
It's probably been

648
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:06,111
I don't remember the exact quote Vietnam

649
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:13,023
Was like his personal Vietnam

650
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:18,655
Dog and everybody not raw dog so before the 80s he was

651
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,447
F****** getting it in

652
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,471
On

653
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,239
Rap

654
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,287
Wow

655
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,311
Hansa

656
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,079
Like

657
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:28,895
What's the date

658
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,175
Probably tons of s***

659
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,199
Just going on

660
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:34,527
Explain everything that's going on

661
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,575
Right he's cuz it isn't crazy stuff

662
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,559
If you don't

663
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,799
Just like you the most

664
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,847
Healthy individual

665
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,919
National weather looking like

666
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:05,503
Looking like some old hippie doctor

667
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,575
Do you know

668
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:11,135
How do we know that

669
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,207
A real badass

670
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,999
But the question that we all got an

671
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:20,863
Well one way we can tell is how do other people

672
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,167
Who are badasses interact with him

673
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:23,935
Okay

674
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,471
Alex hasn't talked about it

675
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:32,639
So just wait

676
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,919
And their lives are better

677
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,319
Which prison for beating people to death

678
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:47,999
Promoters

679
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,535
Love Donald Trump

680
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,559
I'm respecting

681
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:03,103
At this point

682
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:08,735
Ashley and LeAnn are both looking at Trump at The Alex Jones

683
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,783
What are you talkin about

684
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,575
At this point they have gone

685
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,599
Confused

686
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,623
Like what

687
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:15,647
Why are you

688
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,695
First of all Duncan

689
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,975
There was murder

690
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:23,071
Used to collect on a gambling debt and beat a guy to death

691
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,911
So

692
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,447
You know maybe it's manslaughter

693
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,263
You the bad dude

694
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,567
You right yeah

695
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:38,175
Where's a lot of flag shirt

696
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:41,247
I think Alex might be taking the wrong lesson

697
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,575
Do you think you know

698
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:49,951
Even if you have me on

699
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,231
Michelle but I think you might be right

700
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,511
I appreciate that

701
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,559
Also Alex has more thoughts

702
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:06,847
I'm telling you he's just

703
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:21,183
Enfamil

704
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,231
To be fair at the end I was like nah

705
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,839
Insinuation

706
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,375
Good enough

707
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,167
That's good enough for marketing

708
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:34,751
Yeah he's a vital man and

709
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:39,103
Who's the black guy runs over white dudes

710
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,919
Yeah I like having have to come back to race

711
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,295
I don't think so

712
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,855
I don't know

713
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:54,463
It would be inappropriate for me to say that

714
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:59,839
And I don't think that the evidence really necessarily bears that out

715
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,887
But I think he's beholding

716
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,679
The song racist lies

717
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,727
But he doesn't realize that

718
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:06,495
But he believes

719
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:09,567
But he's kind of big on the idea of white genocide

720
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,335
Basically

721
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:13,663
Okay

722
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,967
Subway

723
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,527
This does come up on the program some

724
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,575
And it's interesting that he

725
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:21,855
He equates why

726
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:24,927
Takeout

727
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:29,023
And murder a guy

728
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:33,887
Mixpak

729
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:38,239
CR80 years old and Incredibly insane

730
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:44,895
Trump standing

731
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:51,295
Next really looking at anything in particular

732
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,087
I don't want to make fun of the old

733
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,623
For like being old

734
00:47:56,415 --> 00:48:02,559
Right batty levels of old

735
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,327
105

736
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,631
They're really with it

737
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,055
You take the

738
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:17,407
Infowarsstore.com

739
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,943
Love it

740
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:22,527
This point we're onto the next

741
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:25,343
They we are now on the 24th

742
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,927
And Alex's

743
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:32,511
Material a lot of stuff that we didn't cover his reputation

744
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:35,071
There's just a lot of saying the same thing

745
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,095
Over and over again

746
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:45,823
Fuller more robust lies about what happened at the inauguration

747
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,175
Capitol Police

748
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,223
Do not let

749
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:56,319
People let the protesters beat people up

750
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:00,159
So first of all he saying that Obama

751
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,463
Relinquished power at noon

752
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:05,023
I put someone in place who wasn't going

753
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,047
To defend the public

754
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,071
And

755
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:09,631
He was going to make it so people couldn't get in

756
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:14,751
And that is why that one picture looks like there's nobody there at the inauguration

757
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:19,615
Because there was millions of people waiting to get in

758
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,639
On the perimeter

759
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,919
Yeah yeah yeah

760
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:25,247
But good because they needed to Stage that photo op

761
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,295
Insane

762
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:35,231
Like Obama lock credits

763
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,279
I mean

764
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,071
Bushel

765
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,399
But it's not Obama globalist

766
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:47,519
Sure the globalist at the George soros's of the world we're actually doing all this stuff

767
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,055
Obama just gets credit

768
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:49,823
A figurehead

769
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:55,199

Inferences

772
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:04,415
Here's how I know that that's not true

773
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:07,487
They post everything on infowars.com

774
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:15,679
If they have hours of footage of people beating up old women at the inauguration

775
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:22,847
Hotel room right now

776
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:27,711

781
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:43,839
People trying to block the entrance

782
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,263
A report on this

783
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:55,103
Everything from MSNBC

784
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:59,199
CVS

785
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,735
Running what stories

786
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,367
And they show video

787
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:10,463
Photo

788
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,743
Complete

789
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:21,727
Is it true what do you mean

790
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,263
Specifically that was Alex Jones

791
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:26,079
I want a hundred percent don't give a fuk

792
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:29,919
The only things that he put up where like blogs

793
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:35,295
Show any proof of the New York Times reported on it

794
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,087
Which I can't imagine them caring

795
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,367
No

796
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,927
It has a real like

797
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:43,999
Victim mentality about a lot of stuff

798
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:48,351
While accusing Democrats of being like

799
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:51,423
You guys are all just you know your victims

800
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:54,495
System you're willing victims

801
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:56,543
Do you think

802
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,335
Cabal

803
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:03,199
Stopping you from doing everything right

804
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:07,039
I don't care if

805
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:07,807
News sources

806
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,831
Looks like they did

807
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,111
I don't care

808
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:12,159
Isn't bad reporting

809
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,975
I saw the video about being thrown out of

810
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,047
Where did you find the videos you too on YouTube

811
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,863
And like I said if they're saying

812
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:27,263
Is there if they didn't do any Research into the circumstances reporting

813
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,615
I guarantee he was drunk

814
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:39,039
Drunk

815
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,063
Heck

816
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:44,159
And so like him being like I wasn't thrown out and they want to stay on drunk

817
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,695
Come on man

818
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,999
Give it up just

819
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,791

820
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,583
Only care that you're tonight

821
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,375

836
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:10,687
Do you think that his lawyer is as crazy as he is

837
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,967

00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,759

I just goes on from there

955
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:15,199
It's boring interview

956
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:18,271
They cornered him in an elevator

957
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:22,367
This interview is taking an elevator

958
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:27,231
It's insane to see how sad Ted Cruz's faces

959
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:30,047
But he does not want to be in that elevator

960
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,071
Oh yeah I bet

961
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:37,471
It's like Alex Jones always impressed by celebrities and doesn't care about insiders and

962
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:40,031
Stuff like that she looks like a kid on Christmas

963
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:47,199
Like he was so excited the Ted Cruz was there at the end of the interview he's even like

964
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:50,527
Bill got a billion listeners now

965
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:56,671
Real quick

966
01:03:56,927 --> 01:04:02,559
Levels of impression

967
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:05,631
The program

968
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:14,335
Is way more than Glenn Beck

969
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:25,855
Reasonable

970
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:29,439
I hate so many different

971
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,207
People

972
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:30,975
I have

973
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:32,255
100 cans of soup in

974
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,791
Tree.com

975
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,071
My daughter's hate me

976
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,887
They won't kiss me

977
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:39,935
The boys of Sky Sandwich Works

978
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,567
Izakaya

979
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:53,759
Government over something people wanted

980
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,295
Never support Trump after he

981
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:58,367
You f****** really went after my wife real hard

982
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:01,951
And my dad

983
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:03,743
Both bucket cutout

984
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:09,887
Supported Trump and yet I know I can't

985
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:12,447
I called called Fort Rob

986
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:15,519
There are pictures of me with the saddest

987
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:18,079
Puppet look at my face

988
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:20,127
I can't get the stink of this guy on me

989
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:27,295
This packet iPhone elevator interview

990
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:30,623
Can you tell what kind of iPhone by Anita

991
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,415
Cuz I feel like

992
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:33,695
5S

993
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,815
Any of the sectors I'm working with

994
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:48,287
Okay that's good

995
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,871
Technology very well I'm real

996
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:52,639
The time

997
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:55,199
Only felt like an iPhone like

998
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,223
2 years ago

999
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:57,247
Oh yeah

1000
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:58,783
What is podcast

1001
01:05:59,295 --> 01:05:59,807
More advanced

1002
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:04,159
Are there podcasting friends

1003
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:07,999
No it's something that Alex takes seriously

1004
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,023
Tell me

1005
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:10,047
Sex

1006
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:17,215
Here is where we get to what I would describe as the fun part of the show

1007
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:21,567
I can't wait it's been fun so far but if we're just now.

1008
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:22,591
3 clips

1009
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:24,895
Are cuckoo bananas

1010
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:31,039
So if everything else up to this point

1011
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:31,807
Has been

1012
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:36,159
Reasonably sane

1013
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:37,183
Yep

1014
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:38,463
Succubus

1015
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:40,767
Go to Alex's thoughts about like

1016
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,303
O'Gorman even sure how to

1017
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,839
Explain what this is but

1018
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:44,607
Enjoy

1019
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:50,239
About the fact that I always thought people were good like I was

1020
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:52,287
Perfect

1021
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:55,359
I'm a very worldly person when it comes to

1022
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:01,247
And I'll let you say I'm certainly not gay

1023
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:04,831
But the point is when I mean

1024
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:07,903
The point is

1025
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,439
And

1026
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:14,815
God's creation

1027
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,679
These people are crazy ladies and gentlemen

1028
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:21,983
Remind

1029
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:24,799
What would you want to try and parts that one

1030
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:31,455
Which people are supposed to know that already

1031
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:38,879
What's the central theme of most of the show that gay people are out to get you

1032
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,647
Yep

1033
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:41,183
The gay people are crazy

1034
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,487
And

1035
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:45,535
They might be crazy because they don't

1036
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,303
Beauty

1037
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:51,167
Donut world

1038
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:57,055
I like how he has to say three times in there

1039
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:05,247
Decorations of feminine

1040
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:09,855
Yeah

1041
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:11,391
Roundabout way of saying

1042
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,415
You like women

1043
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,975
Instead of just being like

1044
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:16,767
Cut and dry

1045
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:20,607
You can just say that

1046
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,679
You're not gay

1047
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:25,471
Is not an attack on gays

1048
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:29,055
Truth like if I say I'm not gay

1049
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:32,383
I don't

1050
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,711
Nothing wrong with gay

1051
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:39,807
Seinfeld episode

1052
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:42,879
3 years ago

1053
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:48,511
We took care of that ideas

1054
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:59,519
This clip is a little bit longer

1055
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,823
It is

1056
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:04,127
Absolutely

1057
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:08,223
It's

1058
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,247
So

1059
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,271
Strange

1060
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,575
The thought process makes no sense

1061
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:15,647
There's a

1062
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,927
A bodily function

1063
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:18,463
That is

1064
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,255
Bizarre

1065
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:25,887
He doesn't pray

1066
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,471
I mean

1067
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:36,383
I just can't believe we're facing this lovely a lot

1068
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:39,711
Little bit longer so

1069
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:49,951
Destroyed

1070
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:56,863
And that's it they're people like to neglect this mental illness

1071
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:02,751
So make me

1072
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:05,311
Dog style haircuts

1073
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:09,151
Haircuts

1074
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:16,575
Brock go out on the street

1075
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:26,047
Ground and tell those women that it was pumpkin pie

1076
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:30,655
Do you think he was trying to do with Bernie Mac there

1077
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:40,127
Gross

1078
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,663
They're disgusting

1079
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:45,759
Little scumbags like this

1080
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:52,415
Tots for so long I mean there's a global overthrow of

1081
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:01,887
Overthrow you

1082
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:08,031
And you think you and your minions all your people and

1083
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:14,431
You think you

1084
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:22,623
Can talk about doing violence does get away with it you got another thing coming

1085
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:24,159
I just know how either works

1086
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:29,279
Their spiritual spider webs

1087
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:34,143
I think you have some big wires

1088
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:38,239
Realize that Alex Jones is a religious zealot

1089
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:40,031
Really weird way

1090
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:43,871
From the last episode we found out that he believes that everything is energy

1091
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:48,479
Not totally in line with Christian teachings

1092
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:50,527
I want this girl who believe

1093
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:53,087
Everything was crystals

1094
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:56,415
No she might now at the time crystals aren't really big

1095
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,183
Okay

1096
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:01,023
Okay is this in Springfield

1097
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:05,631
Okay kind of goes along with an ostracism a little bit another is sort of

1098
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:12,543
Influence I don't know what brand of Christianity everything is energy I'm going to be honest I think

1099
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:16,127
Very bad

1100
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,919
This for very long time

1101
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:23,039
I think a little bit

1102
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:33,535
Fanfiction the spiritual spider web

1103
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:35,583
That's not in Deuteronomy

1104
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:41,727
The book of Jones

1105
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:45,567
That's right so this clip is not nearly.

1106
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:47,103
The craziest part is yet

1107
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:51,199
I think the left hit some big wires

1108
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:55,551
And some big spiritual things you have coming up

1109
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:02,463
Just released that

1110
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:03,999
Door over there

1111
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,583
Amador

1112
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:10,399
Outcomes

1113
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:12,447
What you're looking for

1114
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:14,495
What do I put peace out there

1115
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:18,335
Obama and Michelle

1116
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:22,175
Walmart for you friend and Madonna

1117
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:26,271
Please smugly preening well he says that cuz he's obviously like

1118
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,039
I don't mean

1119
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:29,855
Is it

1120
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:33,695
You like the first sure I wish peace and long life for

1121
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,231
Obama and Michelle

1122
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:38,047
He's gone on long tirade about how you believe that

1123
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:39,327
Michelle is a man

1124
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:43,423
No the first tranny and stuff like that like

1125
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:49,055
Are you f****** serious not kidding at all it's it's horribly called her Michael sometime

1126
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:50,591
Incredibly offensive

1127
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:55,711
Yeah that is but I wish them the best when I'm trying to make a false point

1128
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:58,783
About my my honor or my integrity

1129
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,087
So

1130
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:04,415
Again I'm sure Alex Jones fans have got a short memory

1131
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:05,439
Very

1132
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:08,767
Crazy

1133
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:09,535
Studio

1134
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:10,303
Okay

1135
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:19,263
Brock at Hillary and Obama

1136
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:25,151
Who's David Brock Brock is the guy who runs Media Matters

1137
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:27,967

1138
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:31,807
Watch Dogs

1139
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,599
Mixed martial arts

1140
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:39,231
America

1141
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,279
Then Alex is mine

1142
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:45,375
Do they take money from George Soros and the open society and stuff like that

1143
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:49,215
As part of the globalist network David Brock

1144
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:49,983
Is

1145
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:50,751
The global.

1146
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:51,775
Funneling money

1147
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:55,359
Do the priests like the propaganda arm or whatever

1148
01:14:55,615 --> 01:15:00,223
I think David Brock's got a lot of issues but Media Matters is generally a very well research

1149
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:01,759
Site that

1150
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:06,623
Not all they do is watch Fox News

1151
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:08,415
Watch Glenn Beck watch

1152
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:10,463
Alex Jones and debunk Tumblr

1153
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,487
Stuff that they say

1154
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:17,887
And of course I picked

1155
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:18,911
Anything whatsoever

1156
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:21,727
Also fun little tidbit

1157
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:22,751
David Brock

1158
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:24,799
Ex-boyfriend is the guy who owns

1159
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:26,335
Comet Ping Pong

1160
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,871
What is the center of pizzagate

1161
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:32,223
So nice little fun connection there

1162
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:34,783
Spiritual spider webs

1163
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:36,831
Spiderwebs

1164
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,623
He's got no doubt

1165
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:43,487
Tragic Kingdom

1166
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:46,559
Does a girl in the world map

1167
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:49,119
So here we go this is where you start spraying

1168
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:51,423
Father

1169
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:55,775
I'll also keep

1170
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:05,503
They're fighting good

1171
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:19,583
Apologizing

1172
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:22,655
Such a spectacle

1173
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:38,271
We should pray for their slaves

1174
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:03,871
Earlier

1175
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:06,431
Collector collector piss

1176
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,151
What's the stop all that

1177
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:41,759
It's so fascinating to be where he catches himself to clarify stuff

1178
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:51,487
Are we leaving the CIA

1179
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:54,559
You have to clarify that but he doesn't want to walk back like

1180
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:57,887
No not all crazy people leave their crap

1181
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:01,215
Oh man I love that Federer

1182
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:02,239
Play following a prayer

1183
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:04,031
Within a prayer

1184
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,055
He never said amen

1185
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:09,663
All that yelling at prayer

1186
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:11,711
God

1187
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:16,575
Also also I like that he's trying to mansplain to God

1188
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:18,879
About to how evil other people are

1189
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:21,183
Yeah the guy doesn't mean that he knows

1190
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:21,951
Yeah I got nose

1191
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:27,327
Eagle

1192
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:30,655
So I don't know man I think I'm evil I don't

1193
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:31,423
Ebony fast

1194
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:38,079
32 points in his next clip you'll probably hear it too

1195
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:43,711
They like to keep their crap

1196
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:44,735
Keep their path

1197
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:45,759
Like

1198
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:48,831
You could hear in the clip

1199
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:50,367
A blurt laugh from

1200
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:52,671
Cuz as I was isolating the clips

1201
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:53,695
I just lost

1202
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:56,767
Craigslist

1203
01:18:57,023 --> 01:19:02,143
History happening at the eclipse

1204
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:03,935
I laughed

1205
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:06,495
So hard hearing it for like the third time

1206
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:13,151
Incredibly offensive

1207
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:17,247
Said that he's really good at doing impressions

1208
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:23,391
And that his kid loves it when he does a Cookie Monster impression

1209
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:24,415
BookIt

1210
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:25,951
Do you have a wife

1211
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:27,487
Perfume does the other wife

1212
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:29,535
He has a wife

1213
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:34,399
Yeah there was a with Leanne McAdoo

1214
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:36,447
Years ago but I don't know if it's

1215
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,727
Substantiate at all

1216
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:39,775
Good to speak gossip rag talk

1217
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,055
Kia

1218
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:42,847
It started

1219
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:52,063
Matt with all due respect

1220
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:54,367
Man without you you're very attractive lady

1221
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:59,999
As this clip is we're coming to the end of our Clips here but this one is

1222
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:01,791
Insane

1223
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:02,815
It is a nice

1224
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:07,423
Impression on the part where were the revisiting that Alex has ability to do impression

1225
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,311
I've always liked to hear about the

1226
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,528
I should clarify

1227
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,832
This is after he had shown a clip

1228
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:28,416
What he described as the mentally ill protesters

1229
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,440
At the inauguration

1230
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:31,744
Okay if you just showed

1231
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,024
One lady

1232
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,584
Out in the middle of the street with tin cans

1233
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,632
Tied to her waist

1234
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:41,472
Slamming something against the street it was

1235
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:42,240
It was a crazy

1236
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:49,664
Who is the person who believes they are holding people who just got married

1237
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,688
Level two

1238
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:52,992
If you saw this you not think this is free.

1239
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,528
Do not think cuz of the protest

1240
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:55,808
Crazy person

1241
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,624
And he's like yeah they just get out there and they do this

1242
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,184
This crazy stuff in the people gather around them

1243
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,976
There's no one around

1244
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:06,304
This isolated Crazy Bruce

1245
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,328
Yep

1246
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:11,424
Relatively

1247
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,192
I suppose

1248
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:18,336
Sure I would say

1249
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:20,896
At least 150 ft

1250
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:22,688
Of this lady

1251
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:23,712
The people taping

1252
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:24,992
Who work for

1253
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:30,880
Who do crazy things that gather a crowd

1254
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:38,048
He starts by saying he feels bad for this crazy person

1255
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,120
Not because she's crazy but because she's indoctrinated by the

1256
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,400
The globalist

1257
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:53,408
Put cigarettes out on her beating

1258
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,456
Robert i-card

1259
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:42,816
That's where I lost it

1260
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:57,152
Crazy

1261
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:58,176
It's the best

1262
01:22:58,688 --> 01:22:59,456
Oh man

1263
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:04,320
So you don't think that was a very good impression

1264
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:11,232
I don't think it was a good impression I'll say this I could tell what he was going

1265
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:14,816
Miami

1266
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:23,776
The man's voice really offended

1267
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:28,128
His own voice is the pimp okay okay for black women

1268
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:41,184
Secondarily offensively

1269
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:42,720
Right

1270
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:47,584
And if you were to try and tell him it would be like you're a dumb

1271
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:53,216
Brainwashed liberal

1272
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:56,544
Dead behind us

1273
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:00,640
Busted

1274
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:07,040
Through before we get out of here I would like to take a moment we got a we got a missive from the road

1275
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,832
Jordan is on his work keishin

1276
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,624
Out there London

1277
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,392
Good ol

1278
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:12,672
Joy England

1279
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:18,560
From from London on the ground

1280
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:20,096
And so far

1281
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:21,376
We have a fight for knowledge

1282
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:22,656
Iran knowledge fight

1283
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:25,216
And knowledge

1284
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:25,984
From across the pond

1285
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:33,152
I'm recording this from

1286
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:35,968
There is zero occupiers here

1287
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:40,320
And they would know they've been occupied before or at least bombed by them

1288
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:44,928
I'm speaking specifically of Nazis the ones from Germany

1289
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:48,768
Not the ones from the United States

1290
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:50,560
Who currently holds power

1291
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:52,352
Over

1292
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:54,656
Over all of us really

1293
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:00,544
It's strange being here and

1294
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:03,872
Blamed for Trump

1295
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:07,968
So much as I feel like the representation of

1296
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:09,504
You know what I'm saying

1297
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:15,136
Trump so much here because his hair offends them personally

1298
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:17,952
It reminds them too much

1299
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:25,376
ORS fake tan his fake tan reminds them of the

1300
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:28,192
Relationship

1301
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:33,312
With the son that I have with an old high school classmate

1302
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,104
Where is

1303
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:41,504
Do I know you I just I just don't want to see you again except for short bursts

1304
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:49,440
I think I think one of their big issues has they do feel like

1305
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,768
You know we we one-up them

1306
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:56,864
Like we have a little bit of a

1307
01:25:57,632 --> 01:26:00,960
With the UK no matter how much things change

1308
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:05,568
There is still that kind of small relationship there where

1309
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:12,224
You know with one vote they said hey we can destroy Great Britain and we said oh yeah yeah

1310
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:17,088
Like that we can destroy the world how do you feel about that assholes

1311
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:20,416
America

1312
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:27,328
You know they they read the news

1313
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:29,120
And the news about Trump

1314
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,168
Even though

1315
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:37,312
You know they had something

1316
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:40,384
And the Supreme Court

1317
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:44,992
I don't know if they even have real quartz wigs

1318
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:52,416
They rule that you cannot actually trigger article 50 that's the brexit law

1319
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:57,536
Without a congressional or parliamentary

1320
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:59,328
Like

1321
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:01,120
The c word

1322
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:04,192
You can use parliamentary

1323
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:10,080
Rules to actually vote on article 50

1324
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:13,152
Without a parliamentary vote

1325
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:13,920
You know

1326
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:17,504
Everybody's fine

1327
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:21,856
Brexit to happen then they could put pressure on their Parliament

1328
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:24,160
To keep that from happening

1329
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:27,232
But that's a very non British way of looking at

1330
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,304
The facts

1331
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:33,888
The majority of people now don't want brexit to happen

1332
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,192
Doesn't matter to them

1333
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:38,752
What matters is that

1334
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:41,312
The right way

1335
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:47,456
Adjust is so British

1336
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,272
Yeah we don't want this to have

1337
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:53,600
We have an opportunity

1338
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:56,416
To keep it from happening

1339
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:59,488
But how about

1340
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:02,560
NFL

1341
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:08,960
Is Jordan from the road

1342
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:13,312
Alex Jones

1343
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,296
Sister Alex

1344
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:24,320
Okay

1345
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:25,344
Georgia Lotto

1346
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:28,160
Probabilistic

1347
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:32,512
He always Records On

1348
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:33,280
Flame

1349
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:40,192
Text her on an iPhone recording on a plane

1350
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,544
There one more clip

1351
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:48,128
And it is

1352
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:49,408
Where I think

1353
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,688
Alex gives up

1354
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:53,248
Too much

1355
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,784
Of his insecurities

1356
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,344
I think they're showing her on full display

1357
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:01,696
As if he hasn't already been doing

1358
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,768
But I do almost every second

1359
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:08,352
But I think there's something you haven't really

1360
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,120
Securities about

1361
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:09,888
Necessarily

1362
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:10,656
Sure that's fair

1363
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:15,264
And I think he accidentally says

1364
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,800
Something that's very true

1365
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:19,616
Surrounded by a bunch of things that are

1366
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:35,744
Ridiculously good

1367
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:50,848
And it's just crazy

1368
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,552
And there we have it

1369
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:03,392
Isn't that an interesting set of sentence

1370
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:04,672
That is

1371
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:08,000
Przegryw

1372
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:13,632
Well the if that either or statement

1373
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:19,776
Drew

1374
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:20,544
Yep

1375
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:22,080
And I think

1376
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:25,408
That's why he has to reassure himself

1377
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:27,200
Alex no

1378
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:27,968
No

1379
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:31,808
And the part that he said before that like the story of it being like

1380
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,112
I was doubting a man

1381
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:37,440
But my God wanted me to be on the show

1382
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:40,256
That's what convinced

1383
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:42,304
Choppa's on an episode

1384
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:43,840
It's G

1385
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:50,496
Doesn't do like a super long interview but he tells Alex that he thinks his record is impeccable

1386
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:54,080
You can write about a lot of stuff and that he promises he won't let

1387
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,920
It's really really scary and super depressing

1388
01:30:58,944 --> 01:31:01,504
It was funny back when he wasn't present

1389
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:03,296
Things are a lot funny

1390
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:08,160
Jokes

1391
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,184
Whatever Jen

1392
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:12,000
We've come to the end

1393
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:18,144
The two days in the brand new experience

1394
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:22,240
I feel like from watching your face

1395
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:24,800
There was there was a moment of overwhelming

1396
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:25,568
Like I think

1397
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:28,384
The middle especially there was a looking

1398
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:30,944
Are these the feeling of you didn't want to go further

1399
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:35,296
There was definitely admit

1400
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:36,320
Shock

1401
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:42,464
Happy surprises

1402
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:44,000
As well

1403
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:48,096
I don't know

1404
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:52,192
Surprised like I'm glad

1405
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:52,960
Any children as you can

1406
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:57,568
But not divisible by

1407
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:04,480
That's pretty cool

1408
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:08,832
Glimmers of humanity within the shell of a

1409
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:10,112
Horrible horrible man

1410
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:11,648
I can't imagine

1411
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:14,208
Either

1412
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:16,512
Very tranquil or full of yellow

1413
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:21,888
She can't turn it off

1414
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:26,240
Well me and Jordan have been speculating that a lot of these products

1415
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:29,056
Who sells super male vitality

1416
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:33,408
There's a really decent chance

1417
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:36,992
That in all this aggression

1418
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:38,272
And stuff like that is

1419
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,064
Bridal

1420
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:41,600
Uncontrolled testosterone

1421
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:44,160
That doesn't turn off when you leave

1422
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:45,440
Your performance

1423
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:46,208
Studio

1424
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:47,744
That's

1425
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:48,768
Dangerous

1426
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:51,072
Is very dangerous

1427
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:53,376
I know

1428
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:55,936
Finish hair but

1429
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:05,664
You feel like he doesn't deserve it

1430
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,432
Football pro

1431
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:14,624
Do you think you will go back and explore Alex Jones ever again

1432
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:17,184
Not on purpose

1433
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,232
Cool cool cool

1434
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:21,792
I think I might I will be more acutely aware

1435
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:22,816
And probably interest

1436
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:24,864
If something about Alex

1437
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:27,424
Crosses

1438
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:29,728
These in the zeitgeist

1439
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:32,544
Definitely a new story about it

1440
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,312
People are

1441
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:35,616
Tweeting or Facebooking about

1442
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:37,152
I'm sure

1443
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:41,248
You got a little bit of

1444
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:43,552
Also this is very

1445
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:44,832
I would love to

1446
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:59,424
That's kind of one of our messages

1447
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:10,176
You are really summarizing things are providing some contacts

1448
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:15,808
Some jokes along the way laughing at his dumbass

1449
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:21,952
Experience with you cuz I'm creating this

1450
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:24,512
Pretty much everyday

1451
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:31,168
And I would recommend no one else do that if you want to get some of it

1452
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:32,448
Listen to this

1453
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:33,472
Yeah that's fun

1454
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:35,264
I think everyone says

1455
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,688
On the spot

1456
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:45,504
Music you want to listen

1457
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:48,320
That's what I've done here

1458
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:54,976
Legitimately if I could listen to if someone else was doing this I would listen to this f****** thing everyday

1459
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:58,304
I love doing this so much thank you for all for listening

1460
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,096
