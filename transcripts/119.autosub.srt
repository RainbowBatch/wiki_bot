1
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:05,120
Alex

2
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:11,520
Birthstone colors

3
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:23,296
And I don't know anything about Alex

4
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:26,112
To be doing those two things public

5
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:30,720
Indeed for the first time ever

6
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:34,304
Chicago

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,680
Did you want to give out ticket dreads

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,336
Microsoft Belmont

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,480
Halsted & Belmont that's where we are going to be 10:30 p.m. I believe tickets are $5

10
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:58,880
Might be able to sneak in a tube baby

11
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:04,000
Beaba that's that's great we'll have some beers for folks for walk

And also hilarious comedian mcburrows will be opening up the

13
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:15,008
Can't believe we got it

14
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:19,104
Very busy schedule is flying a back into town

15
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,736
Still happen timing workout that way but

16
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:31,136
M a hilarious dude needs my old partner from a referral to have him

17
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:35,232
If you can

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
Delis

19
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
Please come out

20
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,120
If you don't I understand

21
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:44,960
Sonja over there

22
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:51,616
Some of our Australian peeps they don't need to come you know

23
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:55,712
Because who knows when they'll get to see you again

24
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:00,320
Like if you are around

25
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,648
Come out it means a lot and I do come out

26
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,208
It will open up the possibility of us

27
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:06,976
In the future

28
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,768
So this first run

29
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:12,864
Is particularly important

30
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,656
Villagio

31
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:20,800
How dare you

32
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,944
Fun fun time

33
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,480
That's

34
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,248
Someone we love

35
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,624
Perfect clunky with smooth transition

36
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,440
Congratulations

37
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:43,072
We appreciate it so much

38
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:47,936
Great rookie for the Dodgers know

39
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:51,264
38 home runs

40
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,336
I also I'd like to give her a congratulation

41
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,920
To one of my dearest friends

42
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,320
Congratulations on being a global at Smith

43
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,720
Someone sodomites

44
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,488
Get me a bucket of poop

45
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,864
Congratulations and thank you so much

46
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
Thank you so much babe

47
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,168
You're the best

48
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:25,312
I want to feel in the audience on how difficult this episode was to make

49
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,128
We're getting a lot of work done up top

50
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,944
This episode today was

51
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,712
A disaster

52
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,248
We met up last night

53
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,784
Rent a couple drinks

54
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,880
At the bar trying to figure out what are we going to cover

55
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,440
Number possibilities

56
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,744
And the one that I was most excited about

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,024
Was a day

58
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,816
I was May 31st

59
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
2014

60
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,168
Bowe Bergdahl

61
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:56,288
Got the traded with some Guantanamo Bay prisoners right

62
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,056
Yes

63
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:03,712
I got really excited about that possibility I was like holy Schmidt I looked over on a calendar

64
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,760
And it turns out that that was a Saturday

65
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,784
So that mean

66
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,600
Someday when Alex Jones comes back to do his show

67
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,672
He's going to hurt both of those things obvious lady

68
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,256
He's got to talk Slenderman must going to be the best

69
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,839
And so I changed in with Bo Bergdahl because

70
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:24,959
The Slender Man did negotiate that.

71
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:29,055
Where we got into all this trouble in the first place exactly

72
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:33,407
I was hoping for something like that and so I get back from the bar I'm a little buzzed

73
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,247
Turn on that episode

74
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
I don't like

75
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,551
This is the craziest thing

76
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,599
In the world there's a lot of gas

77
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,135
And what it is

78
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,927
He's a murderer's row

79
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,207
Of Alex Jones

80
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,231
F****** lunatic

81
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,791
So we were talking Larry Pratt

82
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,351
Yaki's be had of the

83
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,679
Irgun loving NRA

84
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:00,799
Citizens guns or something like that they love it

85
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,335
We got Paul Craig Roberts

86
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,407
Who Alex Jones bills as the father of Reaganomics

87
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:11,807
The father of Jesus Bible is type guy

88
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,087
So there's that

89
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:13,855
Then

90
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,135
Jon rappoport

91
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,975
Holyshit

92
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,095
10

93
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,887
Cherry on top

94
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,911
Steve pieczenik

95
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:33,567
I'm like oh no I'd like we accidentally stumbled into the motherlode Slenderman

96
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,663
Don't see

97
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
You think about

98
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,599
Bowe Bergdahl

99
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,159
You know what they talk about

100
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,951
Elliot Rodger

101
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
The guy

102
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:55,327
Who ended up shooting up a bunch of people in California because

103
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,351
He couldn't get laid

104
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,631
Right that guy

105
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,655
So the whole time

106
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:03,263
A lot of the time

107
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,799
Just talk about Putin BJ

108
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,591
But Jon rappoport

109
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,663
And Steve pieczenik are both talking about how it was fake

110
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,735
Course it was and it made me so bummed

111
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:19,135
That's why I went back yet

112
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:23,999
Big big pile of bass shootings are false Flags is not a great live show

113
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,559
Excuse all white crime

114
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,887
Hey so I went back and I listen to a couple of shows the celebration of life

115
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:36,543
Well at least the pointing the finger at it but be that as it may I went back I listen to a little bit more

116
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,567
Actor Elliot Rodger

117
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,919
It'll take a week earlier Volkswagen out the gate

118
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,455
Really

119
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,015
But over the course of one episode he does anyway

120
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:49,343
I've learned a lot about his position on Elliot Rodger and it's

121
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:57,791
I can't use this for the cuz no Slenderman no Bowe Bergdahl

122
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:02,655
Like 5 hours of hours at Elliot Rodger and I don't want to tell you about it

123
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,151
What am I going to do

124
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,943
I texted you or like

125
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,247
I can't I can't do this I can't use this episode

126
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,039
Slenderman

127
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
No good luck sign

128
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,367
Something else but for today's episode 1

129
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
To keep up

130
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,975
I like just send me a f****** random date send me random

131
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
You send me a Saturday

132
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,303
Cuz I'm a failure

133
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,375
Disappointment in

134
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,191
And that you sent me a Saturday was August 11th

135
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
2012

136
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,519
And so that's a Saturday

137
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
Thankfully

138
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
Because it's Saturday

139
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,359
A bunch of other episodes

140
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,151
Near that date show up

141
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,175
Indeed the search

142
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,479
High speed

143
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,271
16th of

144
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,343
Looking at this gas place

145
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,903
We might be able to make this work

146
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
I'm so

147
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,487
Without spoiling

148
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
We have

149
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,935
One of the most bizarre things that has ever happened before

150
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,775
It's actually this episode

151
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
August

152
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,823
16th 2012

153
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,151
The weirdest things ever

154
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,711
And one of them involves the other involves

155
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,271
A special report that Alex does

156
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,039
What is

157
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:32,255
Cannot wait to tell you about this starts the show this is literally

158
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,535
Really the beginning of the show

159
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:40,191
All right ladies and gentlemen I just got off the phone with

160
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
Garage

161
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,975
ABC CBS everything you are

162
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
Commented

163
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,751
Contacts to make a big deal out of

164
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,311
Show we need to get

165
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,319
That decision myself

166
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,279
Dave Mustaine

167
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,559
Just got off the phone with

168
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:48,287
Celebrity

169
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,103
Cuz no one remembers this

170
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:57,759
No one remembers I understand correctly what what happened at this time

171
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,039
Was Dave Mustaine

172
00:09:59,295 --> 00:09:59,807
Came out

173
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,855
And that Obama false Flags

174
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:06,207
Well that's what you just heard from the clip remember that

175
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:10,047
Stone Rivers Dave Mustaine news

176
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,679
The headline of the Megadeth concert to share his instinct

177
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,471
Conspiracy theories about the president

178
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,239
Already

179
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031
Grilling

180
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,103
You had oil my friend

181
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,551
In a video posted to YouTube by a fan

182
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:37,951
Video shop in put a few to buy a fan those picked up a week later by a metal news

183
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,999
Whose website called blabbermouth.net

184
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,071
Mustang pauses between songs by The Fan

185
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,887
For checking a Chuck Taylor in his general direction

186
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,191
Holy what's wrong with you

187
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,471
The quote

188
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:55,871
The weather then accuses the president of the United States

189
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
The movie theater in Aurora

190
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,991
Colorado mvic temple in Oak Creek Wisconsin

191
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
Quotes

192
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,295
My president

193
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,319
Here do you mind

194
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,367
Themself making himself bar

195
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,439
Like all serious speakers of Truth to power do from time

196
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:15,839
I'll bring this from a Grantland article license a chops here

197
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,631
The gun ban

198
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:24,031
Restaging all of these murders like the Fast and Furious thing down at the border and Aurora Colorado and all the people that were killed

199
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,591
And now the beautiful people at the Sikh temple

200
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,359
Pause

201
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
God

202
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:32,479
I don't know where I'm going to live with Americans going it's going

203
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
But it looks like it's

204
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,039
Turning into Nazi America

205
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,319
Right

206
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:39,903
This is fun

207
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:40,927
Because

208
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,231
It's strange to me that he would both

209
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,815
Be like Obama's false flagging all of us to get rid of guns

210
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,119
While at the same time being like

211
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:49,887
The 6th

212
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,423
People are

213
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,215
People are a beautiful and wonderful

214
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,031
Yeah we don't see that type of accept

215
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,335
And conspiracy theory in the same set

216
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:02,175
It's rare but Dave Mustaine

217
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
Weather

218
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,015
Volkswagen deicide

219
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,551
Cuz that's nonsense

220
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,367
Furious is a really calm

221
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Complicated thing

222
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
But

223
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,719
Wasn't that the one where the

224
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,487
Actually

225
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:19,839
Gays guns away

226
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:25,471
Have you taken across the border B cutout clearly buying them for

227
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,519
Illegal purposes in Mexico

228
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:31,359
And ostensibly the idea was that they would have these illegal guns

229
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,895
Be able to roll up

230
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,663
The people

231
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,711
Who ended up taking possession of the gun

232
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,991
Cuz they had

233
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
Space

234
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,551
In their own ability to use

235
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,343
It wouldn't end up

236
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,623
You're leading to the death of

237
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:47,487
A bunch of a later discovered should not have had faith in their capabilities

238
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
Whatsoever

239
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,607
Incredibly complicated is a

240
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,887
Do the emails in the document

241
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,935
Instead of come out about the people

242
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,215
Used to say that it's

243
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,263
False

244
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,799
Eric Holder in the

245
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,847
The boj we're just trying to

246
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:09,759
False flagging around in order to get gun ban

247
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,319
And it just doesn't really it doesn't really work

248
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,367
All that well for a number of reasons

249
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,159
The first of all is that

250
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,463
Though Fast and Furious as it

251
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,231
It was

252
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,023
Known started in 2000

253
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,071
It was based on and

254
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,095
Continuation of

255
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,119
Something called operation

256
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,143
Receiver

257
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,935
Butcher started in 2006

258
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,959
When Alberto

259
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,727
Gonzales

260
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,007
Charge of the doj

261
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
Operation

262
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,335
It's been happening

263
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,871
Down in the Southwest

264
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,711
To some extent

265
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,879
I am

266
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,927
Absolutely not happy about it

267
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,231
The same time I do understand the motivation

268
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,559
Incredibly misguided way to do things

269
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,863
But from the sense I get

270
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,167
There is at there is a bit of like

271
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
Okay

272
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,471
He's just dumb law enforcement

273
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:06,335
Volkswagen in order to get people killed

274
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
It's just

275
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:08,895
Send it.

276
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:12,223
Seems like they were like okay well

277
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,039
The same thing right

278
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,367
Right make sense

279
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,719
But be that as it may stand people

280
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,255
I'm fairly against

281
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:28,863
Right but I also understand the reasoning

282
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,631
4

283
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,167
In extreme situation

284
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,447
That using

285
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
Maybe unconventional

286
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,239
Conventional

287
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
Technique

288
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
At the same time I don't know

289
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
I can't unpack it

290
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,407
All I know is that Alex Jones is wrong about it

291
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,711
I meant Eric Holder did

292
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,015
He may have lied about it

293
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,039
Underoath

294
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,831
Or may have lied about

295
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,111
What he knew

296
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
And I'm not

297
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,183
Defend Eric Holder

298
00:14:54,207 --> 00:15:00,351
Doesn't matter what team you're on your way I don't know but there's also

299
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,655
Possibility that this stuff was going on

300
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,703
Was unaware of it because it's

301
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:09,055
I don't know I don't know how the organization of these like

302
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,335
Doj goes

303
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,639
There's probably some stuff that goes on

304
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,687
But not everybody's aware of

305
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:24,927
I don't know I don't know what the compartmentalization of everybody's jobs are

306
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,951
I don't know

307
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,767
So I don't know how malicious the lie was

308
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,839
How much it was just a mission or whatever

309
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,655
All the emails the talk about like

310
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,703
Maybe we can get that too

311
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
Regulation

312
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,335
Purchases and stuff like that

313
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,871
Yeah I don't

314
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,687
It's not a propaganda campaign

315
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,223
But be that as it may

316
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,783
You might not also remember what that

317
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,807
Shooting was

318
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,831
I do not remember

319
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,903
That was one that people forgot about pretty

320
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,927
Pretty easily

321
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,231
Wisconsin

322
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,631
Two Fair there's a guy named Wade Michael page

323
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,679
Who was a 40-year old white dude

324
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,983
He walked into a Sikh temple

325
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,823
Six people and wounded four other people

326
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,687
Yeah it's not like

327
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,479
Murdering

328
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,527
But it made me really bummed out cuz everyone

329
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,831
It was between 39 and 84

330
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:28,415
He's killing a bunch of just old people trying to

331
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,951
Practice her faith

332
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,255
It's not like age matters

333
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:36,863
I don't I don't know it doesn't

334
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,887
For some reason

335
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:45,567
Michael page had a very deep connection

336
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,847
Two white supremacists

337
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,615
Groups

338
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:51,967
The number of

339
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:56,575
You might call his white supremacist power bands

340
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:01,439
You got it

341
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,975
Nope

342
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,559
He was and apathy

343
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,095
In 2005

344
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,143
And played in the band

345
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
Definite hate

346
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
Is blue-eyed devils

347
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
Okay

348
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,311
Yeah I guess so

349
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:22,943
Do the Army dude he was in the Army discharge

350
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,735
General discharge

351
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,039
Neither neither honorable or dishonorable because

352
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,063
Pattern

353
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,831
Misconduct

354
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:36,767
Drunk driving

355
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,303
Dishonorably discharged

356
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,703
Yeah it up by becoming radicalized at some point maybe already was when he was in the army

357
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,007
Man that fell in with white supremacist groups

358
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,335
And ended up going to

359
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,359
Killing

360
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,175
Six people and injuring others four others

361
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:58,527
Subway really super wild is that like this part

362
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,807
Blew my f****** mind

363
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,087
Yeah it's

364
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,879
Not a positive but it made

365
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:08,255
Ended up

366
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,047
No showing up

367
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,583
And

368
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,399
He ended up I think it was his gun

369
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,423
Duck shooting

370
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
The Wade

371
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:20,031
Waited up killing himself after he got shot by the cops

372
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,823
Yeah

373
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,847
Ryan Murphy

374
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,895
Ended up getting shot by this dude

375
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,943
This guy a******

376
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,967
Yeah he shot him

377
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,991
15 time

378
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,807
Close range

379
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,855
15 * 50 *

380
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,671
Close range include

381
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,439
In the back of the head

382
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,999
And the dude survive

383
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,815
Yeah Brian Murphy Murphy survive

384
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:47,167
I told you people can with jingle a surprising number of gunshots

385
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:50,239
New york-based

386
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,543
Pledged a $10,000 award to Murphy

387
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:56,895
To seek residents of Yuba City California donated another hundred thousand dollars

388
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,431
Officer Murphy and praise

389
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:05,343
My God this is kind of a nice nice piece of how good these people are

390
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,623
Respond

391
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,903
To such tragedy

392
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
This way

393
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,767
In this situation

394
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:24,031
I don't know anyways

395
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,711
Again mysteriously it is a white supremacist guy murdering minority

396
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,295
It's very fascinating to me

397
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,319
To be real and their work

398
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,391
So anyway let's get on to this next clip

399
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,159
Wie geht's

400
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,439
It's more about David

401
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,023
Amanda Alex makes a dumb prediction

402
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:49,375
Mustang

403
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:53,215
Asia a few days ago in California

404
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,407
And

405
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,991
Obama

406
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
Lamp shades

407
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,391
Aurora and in Wisconsin

408
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,231
It's a big National story

409
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,511
Also

410
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,839
I need to dump Biden

411
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,471
Omni gets elected

412
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,799
How did Nappa die

413
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,335
I don't think I have

414
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
Biden

415
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,943
Still in play

416
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,503
You did not get dropped

417
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,319
Notebook

418
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,343
Some shooting

419
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,135
That's part of what

420
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,071
There's another shooting

421
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,607
Or is another incident

422
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,191
Gets into it

423
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
A little bit here

424
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
It's very

425
00:20:59,263 --> 00:20:59,775
Very different

426
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
Situation

427
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,871
Family research Council

428
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,551
Weather in shot some people

429
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,135
Mustang and a terrorist

430
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
This

431
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,584
Is Ally was going to say that sounds very faults

432
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
July

433
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:29,216
Reasons and I don't support

434
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,240
Guy who ran into

435
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
The family research

436
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,032
Console with a gun

437
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:37,408
But one of the reasons

438
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,944
But it's probably less than

439
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,224
Severe and maybe not

440
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,040
Cena is a horrible acts of terrorism is that no one with

441
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,112
I don't think anyone was even seriously injured

442
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,672
It wasn't good guy with a gun

443
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,720
Someone wrestled the gun away from

444
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,488
From the guy

445
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,768
Halo good guy

446
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:58,400
Attica

447
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:01,984
But it wasn't the good guy with a gun that's not brave enough

448
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,032
To step up and I mean I don't

449
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,568
I don't think that you need to really

450
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,360
I don't know I don't know if it's healthy to

451
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,384
Glamorise rental

452
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,712
People think it's a smart thing to do

453
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,272
Not have done that it

454
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,296
Probably would have been

455
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,880
I am so I think the reason

456
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,416
Is the severity of it is

457
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,696
Much lower than

458
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,488
A Sikh temple which is

459
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,024
We targeted for

460
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,048
They're religious an F

461
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,352
Ethnic minority

462
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,656
That multiple people were murdered

463
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,704
Write a police officer was shot 50

464
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
Cooking times

465
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,032
That was more terrorists

466
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,824
And the guy was a member of The Hague

467
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,920
That seems like a big part of being terrorists

468
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:46,016
Having a Ed entire ideology behind you

469
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:49,856
You can easily make the argument and I'll go along with you halfway

470
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,136
You split the guy who win

471
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,184
The family research Council

472
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,952
Some sort of like

473
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,560
Maybe he was part of some life group

474
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:03,424
Possible I don't know I don't know either

475
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,728
Just seems like it was a guy who didn't like people

476
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,776
Supporting Chick-fil-A

477
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,592
That's a little bit

478
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
Papa's

479
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:24,928
Are brilliant

480
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,952
Very

481
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:31,840
So I remember if you recall correctly when we talked about Alex's coverage

482
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,120
Chick-fil-A billboard

483
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,704
But if you understand this

484
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,240
You are bored

485
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,032
Understand everything

486
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,568
So now

487
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,616
In the middle of this episode

488
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
Alex Jones

489
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,152
Play the specials

490
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,456
And I want you to

491
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,736
Brian guess

492
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,528
What this special report is

493
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,320
Is about I'm going to play

494
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,600
This first clip

495
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,672
And see if you have any idea what he's about to talk about

496
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,488
Alex Jones

497
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,352
Any ideas

498
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:14,592
How Dave Mustaine should never been kicked out of Metallica not to eat

499
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,944
There is ever talk

500
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,504
Do you want another clue before you go

501
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,088
This information is very closely held

502
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
Want you

503
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,720
Understanding

504
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,256
Okay so it's both

505
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,536
Andeli Corporation

506
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,352
Yes

507
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,376
Keeps us all in chain

508
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,656
Brighton

509
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:47,104
Edgewater

510
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,896
Interesting gas I'll give you another clue

511
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:53,248
Large swathes of the global population

512
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,296
DIA

513
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,600
The real geopolitical paradigm

514
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:05,280
In the battle for 21st century global

515
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,816
Hegemony

516
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,376
What blood did you have any idea what he's about to talk about

517
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,424
Any idea

518
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:18,080
I mean he's always talked about

519
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,968
Who really rules

520
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,320
Usher

521
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,672
The General

522
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,792
I mean

523
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,584
Okay what do you think

524
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,608
He's about

525
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,216
Think it's about to become the

526
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,496
Here's the issue

527
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,032
Where's the beef

528
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:51,616
What's the most successful at Camp Wendy's ever had

529
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,408
And it's red hair b****

530
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,176
Nah

531
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,456
This is the most

532
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
Import

533
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,248
Information Alex

534
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,528
Has ever had

535
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,576
Closely-held information

536
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,904
It has to do with

537
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,976
And the global hegemony

538
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,512
That is all

539
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,048
At all times

540
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,608
Do you have any idea

541
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
Okay

542
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,656
Get ready for this

543
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:19,008
Illustration

544
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:27,456
Look at these symptoms of

545
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,552
Ultimate living

546
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:38,720
Cesare Borgia

547
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,536
The game of Risk

548
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:48,192
A game of Monopoly

549
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,984
Important because otherwise we're going to have

550
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:56,384
Harbor Freight clamp

551
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,152
Find a control

552
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:57,920
Maui

553
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,992
Boys are blue girl.

554
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,904
This isn't Candyland everybody we're not going to have fun doing that

555
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:14,048
Shoot a ladder

556
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,584
Is

557
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,352
Crazy

558
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,632
This is so crazy

559
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,448
I can't even explain to you how much ice

560
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,240
Huh

561
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,592
It indicates to me a couple things

562
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,872
It's Bill time

563
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,176
Do you think his audience

564
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,200
Really stupid

565
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:34,272
Like the idea that it's like okay I'm going to explain

566
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,832
My bizarre theories about like

567
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,624
Global

568
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,208
Board games

569
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:45,280
Just like how it's like

570
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:51,424
Like a comet comes up with an open microphone at their place in there just kind of looking around

571
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,032
This

572
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,640
Superman

573
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:04,736
He was sitting there like he was whacked out of his mind

574
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:11,136
Who's on cocaine

575
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,280
So let's

576
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:20,608
Patton Oswalt about

577
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,144
Let me explain lucky

578
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,704
Now the rainbows

579
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,472
In the clovers

580
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,496
They're sweet

581
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,056
Traditional pagan

582
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,848
Symbols

583
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,128
The weed stuff

584
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:32,896
Is a cross

585
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,664
Said it's all that

586
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,712
What they're trying to tell you

587
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,736
Is that the path

588
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:37,504
The good

589
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,528
Bland

590
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,296
Tasteless

591
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,184
That's smarter

592
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,000
Alex Jones

593
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,280
Starts his analysis

594
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:50,816
About Chess

595
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,608
And I'm not talking about

596
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,144
Musical

597
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,960
Includes the great song One Night in Bangkok

598
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:58,240
This is

599
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,312
Musical was about the game chess

600
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,336
Anyway here's h

601
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,456
I'm going to use a chef set

602
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,808
Forms of government

603
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,856
Domination

604
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,648
If you look at this

605
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:20,256
Doesn't even have a child on the bottom

606
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:27,680
Beginnings of civilization more than 6000 years ago

607
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,984
The black sacrifice was the model

608
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,008
Warfare

609
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
Between

610
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,176
Warfare and politics was carried out

611
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,040
She's already off base a little bit there

612
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,320
Vig

613
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:47,136
Her like until very recently

614
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,440
Didn't play a big role in

615
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,512
Tribal

616
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,304
Nation

617
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,096
They have the right to be called Nation

618
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,400
Complicated

619
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,192
Between each other

620
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:02,496
That sucks

621
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:06,336
It goes a long way back the phrase the enemy of my enemy is my friend

622
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:09,664
Right and even if you consider like to talk about

623
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,688
Eastern

624
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:13,760
Cuz that's even more

625
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,064
Understand what goal is and that's never going to happen

626
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,184
Right he's already started off his analysis with her like a pretty productive

627
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,464
View of

628
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,488
Complex

629
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,024
Denver overtime

630
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,888
Yeah it let's see let's see

631
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,848
Is the fact that

632
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,128
Sometimes

633
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,248
Against each other

634
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,296
When they had rebellions at home

635
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:57,536
The population of young male

636
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,584
Jobs

637
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,632
How does that relate to chess

638
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,424
Call the ponds

639
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,008
Freeloaders

640
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:07,776
Economy

641
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:14,176
They're unemployed

642
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:17,248
The manufacturing bases

643
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,272
That's what I learned

644
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:22,112
From Chattanooga to protect the learned about prosperity

645
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:28,000
I mean I guess if you want to do a really wild interpretation

646
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,048
You could say that

647
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:30,816
But I don't

648
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,376
I don't think that relates to

649
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,656
Jobs

650
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:40,032
Well you know you're trying to get rid of your religious powers

651
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,848
They're the ones who are causing all of this insurrection

652
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:49,248
They're the ones who are going to leave the

653
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,296
People that are

654
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,088
Do you know what

655
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,624
I'm over on Alex

656
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,184
Side right now I know

657
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,512
When using cats as their model for global domination

658
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,584
For thousands of years you're probably right

659
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:11,008
Multiple

660
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:16,128
Parker Brothers

661
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,248
It's hard for me to take this seriously when it's the same uses to sell Beyond Tangy Tangerine

662
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,016
But

663
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,880
Their financing

664
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,024
Starting on the 17th

665
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:36,864
Factions

666
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:41,216
Because all of them

667
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,288
After the war

668
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,336
They were not allowed to pass go

669
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,128
And collect $200

670
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:54,272
But like did we already discussed on the last episode The anti-semitic nature of his relationship

671
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,808
The Rothschilds

672
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,624
And with cats apparel

673
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:05,024
And about the history of their their family

674
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,096
It's 08

675
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:08,864
It's difficult

676
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,400
Take too much that he says about them

677
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,984
Seriously and also when you look at this history that he's talking

678
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,544
About funding both sides of a war

679
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,568
That is

680
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:23,200
You believe that everyone is on the same team and they're all global

681
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,248
Cuz if you talk about like

682
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,064
Bread Coke or Prescott Bush

683
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,880
Or IRA Ford supporting the Nazis

684
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,416
In World War II

685
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:35,744
If you can see both of them on the same side

686
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,024
5 people who supported

687
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:39,840
Ben

688
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:45,984
I guess they're controlling both sides but if you don't if you look at them as

689
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,520
Conflicting operations

690
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,056
That have

691
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,104
Intertwined business interests

692
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,408
So they don't kill each other or whatever cuz

693
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,176
You'll date

694
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,200
Still running business

695
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:58,016
But our guests but artwork

696
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:01,600
Getting together in some weird oneworld globalist operation

697
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,136
But they're not

698
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:08,768
Okay fine but this also goes to like

699
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,048
Just the history of

700
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,888
Kind of stupid Lee supporting

701
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,680
Factions in wardsville no business

702
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:18,496
Which is something that unfortunately

703
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,544
We have been involved with a lot

704
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,312
Pretty much

705
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:25,664
It's not like we have a

706
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,480
Refinance and taking over

707
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,808
Gun manufacturers

708
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,464
Everybody

709
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,232
Alright

710
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:44,352
Guatemala

711
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,984
In Bosnia during the during World War

712
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,432
Churchill was a piece of s*** about it and then

713
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:01,760
Territory

714
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,528
Death-squad

715
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,320
He has a fair point if

716
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,344
If you believe

717
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,392
The central premise

718
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,696
That there are global

719
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,720
And they're all working

720
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,000
Together

721
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:14,304
You don't believe that new think the world's a little more

722
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,328
Complicated

723
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,120
And you think there are people

724
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,912
Both sides

725
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,192
Running operation

726
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,984
Sam's and stuff like that

727
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,520
To further their own in

728
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,336
That are at odds with each other

729
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,896
Start to look at the world I think

730
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:35,296
In a more realistic what come into the show

731
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,576
With something prepared

732
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,344
Good for you

733
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,904
And I'm going to play you a recording of

734
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,208
Of how I explain how Henry Ford

735
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,488
Kissinger

736
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,328
Who are the three main players in the globalist Empire

737
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,888
Okay.

738
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,168
Okay

739
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,520
Rap God that's fine cuz at this point Alex Jones Mouzon to risk

740
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:03,200
Distill down

741
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,760
Human conflict and domination

742
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:13,696
Jerry's all have basically

743
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,912
Are you reading the rules

744
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,960
What is the temperature

745
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,544
Was it worth

746
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,592
I can't understand conflict

747
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:34,432
Can we boil it down into a game I can play in a few hours

748
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:40,064
I sure sure but we're going to need to have Dyson cards

749
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,208
How many immediately does a

750
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,048
There is no discussion here

751
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,352
I'm looking at the real model

752
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,888
We are under today

753
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,056
The game of Monopoly

754
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,080
Let's

755
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:11,552
That's all he says about video game

756
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,576
Streamers on Twitch

757
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:15,392
He's got a whole nother career

758
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:19,488
Pivot to I'm just him scribing board games

759
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,304
Set alarm

760
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,912
Monopoly by himself

761
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:33,312
Alex Jones start it up

762
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:39,456
Errors in your favor are actually

763
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,224
Standard

764
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,272
In the game of Monopoly

765
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,120
New York City

766
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:02,240
Already talked it up if it landed City Atlantic City

767
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,032
Already started

768
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:12,224
But good analysis so far

769
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,040
You know it it's those sorts of things that are like

770
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,064
I mean

771
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,392
When you don't know the basic

772
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,416
Pieces of something

773
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:27,072
And that you're trying to deeply analyze it so it fits your version of the world it makes me think that you don't

774
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:30,400
You don't care enough to understand your subject

775
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:35,008
He threw this together whenever he was sitting in his study like I don't have it

776
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:35,776
Time to sell

777
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:40,384
Always win at Monopoly

778
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,408
SalusCare

779
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,992
Monopoly

780
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,576
Strategy

781
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:52,928
Pictures of the real system

782
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,000
Grounded Rockefeller

783
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,048
Competition

784
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,608
Is it real quick

785
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,680
Fairly misunderstood

786
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,448
I believe

787
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,728
From what I can tell

788
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,032
A better way to

789
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,056
Sort of unpack that

790
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,848
Is VIP

791
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,384
Diaz it is everybody's

792
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,176
Competing for the same thing

793
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:14,944
There's no money

794
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,064
That the quote is actually in the context of supporting innovation

795
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,624
I'm changing the model of what you're doing

796
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,696
In order so you're not competing with people everybody cancel

797
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,464
6 Yvette

798
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,000
If everybody is trying

799
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:28,768
Innovate

800
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,816
And constantly doing other things

801
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:35,680
They won't be in direct competition with each other

802
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,728
Spiritual version of competition

803
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,264
But it's really just about like a

804
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,824
If you and I are trying to do literally the exact same thing

805
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,104
And Myra

806
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,896
Wind takes away from you

807
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,176
It's not good for either of us

808
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:52,064
What does I'm going to either be motivated on keeping you down one of us has to lose

809
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,832
It's nonsense

810
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,112
Do the same time

811
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,928
Betrothed so true

812
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:02,816
Particular though is

813
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:05,376
Political power

814
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:10,752
The barrel of a gun quotes that are taking everybody knows them but they don't really know the

815
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,776
Contact

816
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,312
I don't like Alex

817
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,080
Is just misusing

818
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,128
EXO

819
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:16,896
I mean whatever

820
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:17,920
That's again

821
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:20,480
Monopoly is in New York kind of stuff

822
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,784
It's just a while willful lack of

823
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,576
Engaging with

824
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,344
The things he's

825
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,904
So you're the last clip

826
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,696
Now this is

827
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,720
It's designed that board

828
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:35,072
Monopoly

829
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:40,704
Drop a chessboard on top of an overlay

830
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,240
I'm in

831
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:46,592
4:10 report but like the last four minutes we can just

832
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:50,688
Rambling and has nothing to do with board games anymore

833
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,712
Pertinent to

834
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,480
The report

835
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,552
Monopoly

836
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,344
Describe

837
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,672
Shelters

838
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:12,960
You think

839
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:16,032
Houses and apartments

840
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,592
Park Place in for the electric company

841
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:27,552
How to get out of jail free card

842
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,344
Control

843
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,768
What happened

844
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,048
Country

845
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,864
What happened

846
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,400
The African nation

847
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,704
Play the Monopoly game

848
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,080
The modern

849
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,640
Master System based in London and New York

850
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,623
Alright

851
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,559
Disagree with what he's

852
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,607
Trying to say

853
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,655
Silly and stupid

854
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:17,983
He then launches into a long thing about

855
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:18,751
Like

856
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:23,871
Hayden Al-Qaeda to destabilize countries in

857
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,431
But like the part of it

858
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:32,575
You've established your trying to use board games board game references

859
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,343
It's just like this

860
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,111
Brett

861
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,671
Hey people to invade countries in Risk

862
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,743
The top hat who's controlling your gay

863
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,815
And the bank doesn't win in Monopoly

864
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,119
The bank is not a character in the game

865
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:50,239
Like there's no point at which nothing

866
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,031
Snowman games at the bank

867
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:54,335
They're playing their winning every game

868
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,663
I guess so

869
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:00,223
The game Monopoly

870
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:03,295
This whole thing goes all the way back

871
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,319
To The Rock

872
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,087
Fellers

873
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,623
Our globe

874
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,647
And let me get back in

875
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,415
Chairman Mao

876
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,207
Right this is where we getting

877
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,231
The game of Risk

878
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,791
You know what German Mauser

879
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,095
Milton Bradley

880
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,423
Great leader Milton Bradley

881
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,703
I just

882
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,239
I just don't know man

883
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,055
I just don't know what you

884
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:25,823
You doing

885
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,639
But it tickled me a little bit

886
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:32,735
So we're done with that whatever he was just

887
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,759
Crazy

888
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,807
Yeah it is any kind of refreshing

889
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:47,327
Prior to this week

890
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,863
Temple ideas like

891
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,543
Terrorist

892
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,823
Because he was going up a

893
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:58,847
Their side

894
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,711
To bring home

895
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,991
Real f****** clue

896
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:07,295
Is that even back then

897
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:12,159
He still suffered from the same problems that we complain about now

898
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,207
No one cared about him back then

899
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,559
He didn't have a real

900
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,607
Dangerous effect on

901
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:26,495
Affiliation to the point of subservient

902
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,775
With a

903
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:28,799
Racist

904
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,591
Eddie Taiwan

905
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:33,151
Yeah

906
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:44,159
Alright so we put the board game away we broken down the leg

907
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:50,559
Find out why did you play that 10-minute special report that made no sense

908
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,583
Here's why

909
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:52,863
There are

910
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,655
Thousands of articles

911
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,191
Thousand

912
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:04,127
The Rock's albums

913
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:12,063
The president the criminal a liar a few weeks ago on the show

914
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:17,183
Special Report

915
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,071
Interview with

916
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,399
It's a video interview

917
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:34,847
We will Eric hear on the radio

918
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,455
Movies

919
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:41,759
Researcher

920
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:45,087
Richard Belzer Hellyeah

921
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,463
TV star researcher

922
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,231
Isabel

923
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:56,607
He's not going to throw, can there

924
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,911
He was the original opening comics

925
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:01,471
For Saturday Night Live

926
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:06,335
He was in the first ever episode of Saturday Night Live as a like extra

927
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:10,175
Absolutely

928
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:12,479
He's written a couple books about JFK

929
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,759
UFO books

930
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,783
Play conspiracy books

931
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:20,671
I've read a couple of engaging writer

932
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,463
I'm not sure if I believe any of them

933
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:26,815
We're not going to listen to really any of Richard Belzer on the show cuz

934
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:31,679
He's on and all it is is him talking about JFK stop and for my money

935
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:35,007
Those things that are covered on Alex Jones Show

936
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,311
JFK's the closest to real

937
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:40,639
And it's not that interesting to me because

938
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:47,039
Richard Belzer comes in with a lot of specifics in a lot of things that he's looked and there's a lot of questions that he has

939
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:50,623
And Alex really can't hang with specific music

940
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,671
And it's not really all that fun

941
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:55,487
So we're not going to listen to that but big shout out

942
00:46:55,999 --> 00:47:02,143
What's up Richard Belzer order universes

943
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,167
John Munch

944
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:05,983
Character ever

945
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,543
How did you get on Arrested Development

946
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:12,639
You're on The Simpsons that means cartoons and real-life are the same

947
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:19,551
A robot

948
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,439
In this next clip Alex

949
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,487
The bunch of his narrative

950
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:28,767
Then turns them all into

951
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:29,535
Is weird

952
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:34,655
Bouillabaisse of First Amendment complaints

953
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,847
Temple shooting we have that

954
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,383
Family research Council shooting

955
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,175
They're all sort of combined into one

956
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,455
Something along with

957
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,223
Chick-fil-A

958
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:52,063
It is a visit a mess

959
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:52,831
A cold

960
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:56,159
Stupidest just ice cream gone wrong I think that's the truth Bass

961
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,183
Call Beyond

962
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,975
Multiple

963
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:03,071
People chasing eyewitnesses

964
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,095
Real quick

965
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,119
First account

966
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,423
Generally are the most unreliable things

967
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,959
In terms of

968
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,543
Shootings in America

969
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:16,895
No generally In the Heat of the Moment you misinterpret all kinds of cues and things that you

970
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:17,663
You see because

971
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,687
You're in shock

972
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:23,039
Your adrenaline is Hanover charge

973
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:25,087
Some people thought there were four shooters

974
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,367
To me doesn't mean any

975
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:27,903
Especially

976
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,207
Westgate

977
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,279
No one's like

978
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:40,447
We need to look at that sweet be idiots

979
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,311
I just breaking just like

980
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:49,407
With the Dixie Chicks sing the interview with the war they're trying to cancel it

981
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:55,807
Chick-fil-A

982
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:59,391
You've got to support the First Amendment with these bullies

983
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,951
Has shot up the family research

984
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,279
Family

985
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:06,815
Research Council

986
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,351
Saturday

987
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:10,399
Launch Chick-fil-A

988
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:14,239
You got to support the First Amendment

989
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,567
And we'll have that exclusive Dave Mustaine statement

990
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:21,151
The 1st of July is the boardwalk

991
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,711
The guy who shot up

992
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,991
The Sikh temple

993
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,319
But the guy who didn't

994
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,343
Kill anybody

995
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,879
The family research Council

996
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,671
Terrorist

997
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,695
Two faults to be a

998
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,231
True false

999
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,095
Then First Amendment

1000
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,887
Issues are the dicks

1001
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:48,287
Whatever the Dixie Chicks are doing that he was very very not happy

1002
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:54,687
I don't know cuz he hates George Bush 2 though so I mean it's it's entirely possible I'm willing to believe

1003
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,223
He very well may have

1004
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,247
I've been again

1005
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:04,927
What is a compelling argument without going back to that I am not willing

1006
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,463
Going to make a prediction

1007
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:08,255
Can because I would not be surprised

1008
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,279
If you supported

1009
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,559
Because

1010
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,095
Kihei to George W bush.

1011
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:14,143
So that's possible I don't know

1012
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,703
But those two things are a little

1013
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,727
Chick-fil-A

1014
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,007
Being like

1015
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,055
We don't like gays coming in

1016
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,103
Note 4

1017
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,663
I don't feel like it is

1018
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:29,247
Discrimination and that's where the libertarian stuff gets

1019
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,015
Get money

1020
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:30,783
In with him

1021
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,551
Because

1022
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,343
I mean

1023
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,367
Businesses

1024
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:36,671
Are that you run your business

1025
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:37,951
And what have you but it is a

1026
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:38,719
Public space

1027
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,743
It's not a private

1028
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:40,511
Space

1029
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,279
Necessarily

1030
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:49,471
Decide if you want to know what the free market is going to be

1031
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,239
Takes you down

1032
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:53,311
It's definitely not going to be supported by all of your other races

1033
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,591
These people

1034
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:57,919
You're not going to have Dave Mustaine getting weaved in on it

1035
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,199
MMA

1036
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:04,575
Two chicks getting thrown in for no reason

1037
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:07,391
If that's a weird thing that Dave Mustaine also said in China

1038
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,159
At that,

1039
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:12,255
Have you guys been to this no black people allowed Diner over there it's

1040
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,023
Amazing

1041
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,815
Brighten and you know like

1042
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,839
In the name of

Are you gotta support dating

1046
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,407
I don't see why you wouldn't make that argument

1047
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,711
Based on the logic if someone

1048
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,783
Aladdin restaurant

1049
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:41,183
Makeup set from races

1050
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,975
It's whenever they are

1051
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:47,071
They're against the Civil Rights Act

1052
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:51,167
Encroachment

1053
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:53,215

Wild violets

1055
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:57,055
It's just like with this cake

1056
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,079
Situation

1057
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,871
Let's go to the Supreme Court of like

1058
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:00,639
We don't have

1059
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,431
His free speech

1060
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:06,015
Specifically because you're gay

1061
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,087
You could have lied

1062
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:15,487
You could have just lied and everyone have been everybody would have known that it was discrimination but we wouldn't have taken it to this

1063
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,511
Supreme Court

1064
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:20,607
Text Leah question about literally this situation

1065
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:33,919
Probably

1066
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:40,063
This is not one of those issues

1067
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:42,367
We the bad guys

1068
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:45,439
It does

1069
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,463
Lehigh

1070
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,231
Right now

1071
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:52,607
Are you have this attitude like you've got all these libertarian fooling you while you're high

1072
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:54,655
Look

1073
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,983
Before Richard Belzer Hells Bells comes in

1074
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,519
Another gas

1075

Gentleman by the name of Gerald Celente

1076
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:04,383
From the trends research whatever

1077
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:08,223
Usually just

1078
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:12,063
And of course it always usually revolves around a common theme

1079
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,087
Which is the right here

1080
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,623
The real

1081
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,391
Crashing

1082
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:18,975
The Indian rupee

1083
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:30,751
I love his voice

1084
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:32,799
Oh he's a ghoul

1085
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,223
Is solute

1086
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,503
Is he safe

1087
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,039
Alex

1088
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:46,623
Giving me credit for calling all of this s***

1089
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,903
I'm smarter than Soros

1090
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:54,303
No no no you talk about other people who are like oh now Soros is buying gold we should buy gold what about

1091
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,839
Sing it forever

1092
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:59,423
Kind of a problem because you're on a sucking radio show

1093
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:04,031
Brought

1094
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,055
Mutations

1095
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:09,663
That is run by Ted Anderson

1096
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:14,783
Is on the show frequently selling gold on the show Gerald

1097
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:15,551
That's why

1098
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:18,879
Cuz you're part of a scam operation that's right

1099
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:22,207
It's not about the golden itself per se it's more

1100
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:27,839
Select

1101
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,375

Talenti

1103
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:31,423
I would

1104
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:36,543
I don't remember my own name most of the type I would have the same complaints about George Soros

1105
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:41,407
If you was going on a radio show that was run by gold sale operation

1106
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:53,439
They didn't he made up the whole story about that instead he had a radio show told nothing to buy gold

1107
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:58,303
It was basically like a good morning Vietnam but it WWII

1108
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,887
Tragical history of PG wodehouse

1109
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:02,655

Brother

1143
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:05,695
Clearly the red

1144
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,535
No keep going keep going let me try

1145
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:15,679
Gather my thoughts Subway sandwich

1146
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:28,991
Sure Gerald's Darrell shooting on everybody

1147
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:33,599
Last train to awesome at this,

1148
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,903
Google

1149
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:36,927
Boo Buie

1150
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:42,047
You can't I can't take him seriously

1151
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:45,631
Play I can't take his voice serious

1152
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:47,167
Abdullah music

1153
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:50,751
Sparingly on the show

1154
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:53,823
Almost all the time it comes on the show it just ends of him screaming

1155
00:58:54,079 --> 00:59:00,223
Somehow relates back to you should buy gold that's pretty much the trends that he's

1156
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:03,295
But

1157
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:05,343
This Kardashian app

1158
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:09,183
You know what the golden Kardashian ABS is

1159
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:13,791
That's why you got to buy real gold

1160
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:17,375
In the Marvel heroes of the universe app

1161
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:19,167
That's a much better game

1162
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:21,215
They sell it at Midas

1163
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:24,031
We're entering the home stretch

1164
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:28,639
Ruining this planet I wouldn't be surprised

1165
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:34,527
Just a little bit of a shorter episode cuz there's a lot of

1166
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:43,487
Is Richard Belzer off the phone

1167
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,279
Cuz he realizes

1168
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:47,583
Run

1169
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,119
Mustang

1170
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,727
Basically.

1171
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:58,847
That's a good statement by mistake

1172
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:02,943
Furious was a thing they faked the Aurora shooting why wouldn't is all beef

1173
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:07,039
Try to take our guns

1174
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,623
Is the comeback

1175
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:13,439
Commercial yet

1176
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:15,999
During the Richard Belzer interview

1177
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:17,535
Something really f*****

1178
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,631
I'm at my friends

1179
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:23,679
I'm with my friend Chris walking was doing

1180
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,543
He doesn't have

1181
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,335
A computer

1182
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:35,711
Ticketmaster

1183
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,015
Wow

1184
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:40,319
At all

1185
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:44,671
Republic

1186
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:47,487
So supposed to Christopher Walken

1187
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,791
Yeah who's private

1188
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:54,143
Computer so Google exactly

1189
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,423
Richard Belzer

1190
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,775
Christopher Walken's house

1191
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:01,055
And of course

1192
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:03,103
You know what this leads to

1193
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:06,943
This conversation had to have happened

1194
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,223
Hold on Chris

1195
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:14,111
I got to go talk to Alex Jones Infowars you know what happen

1196
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:18,207
Chris is going to show Christopher Walken appears on

1197
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,255
Yes

1198
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,279
Oliver

1199
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,607
Inject it into my veins Dan

1200
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,887
I got to be clear

1201
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:29,983
It would be to think that this was someone doing a Christopher Walken impression

1202
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,007
It is not

1203
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,031
He is on video

1204
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:36,127
It is on video Christopher Walken

1205
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:40,223
It looks like sitting on Richard Belzer's wife

1206
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:47,135
Which is another reason for things that could happen in Christopher Walken

1207
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:51,743
And I just have the full clip will have to pause at some point but like

1208
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:56,095
It is a masterclass in someone who doesn't give a f*** about Alex

1209
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:01,983
Well I feel like I should say more cowbell

1210
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,775
Blackmail

1211
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:07,871
On the line with us he's the author of

1212
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:11,455
The author coming in

1213
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,815
Call Mike

1214
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:50,623
I'm going to release that is a short film

1215
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:56,255
For second movie of my nose

1216
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,727
If it's ready don't go

1217
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,567
You can also just be Alex be like

1218
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:15,455
I do not know how to cut in I have no idea what to do

1219
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:17,503
Christopher Wilde

1220
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:19,295
I don't know why

1221
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,319
Plus he's

1222
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,599
There is a calculator

1223
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:23,391
You can see him for going over his head

1224
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:28,255
Christopher Walken

1225
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,023
Richard Belzer

1226
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:30,047
Willingly

1227
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:33,375
Crazyshit with me getting Christopher Walken

1228
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:37,983

Now I got to get walking

1230
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:40,543
This is

1231
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:44,895
This is strange guest episode very strange

1232
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:01,535
Image

1233
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:09,215
Brazil

01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:12,287
So there's talking about

1235
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,567
There's talk about lunch

1236
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:18,175
Tomato

1237
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:21,503
That's all

1238
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,231
Walking

1239
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:38,399
When you come to town

1240
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:47,615
Arugula salad is schedule

1241
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:56,319
Richard Belzer trying to leave Alex in somehow

1242
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:58,623
But Alex is even that really can't you ever come to New York

1243
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:01,183
Like as if it's a trap

1244
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,463
Comfortable

1245
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,999
New York to stay away from

1246
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:08,095
Today we got an arugula salad now that's in the mix

1247
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:11,167
Tomatoes

1248
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:13,471
Parmesan

1249
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,431
Search rock

1250
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,967
They're probably drunk

1251
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:27,807
Great great at interview

1252
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,599
Krystal's at Gourmet

1253
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:32,927
Mishawaka

01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,231
I hear you

1255
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:45,215
Fisher walking we are learning Mr Bill's reviews on the world

1256
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:47,263

What is what is your view on what's happening in the world right now with

1258
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:56,479
I want to know so bad

1259
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:59,295
Do you think he's going to give him a real answer

1260
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,319
You know what

1261
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,599
Absolutely not

1262
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:09,279
I was hearing that you don't have all the little Spa

1263
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:11,583
I have no idea

1264
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,079
Tuba

01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:38,463
Is found to be have that rebirth technology that we all know he wanted to know where we are

1266
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:02,015
You're almost invading you right now like an Alien Probe

1267
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:13,279
Mishawaka know what do you think

1268
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:17,631
That they want to have an Iran War

1269
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:24,799
Thank you so much walking

1270
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:29,151
I'm sorry

1271
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:38,111
I was one of the least successful interviews I've ever heard

1272
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:45,535
Christopher Walken love making chicken with a red wine and arugula salad with two kinds

1273
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,863
Eatzi's in there cooking book

1274
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:51,167
Cookbook

1275
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:59,871
What do you think about them

1276
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,943
Who

1277
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:08,575
We have no idea

1278
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:10,111
No interest in playing

1279
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:15,487
Doesn't give a f*** I was kind of disappointed cuz when I pulled up the episode when I saw Christopher Walken I was like

1280
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:17,791
This could be crazy

1281
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:25,471
But I was kind of hoping it would be

1282
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:26,751
It's just like

1283
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:30,847
Wondered what Christopher Walken

1284
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,919
Until now it which

1285
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:36,479
I want to know everything he thinks about the world

1286
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:41,343
I still don't really care this is good enough for me

1287
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:50,303
That's pretty much a little bit more about JFK

1288
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:54,655
And you know it's that not really all that interests

1289
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:58,239
16th 2012

1290
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:01,567
At the end of a at the end of the interview Bells

1291
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:07,967
Christopher Walken's room where he's wearing those blackouts

1292
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:08,991
Bells is like

1293
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:11,807
Siri going to read this book about JFK

1294
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:15,135
Hope

1295
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:16,927
No

1296
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,255
And it is

1297
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,279
I don't know

1298
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:24,863
4 in the afternoon right now

1299
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:25,887
And then I cook

1300
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,007
Living a great life

1301
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:31,775
Christopher Walken

1302
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:39,455
Making a movie about Joseph

1303
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:43,295
Any goes right back home like this really not much

1304
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,831
Talkabouttd

1305
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:47,903
It's fun as hell but there's not much to talk about outside of Alex being a

1306
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,695
Completely impotent interviewer

1307
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:50,463
It was at

1308
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:54,815
270 road map

1309
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:59,935
The fake strfkr laugh is baby my favor

1310
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:02,239
Between the Mustang

1311
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,263
Stop and that it

1312
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,031
It's just like this is a

1313
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,055
Graceful look

1314
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:07,871
For Alex

1315
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:16,319
Trajectory he comes back from the next commercial break with Don't Fear the Reaper

1316
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:18,623
Quarters more cowbell joke

1317
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:22,719
I got this one day of celebrity Worship in board game analysis

1318
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:23,743
The most

1319
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:25,791
It's one of the weirdest episodes

1320
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:28,351
Well you know what

1321
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:30,143
I think you covered it

1322
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:36,543
You got all the subjects he needed to cover so what else is there in the world besides

1323
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:43,711
Chest Monopoly and the game Risk

1324
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:47,039
What is 20 think about something
