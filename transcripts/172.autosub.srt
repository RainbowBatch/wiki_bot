The single most

6
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:33,280
Possibly wear

7
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,560

00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:57,856
This is not working out I know a lot about

14
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:08,096
Good but before we do that I would like to spend that video.

15
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,400

00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:14,240

Common Man

27
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,040
Possible

28
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:04,416
What we're doing is I started listening to a little bit of modern

29
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:08,512
And I said I said goodbye

30
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,048
Nope

31
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,632
Interview with a guy named

39
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,816
No that's what I'm saying there's a lot going on I don't want none of it

40
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:47,168
I was really disappointed

41
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,192
Expect it's just

42
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,240
I don't want to do it

43
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:54,592
No I don't want to talk about his perspective on the present

44
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,640
Perspective is kill non-whites

45
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:03,040
Going in there are time travel

What about daughters who donated on the time travel level

49
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,584
We'd appreciate it

50
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,632
Today we are fulfilling

51
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,168

11th 2013

54
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,880
Any idea why we might be going

55
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:44,768
June 11th 2013 so that's a years after Obama was re-elected

56
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:52,448
And wait wait hold on

57
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,264
Re-elected

58
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,360
I think I might be living in the alternate reality where life isn't

59
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,152
Here's a clue of what we're going to be

60
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,992
On the show

61
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,040
I agree

62
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:07,808
Good

63
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,136
You nailed it

64
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,440
Terms of public opinion

65
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,464
About him

66
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,375
I don't think I want to tell you why

67
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,167
This date was chosen

68
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,007
Use it you just rather let it unfold in front of me

69
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,055
I think I think you do

70
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,103
Pretty cool you're pretty quick

71
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,151
I'm not sure

72
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,431
This is a good choice

73
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,991
All right here's where we start

74
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,903
11

75
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:49,023
We are going to be

76
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,863

He is just scored the biggest refrigerator

81
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,551
Forever against everybody

82
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,343
Personal record

83
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,951
The interview

84
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
Into

85
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,535
2011 that was June 9th

86
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:27,935
2013

87
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:32,799
Turn on BBC Sunday show

88
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,015
10th and then we have the 11

89
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,575
Just as a refresher for everyone who doesn't remember

90
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,111
This moment did Alex Jones

91
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,391
History here is a clip

92
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,463
Alex being a f*** her show

93
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,279
Yes I mean

94
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,815
At the time you discovered

95
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:03,263
But it leaves me with a shoot question

96
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,823
The New World Order

97
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,127
It's full of criminals

98
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,199
Is full of criminals at cetera

99
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:15,551
Poots

100
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:19,391

00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,423
You'll part of the controls

104
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:36,543
I tried to put

105
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:46,015
The New York Times

106
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
Threatening

And you better take it serious cuz you were just talking to your dad was in the hospital

108

I'm here to testify that your head was not cut off

109
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:29,791
A little bit

110
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:38,239
Tell him to shut up and just

111
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,311
Interview.

112
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,127
Screaming over them as they end the show

113
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,943
The guy the host of the show

114
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,039
You are the worst gas I've ever had he have an idiot on the program

115
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,415
Came out and said that as soon as

116
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
Showing up

117
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
Went back to normal

118
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
Dan started

119
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:06,911
Oh that right

120
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,007
Alex

121
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:11,775
His feelings on it

122
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,847
The victory over Bilderberg

123
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:18,431
I don't know as there's not a lot more

124
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,455
In this episode the rear lights

125
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,735
I said that but he could be reference

126
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,855
This episode is probably you could say about TSA

127
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,623
Aspire

128
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
Sort of

129
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
Okay

130
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,535
Okay

131
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:40,191
I'd like is the TSA the transportation do you know why I got confused

132
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:45,823
You're right you're right

133
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:52,223
Add insult to injury

134
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,271
From

135
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,855
What is way back from English

136
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,391
Planes a lot about both of them

137
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,463
Bored with Snowden

138
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,767
He's mad that other people are

139
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,559
And then

140
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,583
Pencil

141
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,655
Inordinate amount of time on this episode talking about like

142
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
Waze

143
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,703
Do you can block

144
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,495
The NSA spying

145
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,287
On you and like try and create

146
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:20,639
Right problems right

147
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,943
Track really well but

148
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:28,319
By the weather today

149
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:32,159
Are traveling all this with terrorists terms online

150
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:35,231
Ladies and gentlemen

151
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:41,119
The latest patent

152
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,983
Tell Yukon a congressman

153
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:50,847
That will give them so many headaches talk about how you're a whistleblower

154
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:09,279
Stop at Aerotek

155
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:14,655
They're there to make sure the terrorist attack

156
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,727
Talk about making sure we stopped are

157
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:28,479
That's like I got two seconds left till break

158
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:33,087
Okay we're at already committed to laughing a little bit

159
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,879
Humans do this

160
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,951
Human run

161
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,351
I don't care about that strategy

162
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,423
At what point did you just start saying human laughter instead of

163
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:54,335
Human laughter or not following what he says

164
00:10:54,591 --> 00:11:00,735
He's basically saying just talk about patents in front of your washing machine or your toaster

165
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,295
Listening to you and Alexa

166
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:08,671
Right you just say I'm going to stop a terrorist attack on the Block

167
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,095
So they have trackers

168
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,655
That is obvious

169
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,983
But hackers

170
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:28,383
Flooding the internet with terrorism words

171
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,247
That like if you could give enough. Leaves it would overwhelm the software you could just

172
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:37,599
Constantly be writing stuff about bombs or IEDs like that

173
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,879
They've there was a belief

174
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,415
But you could trick

175
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,951
Wild goose chase

176
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,023
For the NSA to make it worth their time

177
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,071
Or not like Finance

178
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,095
Actually viable to use

179
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,935
The system it said it was already

180
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,287
And that it did not work because it was already flooded with too much of

181
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:02,943
Monitoring the domestic Communications of the entire country

182
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:09,343
So much information there that you can't possibly find a needle

183
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,879
If you want to find something

184
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
You know where to look

185
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,951
Of course but like

186
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,975
The reasonable

187
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,023
Response for someone to have like I just

188
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,791
The first thought

189
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:22,399
Right kind of

190
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:27,007
What set off every alarm

191
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:33,151
But I don't know Alex is a toasters

192
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,479
We're going to stop terrorism

193
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,271
You're not that brave

194
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,599
You and me toaster

195
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,159
Lobotomy

196
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,487
Perception is a little screwy

197
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
And I think

198
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
He's doing his listeners

199
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,815
The disservice by misrepresent

200
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,095
What

201
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:52,863
I'd come out about

202
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
But

203
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,751
One of the reasons I believe that you've misrepresented

204
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,543
Is because I don't think he

205
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
Reality

206
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,431
As evidenced by the next clip

207
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,503
He talks about going through the TSA line

208
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,807
I would he's describing

209
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,647
Is a very positive encounter with some

210
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,975
I hear this

211
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:26,911
I hear this description and I will say that I all I hear is a TSA agent

212
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,935
Being polite

213
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,471
Courteous

214
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:35,871
Maybe even going above and beyond their responsibilities Alex feels like he's being attacked

215
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,407
Super thin soup

216
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:43,551
Just like our government is caught shipping in the majority of Narcotics

217
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,623
Four Points

218
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
4

219
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,775
I said wow you're really on power strip

220
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,895
Do you know who I am if she was persecuting me

221
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,623
Why do you think you need to get a new one

222
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,439
There's something wrong with this one

223
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,047
She just sits there staring at me was like

224
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,399
She's Janet Reno type

225
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,447
I hear there's that mean

226
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:39,103
I don't know I don't care here there is essentialism

227
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,895
You know

228
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,919
I'll get a new one

229
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:46,527
Cuz that's exactly what I heard is really nice

230
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:52,927
Aspire like once every 10 years

231
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:02,911
You might want to think about getting a new one

232
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:09,311
New one before it expires then the whole process is going to have to go through afterwards

233
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:15,711
You could say a Power Trip like Reno

234
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,527
Right now I don't even understand why

235
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,063
Even even if

236
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,391
Call Leanne maliciously

237
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:27,487
In the most possible way you can

238
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,535
Power Trip

239
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,375
You clearly let him use this one

240
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:40,799
Stupid

241
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,079
And that is that like

242
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,383
She said that you need

243
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,407
To get a new one today

244
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,199
Expires in a year-and-a-half

245
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,223
Do you know who I am

246
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,503
Because I thought she was

247
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,111
Computed wherever you go

248
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,391
Now here's my work

249
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,231
Alex Jones doesn't fly internationally all that

250
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,303
News very few opportunities to

251
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,071
To get his own /

252
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,863
Personal story about being harassed

253
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,399
TSA agent

254
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,935
Costumes

255
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:13,055
People make the most out of it whenever it happened something like this

256
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,591
Superflight he's got it like

257
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,175
See what I can do with it

258
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:22,015
See if I could change your tone just exactly

259
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:28,415
Every time Alex is taking an international flight I imagine about

260
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,743
Him it's his version of being like

261
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:38,143
Really I have to take my shoes off because one guy put a bomb in there one time during years ago like he's

262
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,423
He's just bitching about it

263
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,031
What is jealous of people who actually get singled out

264
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,079
And he wants his own claim to victim

265
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:51,199
He doesn't have 10 my God she was so considerate to me

266
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,271
It is I was a victim

267
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,807
I was such a

268
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,855
I have the worst

269
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:03,231
TSA experiment or experience I had was coming back from London

270
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,535
And I was almost home

271
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:09,375
I was almost home I was right to the very last

272
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:14,495
I do hair and this f****** guy it's like 8 in the morning I've been on the plane for 9 hours

273
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,543
I got my headphones in clearly I can

274
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
Can't see straight

275
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,127
And this guy was just a f****** dick to me the whole time

276
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,151
Would not

277
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,711
F****** I just wanted to try and hand him

278
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,295
Then the f****** ID and he's like slapping always like headphone

279
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,831
Get your headphones

280
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,903
Screaming at a little road

281
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:38,303
Worst

282
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,095
It was 50/50 on me

283
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,167
And this was a very polite and erection

284
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
Absolutely

285
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,079
02b

286
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,383
This is not the totalitarian

287
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:57,503
Popping all over you in terms of

288
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,039
You make a fair point

289
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,135
Emina pilot walks over

290
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
Add

291
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,295
It was incredible

292
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:37,695
This is very weak

293
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
Do people

294
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,487
Very vague

295
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
And like

296
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
Alright

297
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,303
Sure maybe they

298
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,375
Will be nice if they were nice

299
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,143
What

300
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,423
They need that you

301
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,287
Process like a thousand people every hour something about bored

302
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:58,687
Of court and some of those people are way bigger assholes than absolutely kind of customer service

303
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:01,759
Every situation you know assholes about

304
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,039
Let alone one

305
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:07,903
Fraught with anxiety over travel airport

306
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,815
Tensions were high at airport

307
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,839
Cuz lot of people are anxious

308
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:19,167
Just about flying a lot of it is really tight schedules

309
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:19,935
And because of

310
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,727
The nature of weather

311
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,567
And things that are completely outside of our control sometimes flights get delayed

312
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,639
Hey become complete disasters

313
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,431
Jeffy

314
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,735
There never was a TSA

315
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:36,319
If there never was terrorism it would still be a scary

316
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:40,415
Supply places

317
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,695
Yasso

318
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,719
DD's people

319
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,511
In a vacuum

320
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,559
It makes sense why they would be rude

321
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:51,423
Belittle route so many other route

322
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,287
That you can expect until

323
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:00,895
Curing here

324
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,175
Is 0

325
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,199
This is the euro

326
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,247
Have a great day

327
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,295
Like that's what I'm giving these PSAs

328
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,111
About the pilot stereotype

329
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,671
Is that a known thing that pilot do

330
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,231
I feel like we're also I mean I don't know but I also

331
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,255
We're past the point where

332
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,791
Pilot being drunk

333
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,071
Okay The Stereotype that the

334
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,095
Youth probably understand

335
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,399
You know like that used to be the thing

336
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:33,919
No I don't I don't know or I'll eat

337
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,991
Sitcom stereotypes

338
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,063
For the kids

339
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,903
Was that that man on fire

340
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,511
We've only got one reference

341
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:52,095
It was not all bad

342
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,631
You did end up needing one

343
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,655
Super woke

344
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,679
TSA agent

345
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,959
Alright

346
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,239
I like it I don't think

347
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,799
You should get

348
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,864
Obsessive

349
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,144
Compulsively

350
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,592
He's basically images of screenshots from

351
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,128
The South Park episode

352
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:39,712
About TSA

353
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,600
Certification

354
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,376
Alex

355
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,264
We bring back so I need a new password please please

356
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,872
Scary I would want to I wouldn't want to

357
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,640
Secret

358
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,968
Secret

359
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,784
Conspiratorial wink

360
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:15,808
Number to USAA

361
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,832
Just like

362
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:29,632
People forget to take away that I don't even care

363
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:40,384
Female that be fun why did it why don't more people turn the TSA

364
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,920
Experience

365
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,224
Like a fun little what

366
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:47,552
Cuz I want to get there to be more like

367
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:51,392
When you go through the line ever

368
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,976
I would like to psia line is where everyone knows your name

369
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,256
Exactly that means

370
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,400
This is like this is my kind of fun

371
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,496
So I was over at

372
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,104
A Bloomberg article came out

373
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,640
About how

374
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,664
Uses

375
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,432
Conspiracy

376
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
And feared

377
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
To sell gold

378
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,016
And

379
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,600
One of those no duh

380
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,880
But Alex takes

381
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:27,232

Pretty

384
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,072
A serious problem

385
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,352
But people saying that

00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,376
He's trying to sell gold

Alex Jones sells gold on Sirius

With bombing conspiracy

390
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,504
Why are they shooting at me Politico

391
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,320
By the way we hardly

392
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,368
Gold is one of the smallest

393
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,160
Sponsorships we got

394
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:03,072
Unfortunately I wish I could

395
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,872

397
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:27,904
That is

398
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:32,512
That is as much an advertised you could reasonably do

399
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,560
Without it literally being like

400
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:39,424
We're barely has resources

401
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,240
Which has the best sales right now they have

402
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,288
Gold for $300 an ounce

403
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:47,872
You couldn't beat that and it's so good that I've always held on

404
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:54,272
I'll never let it go at all I want to do is sell gold I don't want to sell

405
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,600
Giving gold away I want to hoard it

406

00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,216
That's right

412
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:17,568
Entirely

413
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
Vindicate

414
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,384
Okay

415
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,408
It was very different

416
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,456
Then just being a sponsor

417
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,528
They are responsible for his vindication

418
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,576
And for it being on radio station

419
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,672
Shepherd is beyond sponsor

420
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,488
Bambi the the nature of the

421
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,256
The ads

422
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,072
A lot of Alex Jones's adds Argenta

423
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,144
Network ads better run

424
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,448
Through the network which is owned by

425
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,824
Resources own

426
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:53,152
The ads that are paying Alex Jones Revenue

427
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:56,224
It's very complicated

428
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,992
Is f***** up

429
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,552
I meant it's locked up because we know we've seen

430
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,112
How desperately tries to

431
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,928
I like the idea that he saying

432
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,232
We barely saw

433
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:12,352
Existed Elgort

434
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:15,424
I think I got a limit for you

435
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,520
Baby bobcat

436
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,312
Around as much anymore and

437
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,848
Maybe Alex

438
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:27,456
Remember how shameful he was 2009

439
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,296
You want to Buck back at Bloomberg

440
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,320
Triple B

441
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,392
I still think it's

442
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,720
It's awful to hear

443
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,488
Do just

444
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
Do it

445
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,536
You sell gold

446
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,656
Crime in terms of

447
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,424
Misrepresenting

448
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,496
I really cry more likely that big of a deal

449
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,776
Considering what it what else

450
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:55,104
What does Fox News sell but like things that are for

451
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,128
Beer and old

452
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,176
Mostly old people get Mickey

453
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,200
Do stuff

454
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,504
I seen on TV type nonsense

455
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,552
That's as big of a crime is gold

456
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,624
Ellie Goulding and doesn't break down after

457
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,184
Easier to scam people live gold

458
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,744
Manipulate the Value Inn

459
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,048
It like that

460
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:18,144
Yeah it has Seen On TV products

461
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,704
So in the next five Alex Jones

462
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,728
Get them to another

463
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,008
I think it's going to be a

464
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,032
Throughout this up a

465
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,056
And that is

466
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,104
He wants

467
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,384
He wants you to know that he's

468
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,688
He's been nice

469
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,712
Scared

470
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:42,720
New York

471
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,256
Truth Rising

472
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,008
You're not allowed to have this demonstration

473
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,848
Windpipe

474
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,896
Gyros

475
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:10,624
Hollywood as a thug

476
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,904
Badfella

477
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:16,256
Or average fellows

478
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,536
Good for medium

479
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,072
I don't believe that I'll

480
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:22,912
You know I rejected the idea of

481
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,240
Every conversation that begins with

482
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,264
Listen

483
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,312
We're going to say your cameras are bought

484
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,432
Kabob

485
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,968
I need at least

486
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,016
I don't like people

487
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,552
Bounce Around the issues

488
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:44,160
Little dance

489
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,184
Front and honest

490
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,232
If you're going to say that's something I'm bringing with me

491
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,072
I love the pretending the guys were walking around with pipes

492
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,656
There's other weapon

493
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:59,264
There's a concealed carry law

494
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:05,920
New York is going around in New York

495
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,712
Osberg

496
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,272
Really in favor of

497
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,064
Carrying laws for

498
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,088
Yep

499
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,112
So Alex gets death

500
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,280
We are change

501
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,400
Infowars adjacent actual employee

502
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,680
He pops up a lot

503
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,384
I don't know the skulls

504
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,408
No one does

505
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:41,504
Mistletoe

506
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,808
Williston you just said this earlier

507
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,832
Yeah that's right

508
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,168
Asking Bloomberg a question

509
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,704
My wife

510
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,640
And I'm going to head up a

511
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,200
So we need your prayers first and foremost

512
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,808
Madre support because

513
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,672
We need to expand the face of this new world order

514
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:23,744
This is like watching a baby learn to crawl

515
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,048
He's really close to that address

516
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:32,192
Interested in

517
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,728
He's going to die and they're getting me

518
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:40,128
Cryptic phone calls the tell you what you've been saying and stuff like that

519
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,176
Raise your emotional state

520
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,224
And then mention weenie

521
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,504
Need your money because of the

522
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,784
These things I'm scaring you about

523
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,600
So it is the primordial ooze from which

524
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,880
The ad Pivot Group

525
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:54,976
Yeah this is not yet

526
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,280
It's where they're better

527
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,304
Astonished

528
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,608
Yeah I think I think

529
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,168
Recall is pretty early and

530
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,192
Supplement

531
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:07,520
Company offering I don't know what month

532
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,312
It started in Bible

533
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,848
Things got going with a couple

534
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:13,920
Call supplements

535
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,200
Into that mode yet

536
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,760
But I still wanted money

537
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,296
That you get all the time

538
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,600
They're like

539
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
Hey

540
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,904
I've been listening to

541
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,208
Right here's what you were talking about earlier

542
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:31,584
Experienced so many times in the past

543
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:40,032
No no no setting on a self operator

544
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:44,640
Party line

545
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:50,016
Small towns would have like a party line going maybe

546
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,832
I think it's something

547
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,136
I mean it sounds good

548
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,160
In terms of scary

549
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,440
You know

550
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,208
Well

551
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,488
Yeah

552
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,024
I mean

553
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,792
You

554
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,584
If you believe

555
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,888
All of his ideas

556
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,656
About

557
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,192
The nature of the spying

558
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,216
What's going on

559
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,496
It does track

560
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,776
Someone would be listening

561
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,080
And would be like

562
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,640
You were talking about earlier

563
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,432
It works if you're already

564
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:21,504
I think

565
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272
I don't think

566
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,296
That's absurd

567
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,344
Just silly

568
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,416
I think that's silly

569
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,208
If somebody did that to me I'd be like

570
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,488
Are you

571
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,512
Are you okay

572
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,048
Hey man

573
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,328
What are you doing friend

574
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,864
Can't you be doing something else

575
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:37,888
The

576
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,936
How do you feel

577
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,472
About what

578
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,080
The British guy

579
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,384
Serological response

580
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,408
Do that

581
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:55,808
Euro f****** loud mouth guy who screams

582
00:32:56,064 --> 00:33:00,160
About everything and has no filter on the radio if we threaten you you're going to

583
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:06,560
To talk about it either

584
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:13,472
Our position has been there not real

585
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:18,336
I think I'm going to stick with that one even get the idea that he has

586
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:22,688
They can't kill me I'm too publicly again

587
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:29,088
It really would not be hard to kill you because there are so many alternate explanations for why you could die

588
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,440
Literally any kind of like

589
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:39,328
Oh he had a heart attack and everybody be like

590
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,120
Can kill you for giving you a heart attack

591
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,400
Kenlake wave weapon

592
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:45,984
The project

593
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,032
Kellogg Eye his associate Vince

594
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,592
I was killed Biggie they gave him a

595
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,896
Give me the right

596
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,456
Walk around carrying types

597
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,992
It's consistent throughout

598
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,296
These are paranoid

599
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:02,368
Like the idea is anything that's natural causes

600
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,136
Is probably

601
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,416
It could be suspicious

602
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,952
So no matter how I die

603
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,488
I believe the worst

604
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,096
Wow

605
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,400
We saw what happened with that

606
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,448
Right now in terms of

607
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,752
People not believing

608
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,288
I just something

609
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,616
Sprite but if nothing if

610
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:28,480
There is nothing matters there is no explanation that satisfies

611
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,248
The paranoid mom

612
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,016
Exactly

613
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,552
So matter

614
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,112
They don't exist

615
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:40,512
Going to kill him first

616
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,888
The good way to go about things

617
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,704
Organization behind

618
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,728
Lucien's 400z

619
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:53,568
Love yourself before the invention of the telephone

620
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,640
They like pissing the best

621
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,456
You know he's not threatening

622
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,480
But he has buyable

623
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,016
So maybe we invest

624
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:02,784
Gold company

625
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,856
Someone would go about it

626
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:09,184
If anyone wanted to corrupt Alex it would not be through

627
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,952
Threats

628
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,000
Or anything like that it would be through

629
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,024
Greenback

630
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,584
Or just

631
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,120
Things about him

632
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:21,984
Flattery and money worship hours

633
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,568
Earlier in the show we did see

634
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,336
Example of a

635
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,128
I'm trying to explain

636
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,688
To try and jam

637
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:33,760
Yes he does

638
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,064
He goes about it

639
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,368
Here in the show

640
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,208
Just the way they spin

641
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:42,976
Is so funny

642
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:47,072
Messages about terror attack

643
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,888
Bombing Al-Qaeda

644
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:02,176
Yes we have photos of the defense intelligence operatives that were there with the Patxi's in command of them

645
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,200
On

646
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,784
April 15th and we're releasing that data

647
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:10,112
Central

648
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,488
All the computers

649
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,816
We don't actually have that

650
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,192
That part will computers

651
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,752
Saying that you do

652
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:31,360
Immediately following up with hieroglyphics

653
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,432
Like seriously

654
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:41,088
You're telling the wrong lies

655
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,368
You're lying wrong

656
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,464
I'm good at that

657
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,768
15th is in Redford

658
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:49,536
To the Boston butt

659
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,560
You talking about

660
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,352
The Boston bombing

661
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,888
Because I

662
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:59,008
I've been I've been looking into this a little bit and I think that as much as he became

663
00:36:59,264 --> 00:36:59,776
Popular apps

664
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,544
After 9/11

665
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,616
His stock grew quite a bit

666
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,408
I think that

667
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,176
The post Boston

668
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,200
Embalming.

669
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,224
Would probably

670
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:08,992
The most like

671
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,064
The modern most organic growth

672
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,112
Because of the

673
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:18,720
Is what it was one of the early ones I know that I remember

674
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,000
The internet

675
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,560
A c community going Buckwild along with him

676
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,352
Lichen

677
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,376
Search

678
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,144
Through

679
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:26,912
Pictures

680
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,704
The try and find culprit

681
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,520
Pencils like that like the internet sleuthing community

682
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,568
Crazy

683
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,104
There was more of it even

684
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,128
Before this.

685
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,688
I've just don't realize but I know it was pretty crazy

686
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,968
In terms of like

687
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,504
Very irresponsibly

688
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,368
Put the blame on various TV

689
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,416
Yeah there was there was some pretty serious

690
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,464
And I know that Alex

691
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,512
Made a lot of hay out of

692
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,304
I am so

693
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,840
This is right in the

694
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:58,912
What would you call it

695
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,680
Right after

696
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,472
After that it's sort of in the

697
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,520
The evening of the honeymoon

698
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,312
Yeah yeah where things are still like

699
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,080
I think he's

700
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,360
He's gaining a lot of

701
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,688
Momentum went over to England

702
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,736
Absolutely

703
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:15,808
If you're from Texas you have to go to England at least once

704
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,600
Yeah yeah

705
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,416
Yeezys

706
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,184
Positing

707
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,744
Bringing up this idea that

708
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,512
He's going to

709
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,536
Revealed evidence

710
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,816
But he's right

711
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,096
Hobby People

712
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,400
Admittedly he doesn't have

713
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,448
He also did say it later that

714
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,984
He's already put it out

715
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,056
Even though he doesn't have it

716
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,080
He doesn't have it. I don't

717
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,360
I don't I've looked

718
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,224
I do think

719
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,528
Present his trip

720
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,064
UK

721
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,904
First of all the greatest victories all-time over the Bell

722
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,208
Absolutely

723
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,256
He's bent out of shape a little bit about the in

724
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,792
Interview I think he's in a bad head

725
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,584
And I

726
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,352
That comes up missing

727
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:07,776
I don't care

728
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,336
Me all you want I don't care

729
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,176
Whatever

730
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,456
Whatever happens

731
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,992
Whole truth

732
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,856
So help me God almighty

733
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,952
On the altar of God

734
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:30,816
Resistance and defiance

735
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,632
Solar eclipse

736
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,192
Starts with him

737
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,216
Makes fun of me

738
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,008
I think it's because a lot of people

739
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,104
I think the

740
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,408
Rational Minds

741
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,200
Steve at UK interview

742
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:50,016
Have you hear the guy being like I've got an idiot

743
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:53,600
Mstudio Drake you do

744
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:54,880
Sorry

745
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,416
Sorry had to go through that

746
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,184
Geico

747
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,952
Interrupting

748
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:58,720
What have you

749
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,280
I think he's probably getting a little bit of blow back about that

750
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:02,816
I'm so he's

751
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:03,840
Kind of on edge

752
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,608
A little bit

753
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:08,960
I don't care

754
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,496
Cuz all I care about is

755
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,264
Vigilance

756
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:15,104
I'm always

757
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:19,200
Like I don't know what it is but there is something programmed in

758
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,992
To humankind that that

759
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,272
Southern Baptist

760
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,064
Revivalist preacher talk

761
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,112
Like that that

762
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:28,160
Forum

763
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,184
Just so

764
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:33,792
Like there's a reason that there were there were f****** kids

765
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,560
Like Margie

766
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:37,632
In the twenties leading that spiritualist revivalist movement

767
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,448
Having 20,000 people at their at their f******

768
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,264
Can shows

769
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,176
You are lying

770
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:56,576
There's a lyrical quality to it looks like oral tradition cultures

771
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:59,136
Storytellers

772
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,928
Even to ascertain

773
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,952
Rappers

774
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,256
You know like

775
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:09,888
Is infection

776
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,424
After

777
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,264
You can tell 20 minutes of good jokes and then you can just ride on the Rhythm

778
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,848
Taking care of you like your next 20 can be boring but people are so

779
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:22,944
It's constant that's in this like reaction to the Rhythm that they'll laugh at anything

780
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,248
Just like you

781
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,552
Your Rhythm can make your

782
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:30,112
Your style Legend

783
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,160
Even like

784
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,440
The jokes

785
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,976
Someone like Mitch Hedberg

786
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,000
Wouldn't be

787
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,024
Revered as

788
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,792
He is

789
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:41,120
Or Steven Wright Interlaken just have

790
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:41,888
Perfect

791
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,752
If you want to you want to follow the Rhythm

792
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:53,151
Yeah what if the Headless Horseman had a headless horse that would be fun

793
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,431
Cooking chaos signal like that

794
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,735
There's nothing but the way

795
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:01,087
The Rhythm over

796
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,183
Come to that

797
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:05,951
But

798
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,487
This is

799
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,255
Next

800
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,023
Yeah

801
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:11,327
Because

802
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:15,167
The point that I think is weird

803
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:26,175
Particularly tough time for us to do this sort of thing

804
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,711
Make the point that

805
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:30,783
Nope have a real tough time with the Border

806
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:43,583
Hello passport

807
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:53,823
And tell me that maybe I should get a new password

808
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,295
Feed

809
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,831
Their power ego

810
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,047
He almost said you don't belong

811
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:17,119
Let you know

812
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,423
If you look like you were fervent

813
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:24,031
It was citizens it was milk cows

814
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:27,103
It was good looking women

815
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,271
It was border patrol

816
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,551
Customs

817
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:41,439
Even the TSA imperious

818
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,999
Imperious

819
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:57,567
I think you have the word today calendar and.

820
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:02,431
Do you know if he's using that the way that he

821
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,479
I don't know I don't think it always

822
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:07,807
Necessarily have the consolation of Imperial

823
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:14,719
Do fall under

824
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,743
Imperiousness

825
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:19,071
I didn't see that the reason that that is

826
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:23,167
Is a an incorrect usage of that word is because imperious

827
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,703
Suggest that there

828
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,471
Empower

829
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,007
Without

830
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,591
Application for it

831
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,175
That

832
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:36,479
They have a justification

833
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,783
I'm not super interested in

834
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,551
Because you can

835
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,319
You know

836
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,087
I could

837
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:44,927
Someone on Alex's at world

838
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,463
Easily make

839
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,487
Argument that they

840
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,023
Take too much power

841
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,071
And it the ends don't justify the me

842
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,095
In terms of

843
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,911
The other scrutiny that people are forced to go under

844
00:44:55,167 --> 00:45:01,311
I agree with that argument in tires

845
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,591
F****** racism

846
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:09,247
That's the bigger issue Mister grammar over here

847
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,527
Take a step back and say

848
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:15,391
It's really f***** up that he's saying that hate anybody who looks like they're foreign

849
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,927
I don't have you they just get

850
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:20,255
But this citizen

851
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:24,607
Cow who don't know what they look like

852
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:31,007
I think Alex knows what the f****** look like anybody come out

853
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:36,383
This is the sort of thing

854
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,663
Yes

855
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,431
That doesn't

856
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,711
That doesn't match up

857
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,247
In terms of scale

858
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,015
With like

859
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,575
If you have Richard Spencer throwing words around

860
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:52,255
But boy howdy that is as racist as like

861
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:57,375
I thought can be it is absolutely it because you categorizing people don't look

862
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,655
American is

863
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,935
Being non-white

864
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:05,311
That's a problem which I got the entire point of America is that

865
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,871
Anybody here looks America

866
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,919
That's kind of Who We Are

867
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:14,271
You know that whole Melting Pot

868
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,599
I like to eat

869
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,623
I like to eat out

870
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,903
I prefer broth

871
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:20,927
I don't like to cook

872
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,463
Give me give me milk

873
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,743
Give me milk

874
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:28,863
So

875
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:30,655
Situation

876
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,191
And you might be surprised

877
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,215
Great band

878
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:37,055
The BBC situation yeah that's not bad

879
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:40,639
You might be surprised to hear Alex's take on how everything

880
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:43,199
I'm not but

881
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,223
This clip is jarring

882
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,439
Shows Italy

883
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,463
You're an idiot

884
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:01,375
I just broke the trance

885
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,751
Winter break

886
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:11,359
Stop yelling

887
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,879
Their treasury secretary

888
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:24,415
Ball

889
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,207
And

890
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,743
Egos

891
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:35,423
Stop yelling

892
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:40,287
He went back on and said that I was a fake and it was all an act

893
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:45,151
Real

894
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,175
Okay

895
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:49,247
Want YouTube

896
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,623
Realize you are not

897
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:57,951
I would suggest there's just a difference in definition

898
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,743
I would say

899
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:00,511
By definition

900
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,559
Someone who's real is not someone

901
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,351
Screams over the other person

902
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:09,215
And delights in dominating them by yelling infowars.com

903
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:12,543
Over them instead of engaging with the ideas of

904
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,871
Putting forth that's not dominating that's being a baby

905
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:19,199
Rima fakih child on British television

906
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,479
I'm looking like

907
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,759
Crass

908
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:24,831
And the fact that he stops as soon as the cameras off

909
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:27,903
It doesn't mean that it's fake but it just means that like

910
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,183
It's a show.

911
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:39,167
They think they want you to think that no one's real it's like no we think you're real but the reality for you is

912
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,191
This is all bulshit

913
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:43,519
Write a mixture

914
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:47,615
Aren't you know Inez in a certain sense I can actually

915
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,895
Respect that argument

916
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:52,735
I can't

917
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:53,759
Really worked up

918
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:56,319
As he presented himself to be

919
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,087
On the British

920
00:48:57,343 --> 00:49:00,159
Yeah he would not stop saying you guys

921
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:02,719
You don't fucken understand what you're apart of

922
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,767
Do you understand that

923
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:05,791
Be the globalist

924
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,143
I have all these documents on my phone

925
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,935
He would continue trying to

926
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:17,823
His point across to them after they got off or he would scream at them and say you're part of the problem

927
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,919
One of those three

928
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:25,759
Or you would just check out cuz this is isn't like he would just

929
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:28,063
Performatively stop screaming

930
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,599
I've been hanging around

931
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,391
That's not what would happen

932
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:34,463
Well I'm just trying to put myself into that

933
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,255
Idea of like

934
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,815
If I am going on TV

935
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:42,399
If I am against

936
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,935
All Odds

937
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:46,239
Somehow

938
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,007
Hannity

939
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,287
Invite me on

940
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:54,175
Pretend that he has something to say tucker might be a better

941
00:49:54,431 --> 00:50:00,575
HuHot possibility

942
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:07,487
I would absolutely because

943
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,535
The show

944
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:13,119
He has nothing on the inside

945
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,167
And he's he's a joke as well

946
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:20,031
So is when the cameras are off I'm just going to go

947
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,639
Just go

948
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,391
It's funny you should bring that up

949
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:37,695
Escorted

950
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:40,255
But I don't

951
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,023

Got to go

953
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,351
Cuz I don't I don't think it was like a getting

954
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:46,655
Thrown out

955
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,959
For his own protection or whatever got

956
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,263
Regards to take him out

957
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,311
Here or even just like

958
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:55,359
Dude you don't belong here anymore

959
00:50:55,871 --> 00:51:00,991
You in this light you're gone your services have been rendered

960
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,039
There's no after-party to hangout

961
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,159
Something that I do

962
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:08,927
Do not believe this true

963
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:13,535
That's all they can do as well

964
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:26,079
Former police here

965
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:31,711
Sure they said what you said about the 7/7 bombings Mendes how did you know that

966
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,087
What

967
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,647
That was an assassination

968
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:49,119
I need cops one and Eminem

969
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,031
So sorry about 77

970
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:56,799
The bombing

971
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:59,359
What else is probably operating off

972
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:00,639
Probably most

973
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,919
With his awareness about

974
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:05,503
Movie called 77 ripple effect

975
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,783
Productive

976
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,319
About 77 bombing

977
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:10,623
Basically the British

978
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:13,183
77 bombing equivalent to Blue Stream

979
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:17,535
It was directed by a guy named

980
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:23,423
But that of course is a fake name

981
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,703
It's actually blue

982
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:29,055
From Dune

983
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:29,823
It muaddi

984
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:32,383
5

985
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:36,223
My friend

986
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:41,343
Do you want to go into all this all right so you have to go through

987
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,111
Concentrated spice

988
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,135
And that

989
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,927
Kills all men who take

990
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:47,231
But it's the same thing that Reverend mothers take

991
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,511
In the band

992
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:53,119
All right so when they

993
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,911
And they take this and they have to

994
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,703
Use their there

995
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,239
Like

996
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,775
Biological Powers 2

997
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:00,543
Due process

998
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:02,847
And that then liquid becomes now

999
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,895
The interesting thing is that Paul Atreides

1000
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:05,663
Is Mom

1001
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,687
Wasn't

1002
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:07,711
Supposed to have a son

1003
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,247
She was supposed to have another

1004
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:11,551
Because the movie

1005
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:17,183
To be two generations on

1006
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:17,951
Crazy

1007
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,231
So anyways

1008
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:22,815
What what are we talk

1009
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:31,263
I love to take name of the director Paul son and his daughter

1010
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,287
I'm sorry I'm sorry I did it

1011
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,847
The directors real name is John Hill

1012
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,479
You like dude

1013
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:44,575
From an article

1014
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:47,647
A document from website

1015
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:48,671
He is the messiah

1016
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:49,951
George Lucas

1017
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:52,511
Star Wars after being told telepathically what to write

1018
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:53,791
By the very Force

1019
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,583
To which the films were fur

1020
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,375
So that's part of his world

1021
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:01,215
Interesting to read living in both.

1022
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:07,615
Fake I was all comes back to

1023
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,895
To the fact that the

1024
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:10,943
Is reporting that there was a

1025
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:11,711
Drill

1026
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:14,271
On the same day that the police were engaged

1027
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,807
But if you'll pay attention

1028
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:16,575
Alex

1029
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,623
That's pretty much what he says every single time

1030
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:19,391
As well

1031
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:22,207
Now you can go case-by-case on these and I can't speak to

1032
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,487
To every single

1033
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,791
Supposed drill that Alex will talk about

1034
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:27,839
But as it relates to the 771

1035
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:30,399
BBC article about it

1036
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:32,191
They point out very clearly quotes

1037
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:36,543
Peter power of former Scotland Yard police officers her power

1038
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:41,919
Do we have to do this with every f****** name

1039
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:48,319
Sorry where do these people come from I don't know

1040
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:52,671
Copp is a former Scotland Yard police officer

1041
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:57,791
He says that the 7777

1042
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,583
That was wrong the drill

1043
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,655
Was an office base drill and involve Justice people

1044
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,423
Republic income

1045
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:06,239
Internal office

1046
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:08,287
Exercise that was Ron

1047
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:10,335
What would be the response

1048
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:13,919
It's unfortunate

1049
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,455
Horrible coincidence

1050
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,503
Act did go down

1051
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,879
Very suspicious

1052
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,183
I want

1053
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,743
Juneau Police Department

1054
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:28,511
Girls all the time

1055
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:34,143
Each day like every city and every

1056
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,191
You know principality

1057
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:39,007
Everyday there's going to be something generally

1058
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:42,079
Sort of like let's pasta our response to

1059
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:46,687
The laws of coincident

1060
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,271
You know like it's broken

1061
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:52,831
It's like if you've ever

1062
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,111
If you ever like

1063
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,135
Lifted a phone to

1064
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:55,903
To call somebody

1065
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,951
Can you find out that at that moment

1066
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,231
Start calling you

1067
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:05,119
About all the calls that are happening all the time

1068
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,399
Every single day

1069
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:08,447
It's inevitable that that happened

1070
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,727
Irregularly

1071
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:14,847
Beatles meaningful fuels like this

1072
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:15,871
This is very suspicious

1073
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:17,151
Yahtzee

1074
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,711
I get it I get why people be very suspicious

1075
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,479
About that

1076
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:22,015
But I don't

1077
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,575
It's like a dam

1078
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:28,671
In the case of this where they've talked about it like it was a tie

1079
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,207
In office

1080
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:32,767
They clearly have nothing to do with the running of

1081
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:33,791
Multiple

1082
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:34,559
Attack

1083
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:41,727
Anyway Alex belief about 77

1084
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,007
Big fake large leaf

1085
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,543
Comes back to this documentary

1086
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,335
It was written by a guy who believes in

1087
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,103
The force

1088
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,895
The Messiah

1089
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:49,919
From Dune

1090
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,199
And a lot of his overtime

1091
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:52,735
Bogus

1092
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,271
Fun

1093
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,295
I love the cops

1094
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,831
I came up to you and cried

1095
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,111
Figure line

1096
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,671
Now

1097
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,207
This is interesting

1098
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,487
This next clip

1099
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:05,279
Because this is

1100
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,095
Free

1101
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,911
The episode

1102
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,447
We when we talked about Fergie

1103
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:14,751
Alright

1104
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:17,055
Alex's response was very much

1105
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:23,199
People that burning stuff down cop killed a guy I think it was totally fine

1106
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:24,735
We apologized

1107
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,271
Wasn't White

1108
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,831
But Alex has a very

1109
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,111
John riot

1110
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:32,927
About how Paula trade

1111
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,951
Nissan Note

1112
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:37,023
Merges with sand fish and actually be

1113
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:37,791
Becomes a

1114
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:38,559
A sandworm

1115
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:42,143
Himself a power

1116
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,679
You know a few thousand years

1117
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:49,055
And Alters the entire course of human evolution which eventually leads

1118
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,079
The great scattering

1119
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,407
Mount was at the sequel to Highlander

1120
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:56,735
Now that when they go to space for some

1121
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:00,575
Alex

1122
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,599
Expresses variant

1123
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:05,951
Absolutely

1124
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:09,023
Plus riots on record a year

1125
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,143
What

1126
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,423
So that's a good thing

1127
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,983
Very weird

1128
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:24,127
Very weird when the cops kill somebody we should have a right and Burn the City

1129
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:34,879
Because they have like a Thor attarian

1130
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:40,767
Totalitarian state already

1131
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:41,791
Covid-19

1132
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,839
But here's the rear

1133
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:50,751
Is why

1134
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:51,775
See that's why the Chinese

1135
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:55,871
Can handle and at home I have the balls

1136
00:58:56,383 --> 00:59:02,271
Strength to Riot right somebody when you burn it

1137
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,295
Meanwhile

1138
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,575
Not

1139
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:09,695
Six months later or whatever

1140
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:16,095
And there were burned down

1141
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,167
No

1142
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:20,959
Breakfast

1143
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:25,567
You know protest lied to that is up minimizing the

1144
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,687
Situation dumb assholes

1145
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,991
It's like I don't understand where the

1146
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:34,527
I don't understand where the line

1147
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:35,807
Absolutely no sense

1148
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,367
Isn't one that I can really

1149
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:40,671
Toss away really easily like

1150
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,207
When we are looking at

1151
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,487
Looking at 2009

1152
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:44,255
Position

1153
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:45,279
These have been

1154
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,583
I don't think there's enough time

1155
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,375
For something to have happen

1156
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,703
Yeah I think he's just

1157
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:54,239
Racist

1158
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:57,823
Yeah there's no other explanation scared of black people

1159
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,359
Having agency

1160
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:01,407
Being mad

1161
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:03,199
Being justifiably mad about

1162
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,831
It's interesting to me

1163
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:09,599
The

1164
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:10,879
Because

1165
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:13,183
Like the more we go through this

1166
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:15,999
The more Alex's insanity

1167
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:17,791
Dubstep DuckTales

1168
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,071
Perfectly with just

1169
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:21,119
The mental gymnastics

1170
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:25,983
People require in order to justify them not

1171
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,031
You know what I'm saying

1172
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,311
But all of this

1173
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,847
Worldview all of this

1174
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:31,871
Sanity is

1175
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,663
Built around the idea that

1176
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:35,199
He believes all people

1177
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:37,503
Equally

1178
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,271
Did B

1179
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:41,343
And yet the same time he makes all of these

1180
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,879
These rules where it's like

1181
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:43,903
Japan

1182
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:44,927
We are at

1183
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:51,583
Overarching we are all underneath it all of the rules that I build

1184
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,607
Mean that

1185
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:58,239
White people are under more tyranny than everybody else

1186
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,519
Creating the tyranny

1187
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:01,311
Is destroying the white

1188
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:07,455
Exactly his worldview so even though it may appear that he doesn't care about all these other groups

1189
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:10,015
It's really because once the lights go down

1190
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:10,783
You're all neck

1191
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:17,183
He says like the West

1192
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:20,255
Behind hell on Earth on Earth

1193
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,303
The exact same sort of thing it's like

1194
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,327
Alright

1195
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,375
When

1196
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:29,983
To Native people

1197
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,775
When they happen to black people

1198
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,311
Shirts bad

1199
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,591
But I don't really care

1200
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:39,199
Because they're on the other side of that pork or whatever it's like

1201
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:41,759
That's not going to take down the Levee

1202
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,807
Right but the white people are the Levee

1203
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:49,183
He's not realizing it make sure that they get there

1204
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,743
Eddie's not realizing that like the water is

1205
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,791
You are at your

1206
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:55,071
Your Swiss cheese

1207
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:01,471
I don't know if I mailed that metaphor but

1208
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:04,287
The same type of mental gymnastics

1209
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,055
Pixar require

1210
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,591
A

1211
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:09,663
Just like

1212
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:14,271
You know it look like if you if you and so many people went to

1213
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:16,831
Trump rally in Minnesota

1214
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:20,415
150 years of our Republic

1215
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:27,839
Show me reporters went there and they asked people are like seriously what the

1216
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,959
If if this were happening

1217
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,239
We would

1218
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,519
Totally be against

1219
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:38,591
We just don't believe any of it happening

1220
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:41,151
I watched a bit of it it was very troubling

1221
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,479
No it's not

1222
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:46,783
Really it really

1223
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,063
Struck me that

1224
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,927
I watch the number these rally

1225
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:55,743
Another point there were

1226
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:56,767
Fu

1227
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,047
Not white people

1228
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:04,191
I don't want to judge whatever there

1229
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,215
Motivation

1230
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:06,751
For being there were

1231
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,543
Their own choices in life

1232
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,871
There were it wasn't

1233
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,431
Rutledge said

1234
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:18,527
And then a little bit later down the road it would be like

1235
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,343
Just that one guy with the blacks

1236
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,903
For Trump sign

1237
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:26,975
Yep yep there's that guy and then like

1238
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:28,255
He kept showing up

1239
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,791
And that was like all right we got

1240
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:31,839
This was

1241
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,631
I was looking I couldn't

1242
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,935
Anybody who wasn't like

1243
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:39,775
I don't know cuz you know

1244
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:43,103
Right I don't even know if there are anybody who

1245
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,639
Are already

1246
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:50,015
I don't know if ever been

1247
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:56,159
And I was like nope

1248
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,439
Still nobody

1249
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,719
Everybody's like

1250
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:00,255
Michaela

1251
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:06,143
I didn't know if it was him or not but I saw people clowning on Twitter but that was like

1252
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:07,167
Super high-resolution

1253
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:13,823
Picture of this bar

1254
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:14,591
Looks

1255
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:16,127
You could blow it up higher

1256
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:16,895
High-resolution

1257
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:18,175
I was looking around

1258
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:24,063
I wanted Pizza I don't know if

1259
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:25,599
Kevin McHale butt

1260
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:27,903
I know it's not Robert Parish

1261
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:30,207
Tell you that right now

1262
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:33,791
It's super weird

1263
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,327
All of this could

1264
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,351
Still down

1265
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,119
Sam's

1266
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:37,887
Look like

1267
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,935
Alex is not really

1268
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:40,959
Concerned about

1269
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:42,751
Your contacts.

1270
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:44,543
And so like

1271
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,591
Chinese people rioting

1272
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,359
Is great because

1273
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,383
Because in his brain

1274
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:49,663
Creates problems

1275
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:50,687
Tricom

1276
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:52,223
He hates so much

1277
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,831
If it were Chinese people rioting

1278
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:57,855
Here against

1279
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:58,879
Dissimilar oppression

1280
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:05,023
Let's say when the Chinese Exclusion Act was going on or something like that

1281
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:09,119
American act like that but so like if that were Happening Here

1282
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,399
He would be very good

1283
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:11,935
Creating problems

1284
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:12,703
For his

1285
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:17,567
Conception of America is white

1286
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,175
Problematic in a

1287
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:24,735
Largely African-American area

1288
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:27,295
If it were white people rioting probably be

1289
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,063
He totally fine with

1290
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,343
Especially if they were like

1291
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,111
We're against

1292
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:33,695
Chinese

1293
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:35,999
Yeah I imagine that might be okay

1294
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,023
Especially

1295
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:37,791
Subway to work it in

1296
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:40,863
Some b*******

1297
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,399
You know what interests me

1298
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:44,959
I don't know at this point

1299
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:50,335
At this point I am not going to let you know

1300
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,871
Dude for sure Highlander

1301
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,407
Moderately

1302
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,687
I love Highlander

1303
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:59,807
I'm suggesting that you do a spa podcast

1304
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:02,111
With you cuz you keep bringing it up

1305
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:05,183
It's just you know

1306
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:07,999
The Erasure of the line

1307
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:10,815
That is what fascinated me most

1308
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:11,583
About

1309
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:15,679
The way that they when they do those stories where it's like

1310
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:18,495
You know that people are

1311
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:20,799
Being torn from their parents

1312
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,847
Inputting to concentrate

1313
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,383
How can you deal with

1314
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,407
How can you support

1315
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:28,223
And instead of saying that there's a line

1316
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,271
Where they won't support Trump

1317
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,295
There's no line

1318
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:34,879
Now they just it just doesn't it just doesn't happen

1319
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,927
I know but it seems like

1320
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:39,487
Even if you are a republican you should have

1321
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,255
Thought

1322
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:42,047
At least before now

1323
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:43,327
Is there a line

1324
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,375
Is there a line

1325
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:49,215
What will it take for me to stop supporting the Republican Party

1326
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:51,007
Nasi but that's what I thought

1327
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:56,127
Democrats want you to have and that's why they would never had that thought

1328
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:58,175
It does seem strange to me that that's a thought

1329
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:58,943
Nobody

1330
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:00,479
Seems to have ever had

1331
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:01,759
Like what's the line

1332
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:04,831
What is the line for me to change my party

1333
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,391
Have you ever like I don't

1334
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:09,951
I have no Allegiance

1335
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:11,231
Stupid Democrats

1336
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:14,047
Because they are f****** garbage and they're going to ruin it

1337
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:16,351
They're going to

1338
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,399
But I have no choice

1339
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,447
Because they

1340
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:22,751
The alternative

1341
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:23,775
And at the same time

1342
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:27,103
What's My Line

1343
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:29,919
No

1344
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,455
Right because I don't

1345
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,223
I don't have an Allegiant

1346
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:33,503
So I don't have a line

1347
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:35,551
I will go with

1348
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,599
People that I think are best

1349
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:38,879
The positions that are open

1350
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,719
No that's

1351
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:45,791
Really

1352
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:50,911
Youth in like really early there's a lot of things that are disqualifying

1353
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,191
L but

1354
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,983
I think

1355
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,543
Right yeah me neither

1356
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:57,311
That's true

1357
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,615
I guess our line is not

1358
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,943
I'm sorry I'm sorry

1359
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:05,503
I mean I mean for the politically on a Philly

1360
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:08,319
The line is ultimately like

1361
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,087
Just leaving

1362
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,111
Right

1363
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:13,183
Like at what point can you not even support the Comerica

1364
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,207
Yeah yeah

1365
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:15,487
Yeah that has to be the

1366
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:16,255
The real

1367
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:20,863
Like what's that what's that line feel like it should

1368
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:21,887
Earlier

1369
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:25,215
Cross a long time ago

1370
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:30,079
I'm not afraid of planes anymore

1371
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,127
Time to go

1372
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:36,479
Time to change this up

1373
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:41,087
Get back on track the show Alex

1374
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:43,391
He wants to

1375
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,927
Duplex on Obama supporters

1376
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,719
And so he starts taking calls

1377
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:47,743
From Obama supporters

1378
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:50,815
Alright I want you people to come at me

1379
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:55,167
Don't really like Obama that much but

1380
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:55,935
These are Obama

1381
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:59,007
Are your colors

1382
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:07,455
Yes you know what that mean

1383
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:09,247
He ran into

1384
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,015
2

1385
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:15,135
Wherever I'm not sure if this person is a globalist

1386
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:17,183
But it's very possible

1387
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,767
Nothing

1388
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,815
The plane okay then the jury still out

1389
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:30,495
Chinese Telecom

1390
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,455
Welding gas wanted back with

1391
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:42,271
American Airlines

1392
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:44,575
I forgot Alice and Annie was like

1393
01:09:56,607 --> 01:10:00,703
What's going on

1394
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:04,799
You use regulations

1395
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:15,039
I don't think I prison

1396
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,855
First of all he's very well-known

1397
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:18,879
Vero

1398
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,671
Somehow involved to George Bush

1399
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:24,511
Famous we know these on American Airlines

1400
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:27,583
Absolutely very powerful

1401
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:38,847
Not a f****** chance in the world

1402
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:42,431
Also this didn't happen but I do

1403
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,967
That's exactly what

1404
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:45,759
I think that part is clear

1405
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:46,783
But

1406
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,575
I just

1407
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:49,599
Who's that

1408
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:50,367
Stupid

1409
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:51,903
Libertarian garbage

1410
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:54,719
Reframe what

1411
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,743
Regulation

1412
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:58,815
That's like all the super rich

1413
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:02,143
People already have all their money

1414
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:02,911
Enforce

1415
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,703
These are these regulations

1416
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:05,983
Make sure no one else

1417
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,263
Can get in their game

1418
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:09,311
Trust

1419
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:10,847
Monopoly

1420
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:13,151
We which we have many

1421
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:15,455
That regulations are supposed to break up

1422
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:21,855
Problem

1423
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:25,951
I don't understand idive sincerely donut

1424
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,487
The difference

1425
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:28,511
Spiritually

1426
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:29,535
Between

1427
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,839
That which would break up

1428
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:32,863
Monopoly

1429
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:34,399
And that which would regulate

1430
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:36,447
You know like I don't understand

1431
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:38,239
Like you can

1432
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:40,031
Bring a spiritual difference

1433
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:42,079
It's supporting one and not the other

1434
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:44,895
Cuz I like seems to be very against monopolies

1435
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:46,687
He hates the idea of Monopoly

1436
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:47,455
Capitalism

1437
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:50,015
Should I try

1438
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,551
Regulate business

1439
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:54,111
Let business be

1440
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:56,159
Government to break up Monopoly

1441
01:11:56,415 --> 01:12:00,255
No he does he wants the people to break up

1442
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:01,535

1443
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:02,559
Okay then how

01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:03,327
What do you mean

1445
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,351
Well

1446
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:06,399

Do you want to go into breakup Amazon you want some breakup Google

1448
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:12,031
But he doesn't want us

1449
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:12,799
To do what he wants

1450
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,335
The government to step in

1451
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,359
Okay but how

1452
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,919
Without regular

01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,247
Laurel Leaf

1454
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,015
Nope

1455
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,551
To close

1456
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:27,135
Can you use stipulation how about dance party

1457
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:28,671

Amazon.com

1459
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,231
How about

1460
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,767
Tire government

1461
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,815

We go to like your dance party

1464
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:41,471
This is a better idea

1465
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,007
Musical chairs

1466
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:44,031
Okay

1467
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,823
Everybody pays

1468
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:48,383
Amazon business

1469
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:57,343
Or like you get the book

1470
01:12:57,599 --> 01:13:02,207
Part of it okay

1471
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:04,511
Go to work

1472
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,303
Because

1473
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:09,119
Musical chairs is only going to lead over Napoli

1474
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:11,423
One person win

1475
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:15,519
Oh okay multiple rounds

1476
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:18,335
Like you guys round is 4 Prime

1477
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:20,639
This is for the shipping business

1478
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:26,527
This is for the warehouse in all right around if you win

1479
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:32,671
Bees okay throwing the dance party

1480
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:35,487
I must say I don't know it's 200 million

1481
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:38,815
To get in or something like that

1482
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:40,863
19 to walk away with something but you

1483
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:41,887
Choose what it is

1484
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:43,935
You get whatever

1485
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:49,055
Right there like one of those games where you at

1486
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:52,383
No because you get whatever musical chairs were found you

1487
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:56,223
But there's only enough rounds for as many people are they

1488
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:09,279
These are there is a dummy

1489
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:11,327
Cuz it's not fun to play musical chairs

1490
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:13,631
Here's my plan to break up

1491
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:16,191
Monopoly

1492
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:22,079
You know what that's a very big cuz I'm a big enough man to admit that Saturday

1493
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:23,359
Here's my plan

1494
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,383
Alright

1495
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,151
Firing

1496
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:30,271
All right so it's hoping to avoid this sort of thing

1497
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:33,343
Right then we have like six people with guns

1498
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:35,391
Nobody knows who has a live bullet

1499
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:36,671
And they all shoot them

1500
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:38,975
Via

1501
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:40,255
I don't know

1502
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:43,583
I guess regulation

1503
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,519
Just to reinforce Alec

1504
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:52,799
Terrible

1505
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:54,591
About that

1506
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:57,407
Very sad

1507
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:00,735
We haven't covered a whole lot

1508
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:01,759
What episode because there is a

1509
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,551
The whole lot kind of

1510
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,623
Yells about

1511
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:07,647
Fantasista

1512
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,463
But it doesn't really say anything in particular

1513
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,279
To talk about how you been right all along and yeah

1514
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:14,303
I think

1515
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:15,583
He's talking about William Benning

1516
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:25,055
I had a guy on from the NSA or whatever

1517
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:27,359
No one talked about it a little bitter about that

1518
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:31,711
LOL overall it's just a lot of zeros lot of zeros throughout

1519
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:34,527
Episode

1520
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:39,647
Everything is very vague it's always a guy who did nothing I was

1521
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:42,207
At a place where a thing happened

1522
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:45,791
Rock climb up

1523
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:48,863
Being difficult

1524
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:51,423
But the things that are important are they at

1525
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:54,239
He thinks that yelling at the guy at the BBC is Domino

1526
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,007
Dating him

1527
01:15:57,567 --> 01:16:00,383
Describing different feelings on riot

1528
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,407
Depending on the

1529
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:03,967
It's over there it's not over here

1530
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:05,759
He's just making up so much s***

1531
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:07,295
But he's making up what happened

1532
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:09,087
The TSA agent

1533
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:13,183
He's making up the top crying to him

1534
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:13,951
In London

1535
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,743
He's making up

1536
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:18,303
Former cop making up this

1537
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:21,631
He's just creating it like

1538
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:23,167
Great Samuel Jackson movie

1539
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:29,567
He probably had a really boring trip that was mostly Pleasant outside of getting dunked on on UK television

1540
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:33,151
He's trying to create a mythology out of it cuz he doesn't

1541
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:34,943
Away from the states very often

1542
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,735
I can understand that

1543
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:40,831
Fish and chips

1544
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:42,623
But make no mistake about it

1545
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:43,647
His life isn't Dane

1546
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:50,303
You talk about the Boston Bomber

1547
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:58,751
Release the photos by the grace of God the photos

1548
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:01,055
We focused on the drill real quick

1549
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:04,383
We released the photos that were already out that sentence

1550
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,919
God

1551
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:13,087
And they freaked out and be really honest with you

1552
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:15,391
I know in my gut

1553
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:20,511
Discussion

1554
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:26,911
And some other agency or group might just I'm sick of that guy do it

1555
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:27,935
Well you know what

1556
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:35,615
You're not

1557
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:42,527
FBI CIA

1558
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:43,551
The TSA

1559
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:45,599
Could be the APA the emir

1560
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:51,999
American poolplayers Association Protection Agency of Bradshaw and Farooq

1561
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:54,559
Could be

1562
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:56,351
Kirby the CDC

1563
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,887
Could be the TFC

1564
01:17:58,143 --> 01:17:59,935
What's up

1565
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:06,335
TCM Turner Classic Movies

1566
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:08,383
The rapper

1567
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,407
Alright

1568
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:14,783
Slater Alex Jones

1569
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:16,575
Seems to care about killing him

1570
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:18,623
To our great regret

1571
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:20,927
I'm fine with them not dying but

1572
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:22,719
It's just

1573
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:23,999
It's becoming

1574
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:28,607
Laborious

1575
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:32,959
I still live I love doing the show and I still love learning about these things

1576
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:34,495
Because he's such a perfect conduit in

1577
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:37,823
Into learning about things that I would not have any access to otherwise

1578
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:40,127
But it is becoming a thing where it's like

1579
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:41,407
4 years

1580
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:43,967
Just like that

1581
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:46,783
And then you see him now and he's doing the same

1582
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,063
He's doing the same bit

1583
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,599
And it's really it's like

1584
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:51,903
Cena comic Francisco

1585
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:54,719
I don't want to see anybody in particular because I don't know the man

1586
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:56,767
Someone

1587
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:57,791
Like

1588
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:01,375
I don't know somebody

1589
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,911

See them do basically the same site with

1593
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:09,311
With the same crowd work

1594
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,079
The same

1595
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:10,847

1599
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,111
Is all you got

1600
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:23,903

To meet there wasn't a ton of me but

1607
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:43,615
The reason that I still stand by it and I can

1608
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:44,639
This was a

1609
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:46,431
Exactly the right episode to do

1610
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:47,455
Was because

1611
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:50,527

1612
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:53,087
