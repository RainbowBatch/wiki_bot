91
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,647
Emporia

92
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,415
Do you like apples

93
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,559

00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,727
I found these old Alex Jones episode

96
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,007
I found episode

97
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:03,775
Woods dating back

98
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,591
2 2004 all right

99
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:12,991
So how do you like them apples was relevant at the time is

100
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,575
Okay I found episodes

101
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
2003

102
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,671
Most insufferable and very boring

103
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
In the present day

104
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,511
Ignore him in the

105
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,071
But I also don't want to

106
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,095
Constantly

107
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:31,167
Just looking at him in the present day

108
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,191
To be dumb

109
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,775
It's worthwhile as a sort of social thing

110
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:40,127
Total electoral exercise I don't really care all that much

111
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,663
How about listening to a guy concert

112
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,967
Bentley say he's fighting the devil and then I'm

113
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,247
Supposed to take it seriously

114
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:50,111
And be like

115
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:54,719
I imagine that the audience does get a little bit bored with

116
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,511
I didn't listen to the third hour

117
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,791
Was too boring

118
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:04,191
Oh yeah and a lot of times I did listen to it and I'm just a guy who cares nothing in there

119
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,495
We will obviously still be talking about the Press

120
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,567
For today I needed to go back

121
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,359
Far back as I could

122
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,199
Today

123
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,783
2003 that won Christopher Lloyd Gaston

124
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,111
No

125
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,159
This episode is

126
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,695
Amazing

127
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,999
Number of reason

128
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
The bloom

129
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,351
Okay I am convinced now

130
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
I just

131
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
It's

132
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
It's a new day

133
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,311
It's a new day

134
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:45,919
Twenty years ago myself like getting these reinvigoration

135
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,223
Through like whenever it can find

136
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,991
These old-time

137
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:53,087
Frames to look back on it really is recharging of my batteries and

138
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
It's ma'am

139
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135

140
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,927

May 1st

142
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,999
2003

143
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:04,095
Do you remember 2003 much humor was gone insane

144
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,631
Don't remember

145
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:10,751
Just ended a boy did we just mission accomplished

146
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:17,151
That was that day May 1st May 1st

147
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:20,223
2003 was the day that George Bush landed on the

148
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,271
The aircraft carrier with the bishop

149
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,295
An accomplished Banner

150
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,111
VI day as we all know it now

151
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,159
Victory was upon us

152
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
We're going to find out a number things

153
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,815
Things are really in

154
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,583
Listing to me

155
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
Five most excited to learn about

156
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
Are things like

157
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,471
How is Alex Jones's opposition

158
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
Into bush

159
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,519
And the Iraq War

160
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,311
How does it exist

161
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,847
Bush is in office

162
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:51,199
Prism of history in the context of knowing

163
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,479
How he behaves

164
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,527
Amore generally as a

165
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
Is a pattern

166
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,087
How can we apply that to this

167
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,111
Source material

168
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,671
Anyway

169
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,951
I believe you did you know

170
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,487
The New World Order

171
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:04,767
Has a plan

172
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:11,679
How many years was 18 years ago

173
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:16,799
We are now

174
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,807
Border

175
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
Control

176
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,279
That is all

177
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,167
Your health

178
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,663
Martial law

179
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:01,087
Bill Clinton want to know about Clyde

180
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,367
Don't care

181
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,647
Immediately I'm list

182
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,671
Something to this and I'm like

183
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,951
This dude

184
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,487
Is doing a voice

185
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,047
I wanted it I wanted to

186
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,071
Youth performance

187
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:16,959
This is so weird because I was I was literally writing down like I don't know how to describe it but

188
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,983
Sounds fatter

189
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,567
Has something to do with the way

190
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:27,967
He's filling up his mom's with air I think he's doing a bit of a Rush Limbaugh impression

191
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,503
It has a sound.

192
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,831
It's just

193
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:37,183
It's remarkable it sounds like a guy who thinks he knows he's doing

194
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,999
Got it just

195
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:53,055
You're constantly rebuilding the ship as you sail

196
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,079
That's how it's always work

197
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
Is it

198
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:03,551
Say it was really hard so I can't find the original article that I was talking about from the Pensacola News Journal nor can I

199
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,367
Find articles about archives

200
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:12,767
However I did find a geocities level website that's copied and pasted what supposedly that's articles I'm going to go

201
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:17,119
Read me article you can tell if it was going on there was a situation

202
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,679
Where the school called Hobbs Middle School

203
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,727
Who's part of a partnership with Whiting

204
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,263
Field Naval Air Station

205
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,847
A list of people coming to the

206
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,151
The school he was part of them volunteering to help

207
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,431
Search for a day

208
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:36,319
He did his very basic presentation as if the military was in charge of the school to help the students better understand the issues

209
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,135
They were facing the civilians in Kosovo at the time

210
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,951
As is clearly laid out as being effective

211
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,719
In the article

212
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
What are Whitfield

213
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,559
Students Julie McCool said the Press

214
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,351
The military personnel in her school

215
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:52,191
Made the news she been watching from Yugoslavia seemed a little more real

216
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,519
Georgia great it to use is an impactful lesson

217
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,799
For the students

218
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:03,199
Personally I don't think any military should go anywhere near a middle school

219
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:07,551
That's just me I mean I assume that they weren't like hey let's become fashion

220
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,367
Rested but I mean

221
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,951
The idea of making the newsreel are helping the

222
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,279
Students understand totally totally

223
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,327
If you were going as far as like

224
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,351
Hitting the kids with

225
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,167
I'm out

226
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,311
And also to sort of what you're saying

227
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,895
Be in favor of things that are basically like

228
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
PR

229
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,967
For the Armed Forces directed at school

230
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,039
That would kind of be a huge thing for me like that

231
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:45,183
I've been a Miyazaki fan for a long time and the military teaching children it's okay to be in the military is

232
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,207
Big deal

233
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,511
From the article

234
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,071
What I was getting from it is not so much

235
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,095
But they were teaching

236
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:58,751
It still has the effective rubbing off in like maybe turning these people into icon

237
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,543
Can you look up home

238
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,127
I can also see though like how this kind of an activity could be

239
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,199
Really positive educational tool for the

240
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,735
Some kind of

241
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,503
Position on it

242
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,063
On the one hand it could have the effect of making

243
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,391
These youths think that the Army is super cool but on the other hand

244
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,439
It also has the potential to open up the students

245
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
Two things they wouldn't

246
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,743
The chance to experience otherwise

247
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,791
Princeton's from this article

248
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,095
Quote last year students from Hobbs

249
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:28,447
SS Dixon Primary School email with a coast guard lieutenant

250
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,751
Bound for the South Pole

251
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,287
And had a video teleconference

252
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,567
What's their friend

253
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,335
She got there

254
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,895
That could be a really neat opportunity for students

255
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,943
To learn directly about all sorts of things

256
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,527
Much more real than reading about the South Pole in a book

257
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,575
Could be a positive thing

258
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
Yeah sure

259
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,135
What's it like on the boat

260
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
Have you ever seen a man die

261
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,719
We have to keep rebuilding

262
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,255
Before I've seen

263
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,535
Cool man

264
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,815
That you my arms

265
00:13:55,071 --> 00:14:01,215
Also it's a where that voice cat was a weird voice

266
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,263
Keep in mind that these are middle schools to

267
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:10,175
Opposed to this being done with an elementary school since I could process any of this

268
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
You get Alex

269
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,319
Goodbye Middle School the kids should be exactly at the point where this could be a great experience for them

270
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,135
They're not too young to process it and not too old

271
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,183
To think that it's really dumb

272
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,975
Chiltern High School

273
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,023
Also this is an article for March

274
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,655
1999 so it's nice to see the 2003 Alex doesn't deal with

275
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,935
The thinking it's 2000

276
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:36,031
3 in word listening about Clinton and Kosovo and

277
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,591
I do think that that is a very important

278
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,383
Historical

279
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
Yeah yeah

280
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:49,087
If you're talkin about militarization of police post 911 obviously certainly a

281
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,111
Topic worth

282
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,415
Conversing about

283
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,951
You're leaving the show with his like

284
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,767
The military coming into a school

285
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,327
In Pensacola like that was pretty 911

286
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,863
You just need to

287
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,399
Better

288
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,167
To be able to just

289
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
Wok on a play

290
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:09,311
Whatever whatever the military was at school you can walk on to a place yet

291
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
Story from

292
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:15,711
The past is being woven in with a new headline Alex's read about

293
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
Program

294
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,559
If not it's over

295
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,727
So this doesn't really relate at all

296
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,287
Old story was about a day with military

297
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,103
A bakery in educational experience

298
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
This is more or less

299
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:48,223
The press release about a youth program run by former

300
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,527
The Young Marines is basically I'm bored

301
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,319
Discipline Focus version of the scouts

302
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:56,415
Corley go to the social organization performer

303
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,999
They basically put kids in boot camp like conditions and have them

304
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,303
Eat MREs in order to build strength in dis

305
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,095
Everything I can tell

306
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,655
It's definitely an anti-drug program but

307
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,959
Did not get the sense that it's anti-gun

308
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,543
Heated being in this group and I think it's

309
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,103
F***** up but the only way anyone's going to go to it

310
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,943
Is if they and their parents agree to take part in it so I'm not going to sweat too much

311
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,759
Time completely weather choices

312
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
I don't have to

313
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,087
The Iraq war is just

314
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,391
Speak going on

315
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:31,487
The Iraq war is just beginning what he said that mission accomplished sign up

316
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,791
What's the beginning of the Iraq War

317
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
No it did not

318
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,351
No it did not that was

319
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,143
That was way back when

320
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,471
Yeah man we really thought we were going to get out of there Dan

321
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:47,359
I don't know if I thought that back that absolutely did not I thought these guys were going to f*** everything up and we were all going to die

322
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,175
So Alex is above the political divide

323
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,711
The left-right paradigm

324
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,735
All this stuff

325
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,759
Think about Clinton's

326
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,039
2003

327
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,855
He's above the left right there

328
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,903
Here's where things

329
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,671
You get a little muddy

330
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,375
Edward

331
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,935
No freedom

332
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,615
Evercore

333
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:24,223
America

334
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,551
That's pretty Illuminating

335
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
Tumi

336
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:31,135
It's really the Corvallis fake presentation to being above

337
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,159
Two-party Sher

338
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,999
He's presenting a position where the conservatives that they're actually secret liberals

339
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,791
Which is why the two parties don't matter

340
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,351
Cuz they're both not far enough to the right

341
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
Therefore they're actually

342
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
Play the same thing

343
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:50,079
What is above a two-party system at party system because I want to destroy them

344
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,151
Institute a theocracy what don't you understand

345
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:57,503
It would be just openly Advocate that he feels alienated by politics

346
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,295
Cuz he's way far to the right

347
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,599
Anything that exists

348
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:05,695
In 2003 he knows that's not going to appeal to a wide audience

349
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,719
Who plays the game

350
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
Being like

351
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,279
Call the left and the right is a lie

352
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,815
I not ended you know why

353
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,351
If you actually are conservative

354
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,143
You've got to be an extremist

355
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,679
Yes to the right because

356
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:19,519
These are really hardcore right-wing people are actually towed grit liberal

357
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,567
Yeah yeah that makes sense

358
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:29,247
At this point there was talk of

359
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,295
Do you need for the provisional government

360
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,063
Interact

361
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,879
Do you figure out how to set up

362
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,159
A system

363
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
There once

364
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,719
We were to withdraw

365
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:45,887
Well it turns out that crony capitalism is

366
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,983
Combined with colonialism does not work out well for anyone

367
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,543
Crazy

368
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:05,855
Appointment

369
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:21,727
I don't know how to read Alex's Stone there I really don't know what

370
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,055
Is he's he's being facetious or I was going to say

371
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,103
Smugness to it more than a facetious

372
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,639
I mean they had really

373
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:35,039
Hdbaset vacation at that test

374
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,999
Major things

375
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:48,607
Contributing to the mass of the stabilization in Iraq so it's keeping

376
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,655
Facetious in such ways that like

377
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,983
These get these idiots are trying to get rid of the best party

378
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,031
Or is he actually thinking that

379
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,567
The party is what's going to

380
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,359
Continue going on I think

381
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,663
That's based on the context that I have green

382
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,687
From listening to the rest of

383
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
This episode

384
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,759
I believe it Alex thinks

385
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:09,343
The cia's running fast party people

386
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
What's the Dow

387
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,719
Saddam was allowed to get away sure I set my alarm somewhere

388
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,255
Okay I'm okay

389
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,583
Workout

390
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,911
Susan hole

391
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,935
But

392
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:25,983
I think Ethan

393
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,775
Thinks that the best party loyalist

394
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,567
Some folks who the CIA

395
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:34,175
Trained up and all this will pretend that they weren't part of the bath party or whatever

396
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,455
And then they will become

397
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
People who are

398
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
The puppets

399
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,527
For the u.s.

400
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,551
Within Iraq

401
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,575
Moving forward

402
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:44,671
Betray them like they always do

403
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,207
I think that that that's

404
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:52,607
That's that's where he's going to lie is one of the things that I

405
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
Do you want to track

406
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,447
I'm interested to see how Alex's tone goes

407
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,727
During the

408
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,751
Pacification

409
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,103
For or against

410
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:09,503
I don't know really good question requires a nuanced to Alex's absolutely incapable of now

411
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,879
2003 Alex I think

412
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,952
At this point it seems like he's opposed based on this

413
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,536
Party members being allowed at the government

414
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,096
Right then based on political ideology

415
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,632
WWE super against house

416
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,680
Baby blanket

417
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,960
From all sorts of position

418
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,520
It just seems like

419
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,568
Zoopla he can't possibly be for

420
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,360
What would

421
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,640
What could

422
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,432
Possum

423
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,992
The only thing that Alex could before

424
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,016
A slide

425
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,576
We forced all of them to believe in Jesus

426
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,856
Jesus as their lord

427
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
Savior now

428
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,256
You're coming at this with too much of a 2021 allergies but I'm bitter and

429
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,560
What am I supposed to do

430
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,144
Like obviously can't have perfectly

431
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,704
Naive eyes

432
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,032
Different

433
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,568
Different different person

434
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,616
It's a Devour the same person

435
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,992
And you'll see a lot of similarities

436
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,064
What are the things I noticed I was listening to this

437
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,088
Is that he is

438
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,392
Definitely way more doing

439
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,208
And he goes to calls

440
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,768
And then I'll get back to a story and then later get back

441
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,536
Custom Calls

442
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,816
Like he jumps around

443
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:31,424
A lot of normal talk radio show

444
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,192
The f****** Russia

445
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,984
Compression look this is outrageous

446
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,256
What do you have more

447
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,584
Louis

448
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,912
Because

449
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:19,552
Sarge's I heard that impression

450
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:24,416
Guns is less crime can we covered exhaustively cuz

451
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,440
He talks about it all the

452
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:27,744
True

453
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,536
But I was listening to this

454
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,560
I felt like

455
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,864
I can see how someone would hear that

456
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:33,888
And believe

457
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:34,912
Yeah

458
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,960
Because it intuitively makes sense

459
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:40,800
If I were a criminal why would I

460
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,104
Risk going somewhere where someone has a gun

461
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,944
As opposed to somewhere where someone doesn't have a gun

462
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,784
Authoritatively

463
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,344
Almost certain the mocking the alternative

464
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,112
Right

465
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:57,696
Why wouldn't you just assume I knows what he's talking about you make sense

466
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,488
You know sometimes

467
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:03,072
Things are incorrect

468
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:07,168
It's the same way that people think about the death penalty of like well it's

469
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:09,216
The consequence is so high

470
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,752
Then that should act as a DE

471
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,800
Deterrent in the same

472
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,592
It makes sense of the macro or it's like

473
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,360
Well I'll be

474
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,920
Seriously we're not getting into a nuclear war because of

475
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,688
Mutually assured

476
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,224
Destruction

477
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,552
What's a deterrent against doing that but that is except

478
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,368
You're f****** hungry man you know like that's

479
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,160
That's a bigger deal then

480
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:31,744
Whether or not you're researching the possibility that they sold

481
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,304
You need to do it and you don't like that kind

482
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,608
Doesn't make sense in the micro-level

483
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,216
George Bush

484
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,496
Describe his politics

485
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,264
It's like on the

486
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,032
Spectrum

487
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,312
Right-to-left

488
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,712
Put him in the the the like

489
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,504
Not far right

490
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,784
Not center-right

491
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,832
It's part of like

492
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:00,928
I want to kill everybody but I want them to think I'm nice while I do it

493
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,952
Would you call him

494
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
Conservative

495
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,536
Compared to now

496
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,608
You're wrong on all counts

497
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,656
Conservative

498
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,832
Because

499
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,904
So he's a super socialist

500
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,672
Yeah

501
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,696
He's a super social

502
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,000
Socialistic

503
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,024
Creature

504
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,560
English

505
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,352
Just Cabinets

506
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,656
Alright

507
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,216
That cabinet

508
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,240
See now that's

509
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,264
That's a cabinet

510
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,800
Filled with pure psychopath

511
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,616
That's the thing about George W bush

512
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,640
I don't think he gave us

513
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:56,992
Push it I think you just filled the Psychopaths

514
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,552
Murder let's see if we can surround esteem

515
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,112
Just get it full of weirdos

516
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:06,464
Out of it Lisa Fred least four of the people in George Bush's cabinet

517
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,864
Had personally strangle the person you don't like that kind of level up so excited to see the tooth

518
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,936
M4 election happen

519
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,216
Anyway

520
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,520
At this next clip I think is is is why

521
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,592
How much does talking about how he doesn't feel bad

522
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,128
For Saddam which obviously

523
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,408
I guess that's

524
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,200
You haven't feel bad that

525
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,272
Missing

526
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,296
Target Field

527
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,832
Versa.

528
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:33,856
Alex

529
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,136
Play something she says later

530
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,184
I think he thinks he's on an island somewhere

531
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,744
Obviously don't feel bad for it

532
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,144
It's not like Saddam was Napoleon where they're like okay we got to Exile you that's our solution to this problem

533
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,472
And then Alex gives voice to some stuff that I can actually

534
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,240
You know

535
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,008
Appreciate

536
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,336
Feels bad for the citizens

537
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,360
The people

538
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:58,432
Look on the ground being affected by

539
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:02,016
But if you pay attention to this

540
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,088
Is one of these indications that you can get

541
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,392
Even this empathetic

542
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,160
Kind of

543
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,720
Vibe that seems really grounded in

544
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,768
Decent actually rooted

545
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,352
Sentiment

546
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,120
Her in the giant armored

547
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:10,112
Bored

548
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,584
It's all in service of just

549
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352
Strong

550
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,120
Anti-government

551
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:21,888
Position

552
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
Yeah I don't

553
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,680
I don't see him

554
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,704
I'm carrying as much

555
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,984
Now about the

556
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,288
Hundreds of millions that were slaughtered by the

557
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:30,848
You know what

558
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,128
No

559
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,944
Continue caring about these

560
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,224
These people it's over after

561
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,040
Today but yeah and that's that's part of the reason

562
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:39,808
It's really interesting

563
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,088
Set an alarm

564
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,160
He comes from a place

565
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,696
Of any like

566
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,720
Solid

567
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,488
Center

568
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,768
Yeah it's not

569
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,328
It doesn't feel like it's based on intrinsic

570
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,376
Make believe

571
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,960
Stop position to cover

572
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,752
Yeah yeah yeah

573
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:04,640
A little bit taken aback because it seems like I want to say that this is a Slicker show

574
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,664
Already

575
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,712
Little bit

576
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:11,296
VR controllers exactly but

577
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,832
It's hard to like

578
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,368
Oh well see

579
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,392
Just because he

580
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
He's

581
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,512
I would say it's almost more disingenuous

582
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,560
By being a Slicker show

583
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,608
Oh yeah I agree with that video

584
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,960
And I think that's part of the reason why I feel

585
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,264
Cuz I can see how someone

586
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,544
Believe it

587
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,104
See how someone like listening to clip like that

588
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,896
To be like yeah this guy gets it

589
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,736
Who is f***** up

590
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,016
For killing civilians

591
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,808
Overseas

592
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,088
Yeah

593
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,696
It's the hook to get people to

594
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,000
Falling

595
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,560
No it seems wrestling

596
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,840
It's it's

597
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,656
Disingenuous in so

598
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:01,984
Evil

599
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:06,848
Jessieville

600
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,432
Imma John Bircher behind like hey it's wrong to kill civilians

601
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,992
Because you his answer is yeah it's wrong to

602
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:19,392
Kill civilians until I want to you know it's kind of situation and just leaves out that last part

603
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,440
Which in the present day

604
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,464
He

605
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,536
Kind of leaves today yeah he's mostly leaves

606
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,840
So

607
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,632
Will get you a lot more

608
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,912
Flight over trickery

609
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,936
Because I think you seats

610
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:35,008
Some pretty Stark examples of it later on

611
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:41,152
Society comes up later then

612
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,200
This is about

613
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,272
Security Institute

614
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:49,088
And IB system for livestock

615
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,904
Concerned largely about

616
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,976
Vulnerabilities within the food

617
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,792
Ability to

618
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:02,144
Know if there is a diseased cattle somewhere the causes blah blah blah

619
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,432
Bureaucracy

620
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,264
Sims 3 mocking

621
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,800
The idea of the

622
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,360
Protecting the food supply

623
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:47,200
That's interesting cuz that does fit the tone of some of the rest of his coverage throughout the show

624
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,736
But what it doesn't fit

625
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,272
Is the town of one of his

626
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,040
Commercials

627
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:56,160
Are you prepared

628
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,744
Biological

629
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,080
Alright

630
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,896
Can see how can flip

631
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,456
Messages would cause problems for us

632
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,272
Early listeners to the show

633
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:26,880
Bizarre

634
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:32,256
Why you're not raking in the cash problem

635
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:35,072
Very weird Ted Anderson is still selling crap

636
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:39,680
Survival

637
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:42,240
Being their best

638
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,544
A spectre to drum up

639
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,312
The fears of

640
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,152
Do the food chain

641
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,176
Food supply

642
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:53,248
Interested

643
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,016
I think that is

644
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,040
More government

645
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,600
And more taxes and attacks your cat

646
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,368
Yeah

647
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,136
He says

648
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,672
Loving ice

649
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,512
You know I don't know man

650
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,072
School

651
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,376
You like playing games recess

652
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:16,032
Blackmagic no cherry bombs

653
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:22,432
Blackmagic if you're out

654
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,224
Means but I remember

655
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,760
Exhaustive

656
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,832
Conversation

657
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,112
Beginning of the

658
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:33,440
What you first find out about the kid who's like

659
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:40,096
Oh no he's going to take his balls and he's going to take his ball s*** now we don't know how we have nothing to play with

660
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,632
Remember

661
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:44,960
The conversation of rules more than I remember for B2

662
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,288
Well here's the good news for square still legal

663
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,056
However

664
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,848
Dodgeball has been

665
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,384
Bam

666
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:11,072
The girls

667
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,352
Big the Run

668
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,752
Everyone loved

669
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:16,352
I can't find it

670
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,424
If I rested for Pre-K

671
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,520
School hours dodgeball game stats such a

672
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,288
Hate those by

673
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,312
I hate that ship

674
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,336
How much of the

675
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,360
Like one

676
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:30,176
It seems silly now not to realize

677
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,968
The dodgeball at that age is

678
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:34,272
Is essentially a way to facilitate bully

679
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,624
I'm happy playing at

680
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,720
We all know the game we're all doing a great job

681
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,488
The kids you're just

682
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,584
Like so many guys just picked on this phone

683
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,120
Everybody loves to play the game

684
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,656
He wasn't the runt

685
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:55,520
Yeah I think I like I think it is a game that can

686
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,288
Get abusive

687
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,080
Yeah

688
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,104
People not wanting

689
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,384
Play Mission before

690
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,408
Quiet

691
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,272
I guess if people want to play during recess

692
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,160
Almost Nationwide

693
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,464
Anderson the different way that Alex

694
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,512
The talking about his school days violin

695
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:17,792
Here in 2000

696
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:24,960
Very less.

697
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,496
Jump that guy's guts out

698
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:29,568
The present-day understanding of Alex

699
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,848
Says poor bird

700
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:33,152
Couple people

701
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:40,064
It's weird that he be sitting here 2003 laughing whimsically about

702
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,856
Back in the day did I murder

703
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,136
I did kill it

704
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,416
But I did Kill

705
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,696
I hate those f******

706
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,976
Story so much of life

707
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:50,560
Grew up we used to go out back and get hit with

708
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,984
You guys are all legitimately and say that I think you believe it

709
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,008
Thompson

710
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,056
You did not turn out fight

711
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:05,152
Do not tell me that story and then not connected to your violence

712
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,200
Present and that's why they're bad

713
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:07,968
Dodgeball

714
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,992
Of course now

715
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,784
Do you think has been arrested

716
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,064
This is going to be

717
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,368
This is a trivia question what is a variable

718
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:17,184
Alright get arrested for musical chairs

719
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,464
Yes absolutely

720
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,000
30 to 40 people at a

721
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,024
Time daily

722
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,584
You probably heard they're making

723
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,432
You get arrested

724
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:40,992
Spell did you bring it

725
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,392
No Rest for musical chairs

726
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,952
I would like to

727
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,512
Statistics on the FBI publish

728
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:58,656
Musical chairs related arrests

729
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:01,216
Bureau of Justice statistics

730
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:08,896
Yeah I don't know I mean I feel like I called musical chairs can't get a little bit

731
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:09,664
Supposed to

732
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:16,064
Like you're some kid is fighting with somebody over a chair

733
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,928
Got to deal with this now

734
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:24,000
Deep into a conversation

735
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,024
Buchanan can't do it

736
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,560
Schools the government

737
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,096
Does cracking down

738
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,008
WorldNetDaily

739
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,384
Girls

740
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,712
Spell Herald

741
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,144
So that's

742
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,680
What's a good story

743
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,728
Are we still doing

744
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,056
Peterson Elementary School in

745
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:09,824
Specific

746
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,360
What happened was that there's

747
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:14,176
The teacher at the school who witnessed some not specified public

748
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:14,944
Displays of affection

749
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,712
Recess

750
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:19,552
Decided to disallow girls

751
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,320
Boys

752
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,600
From Talking during recess

753
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:27,744
Obviously this is taking things a little bit far but also Alex is completely blowing this out of proportion

754
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,792
Talk to a girl

755
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,584
Would get arrested on criminal charges

756
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,632
That's totally made-up

757
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,960
Because I suspect even Alex knows the talk about the story on the merits of it

758
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,752
Might come off as a little desperate

759
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:41,056
To make your audience outrage

760
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:44,640
Honestly he's missing the forest for the trees here and there is a

761
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,688
Much much better story to be told

762
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:51,296
That is the story of Sarah Mains and Hannah Guerrero

763
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:54,880
12 year old girls at the school who took issue with the rule that got made

764
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,160
And protested against

765
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,720
Hannah straight-up formed astute

766
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,744
Committee study

767
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,072
I need the school's rules and figured out the proper steps to get a complaint

768
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:06,912
They got all the protesting students parents to sign off on

769
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:09,728
Straits that held a protest to have their complaint

770
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,312
Sarah's mother puts it so Wellness article from The Herald and News

771
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:16,384
I'm so proud of my daughter the hardest part was to walk

772
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,176
Into that school after protesting like that

773
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,248
I think she learned something important

774
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
Heartwarming

775
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:26,112
Yeah it is nice to know that no matter what era were in

776
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:28,160
It is a universal rule that

777
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,720
Children are way better people than adults

778
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,000
By a wide margin

779
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:36,608
Also the principal of the school said no disciplinary action will be taken against the protesters

780
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,144
He's willing to hear any complaints

781
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,168
Some students in Paris

782
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:43,008
Where you basically have here is a situation where a teacher

783
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:43,776
Possibly

784
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,592
Probably

785
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,360
Be concerned about

786
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:50,432
This led to an overly broad being put in place

787
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,480
Switch got students to become active in opposition

788
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:57,344
Listen to it these kids learn how to appropriately and effectively have their voices heard how to present

789
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,880
Argument through proper channels

790
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:03,744
Power is honestly an amazing story and I'm so impressed by these kids

791
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,536
What a bunch of

792
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,816
Text story

793
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,864
Really inspirational is abs

794
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,912
From coverage place

795
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,960
Because the story isn't real to Alec

796
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,032
Prove to be an effective for IPs

797
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:19,616
Details to make it something the government was doing to these kids

798
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:22,176
As opposed to an Ethiopian Ministry of decision

799
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:25,248
It makes me kind of sad because the Infowars audiences

800
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,808
Is deprived the story about students getting involved

801
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,088
Direct civicaction

802
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,672
Because I'm focusing on that too much makes it clear

803
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,208
This whole thing about flirting

804
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:34,976
Becoming a

805
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,000
Criminal act

806
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,280
Complete bulshit

807
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:43,680
Keeps the audience engaged I mean the story is essentially a microcosm

808
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:47,264
People taking on the government

809
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:51,104
Exactly like Alex would want them to do theoretically

810
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,872
However

811
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:55,967
That would be bad for his audience to actually take civicaction's

812
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,991
Change things

813
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:59,039
Because then he would run out of money

814
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:02,367
The students protesting

815
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,903
You know try and change

816
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:08,767
Do the government by sending a bunny to a blowhard

817
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:15,679
And then they were like take care of it

818
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,703
Are you just

819
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:21,055
Tip of the spear going out this teacher one send me money

820
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,591
Pamphlet

821
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,127
Geneva selling

822
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:26,943
Yeah that would be who Alex's

823
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,735
If you had sex

824
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,527
She's just in it for the apples

825
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:36,927
How does the still work I think that's why I'm a little I'm a little depressed about going back to 2

826
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,207
2003 because

827
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,999
How do adults still go

828
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,535
Get caught up in this b*******

829
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:42,559
Look at this

830
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:48,959
It's the same story that we're hearing about now the same story

831
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,239
Symptoms adults

832
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:54,591
Are still it's like at no point in time are they like

833
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,639
Have I heard this exact same thing

834
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,919
20 years ago and I'm

835
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,455
I'm fine

836
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,735
I think that you forget

837
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:07,135
Let me know we're on Christmas happy whatever year

838
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:09,695
I think it's worth Evergreen things

839
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,743
Media ecosystem is like these

840
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,559
These complaints that somehow the

841
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,327
Do you know

842
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,887
All of the kids are being softened its

843
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:18,911
School clothes

844
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,727
It's just something that will never not elicit a reaction

845
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:22,495
Come from

846
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:23,263
That audience

847
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:26,335
No of course because if they were to hear that

848
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,103
The kids

849
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,407
Weren't fighting at all they were learn

850
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,199
Using their words

851
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,991
Organizing and then make

852
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,783
Real change in the world

853
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,807
That would not

854
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,599
Fit in with their kids

855
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,623
Airsoft

856
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,719
You kind of look like

857
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,999
Idiot for fighting

858
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,815
Instead of learning

859
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,095
Organizing

860
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:53,471
And those girls who started that protested got the committee going study the rules

861
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,007
Big accomplish

862
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:57,055
What they set out to accomplish

863
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,847
And I ain't one of those screw up to

864
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,895
To be Michelle Obama

865
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,455
That's one of the important lessons

866
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,991
Think of being deprived from the audience

867
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:10,623
But that's how it's supposed to be if you want to get more depressed about 6

868
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,159
About the past a present

869
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:16,511
Great about how I'm to which you are awake

870
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,815
The British government

871
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,455
Piles of dead animals

872
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:41,087
You'll see

873
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,903
Bio weapons

874
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:44,927
By accident

875
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:56,959
Just amazing

876
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,751
So many similarities

877
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,031
Wow

878
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:02,079
There's no truth to it

879
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:08,479
Interesting late in the aftermath of the 2001 brake in the UK

880
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:13,599
Subsequent investigations have shown that it started on a farm that was feeding its livestock

881
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,367
Country

882
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,671
Stop.

883
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,207
The days immediately after the outbreak

884
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:21,535
What are the popular theories was it there was a vial of this

885
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:25,375
Specific strain of foot-and-mouth released

886
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,399
From Porton down

887
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,679
A biological lab

888
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,447
In England

889
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:35,103
This is an interesting story was essentially the present-day theories about the novel Coronavirus

890
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,455
At various points of the early days of the 2020 outbreak Alex's suggested that it was

891
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:41,247
Intentionally or accidentally released

892
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,271
From the Wuhan in

893
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,295
Institute of virology

894
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,575
He's also discussed

895
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,415
Race specific bioweapons to bolster his claims

896
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:53,279
This is like looking into a funhouse mirror of the past

897
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,839
I'm trying to torture you with us

898
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:58,911
Which act like okay I get there

899
00:45:59,167 --> 00:45:59,679
That says

900
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,703
Is it species or whatever

901
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:04,543
And people are going to do that you know just because something shouldn't

902
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,079
Exist doesn't mean it's not going to

903
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:06,847
Right

904
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,615
What you

905
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:12,479
Can't possibly think it's a good idea even if you could make a race specific bioweapon

906
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,527
You can't think it's a good idea to leave it

907
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:17,087
Anywhere

908
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:19,135
You have to have that in a safe

909
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,415
Inside of a safe

910
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:22,207
Inside of another safe with

911
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:25,023
Like surrounded by people who've lost their hands

912
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:28,095
You can't open it

913
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,143
You whatever Endeavor to make something

914
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,935
So stupid and destructive

915
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:38,591
You would have to keep it in a parody of security

916
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,895
Oops away from all white people

917
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,175
Not okay

918
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:45,759
And also Ray Pacifica

919
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,039
Guardian

920
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,599
The various theories about the foot-in-mouth outbreak

921
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:52,927
Unfortunately for the

922
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:55,999
Conspiracy they spoke to a representative

923
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:58,047
We have never worked on foot and mouth

924
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,839
It doesn't sound like

925
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:03,935
Admitting that it was released from there but yet

926
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:07,007
They don't say that's weird

927
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,567
Colic

928
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,895
This Guardian article also discusses the Revelation that months

929
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:18,015
Before the outbreak people from the Ministry of Agriculture were calling around getting quotes on the price of Timber

930
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:21,087
In order to burn diseased animals that is true

931
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,695
How to supporting this has been sneaky and cryptically telling Farmers to prepare Pires

932
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:26,975
That's about the level of act

933
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,743
Chrissy you should

934
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:31,583
Yeah kind of close to something

935
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,375
But according to the guardian

936
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:38,239
Stratfordshire Animal Health office part of the Ministry of Agriculture

937
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,543
Ring around merchants in the autumn

938
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,079
A quotes for timber for tires

939
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,895
As part of an animal contingency plan on how to deal

940
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,175
With swine fever

941
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,199
Hand foot mouth outbreak

942
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,247
This is a requirement of all

943
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,015
EU countries

944
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,551
It happens every year

945
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,855
It's not something that's suspicious at all but Alex

946
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:54,879
Who's built it into

947
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,903
Trey foot in mouth

948
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,231
Was intentionally released from a level 4 bioweapons lab

949
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,255
In order

950
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,023
R2

951
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:01,791
Subway

952
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,095
Story that's

953
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:06,911
It's more about how England was like

954
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,215
Remember when we threw dead bodies

955
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:09,983
Tams

956
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,287
And then there was disease

957
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,335
We don't do that

958
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,895
It was a smart move on our part

959
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:19,967
So another

960
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:20,991
To the the present

961
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:21,759
To the Past

962
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,039
Comes in this next clip

963
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,063
Just stylistic

964
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:34,047
All 100

965
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:41,727
Flowers

966
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:42,751
Let's just ask

967
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,055
Wow

968
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,079
About to get to it

969
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:49,407
If if you say that there should be a ticker

970
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,687
That appears

971
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,455
Like this by

972
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:56,319
Majic 102

973
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,087
Pierce

974
00:48:57,343 --> 00:49:01,183
Everyday the show ends at 98

975
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,999
My Wish

976
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,791
My genes which is just like

977
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:09,119
Nothing I don't want money I don't want happiness I want

978
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,399
Purely just

979
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,423
If you make

980
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,471
Claim like I'm going to do 100 things

981
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,519
A ticker a b n

982
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,287
Yeah

983
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:20,639
Calls from a conversation

984
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,431
Drift into talking about

985
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,711
The government

986
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,479
Tracking

987
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,271
Children's cell phone

988
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:29,343
Buy cell phone

989
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,111
Excuse that it's

990
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:30,879
To protect the kid

991
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:31,903
Right

992
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,951
It says something weird

993
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:56,991
That's interesting to me because that's a right on the line

994
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,623
A minority

995
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,391
That

996
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:09,791
That's the kind of thing that if you were really uncharitable and ungenerous be like okay so what mine

997
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:13,631
Normandy group so you talking about is that code

998
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,423
But it's

999
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,447
Yeah it's also a

1000
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,471
If you are

1001
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:23,359
Charitable groups that are

1002
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,127
Euro it's

1003
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:30,527
It's right there on the line for you to be like oh see how they do that they say it's for the chew

1004
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,319
Children and then the next breath is

1005
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:38,463
Seems like I only care about the millions of aborted babies it's about the aborted babies inside about

1006
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:41,279
Controlling women's actions at all sure

1007
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,607
Financial advice

1008
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:49,727
To give I will save

1009
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,519
Solid Financial advice

1010
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,543
Ethical component

1011
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:56,895
If they took

1012
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:13,535
Motorola

1013
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,471
It's

1014
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:27,359
2300

1015
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:31,711
2003

1016
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:33,503
You make a baby

1017
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,271
Maybe a good

1018
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:35,807
More than 50%

1019
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:45,535
You want to get out of it is apparently IBM owns the Chinese military

1020
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:18,047
Implant Ator and the implant

1021
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,071
Sure.

1022
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,607
And everybody

1023
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,631
Picture Show

1024
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:24,191
What is the Chinese government

1025
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,215
Ex-military

1026
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:25,983
Daddy's

1027
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:32,383
An interesting way to diversify your

1028
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:34,431
Okay well we did pretty good with that that almost

1029
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:40,831
Suggest that the computer thing was just a way for them to make enough money as military

1030
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:44,415
Questions that I want answers to like it has it been sold

1031
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:48,255
Baby I'm still on the Chinese military

1032
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:51,071
What does the Chinese government

1033
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,863
About military

1034
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,679
To check with IBS

1035
00:52:55,935 --> 00:53:00,287
Play Space companies

1036
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:07,455
What apps have a solid business plan so they were like well we might as well buy a military while we've got the

1037
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,759
Yeah

1038
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,415
15 hours a day

1039
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,975
You doing articles you put out

1040
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:20,511
Normal

1041
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:27,423
I can't imagine reading for

1042
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:28,959
The number of hours

1043
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:31,519
About things that I would suggest

1044
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,055
Realizing

1045
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,591
Call disguises

1046
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,359
Bulshit

1047
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:39,455
Terrible

1048
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,319
Yeah or something

1049
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:46,111
Research

1050
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:50,975
You would learn about how much b******* it is by ozmosis just by repetition

1051
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:52,511
Just like

1052
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:55,327
I've heard this before I've heard this before I've heard this

1053
00:53:55,839 --> 00:54:01,727
Play this doesn't say what Alex

1054
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,799
I think it is

1055
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,079
Indicative of a lot of

1056
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:09,407
His listeners and how a lot of people who get into this world

1057
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,687
Their experience of it

1058
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:13,759
Compulsive

1059
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:14,783
Compulsive relationship

1060
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:15,551
Ship with this

1061
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:21,951
Disinformation 15 hours a day cuz your normal bill

1062
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,487
People react

1063
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,535
To the things that I say

1064
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,327
So I went to this point

1065
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,607
To make a programming note

1066
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,679
Kind of review

1067
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,471
In as much as

1068
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,007
2000

1069
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,543
Tragedies

1070
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,567
Traffic

1071
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,967
There's a terror event

1072
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:52,415
Radio

1073
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,615
Little defensive

1074
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,175
I take it this is interesting

1075
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,967
This point he does understand

1076
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,039
That Dynamic of like tragedies

1077
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,575
Lead to more people

1078
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,111
View and machete

1079
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:24,415
You should have learned from 9/11

1080
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:26,975
You should know that by now pretty well

1081
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,791
I question whether you understand

1082
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:31,071
At this point fully

1083
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,375
Obsessing about the

1084
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:39,775
Immediacy of another tragedy happening soon will also speak his words that pretty

1085
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,055
Quickly

1086
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:41,823
Don't feel like it at the

1087
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,615
Feels like a radio show

1088
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:47,199
This guy sent me down

1089
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:49,247
Nutso rabbit hole

1090
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:50,783
Insane

1091
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:53,855
Wondering if song

1092
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,463
Signatures

1093
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:21,503
Redecoration

1094
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:27,903
2003's and

1095
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:29,695
Interesting time for followers of

1096
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,975
Conspiracy culture in

1097
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:32,255
The community surrounding

1098
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:37,887
In the present-day extremely far-right Tendencies of almost entirely absorbed that space

1099
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,679
It wasn't

1100
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:45,055
Probably agree with some of this caller suggested new grievances

1101
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,591
Post about the government

1102
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:48,127
Okay

1103
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:48,895
Machine exist

1104
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:51,967
I was able to find this caller is re Declaration of Independence

1105
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:57,087
And perhaps unsurprisingly I did in fact find some common ground with this guy

1106
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:58,111
Princeton

1107
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,391
First complaint

1108
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:04,511
We demand the abolishment of engaging our military and unconstitutional activities

1109
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:08,607
Spreading them out as the police of the world while even protect

1110
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:11,167
I might have left out the part at the end about the

1111
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:14,495
Boarders Inn on Constitution

1112
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,263
Military

1113
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,567
But leaving that aside we agree the government

1114
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:19,359
Got to stop this war stuff true

1115
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,663
A little bit later we find even more agreement

1116
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:25,759
Quote we demand the abolishment of all instances of murdering citizen

1117
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,295
Completely within their rights and

1118
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,575
Destroying

1119
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,343
To disclose

1120
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,111
Anthony's crime

1121
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:33,439
I would even expand that language to include non-citizen

1122
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:39,839
Remember that that's where those people were at

1123
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:41,631
Now they're at Blue lives matter

1124
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:44,191
You know you don't know what those guys up to

1125
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:48,543
Immediately

1126
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,615
Complaints about you entreaties and calling for abolishing quotes

1127
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:54,175
The post office public education and a

1128
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:57,247
Play a little bit

1129
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,015
This document

1130
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:00,575
Completely goes off the rails with words like treason

1131
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,879
Starting to pop up in all capital letters

1132
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,415
Hair that's where we get it

1133
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:06,207
The trouble with you all caps a word

1134
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,743
You are yeah

1135
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:11,839
Part of the Declaration of Independence is charging any individual Lorinda

1136
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,887
Industry that traded with North Vietnam

1137
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:16,959
China Russia Iraq or any of their satellite countries

1138
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:17,983
With treason

1139
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,519
This extends to literally

1140
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:21,823
Everyone who works in things like steel or

1141
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,175
Petroleum Industries but also to everyone who's been an elected office in Congress

1142
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:30,015
Executive branch over the Supreme Court to the Korean War

1143
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:32,575
Yeah you might as well just rewrite that

1144
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:37,183
To say we got to clean house and get rid of all these guys him past let's

1145
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:37,951
Yeah let's

1146
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:38,975
Beginning at

1147
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:41,535
The sixteenth century and we'll start over

1148
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:47,167
Document demands quote all who served in these political positions during any of the times of armed conflict

1149
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:49,471
Question from the Korean War to this date

1150
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:52,799
Compensation

1151
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,079
I'm guessing that's in addition to

1152
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:56,383
What about people who supported

1153
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,663
The Civil War

1154
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,199
The South

1155
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:02,783
Treason charges

1156
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,855
4th Federal Reserve

1157
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,647
The biggest businesses

1158
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,463
Ancillary astralis

1159
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:12,767
Humor this collar

1160
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:17,887
I'm certain that Alex didn't read it but honestly it's so much funnier to imagine that he had

1161
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:20,447
And was still giving the sky glowing review

1162
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:23,519
Here's how the new Declaration of Independence

1163
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,543
Ends with a C

1164
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,591
They should do next

1165
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:30,175
We hereby petition for a renewal of government

1166
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:33,503
Removed entirely from Washington DC and reconstituted

1167
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:35,039
In another region Alliance

1168
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:37,343
And at least temporarily at first during the

1169
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,367
Beginning this

1170
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:42,207
New government for and of the people be redeveloped

1171
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:47,327
From Austin Texas the birthplace of the new people's house with an initial mailing address of

1172
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,375
Believe I'll just leave it out

1173
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,167
A new government will be birthed

1174
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:55,775
For the Free World mischley and temporarily by the following Patriots of this new age

1175
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,823
Alex

Ono Ono top of the list

1177
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,247
Alex Jones

1178
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:08,319
Eric rainbow Mike Hansen

1179
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,087
Chris f

1180
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:09,855
Autonomous

1181
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:12,159
Kevin Smith and Robert

1182
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:15,999
In order to retain our original forefathers Declaration of our God

1183
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:20,607
Add framework for the lasting legitimate Republic promoting Global Freedom under God's laws

1184
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:22,655
Not a select group of men's

1185
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,703
And a complete dismantling

1186
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,727
The Tyranny hereafter

1187
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,263
Well this wasn't that much

1188
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:31,359
Farther after Mallrats Rothrock Evans

1189
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:33,919
What is the Papua Stephen Kevin Smith

1190
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:39,807
This guy wants to overthrow the government reconstituted in Austin have Alex until of Alex's friends

1191
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:42,367
Temporarily this new Blossom and government

1192
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,159
Yeah

1193
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,695
In case you don't know those

1194
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:48,255
Mike Hansen was Alex's longtime cameraman

1195
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,023
Producer

1196
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,815
Kevin Smith

1197
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:57,471
And George Humphrey and Bob Desi were regular Infowars guest

1198
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:59,263
Infowars

1199
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:01,311
Chris atanas I don't know who that is

1200
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,359
Rainbow

1201
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,639
Is that

1202
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,663
And I realized

1203
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:07,711
This caller

1204
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:13,343
Well you're not going to not insert yourself into the pub

1205
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:16,415
If you Google the address that he listed

1206
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:19,999
The temporary address of the new government of America

1207
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:22,559
Ivey publishing address for a 2000

1208
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:23,839
15 book titled

1209
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:25,119
The free Masonic Ark

1210
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:25,887
Architecture of hist

1211
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:29,215
Self-published by Eric rainbow

1212
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,311
If it's it's definitely the address of

1213
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,591
The publishing of his book that was

1214
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:37,151
Written and self-published by Eric

1215
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:39,455
He was also the proprietor of 911

1216
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,479
Exposed.com

1217
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:44,575
The real mystery here though is that the name of the person listed as the owner of that house.

1218
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,343
Match

1219
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,111
With Eric rainbow

1220
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:50,207
I felt like I was at a dead end my curiosity was itching too strongly

1221
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:52,767
What's this color of the person who wrote the new Declaration of

1222
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,815
Government

1223
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:57,887
In Austin

1224
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:03,775
It's really complicated but I looked into the phone numbers and addresses listed for the publishing Endeavor and I

1225
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:07,615
Pretty certain that it was this dude it was actually written under Eric

1226
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,151
It's underwater

1227
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,431
I found the

1228
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:12,735
The phone number that's associated with

1229
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:17,343
It's someone else's phone number but also at the house phones Associated someone name

1230
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,879
James rainbolt

1231
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:22,719
But Eric rainbow is probably living

1232
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:24,511
I don't know maybe

1233
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:27,327
Eric rainbolt has written a couple of other books

1234
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:31,167
Under the name Eric James RuPaul

1235
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,263
Stupid

1236
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:38,335
Long road for me to wander down to the reason I still think it's important

1237
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,359
Because there's some

1238
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:40,895
Critical thinking

1239
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:43,711
Stop at me and this guy would totally agree about

1240
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,759
We both want to end the Iraq War

1241
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,807
We both want greater oversight on police

1242
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:51,391
Pretty crucial to recognize that despite our differences we are

1243
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,927
Close to allies

1244
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:53,695
Ever B

1245
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:58,047
Ultimately I want to create a world that operates better and more fairly for everyone

1246
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,583
Ultimately this guy wants

1247
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,631
To be on Alex Jones a small count

1248
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:02,399
Yeah

1249
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,679
Also this guy ended

1250
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:05,471
What's 75 signatures on his

1251
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,495
Petition datapoint

1252
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:08,031
The last screenshot on the way back

1253
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:12,383
Michigan available the state was from July

1254
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:17,759
Furniture exposure

1255
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:22,879
What the f***

1256
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,415
The guy who wrote this

1257
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:27,231
Enemy of my enemy is

1258
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:31,071
Is not my friend if they also want to establish a

1259
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,631
Roland Style

1260
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:36,703
I'm the hand of the king for Alex Jones

1261
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:42,591
Situation Bizarro religious experience libertarian nonsense

1262
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:43,615
Some of his guests

1263
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:46,175
Rule the roost

1264
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:50,271
I don't think so I will choose

1265
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,575
Other people to work on that if you

1266
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:53,599
Yeah

1267
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,623
Anyway

1268
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:56,415
This was kind of what

1269
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:58,719
I'm sure that this guy

1270
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:05,375
That was the beginning of a call

1271
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:09,983
Alex gets another

1272
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,287
And it's kind of interesting

1273
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:14,591
This this fella has a plan

1274
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:17,151
For dealing with some of the

1275
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,175
Daddy doesn't like

1276
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:19,455
Books like

1277
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:20,479
Hannity

1278
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:21,503
These folks

1279
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:22,271
Who are not

1280
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,039
Conservative

1281
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,367
Barf

1282
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:50,175
Broadcast individual this weekend

1283
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,455
Case in point

1284
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:06,303
The real makeup

1285
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:22,943
Michael Savage is a beatnik

1286
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:25,247
All right here's what we do guys

1287
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:30,623
We got a blackmail Hannity and Michael Savage child record

1288
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:32,415
Interesting

1289
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,439
Do you think that's a

1290
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,719
Potent way to attack

1291
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:39,583
These figures on the right that you don't like and apparently aren't on the right

1292
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,631
I found out public records

1293
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,911
That Sean Hannity got it

1294
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,959
His civics class

1295
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:50,079
Is that the type of person on the radio Dash is over for him

1296

Google cancel culture

1299

It's really weird to hear this kind of Ploy being

1300

Suggested by this caller

1301
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:06,719
And then also

1302
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:09,791
The political framing is so important

1303
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:11,071
Like we have

1304
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,351
George Bush

1305
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:16,959

1311
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:26,687
What

1312
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:32,063
So like they're not even moderate or maybe they're supposed to be like tomorrow

1313
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:34,111
He knows if you will Dad that was a

1314

3 and ever and Always Forever

1317
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:40,767
But it makes it okay for whatever really really

1318
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,815
Thank you what

1319
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:48,447
Sorry I don't know this is just actually normal conservative right all right

1320
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,471
Maybe

1321
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,007
Sovereign citizen

1322
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:53,055
Is even just normal conservative

1323
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:01,919
Your honor objection

1326
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:09,855
This isn't true what Elsie saying isn't true

1327
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:17,279
They arrested me simply because I refuse to go down the road without a driver's license

1328
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:19,071
Is an interesting way of putting

1329
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:22,399
I've been driving without a driver's license and I don't give a

1330
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:29,823
Sounds right

1331
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:32,127
It's weird

1332
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:34,431
The Bedrock

1333
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,479

I forgot so much.

1340
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:59,263
Obviously we heard he doesn't like

1341
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:01,567
You think that Michael Savage is a commie

1342
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:04,383
Coincidentally more important figures

1343
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:06,943
What do you think he thinks about

1344
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:09,247
Fox Fox News

1345
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:11,039
That they are just a left

1346
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:12,063
An outlet

1347
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:15,903
Giving out propaganda for an Obama that hasn't even been elect

1348
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:16,671
Headed to the Senate

1349
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,463
Do you think that they are

1350
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,231
Savage

1351
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:24,095
Mirena Army that's on the ground today know what's going on today

1352
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:24,863
Don't know

1353
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:47,647
Ultra call me channel Fox News we're cutting all your benefits right now is not a thing that is acceptable for a

1354
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,439
To say in a negative way

1355
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,975
And you should be like

1356
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:56,351
Yeah they're cutting all your benefits cuz you don't deserve them you lazy pieces of s***

1357
01:09:57,375 --> 01:10:00,447
Quit the show I got to leave I got to leave

1358
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:03,263
Ultra, foxnews.com

1359
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,031

1360
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:05,311
Call boy

1361
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:08,127
It wasn't quite what I expected I mean it's it's

1362
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:09,407
It's a lie

1363
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,175
Toosii

1364
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:18,367
I think I'm going to have like some really subtle things to Triangle

1365
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,647
Sit through

1366
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:20,927
Instead it's just like

1367
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:25,535
Michael Savage

1368
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,583
This is great

1369
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:28,863
Cat

1370
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:29,887
That's so

1371
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:31,679
Cuz we've talked about this for

1372
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:32,703
Years of like

1373
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:35,775
If you just abandon Trump you

1374
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,079
Space

1375
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:38,847
Of like

1376
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:41,919
I don't trust Fox News they're a bunch of liberal,

1377
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:46,783
B******* you know like it's so easy you could just

1378
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:52,159
Giving a speech on CNN and their whining about some nonsense

1379
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:54,719
5 year old who's got a problem

1380
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,743
The proof of the pudding

1381
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:56,511
Is in the eating

1382
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:58,047
As it were

1383
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:00,863
He wasn't his career in 2003

1384
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,399
And look where he is now

1385
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,191
Like obviously

1386
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,471
Signing up with Trump

1387
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:06,751
Massively

1388
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,543
Exposed him that's gotten him

1389
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:10,847
A far greater space in the public

1390
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,383
Sure

1391
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,151
Sphere

1392
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:15,199
He's made it's made him relevant

1393
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:16,735
People

1394
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,015
Like at least

1395
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,551
Jokingly make

1396
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:20,575
His name friend

1397
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,855
True true

1398
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,135
Back then 2000

1399
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,415
He had like

1400
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:27,231
Position of defiance against the right at the last ride

1401
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:27,999
Pikachu

1402
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:30,559
Pretend it was because he's above the divided butts release

1403
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:31,839
Extremely far to the right

1404
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:38,239
That's true

1405
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,263
You're not wrong

1406
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:41,311
Although I bet buddy

1407
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,079
You know

1408
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:45,151
I was I'm still of the opinion of like carving out that

1409
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:49,247
Comfortable space is so much better than being like

1410
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:53,343
Well if I hitch my wagon to Trump strained I can become world-famous yes

1411
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:58,975
Better if he had

1412
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:03,071
He lusts for the sun sets tropaz

1413
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:04,863
And maybe that's just

1414
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:08,703
He could never do that whatever it is

1415
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:12,543
Yeah it is it is one of those situations where were they

1416
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,335
The actions in context

1417
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:16,639
Completely different I would be like man

1418
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:20,479
I got to give it up to you for a seeing an opportunity and shooting your shot

1419
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:23,295
Has not worked out for you

1420
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:26,111
But within the context and his actions

1421
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:28,671
He's an idiot and I hate him forever

1422
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:30,719
And I want to throw baseballs

1423
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:32,767
I don't know if you know this but 2000

1424
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:35,583
In addition to seeing the end of the Iraq War

1425
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:39,167
We also

1426
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:46,335
Covid-19 Coronavirus

1427
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:47,615
Sequel

1428
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:49,919
To what's going on in 2000

1429
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:53,503
Let's see how it looks see how we handled it if

1430
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:58,879
Maybe the real

1431
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:51,871
Power

1432
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:56,991
So weird to see how the past Echoes with the

1433
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:57,759
The present

1434
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:04,159
But you can get back in 2003

1435
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:05,951
Actually make about the novel Coronavirus

1436
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:09,535
Almost like the actual facts in front of him don't matter

1437
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:11,327
Add a particular details of a story

1438
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:15,167
Decorations on top of his existing reality

1439
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:19,263
It was a big deal it was real and it was not a power grab

1440
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:24,127
At this point scientists have been able to concretely isolate the SARS virus

1441
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:28,223
On March 22nd 2003

1442
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:31,551
At this point when I was making the episode it's only been a few weeks

1443
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,135
Ization

1444
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,671
Situation is very much

1445
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,999
The International Community jumped into action

1446
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:42,047
Quickly identified the virus

1447
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:43,327
And cautionary steps were taken

1448
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:44,351
Bedspread

1449
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:46,911
Because of collaborative action and probably some

1450
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:47,679
Because the right wing

1451
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,447
Conspiracy

1452
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:54,847
Manhattan grown to the size that hasn't a present only 774 people in the world ended up dying during the outbreak

1453
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:55,615
Between November

1454
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:56,639
Thousand

1455
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:58,175
In July 2000

1456
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:02,527
The Toronto Star article Alex is referencing his

1457
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:06,111
Bet anything it was an editorial article presented the

1458
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:08,159
Response to SARS has

1459
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:08,927
Hysterical

1460
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:11,231
We can't find some people still

1461
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:13,279
Existing

1462
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:15,327
Websites that Express website

1463
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:20,447
It's hard to say if people are overreacting but the greater Toronto area saw before

1464
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:22,239
First outbreak of SARS cases in the world

1465
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,799
Behind China Hong Kong and Taiwan

1466
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:27,103
Really does kind of make sense

1467
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:29,151
What's the matter there would be taken seriously

1468
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:31,199
In a way that might look like a serie

1469
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:34,015
But if you didn't act that way who knows what the

1470
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:35,295
End result would have been

1471
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:36,319
You know I've always

1472
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,087
Who is Ben

1473
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:38,623
Bootleg especially week

1474
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:40,671
Obviously not when you thinking about it but

1475
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:42,463
It always

1476
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:43,999
Kind of like

1477
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:44,767
Messed me up

1478
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,559
People say off

1479
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:48,351
Hysterically to this virus

1480
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,887
And it feels like

1481
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:51,935
The entire human race should be

1482
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:58,335
Be so hysterical about viruses and bacteria conspiring

1483
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,615
Killed almost

1484
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:03,967
You don't like it we talk about I'm so scared of war and all that s***

1485
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:06,271
All the people who have ever lived

1486
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:09,343
Most of them have died because of some disease or another

1487
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:12,927
And I think it's not like we should all be

1488
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:18,815
The conversational times when we're not

1489
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:19,839
Dealing with outbreaks

1490
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:20,607
Infections

1491
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:22,911
Stop people in medical community

1492
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:23,679
Talk about

1493
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:26,751
The unknown unknown exact about

1494
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:28,031
Conversation

1495
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,567
Disease ex or whatever

1496
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:30,591
This thing

1497
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:32,383
We don't know about that we may ask

1498
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,151
To deal with

1499
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:36,991
Really a terrifying Prospect cuz you have to figure out how it spread

1500
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:39,039
What is characteristics are

1501
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:40,831
And while you're figuring that out its

1502
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:41,599
Spreading

1503
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:42,879
Could be spreading

1504
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,511
Thick almost

1505
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:52,607
Become more rational

1506
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:56,447
The more you think about it some people that I knew

1507
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:58,239
We're going through some

1508
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,287
Steps that

1509
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:02,335
I would say we're maybe a little bit

1510
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:04,639
Further than I would even at the beginning

1511
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,687
No dealing with these shorts

1512
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:07,455
The 2020

1513
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,735
Situation

1514
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,951
I'd rather do this

1515
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,999
And look stupid later

1516
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,279
Then not do it

1517
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,303
And look

1518
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,583
Feel like I do I

1519
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,399
Taking preventive measures

1520
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:29,727
Compelling argument I felt stupid after

1521
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:33,823
Part of it is just the the

1522
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:34,591
The very fact

1523
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:36,127
It's so many f***

1524
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:36,895
People don't

1525
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:38,175
Don't not just

1526
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:39,455
Not understand evolution

1527
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:40,991
Believe it entirely

1528
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:42,015
It's just like

1529
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:45,599
You realize that if a virus spreads

1530
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:47,391
It's going to reproduce

1531
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:50,975
Billions of times in a very short period of

1532
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:51,999
What time

1533
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:55,583
Exponentially increases the possibility of mutation

1534
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,887
And adaptation to

1535
01:17:58,143 --> 01:17:59,679
Measures against it

1536
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:03,263
It is not it is a constant battle it is not

1537
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:05,055
Like even now if we defeat

1538
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:10,943
Did you go to the extent that we would all love it if we don't

1539
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:12,479
Completely eradicated

1540
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:14,271
It is going to mutate any

1541
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:15,295
Can come back

1542
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:17,087
Anytime you don't like

1543
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:19,391
It's it's a real terrifying reality

1544
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:21,695
And most people are like at probably witches

1545
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,231
We are

1546
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,791
Which is it works

1547
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:27,583
For the um totally

1548
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:29,887
Always

1549
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:30,655
Always

1550
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:32,703
You know

1551
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:33,471
I don't know

1552
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,519
I guess it's Trump was president

1553
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:38,079
Conspiracy community

1554
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:39,615
Just that the way it does now

1555
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,895
In 2003

1556
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:41,919
Sorry

1557
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:43,455
Much bigger problem

1558
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:45,247
Well I mean you think about

1559
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:51,647
Think about you think about so many of you know like you think about Ebola outbreaks you sent you think about those things that happened in

1560
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:52,671
In the past that

1561
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:55,231
In retrospect you realize we're handle

1562
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:58,559
Fire by people who understood and

1563
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:00,607
You were serious about the problem

1564
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:01,631
Instead of a

1565
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:06,239
Actively exacerbating it and the people who are causing problems

1566
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:07,775
Silverspot

1567
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:13,407
Hey you know Alex at this point

1568
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:14,431
It's getting towards

1569
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,199
Zeno's

1570
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,223
End of the show

1571
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:18,271
We're getting deep into it

1572
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:19,551
Still hasn't come

1573
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:23,903
Howmanyofme

1574
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:44,127
911

1575
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:06,143
There's no pills to sell supplies

1576
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,423
Looking for exposure

1577
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,703
If you get three of them

1578
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:09,727
Horoscopes

1579
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:11,263
Emeryville

1580
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:15,104
What about shipping is shipping still expensive at the time I don't remember

1581
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,384
Probably probably

1582
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,432
Probably

1583
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:23,296
From from

1584
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,576
Commercial

1585
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:25,344
Make Me Wanna

1586
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,112
4 something

1587
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:35,072
Alarm

1588
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:02,464
New World Order

1589
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:20,128
Horrible

1590
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:23,968
Anyone who listens to our show with any regularity as heard that

1591
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:29,088
Pretty frequently when he gets in a wistful contemplatively

1592
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:30,112
Yesterday he was

1593
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:35,488
Computers but today all the pieces of Come Together release more certain than ever that is a mouse's been right all along

1594
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:37,024
And it's worse than you thought

1595
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:42,400
That's an interesting experience

1596
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:44,448
Episode

1597
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:45,984
From 18 years ago and see him

1598
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:49,824
Pretending to have the same Epiphany that he does regularly

1599
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,104
It's a little annoying

1600
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:53,408
Also another reason I pulled this clip

1601
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:55,968
Is because Alex makes a reference to God and to demon

1602
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:57,248
But

1603
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:59,552
I think you can tell how much different that feels

1604
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:02,368
And speak to the present

1605
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,648
My ears

1606
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:04,928
Listening to this

1607
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:06,976
It kind of comes off like a man was a religious

1608
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:09,024
Just inclinations but isn't azella

1609
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:11,584
It feels like a person calling his enemies demons as a

1610
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,864
The pejorative insult

1611
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:15,680
Not as the description that meant to be taken literally

1612
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:20,544
It's weird to think about but maybe Alex meant it to be heard as literal all along

1613
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,360
If he were just giving him an unasked for benefit of the doubt

1614
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:25,408
There's no way he could fix

1615
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:27,968
Demons were real and they were just

1616
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,272
Crazy

1617
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:31,808
So we'll assume that

1618
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:34,880
He's beating a metaphorical in this sense

1619
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:37,696
I don't think that's the case but it's fun to think of

1620
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:40,000
Exit possibility

1621
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,792
You've been pretty upfront about it

1622
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:46,656
I hate time travel episode sometimes I love

1623
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:50,752
You are you're like a mr. Peabody who refuses to let

1624
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:54,336
Me get into the time machine you just make me watch a movie of the

1625
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,360
The path City alike

1626
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:58,688
Oh yeah if we use this time machine we could fix it all but

1627
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:00,992
PW

1628
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:05,344
Four interesting cartoon

1629
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,368
So

1630
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:08,416
Another call and

1631
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:12,768
Back in 2003

1632
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:15,072
You know I have a lot of friends that are make

1633
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:16,864
I don't have

1634
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:19,936
Friend

1635
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:24,544
The first place

1636
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:31,200
Driver's license cuz they do not load

1637
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,992
They're there for

1638
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,064
To work

1639
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:37,856
Because they do work

1640
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:05,760
Okay

1641
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:06,784
What you doing

1642
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:07,808
That's for sure

1643
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,112
Exact same response that caller

1644
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:15,232
You know what you're doing Alex

1645
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:19,072
This is the same show we're just an hour ago we were told

1646
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:20,864
You do not need a driver's license

1647
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:21,888
Fright with a caller

1648
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:26,240
Between who

1649
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,264
Did not have a driver

1650
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,568
Marriage license in Hoover

1651
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:32,640
We have Alex

1652
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:35,200
I was talking about that like if your uncharitable

1653
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:36,224
You could hear him saying

1654
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,504
The minority

1655
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:41,856
Minorities

1656
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:47,232
Rope in his mind is like criminals are a minority of the population

1657
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:48,000
About

1658
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:49,024
This is not

1659
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,072
The same thing

1660
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:52,864
Yeah

1661
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,424
You guys are talking about undocumented immigrant

1662
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:59,264
Proper channels are people who overstayed Visa

1663
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:03,104
They're just talking about the blanket category of people who are immigrants

1664
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,128
And this conversation

1665
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:06,688
Is outrageously white nationalist

1666
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:09,504
Puzzling over

1667
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:10,528
Driver's

1668
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:11,808
Santa's which is a bit silly

1669
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,088
Alex

1670
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:19,488
Mario bosses instructed to take quotes

1671
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:21,280
Our rights away you got it

1672
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:28,192
Comically transparent here in this walks hand-in-hand with a white nationalist ideas but the great replacement

1673
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:29,984
Stick it through sometime

1674
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:34,080
This is the way that conversation was had back then it's basically indistinguishable

1675
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:34,848
Beaufort

1676
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:36,384
Supremacist positions on immigration

1677
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:39,968
I just see you like a six-year-old Harris

1678
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:43,040
Smithfield and I would be worse than that someday

1679
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:45,600
I want to be more explicit about it

1680
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:52,000
Exactly what I know he is saying I want to take this game and push it a little farther

1681
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:52,768
Further to the race

1682
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:53,792
So bored

1683
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:55,072
So Alex

1684
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:58,400
Kansas big pointed keeps make

1685
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:00,704
He can go on any show

1686
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:05,568
Conservative

1687
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:07,616
There's a board Today Show

1688
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:09,920
Conservative liberal normal whatever

1689
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:10,944
In the middle Center who give

1690
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,504
Give the s***

1691
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,040
Recalls

1692
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:16,832
Of course they all agree with

1693
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:21,440
He's so ideologically consistent and because everyone knows that bush did 9/11

1694
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,464
True

1695
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:26,048
If he gets here and role-playing a little bit as some collars

1696
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:27,584
He's fantasizing about

1697
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,144
Talking to on these radio show

1698
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,800
Call

1699
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,568
Haha

1700
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:06,656
Well

1701
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:09,728
In the shower

1702
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:10,752
Is kind of feeling like

1703
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:14,592
The present is imaginary.

1704
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:17,408
Narrative Arc of these callers

1705
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:18,432
Disgust

1706
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:21,504
It's very

1707
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:27,136
Normal

1708
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:29,696
For decades as dumb people he has to talk to

1709
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:33,024
These people uses caricatures of straw man argument

1710
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,584
That's presented things that are complaints about Alex

1711
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:37,888
Use of these imaginary dumb callers

1712
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:40,448
Puppets to introduce these ideas

1713
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:43,520
Because discredit those ideas

1714
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:44,800
Like that use erase

1715
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:45,568
Yeah

1716
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:50,944
You can hear Alex essentially laying out that him arguing that the Republican party is corrupt

1717
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,480
Is a way to get liberals

1718
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:54,016
Who can admit the Democrats are corrupt

1719
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:54,784
To wake up

1720
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,856
Yeah if you lie about he being hypocritical

1721
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:58,880
Bill wake up

1722
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:01,184
And they won't know you're lying because

1723
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,232
You're not a malicious figure yet

1724
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:04,512
This is a strategy

1725
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:07,072
And it's meant to make Alex look closer to the middle

1726
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:09,376
This hypothetical democratic

1727
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,424
The ideas for him

1728
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:16,288
Picture where humans liberal have more in common than they think they only don't think so

1729
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:19,872
Corrupt political parties

1730
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:21,152
Books similar

1731
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:22,432
This is not true

1732
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:24,480
How to light years to the right of

1733
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:25,248
Give the GOP

1734
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:30,624
So what is actually doing is trying to pull disaffected people of either party towards the extreme right

1735
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:33,440
For people already in the Republican party this could be

1736
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:34,208
Mean becoming

1737
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:35,488
And extremely right

1738
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,792
For Democrats this might mean becoming a

1739
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:43,424
Dated political nihilist maybe a brace in the GOP just not voting for democratic

1740
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:44,960
Ultimately

1741
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:48,800
The political end result of the project Alex's engaging in is best

1742
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:52,128
It's always about dragging people to the right well

1743
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:53,920
Pretending there is no right or left

1744
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:59,040
Which serves the political interests of whichever viable political entity is farthest to the right

1745
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:00,576
Yeah that's

1746
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:02,880
Hiam abbass

1747
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:04,416
Divide an

1748
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:06,208
They want to do all these

1749
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:11,584
Taxes and things and I just want to drink blood from the skulls of my enemies

1750
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:16,704
What what doesn't everybody get about that wake up people of a buffalo

1751
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:22,848
Truly opposed to the left-right divide or whatever

1752
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:23,872
And someone was like

1753
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:27,456
Does suck

1754
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:28,992
I'm going to start exploring

1755
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,576
You should be just as into that

1756
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:36,160
I mean

1757
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:40,000
The Socialist state

1758
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:46,400
Present

1759
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:47,680
2003

1760
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:54,848
To write I haven't heard him bring a break and all this episode

1761
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:58,944
He doesn't like anybody from what

1762
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:02,016
Everybody that is like you look like

1763
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:06,112
Gross conservative or communist

1764
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:06,880
Which

1765
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:08,160
I can but I can you can

1766
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,440
Totally see

1767
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:10,720
That kind of

1768
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:14,560
Being attractive especially at that time whenever you look at the

1769
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:17,120
Fact that both political parties are like

1770
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:18,400
Warriors Gray

1771
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,424
And let's do it

1772
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:20,192
All the time

1773
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:22,496
And you're like a wolf

1774
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:26,592
F****** point I'm having either of these political parties if we're just going to wind up

1775
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:28,640
With a mission accomplished Banner

1776
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:32,992
Something like Alex's superpower

1777
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:33,760
Background

1778
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:36,064
A lot of people who are right

1779
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:36,832
Exact place

1780
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:38,368
That they need to be too

1781
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:39,136
Hiramasa

1782
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:39,904
Did you like that

1783
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:42,720
And get sent down a road they don't know they're going

1784
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:45,792
Yeah I would say it's hard to argue that

1785
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:48,096
You know

1786
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:52,704
Osama Bin Laden didn't destroy an entire country by himself

1787
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:54,752
What's a patriot

1788
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:57,312
A little baby

1789
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:58,848
Traits of course but

1790
01:31:59,104 --> 01:32:00,128
It's a little bit like

1791
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:02,688
9/11 really did

1792
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:04,224
Tiffany Tamara

1793
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:07,808
Instastalker

1794
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:10,880
This is where we're going to

1795
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:18,048
Picking Intuit 2003 stop definitely

1796
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:21,376
Definitely be more of a topic

1797
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:24,960
Today

1798
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:25,728
Because

1799
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:26,496
Alex

1800
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:29,568
Please call her that he gets on radio station

1801
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:32,384
He ends up talking about being on a show

1802
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,408
UK right

1803
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:34,944
And this is your call

1804
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:37,760
Jail guard

1805
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:40,576
This is evident

1806
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:42,880
Show used to be a family show

1807
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:56,096
Family Show

1808
01:33:56,352 --> 01:34:01,984
FCC rules

1809
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:05,568
I would say

1810
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:06,848
Radio interview

1811
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:08,384
But I guess

1812
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:11,456
Either this collars

1813
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,552
For this didn't happen

1814
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:18,624
It's so interesting about Alex ghost

1815
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:22,464
Five minutes talking about how you knew this guy was a jail guard

1816
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:24,000
Stone

1817
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:27,072
I get you locked up I want you to lock up

1818
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:30,144
People only have like really want to do it

1819
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:33,216
I heard this guy either

1820
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:33,984
Either

1821
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:39,616
Was a Serial kidnapper right or jail.

1822
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:42,176
Smart kidnappers just become jail guard cuz

1823
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:48,576
They can do all that stuff and it's legal that sounds right I'm fixing to him since this is how I read this guy

1824
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:56,768
Right they just haven't found the right kidnappings.

1825
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,840
It's a little annoying

1826
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:01,632
Kind of trivial lefun

1827
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:09,056
It's such an annoying habit of so many people to tell you a story where somebody is

1828
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:10,336
So

1829
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:12,384
Over-the-top unreasonably

1830
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,432
That it's impossible to believe

1831
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:15,456
And you know

1832
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,784
Before he even started he was full of s***

1833
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,112
Calls

1834
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:25,696
Unfortunately it's a terrible story

1835
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:27,488
I'm calling you today

1836
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:29,536
Because my local FM

1837
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:38,752
Even exist

1838
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:43,616
Television

1839
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:49,248
But you know

1840
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,600
This is like

1841
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:54,624
My favorite

1842
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:55,904
Thing I love

1843
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,184
Going back to this time

1844
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:57,952
The past

1845
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:59,488
And the colors are fuc

1846
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:01,536
Can callers they're not like

1847
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:07,936
Sycophant nonsense I love your brain Force now

1848
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:15,104
I'm not allowed there anymore because I refuse to discuss anything but

1849
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,640
50 year old news

1850
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:20,992
I love that

1851
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:23,296
That's a Vibe I could listen to

1852
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:24,064
Like

1853
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,368
I could bust that forever

1854
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:31,232
I'm not allowed on C-Span anymore because I won't stop talk about Fort Sumter

1855
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:33,280
Bulshit Alex

1856
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:34,560
It's b*******

1857
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:37,376
The cancel culture is out of control

1858
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:40,192
They won't let me harangue them

1859
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:41,984
For no reason

1860
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,264
About Fort Sumter

1861
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:45,568
Infuriated dad

1862
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:48,128

2003

1893
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:09,440
I heard about this

1894
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:11,744
Big family

1895
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,816
Did the John Birch Society they support

In John Birch Society nonsense he does

1899
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:23,264
Know the name

1901
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:30,688
Do you think maybe if citizens united have gone another way none of us would

1902
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:33,248
Be able to instantly pull Koch brothers name

1903
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:35,040
Wouldn't that be lovely

1904
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:37,344
I don't know I don't know if that's true

1905
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:44,512
I think it's really interesting

1906
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:47,328
Obviously I'm fascinated by

1907
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:49,120
Particularly

1908
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:50,400
That era of

1909
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:54,240
Anti-communist propaganda

1910
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:55,776

01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:04,480
Meet the people that like

1915
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:06,016
Obviously Fred Coco

1916
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:07,040
The founding members

1917
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:09,344
Weird to me that you think

1918
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,136
The Alex came from a family

1919
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:12,928
The clearly was virtue

1920
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:16,768
Full-on members

1921
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:19,584
He doesn't understand like

1922
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:20,352
Who the

1923
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:23,424
These players are

1924
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:24,960
Post to B cells

1925
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:29,056
Necessarily connected to each other originally so

1926
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:32,896
It's not like they had a hero-worship of their founding member

1927
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:37,504
Are you at home

1928
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:40,832
And stay in it for all that long

1929
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:42,368
Yeah it's too busy with the Nazis

1930
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:43,648
If you got s*** to do

1931
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:44,416
Can

1932
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,208
Koch brothers

1933
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:48,256

01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:51,328
I don't know it's

1936
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:54,400
It's weird to have this

1937
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:02,336
He's not saying ignorant

1938
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:04,896
He does seem like he's frustrated that he doesn't

1939
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:06,944
Know the name

1940
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:12,320
But Bert yeah it's strange

1941
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:16,160
Another call this is where we learned that Saddam Hussein

1942
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:17,184
Maybe

1943
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:25,376
Information about the Saddam Hussein

1944
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:30,496

1945
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:32,800

Sorry

1949
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:58,144
Sounds about right

1950
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,168
He's probably in Cuba

1951
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:00,448
I make sense

1952
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:06,336
You know what I would do.

1953
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:07,872
You know what I would do if I was to die

1954
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:09,664
Closer to the United

1955
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:13,248
Americaloc

1956
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:16,320
I'll take a boat from North Korea to Maine

1957
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:20,672
This person

1958
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:23,744
Is into the birch

1959
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:24,512
Society

1960
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:27,328
So there's a little bit more conversation about that

1961
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:28,864
Is a kind of Interest

1962
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:31,936
Let me say something about

1963
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:39,360
I was a member when I lived in Utah not a member now but I do gets magazine

1964
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:42,688
Information

1965
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:48,064
So you're still want the other day that goes back into 98

1966
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:50,112
And here they were telling about

1967
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:58,816
The world trade tower

1968
01:42:59,072 --> 01:42:59,840
In Wichita

1969
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:06,496
Saddam Hussein

1970
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:11,360
The one thing I wanna make sure everybody

1971
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:13,664
People that sing

1972
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:14,944
Things about Alex

1973
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:16,480
Jones and put out in

1974
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:18,784
Information about Alex Jones

1975
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,320
Stadtmiller somebody else

1976
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:24,672
And this is the chloride remember back in the 50

1977
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:25,696
Season 60

1978
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:29,536
Birdy

1979
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:33,888
MacArthur I can hear

1980
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:40,288
MacArthur

1981
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:12,288
Story Church attorney pretended Joseph McCarthy was writing is insane, dude

1982
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:13,568
Bulshit

1983
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:14,336
I love thee

1984
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:16,128
The moment

1985
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:19,456
Yeah that is really polite angry Alec

1986
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:20,736
Yeah

1987
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:21,504
Yeah

1988
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:25,088
That's better than better than now

1989
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:33,792
I would assume that those issues of the John Birch Society magazine that the colors are

1990
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:34,816
I think they have to do with the

1991
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:37,376
The other time the World Trade Center was bombed

1992
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:40,704
You would think I would assume it has something to do with it

1993
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:43,264
I've noticed that a lot of conspiracy thinkers Tintin

1994
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,032
Ignore that that

1995
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:45,568
That happened because it helps

1996
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:46,848
Makes sense

1997
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:51,200
Why people would have been talking about terrorist attack on the World Trade Center before 9/11

1998
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:57,600
Yeah it would be it would be like oh so this guy already tried it it would make sense for him to give it another go

1999
01:44:57,856 --> 01:45:02,976
If you failed the first time yeah big

2000
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:03,744
The context of

2001
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:04,768
The first bob

2002
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:07,840
Otherwise its course

2003
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:09,888
There's a reasonable explanation

2004
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:11,936
For this boy this really weird because

2005
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:13,472
Cuz Alex is talking about

2006
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:14,496
Okay so

2007
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:18,592
This caller saying there's a John Birch Society magazine from like 1998

2008
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:21,408
It's talkin about bombing of the World Trade Center

2009
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:26,272
That's supposed to be his pretty

2010
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:34,208
Did the John Birch Society stuff from 1998 would make meth addiction that he made in 2001

2011
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:36,256
Also he's told her Bill Cooper

2012
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:40,096
Yeah

2013
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:40,864
To take credit

2014
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:41,632
Some kind of a

2015
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:42,400
Prosthetic

2016
01:45:42,912 --> 01:45:44,192
Person in terms of this

2017
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:45,984
Yeah I would imagine

2018
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:49,312
Using that he didn't make it to the 4-year University was

2019
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:51,104
He couldn't keep himself from

2020
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:53,152
Plagiarizing anything and everything in it

2021
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:54,432
If possible

2022
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:58,272
Bluebook borvan individual at this point

2023
01:45:58,528 --> 01:45:59,808
That is true

2024
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:02,368
I was not I mean despite the rush

2025
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:03,136
Slimbodi pressure

2026
01:46:04,672 --> 01:46:05,184
Yeah

2027
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:07,488
No I remember at that time

2028
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:09,024
My my

2029
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,072
My dad had all the limbo book

2030
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:11,840
Books and I was

2031
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:12,608
I was

2032
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:13,888
Inundated with right

2033
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:15,168
Talk news radio

2034
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:20,288
And I wasn't hearing this s*** that's for sure I definitely wasn't hearing this

2035
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:22,336
Some of this is a little

2036
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:25,664
I'm fascinated by how some of it is so

2037
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:27,712
Like what

2038
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:28,992
Similarity

2039
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:31,552
Waze deals with stars

2040
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:32,576
Sayings

2041
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:33,344
They attempt

2042
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:34,112
Released

2043
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:35,136
Mouse from

2044
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:39,232
Bellissimo

2045
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:41,024
Those who learn to act

2046
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:42,560
Exploded in the past refused

2047
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:43,840
To change anything so they can

2048
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:44,864
Continue exploding in

2049
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:46,400
The future dance

2050
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:47,168
For you

2051
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:55,104
That's the real question

2052
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:57,152
I'm fascinated

2053
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:58,432
Beloved

2054
01:46:58,688 --> 01:46:59,200
The past

2055
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:01,248
I can't wait to keep

2056
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:04,576

2057
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:05,344

01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,624
Is clearly not over

2059
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:10,976
Yeah we have a thousand for election

2060
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:14,304
When does multiplying in bed so we haven't done monthly invest

2061
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:17,632
Navigations for a long time I just might be open-ended

2062
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:20,448
Forever

2063
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:22,496
Be not afraid

2064
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:24,288
I will still also be keeping up on

01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:44,512
We are in spirit. No donors were fighting I go to bed

2071
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:50,656
If you could please find a local charity or bail fund

2072
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:52,192
How about

2073
01:47:54,752 --> 01:48:00,128

2074
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:01,152
