Sitting around for cheap

25

The game

Video game reviews

27
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,520
I was looking for something like $5 rain

28
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:26,432
Is that was trying to expand my son called Lovecraft untold stories

29
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200

30
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,992
I'm buying this

00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:33,088
Barbie getting 5,000 in return

Miskatonic University would like a donation

34
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,752
I got it and I was really enjoying it

35
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,312
First level of it was

36
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,080
Pretty fun

37
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,360
And then he got

38
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,408
Absurdly hard

39
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,224
It got like on

40
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,272
Farrell Evans apart

41
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:08,672
I actually looked into it because I was a kid to Camp rewrite the reviews online

42
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:13,024
Unfairly hard at that is like

43
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,584
Not balanced

44
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,864
And it's true

45
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,424
Yeah but it was also like not

46
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,728
It was just really hard

47
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,568
Am I kind of I was playing around with it a little bit

48
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,128
Here's the bright spot was that I didn't

49
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,664
Back down to the

50
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
Call Tay

51
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,736
I kept trying and then I learned

52
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:36,832
I realize like this is kind of video games

53
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:42,208
Like if you playing Mega Man to his f****** hard

54
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,768
It has that sort of difficulty it's just like

55
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,560
It's really it's

56
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,632
It's what I enjoy anyway I

57
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,424
Did beat the second level

58
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,544
Do something that I have not felt a ton

59
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,312
A video game

60
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,432
What are these open-world games that I enjoy are like

61
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:07,040
Yeah you get things done and maybe you beat a castle in

62
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:10,880
Monastery in Assassin's Creed

63
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,440
Difficult it can be yeah

64
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,863
Yeah do you know

65
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
Achievement

66
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,191
So cool

67
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:29,823
How about you my bright spot Dan may sound counter-intuitive but I mean this wholeheartedly as a bride

68
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,359
Okay my bright spot

69
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:36,479
Is failure

70
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:40,063
I think that's kind of a share this

71
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,671
As you know I started trying to stream a little bit of video games on

72
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,951
And it is

73
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:51,839
Gunn disastrous people had asked every time the address

74
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,655
Twitch TV j.b. Holmes 3209

75
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,959
Okay. That was the important thing

76
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,895
Disastrously everytime

77
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:08,735
The audio issues

78
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,063
Really it's really fast because it's fun to teach myself new stuff

79
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,415
At 33 like I've never touched the software on this before

80
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:20,511
It's fun to learn all the things that I'm terrible at and

81
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,071
Require new equipment for and all that stuff

82
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,887
And it reminded me of when I started doing stand-up

83
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,911
I've just like

84
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,447
I failed

85
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,519
For 2 years straight

86
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:37,919
And as I'm doing this I'm so frustrated cuz I couldn't figure it out properly and I felt like I was disappointing the people

87
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:42,271
Who actually came to see it and I was really grateful to them and I wanted to do a good job for them

88
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
And I failed miserably

89
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,087
And then I remembered

90
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,903
I can fail so hard

91
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,927
Persolog

92
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,583
Eventually I got good at it to the point where I think I can do the same thing here failed the equator

93
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,983
Play the Wild streams did not always go

94
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,519
Appreciation for why I have such a

95
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09,407
Difficult time with my being like that let's get back to doing livestream headache

96
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:15,807
But I wish you luck with that I know you'll get it figured out and it'll be great before watching the Stream

97
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
Because it

98
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:21,183
It also means that I'm trying new things

99
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,975
Good out of the gate at new things

100
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:29,375
That's true really good and humbling and I've appreciated it a lot you are second level of Lovecraft

101
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:35,775
Challenging

102
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,335
3 year old people anymore on supposed to be able to use

103
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,871
Computer app

104
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,151
So Jordan

107
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,479
Twist

108
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,015
Yes Alex is out of studi

109
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
No

110
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:52,671
We are on our last episode on Wednesday I had said that today we were going to be

111
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,719
Listening to the end of trump

112
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,023
Presidency and Inauguration Day

113
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,839
On Alex's show and I cannot deliver that

114
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,119
And I'll explain why

115
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,655
First reason

116
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,191
Alex's

117
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,727
Fake last episode thing

118
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,287
Carried over into this episode

119
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:14,687
I know you knew that last episode we talked about the 17th Alex tomorrow will be my fake

120
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:18,015
Could not

121
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,807
Follow the thread up

122
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,111
Then it turned out

123
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,903
That on inauguration day

124
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,695
It was an all-day affair

125
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,743

00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:31,327

Blackjack no

129

A lot of stuff

133
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
To go through

134
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,831
A lot of disappointment

135
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,647
Harrison Smith

The waffle witch

162
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,479
What's the business

163
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,527
Money off that heroin

164
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,071

173
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,855
Super unfair

174

Contacts drop

175
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
From Today Show

176
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,535
War with these people not just on their eyes

177
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,399
I'm not special

178
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,079
He always sounds exactly like the

179
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:58,431
People that he says they're demons

180
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,455
Yeah

181
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,991
I just

182
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,319
You know I don't take someone seriously when they're like I'm fighting

183
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,159
Demons all the time

184
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,951

It's brutal not fair

188
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,031
So we start on the 18th and of course on the 17th Alex had decided he was going

189
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,311
To do his last child

190
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,639
What you again already did last November

191
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:35,039
Between his food and fifth last show somewhere in that range on Saturday

192
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,319
That he was going to do the last

193
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
Broadcast

194
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,391
As he was in the middle of a

195
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,719
So human Mike Adams is a very dramatic

196
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:46,303
Oh yeah

197
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:58,591
On that Saturday Alex got distracted by Robert Barnes lawyer extraordinaire coming

198
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,383
Tell you all about qanon

199
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,967
I meant Alex realize I got I can't do it today or tomorrow

200
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,247
From Sunday came in

201
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,527
Did not do it

202
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:12,415
Decided to point the finger at the Boogaloo Bois right for the capitol storm

203
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,975
And then he's like I can't handle it

204
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:15,999
I'll do it tomorrow

205
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,815
So the 18th Monday is in

206
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
Supposed to be

207
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
The last show ever

208
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,935
The final broadcast

209
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
Great

210
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:26,751
We're doing it

211
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
Is a restart

212
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
Jersey

213
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
Jim

214
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,271
Courts of the state just seized 150

215
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,063
Thousand dollars every dime

216
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
The company

217
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
Payroll

218
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
Adipex

219
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,695
Build a building and to pay for the insurance

220
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,791
Close

221
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,095
Cash donations

222
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,679
Only God knows call themselves the church or BLM

223
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,239
It'll be protected on the First Amendment and all of us should say

224
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,287
You're part of the Church of freedom

225
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,895
I really think I'm an incorporated Church

226
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
Believe in Freedom

227
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:12,831
Okay that that was inevitable

228
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,903
Time

229
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,719
Basically

230
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:28,191
Literally s*** all over the sickness for not having a church in they shouldn't have the protections of the First Amendment

231
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,239
Really screwed up not doing this

232
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
When Trump was in office

233
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,823
Because Trump wasn't going to process

234
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,639
Churches for 501 c 3 violation

235
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,175
But that might

236
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,223
Games that might go back now

237
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,759
To where you can't do

238
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:46,623
Political organizer

239
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,047
It's basically the game here and finally getting around to it

240
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
Church

241
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,655
You never did the Church of blade

242
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,191
Because I would have joined the Church of

243
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,471
Sure

244
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,031
I don't know how Alex isn't already at church

245
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,615
He constantly talks about God and

246
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
Like this show is

247
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,223
Deeply religious thing where he's fighting demons all day

248
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,783
I don't either science-fiction or

249
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,319
One of the two

250
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:21,951
Both of which could be a church news and politics AFL Ron can do it

251
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,767
So Jordan I don't know if you know this but America is dead

252
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,071
It didn't die

253
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,863
Inauguration

254
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,143
And that's only cuz Alex

255
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,959
You can definitely put

256
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,799
United States of America

257
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:41,151
Born July 4th 1776

258
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
Side of satanism

259
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,391
January 21st

260
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,207
Whoops

261
00:14:54,719 --> 00:15:00,863
Still writing gelatiamo still write in July on those checks

262
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:05,471
This is why you got to double-check before you put the death date on the tombstone

263
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,263
Course so that's all I'm in Rock

264
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,567
Yeah

265
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:14,175
Before Bernie had to drop out of the race

266
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,247
Also get a real socialist to kill America

267
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:21,343
I know that you were taking issue with him saying you know Merrick was born July 4th 7

268
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,623
1976

269
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,719
And I don't to parse that right now

270
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,999
What I do want to talk

271
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,559
About is it this seems to imply

272
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,119
The Alex doesn't believe that life

273
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,935
Begins at conception

274
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,031
It seems to me

275
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:43,103
This is an indication

276
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,943
Bertha is looking like if your pronation your pro-choice

277
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,503
I think that's the reality

278
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,343
To celebrate the Independence Day the day when someone came up with the idea

279
00:15:55,391 --> 00:16:01,535
1617 somebody was like man I think we can do it or maybe a thousand years before that

280
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:07,935
Erik the Red is out here man I think that these states should be more night

281
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,751
The beginning of the the protesting

282
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,543
4

283
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,591
The crown began in the colonies

284
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:19,967
Then I don't know anyway I just thought that was kind of funny

285
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
When it became a

286
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,783
Twinkle in the eye of subreddit

287
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:29,183
Missionary by Alex at the beginning of this episode

288
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,791
So Alex decides to

289
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,327
Talk about the one ring

290
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,399
Sure

291
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,935
The globalist

292
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,495
Apparently they all want power in the Rings

293
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,311
Naturally I give power to the

294
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,079
The Ten Kings

295
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:46,847
Louboutin rings

296
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,383
9 rings

297
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,919
Whatever but there's one to rule them

298
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,015
But there's three for the Elven Lord right

299
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,575
Seven for the dwarf Lords

300
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,415
Alex gives himself chills

301
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,999
The globalist

302
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,071
That that that is why

303
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:12,447
And there's only competition with global it's about who gets the AI take over

304
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,727
Usai

305
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,383
10 rings

306
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
Christian allegory

307
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:29,087
He specifically said it was not for

308
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,111
The Insider knowledge

309
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,415
Went out of his way

310
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
When they

311
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,583
Heather's 16

312
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,631
Split ring that controls him all that sing

313
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,191
Spirituality

314
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
Got you

315
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,711
I believe it's 9 rings given to Mortal man

316
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,991
Doomed to die

317
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:00,575
Literally in the poem

318
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:06,975
You make a good point about token really resisting allegory as well

319
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:10,047
Nuclear bomb right news like interesting

320
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,583
No yeah

321
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,167
You did say that it was a religious story

322
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:15,935
You know it was a

323
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,215
The Christian story

324
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,567
Unintentionally at first and then intentionally upon reflection

325
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,127
Who is Jesus

326
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,831
I think that's a good answer

327
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:39,487
Yeah I just I love it anytime Alex is like talking and he oppresses himself or he freaks

328
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:43,327
I'm self out man I mailed that

329
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,375
I absolutely got that one

330
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,935
Solve that problem

331
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,775
Going on about how there's a

332
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,079
They have been in the riot

333
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:54,847
Capital

334
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:57,407
App for the storming of January 6th

335
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:04,831
Who might be inconvenient for him right agent

336
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,855
But you can tell

337
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:09,183
Alex can tell he has a special sense

338
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,511
Are you got you got FBI agents in there running

339
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,079
It seems the video you showed later other people in full camo and full mask

340
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,407
Definitely

341
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,431
Weather

342
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
What's going on

343
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:40,159
This just makes me think of the time that we spent listening to the immediate aftermath of the Boston bombing

344
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,951
I totally whenever Alex was like I can

345
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:48,351
Tell who everybody is just by looking at them I can see the way they're standing and I know this guy's Hast

346
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,399
Did you rescue team all over

347
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:54,239
When do you don't know shitt

348
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:57,823
Alex proves that the the blood of numenor has grown thin

349
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,127
Alright

350
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:06,015
How many more do I got I think you got way more but I don't know how much basically.

351
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,039
Oh boy

352
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,087
I mean like

353
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,135
People that he's talking about I think

354
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:14,207
I don't know what the video he's referring to but I assume based on the

355
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,999
Prescriptions probably the oathkeeper

356
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,023
Folks were there

357
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:21,631
But now a Joe Biggs

358
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,447
Former employees employee grambo

359
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,775
He going to prison hilarious is going to

360
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,543
Do prison

361
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,591
Hard for a while

362
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:34,687
He flips on a lot of more important I don't even know I don't even know that

363
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,479
Going to do much I do I doubt it

364
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:42,879
Who's more important than command of The Proud boy yeah that was pretty easy to take out

365
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,719
What if I mean I assume he can flip

366
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,255
Congressman

367
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,071
On account of them committing the crime

368
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,095
Hey I don't know

369
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,167
I don't know what he knows or what he's up to but

370
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,215
It's interesting to see this path

371
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,031
He's gone from

372
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,151
I didn't gone working at Infowars trying to I get pizza gate going

373
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:11,039
Ted Cruz to finally go to prison

374
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,831
Also just

375
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:17,184
Before we got on are here today on are what the f*** am I talking about

376
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,792
There's a new story those breaking about the William W

377
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,072
Who's the guy

378
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:28,448
Who had a big beard pictured at the Capitol with along with Q shaman

379
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,544
And love the headlines really stressing that he went to the Capitol because

380
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,080
Alex told him to

381
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:39,200
And I think people are making more out of that then they should think you can do

382
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,736
Much with that no I mean like

383
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,552
I saw some people tweeting

384
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,368
To be effective like Alex ordered him

385
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,160
Indigo sure even though

386
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:53,792
Star the rawstory article about it the freezing of it was a little bit iffy

387
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,608
Because as far as I can tell from the actual information

388
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:00,192
He just said that he knew that there was a rally at the Capitol

389
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,216
Because Alex

390
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,008
Brightside meet there at 1

391
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,312
Write what you got to assume is Alex

392
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,616
Wanting people to go to the stage

393
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,152
You Wiki

394
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:15,552
Conceivably going to be having a rally at it would be nice

395
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,320
People ran

396
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,344
With stories

397
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,392
They would at least like send you an e-mail

398
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:22,464
I mean I imagine that the reason they don't is because you would be like

399
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,560
Hey could you add more nuanced and maybe like more Nuance means fewer clicks so we're not going to talk to

400
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:33,216
I mean I don't know if I could even be of much help with this but I wish people would recognize that like the more

401
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,240
You put Alex

402
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,032
In the crosshairs for this

403
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,568
Toad when it's something like

404
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,872
What you see in those stories about the

405
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,152
Just got the mower works

406
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:44,224
Alex's favorite holiday

407
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:51,392
Yeah you just shouldn't you shouldn't do things like that they playing into his now you wind up you wind up not just letting

408
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,160
Off the hook

409
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:52,928
But

410
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,952
Doing a

411
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,744
I would call it pulling a Rogan

412
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,536
Where you accidentally give him more

413
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,304
Credibility that

414
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,840
Bye-bye NTB

415
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:03,168
Also write him a new narrative

416
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,984
Yeah I mean really this is this is like

417
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:11,872
Sam kind of stuff where it's like you can't blame the dog

418
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,152
You know what I'm saying

419
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,176
Or was that him

420
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:20,832
Yeah I'm pretty sure that that was Satan and stuff

421
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,112
The ring

422
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,488
Why I hated the beginning of the show it was very boring

423
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,024
There's nothing going on

424
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,120
And thankfully about an hour in our and Alex

425
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:33,888
Condenses

426
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,912
What he's been talk

427
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,192
Talking about for the last hour

428
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,728
Last hour

429
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,640
Is confirmed the Alex Jones story

430
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,224
The Boogaloo boys

431
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,784
Beyond the Southern Poverty Law Center 80 on the FBI

432
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,320
No

433
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,416
Capital

434
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:03,328
It's been confirmed Apparently that is a fair

435
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:08,192
Condensing of most of what he spent all of his time talking about but he didn't

436
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,008
Is any of this you haven't confirmed any of it

437
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,288
He just believes that

438
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:15,360
Saying something repeatedly is the same thing as good

439
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,384
Confirming it

440
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,152
How about this

441
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,200
How about fuckyour William Watson

442
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,760
Article

443
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,320
Alex doesn't get to do this

444
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,368
And all you do is

445
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,160
Go through what he did on the 6th

446
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:32,768
And how he lied about it immediately and how he's lying about it now and how we don't get

447
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,792
Get to let this go

448
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:36,096
He doesn't get to go on and talk about how

449
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:39,680
There's going to be problems and everybody's going to have their balls cut off

450
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,960
He has to say

451
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,496
If I lie to you

452
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,032
And I was full of s***

453
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,592
And everybody should Braden article about that

454
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:52,992
And also there's writing article that in the weed mentions that he believes he's constantly fighting demons

455
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,016
Yeah

456
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:59,904
We have the FBI in through the Southern Poverty Law Center in the ATL they were running a Boogaloo boys

457
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,744
To do all this right get the get through storm and going

458
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,608
Weird they were buddies on people who were Patxi's apparently

459
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,168
They were just there to be like

460
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,192
Buckle

461
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,800
Usher

462
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,384
And to be killed

463
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,408
An end to be arrested

464
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,200
A sacrificial

465
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:27,040
Dummies just like in Spies Like Us

466
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,416
Yeah

467
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,536
Spotify

468
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,120
Sicko free

469
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,592
Disgusting

470
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:54,944
Who's weird

471
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,992
So then you're saying that

472
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:57,760
They did it

473
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,040
I don't know

474
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,856
Are you saying that the real people at the the Patriots

475
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,392
It's did everything

476
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,184
Spies Like Us recently

477
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,816
I think maybe his kids are coming to such an age that I got to get in some of those classic comedy there

478
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,584
That's fair

479
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,120
Yeah

480
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:13,888
I think

481
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:16,448
That I'm noticing about Alex

482
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,240
Around this time is that

483
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,264
It's pretty much just

484
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,056
It's very Doom

485
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,360
It's very much

486
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:30,528
Dude the country is no more the devil has taken over the United States

487
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,344
Yeah but you would expect it to

488
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,184
BMV

489
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,536
He's been yelling about it for a long time instead of kind of comes in this form it's like

490
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,560
This is just

491
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,096
Going to inside people to

492
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:44,864
Violence

493
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:48,960
Want to come back and talk more about what you're witnessing there in our former capital

494
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,032
Global control we are now officially occupied

495
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,080
Joe Biden will be installed in about

496
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,872
46 hours

497
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:59,200
As the first dictator of the United States okay

498
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,736
And it will all be shut down after that

499
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:05,344
Should we think SBR was the first dictator of the United States manage to avoid

500
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,744
I appreciate that I was going to go straight at you

501
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,144
No DC's the former capital we're now under complete occupation or riding is a dictator

502
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,912
Call Ray

503
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,984
Okay well what has your show

504
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,264
425

505
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,288
Cahiers

506
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:28,128
Suggested people do when those circumstances are achieved

507
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,176
I think you know

508
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,272
Couple days left for Trump

509
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,296
To be an officer

510
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,856
He's got he's got criminals to say you

511
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,672
Can go free well actually I was a prediction about the house

512
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,976
Straits of action

513
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,560
Massage tomorrow

514
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,352
I'm predicting that right now

515
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,144
My gut tells me the trumpet good

516
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,192
The final Crucible

517
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,728
Snake eyes

518
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:57,312
Came up came up just short on that prediction

519
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,104
You don't get to do this

520
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,200
Alex probably very disappointed

521
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,112
Yeah why did he think that would happen

522
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:16,256
Alex's get we heard on that Sunday show he's getting back into the migrant Caravan

523
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,024
Fever Bass

524
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,304
Narratives

525
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:22,144
I've noticed about him is he has a

526
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,424
Absolute

527
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,032
Inability to estimate sizes of groups he will say like

528
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:32,640
100000 people is 10 million

529
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,176
Gumballs in this jar

530
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:38,784
He guesses a million every time or 7

531
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:44,928
He's not good at estimating he's looking at a picture of like a caravan

532
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,696
Of migrants

533
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,720
And he's just

534
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,512
So many more people

535
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,584
And if you don't administrative America it will be

536
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,376
By admitting run

537
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,656
Admitting This Is Love

538
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:01,568
Jamaica

539
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,896
Hundreds of thousands that Caravan here a few years ago that Trump stop

540
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:05,920
Look like

541
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,200
Insignificant

542
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,552
What's going on

543
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:14,112

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,416

557
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,696

00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:16,064

566
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,856

576
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,296
You understand

577
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:51,136
I believe they're going to shut everything down the next few months they're going to blow up Federal Building

578
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:54,464
They're going to put poison in the Water Supplies I mean it's over

579
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,584
You understand your only shot you got is realizing that we're screwed

580
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,680
EVS bossing Intuit

581
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:06,496
We're a trained group of monkeys in this country

582
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,288
We're not what Americans used to be

583
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,128
Constitution

584
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,664
We're a joke okay

585
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,968
He's in a bad mood

586
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,784
Yeah bad mood has started

587
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,600
Covering this story about the migrants

588
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
Yeah

589
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,184
Turns

590
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,976
Pretty f****** extreme

591
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:30,816
I mean he's talking about blowing up federal building poisoning the water supply

592
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,632
And like

593
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,400
Just candy asses

594
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:37,472
No and it was the rock hookah because you apologized

595
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:41,824
I apologize for not getting famous Republican The Rock

596
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,016
Alex goes from there now they're going to do all this

597
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,576
This s*** we're all just going to let the rock get away with that

598
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:56,672
That right everybody's just agreed like I don't worry about it you're the Rock

599
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:00,512
Endorsed all of the horrifying things but will still let him be a movie

600
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,048
I mean

601
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:07,680
Sure I don't know what his politics are anymore and I don't know I don't know how I

602
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,448
I look

603
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,240
Vince McMahon is eluded

604
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,800
That is true

605
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:18,688
I don't know I'm not going to I'm not going to sit here and defend the rock but I'm also not going to say that I know

606
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:21,504
I'm not speak at the RNC

607
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,296
20 years ago

608
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,600
Anyway Alex gets deeper

609
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,624
Into Doom

610
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,648
Fantasies

611
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,208
We ever beat this

612
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,400
Believable

613
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,984
They just begun

614
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:43,776
Pension fund

615
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,848
Power off the oil off

616
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:49,408
It's over man

617
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,968
It's over it's all gone it's all over

618
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,064
ATL forces

619
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,656
I wish

620
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,544
And deserves it

621
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:21,664
Good they're not God glad just let them have their way now

622
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,224
All your games are over

623
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:29,088
All the TV watching all the laziness that joins over

624
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,624
It's over

625
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,376
You don't care

626
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:46,752
There's so much

627
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:53,664
Yeah there was a jarring shift into that commercial

628
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,480
Yeah so I guess we should

629
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:59,808
Not storm Capitol building the senate for

630
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,600
I don't understand

631
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:02,880
If I recall

632
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,928
I do believe

633
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,464
But Alex said

634
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,768
God appointed him

635
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,816
To defeat Satan

636
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:14,400
And he was the only person that Satan was worried about

637
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:17,728
Yeah and that's why Satan tried to recruit him when he was younger

638
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,520
With all the hot cheerleaders

639
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,544
So

640
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,336
I mean now that he's done I assume saying

641
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,104
Bike

642
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,640
Dodged a bullet on that one

643
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,200
I guess God isn't that powerful now is

644
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:30,016
Wow you look don't blame God for Alex

645
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:36,416
The only person you can play

646
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:42,816
Is there s*** I don't believe God at all anymore damn I do think that if you take everything out too seriously

647
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:43,840
Then yes

648
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,632
He has been defeated by the devil

649
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,704
By extension so is God

650
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,752
Yeah but also

651
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,568
I could see a world where God

652
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,432
Sitting off at the size like I didn't tell you to do that

653
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:01,760
Keep my name out your mouth

654
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:06,368
Guess who you've been working for the whole time you idiot

655
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,928
You're controlled opposition for the devil

656
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,536
False flag

657
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,840
Alex believes

658
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:17,888
Everyone

659
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,912

670
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,856
We have one clip

671
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,488
I probably saw 5

672
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,792

Car polishing

677
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,760
Or their jet boat

678
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:08,576
Caring about this

679
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,600
Don't you have both

680
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,648

682
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,232
Makes me sick

683
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,768
You're not successful

684
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:17,536
You're the one

685
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:29,312
Again Alex is furious that rich people are

686
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,080
Doing more

687
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,616
To support the Infowars

688
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,896
Or something

689
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,664
I think you can

690
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,504
Read between the lines a little bit on that we've heard this this chorus

691
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,272
Before

692
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,832
I do think that this is him

693
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,112
Trying to do like

694
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,160

And it's really

700
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,704
Really funny

701
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,728
Because

Literally

712
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,264
You understand they are announcing shock collars

713
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,568
And shock bracelets and bracelets

714
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,408

I love my shocker

719
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,352
I'm not joking

720
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:01,472
No but you're talkin about a thirteen-year-old news story about something that the DHS was

721
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:04,032
Considering and didn't Implement there is that

722
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,104
So sad is that

723
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,896
Yeah that might be an issue Yelp

724
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:13,504
Because we heard him talk about that

725
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,528
Episode

726
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,832

But I also heard him bring it up on

729
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,696
This episode

730
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:28,096
He talks about how they were going to do that for you remember

731
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,912
And then he incorporated into the present

732
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,984
Yeah he's the worst yeah so

733
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,008
Content warning

734
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,288

Their colors that are just

746
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:04,448
Yes people are shocked you're still wearing them

747
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:09,312
There's more talk about shock collars here and then Alex brings in a little bit of his

748
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,872
His fears and disgusting

749

00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,112
Communist China

753
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,392

00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,008
Maybe

764
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,336
You think they're safe

765
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,184
It's all gonna burn

766
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,304
You're smart you're part of systems you can manipulate those under you

767
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,352
Come back on you a trillion Pole

768
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:42,240

Sounds fantastic

777
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,792
I'm not why

778
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:12,960
Is there a solution

779
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:21,408
Oh I'm sorry the flight attendant don't put me in a real Education Center

780
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,040
Put them in a re-education camp

781
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:34,720
It could be your last chance

782
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,000
Joseph

783
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,864
Qx30

784
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,680
Really drives home the Rarity of that entire

785
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:48,544
They let him Tire red like really feels genuine and organic and real

786
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,687
It doesn't feel like a performance at all meant to heighten people's emotions

787
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:59,807
With a minute suggestible State wherein they might be like all know I got to buy this t-shirt

788
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:06,463
You know I think this is why I really don't care like I've seen a lot of like a lot of those takes where it's like

789
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,071
You need to feel for the Q people they really believe this is real and that's

790
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:14,399
And that's why you know I know you don't think that they should read

791
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,191
Pac-Man

792
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:16,959
Get it

793
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,495
I get it

794
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,519
ICare

795
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:23,103
Because a child believes that the boogeyman is under the bed

796
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,407
The child is a child

797
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,735
I'm going to do I'm going to be like oh there's no Boogeyman under the bed

798
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,503
Let's do this

799
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,527
You're an adult

800
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,295
I don't care

801
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:34,879
I don't care if you believe that the boogeyman is under the bed I just don't care

802
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,159
You're an adult

803
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:40,511
Many of you people are middle-aged or older

804
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,071
Stop believing that there's a boogeyman under the bed

805
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:49,727
Yeah but you're not taking into account nearly enough how belief that there's a boogeyman under your bed gives you security

806
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:52,287
And feels an emotional hole that you need

807
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:55,871
Build can you don't realize that it's being filled by something

808
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,431
False

809
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,199
I am nonsense

810
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:05,599
That's cool as a boogeyman under your back and realize that you may you're not I don't feel like you're empathizing

811
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,135
I'm not

812
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,159
They're really not

813
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,487
That's okay and that's your right

814
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,791
I disagree with you I understand that

815
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,327
So

816
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,655
Like if we're pretending that this is Alex's last show

817
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,495
Things that he would obviously do

818
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,799
Is put off going to call

819
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,079
And not really get around

820
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,151
Successfully do that by screaming

821
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:29,919
About all sorts

822
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,479
And then he finally does get

823
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,015
Pickles and

824
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:37,599
In normal color fashion they're kind of a bummer

825
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,647
This one guy

826
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:42,463
Who calls in has been in the in the capital

827
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,255
ABC since the six

828
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,559
Not the building.

829
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,095
Excuse me

830
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,887
Okay and

831
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:53,471
He's really struggling to understand why

832
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,495
Trump

833
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,031
Go away

834
00:43:56,543 --> 00:44:00,639
Why would you get on an airplane and give up on being president

835
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:06,527
If we know the election was stolen right if we know these people are demons dry why would he do that

836
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:07,807
It's tough

837
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,855
I got the call from

838
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:13,183
Only president to be here on January 6th and I'm still here

839
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:16,767
God bless your brother what do you see there what's unfolding

840
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,583
I see a lot of a lot of buses

841
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,863
A lot of Buster's

842
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,911
With the tenant windows in

843
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,935
I'm hoping that

844
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,703
There are true

845
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:25,727
Real troops

846
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,495
You are Soldier

847
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,823
One thing that you're not

848
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,103
Mentioning it all is

849
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,127
Where's Trump

850
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,199
He doesn't

851
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,735
Say something

852
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,271
Start the Insurrection actors

853
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,063
Oldest town

854
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,855
This will be worse than the

855
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,975
That's what I'm saying is he's surrounded

856
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:47,999
No one is the

857
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:48,767
Supporting him

858
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,303
Human wisdom

859
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,839
Like people think he was invincible

860
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,863
They set us up

861
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,703
Comicextra demonizes

862
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,983
Trump's going to leave

863
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,543
Those troops

864
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,335
Here's the weird

865
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,615
Sing the troops

866
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,431
Fox news reporting

867
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:09,247
I don't either so who knows what's going on up there

868
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,551
I miss your crazy brother we're about to find out her

869
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:16,927
We the people know what the truth is we know there was election fraud we know covid result

870
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:19,487
We know there's a pedophilia going on

871
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,535
We know Epstein didn't kill himself

872
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,071
We know we didn't suck

873
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,119
Send help for the Benghazi soldiers

874
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,167
We know that you're biting

875
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,447
Senile

876
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:34,591
What the heck how can a man get on a plane and fly away from all this

877
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:37,151
He also said he would never surrender

878
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,711
I'm here in the belly of the Beast

879
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,759
Waiting for the command

880
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,039
So sad

881
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,831
They just really bums me out

882
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,623
That's a guy who's

883
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:47,903
Except

884
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:51,743
Internalized all of these these narratives from right-wing media

885
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:56,095
And he's really he has the right thought but he's not reaching the conclusion

886
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,143
How could

887
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,447
Trump if he is our hero

888
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:04,799
How could he know all of these things and allow it to continue

889
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,335
Take the next

890
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,103
Step buddy

891
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:10,175
I would imagine that the next step

892
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:10,943
Is

893
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:17,343
Making up a reason that makes him still be the hero yeah or or just turning it into

894
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:21,183
Trump was set up himself

895
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:27,583
Alex's doing surrounded he can't do anything

896
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,143
But that's not his fault or God's fault

897
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,167
Somehow

898
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:38,591
Another caller calls in and Alex gives him some bad advice that if

899
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:42,687
People are listening to a show and taking him seriously Alex could like be costing people

900
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,967
Thousands and thousands

901
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,247
Thousands of dollars

902
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:48,319
Coming from a blue state

903
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,855
Populated area we go

904
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,903
Square mile easy here

905
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,719
Is the time to go

906
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,023
Hear it yeah yeah

907
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,047
We we continue to

908
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:02,911
Downsize your life

909
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:05,215
Cultural goodness of God

910
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,495
It's worth everything

911
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:12,383
They're designed to totally collapse and bring down the entire

912
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,919
United States

913
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,199
So I guess

914
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:21,599
Listcawler he does mention that he's like his family has some land

915
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,623
Someone who's listening

916
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,159
Uprooting your life

917
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,463
It would be very very expensive

918
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:32,863
His family has land

919
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,423
People who were listening probably

920
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:39,775
Is Ray believe what I went to saying in like they're coming to kill you they want to chop you up

921
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,079
America's over

922
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:46,175
It's time to flee the blue city is cuz they're death traps and they're meant to collapse

923
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,199
Like

924
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,271
He could f*** around and ruin people's life

925
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:52,319
In a way that we'd never hear about

926
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:56,159
You never hear about these people who would listen to Alex took him seriously

927
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,207
I decided to go to Idaho

928
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:02,559
I'm sorry to the people of Idaho that that's the exact like I often come up with

929
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:07,423
Oregon

930
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:13,055
I mean but a penny that they're spending on moving to a remote location is a penny they're not giving to Alex

931
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:18,175
Said true except

932
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:21,503
Scenario not as they need to stock up with survival food

933
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:25,343
That's fair you got that one

934
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,159
Literally

935
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:32,767
Amazon for people who

936
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,607
So now I have gas.

937
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,887
It's Jason Jones

938
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:40,191
Show me the guy who didn't like

939
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,215
Covid restrictions

940
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,007
Directions and came to Alex's attention

941
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,799
Director YouTube video I think

942
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,335
Anyway

943
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:49,663
He is there cuz he was at the Capitol on the 6th

944
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:51,711
This is Beast

945
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,991
Planing about how the

946
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,807
The media is gas-lighting people about what happened

947
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,111
This is so funny

948
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:01,183
Mike down for this if so hard

949
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,719
You know it's one thing to

950
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,351
It was all I was all quite

951
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:11,167
Horrifying Alex it just students me

952
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,727
We have to double down

953
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,263
Spider commitment

954
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,287
The freedom of speech

955
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,335
Freedom of religion

956
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,127
Free and fair election

957
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,175
And

958
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:25,247
You know we're not we're not going anywhere we're going to keep standing up

959
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,879
Oh I thought out you still here

960
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:35,487
Okay so yeah

961
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:42,143
That that's what I got it thank you though

962
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,215
Algebraic

963
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:46,751
God

964
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:47,775
That's good

965
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:52,895
I love it

966
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:55,711
That beautiful just beautiful

967
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:58,015
I don't understand how

968
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:01,855
Trump could just leave you know knowing everything of nose

969
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,391
I don't understand how drunk

970
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:08,767
We could just leave remarkably me Jason was saying like Alec

971
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,559
Lexi was addressing Alex

972
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:16,703
He later said that he was walking around with a headset bikes week

973
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:20,031
He can hear everything that Jason Jones

974
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:23,615
Man that is that is profoundly rude that is

975
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:29,247
Love it doesn't matter how much of a dick Alex's does it matter

976
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,783
The other platform keep on,

977
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,855
Somebody who used Alex's platform

978
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,903
Maybe for nefarious purposes

979
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,183
Steve pieczenik

980
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,975
And Steve

981
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,511
Might have turned evil

982
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,791
According to Alexander

983
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,351
Okay eat seems to be implying that Steve

984
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,631
Flipped over and started

985
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,679
Supporting Q cuz he turned evil

986
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:53,055
The problem is that is General Flynn now General Flynn

987
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:58,943
Pledge of allegiance to kill there's that so Alex tries to thread this needle here and it does not work

988
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:03,551
The movement was exploding Q came along and take control of it by with intelligence Ops

989
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:06,879
We now know that well-known intelligence Ops that I know personally flipped

990
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,415
Because they were controlled

991
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:15,071
General Flynn the great guy he is

992
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:15,839
He's a good guy

993
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,119
He's

994
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,167
Control an army

995
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,983
How you don't know

996
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,775
I don't know.

997
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:26,847
Controlling an army under false pretenses

998
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,639
Makes you less of a good guy or bad guy

999
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:38,111
Love you know lying to all these evil people in order to turn them into an army that he can use to overthrow the

1000
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:40,671
Yeah.

1001
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:42,463
The problem with qanon

1002
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:44,255
According to Jason Jones

1003
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,583
Is you know they use

1004
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,119
Vague information

1005
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:52,191
From Anonymous sources

1006
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,215
Why you listening

1007
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,775
Do this just remember how many times Alex's reference

1008
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,567
Vague things that lieutenant

1009
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,103
Colonel told him

1010
00:51:59,359 --> 00:51:59,871
People have

1011
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:00,895
Such faith in

1012
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:01,663
Q

1013
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:05,503
I've been startled the people in my life people I love and know from

1014
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:08,575
High school with college Westerville

1015
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,879
I'm getting inundated with these tax

1016
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:15,743
Listen

1017
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,583
For now please stop sharing this information

1018
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,119
Anonymous sources

1019
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,679
It's communicated in a way that the ambiguous

1020
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,727
And you can verify what they stay

1021
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:26,751
When you have

1022
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:31,871
An ambiguous statement from an anonymous source that cannot be verified

1023
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,919
You can't support it or refute it

1024
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:37,247
All that can lead to infighting and mistress

1025
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:38,783
And

1026
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:45,183
The structure the very structure doesn't matter even a content of what they say doesn't matter what you say

1027
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,975
When it's from an anonymous source

1028
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,535
Sway

1029
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:52,607
It cannot be verified or refuted

1030
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,423
The only thing you have that is argument

1031
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,471
Animated

1032
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:58,495
What

1033
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,031
What

1034
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:03,615
Who made Jason might as well be explaining what Alex does

1035
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:08,479
System ya-ya-ya

1036
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:11,295
I do like whenever

1037
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,831
Self-awareness of 1

1038
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:15,903
The evil is allowed to sublimate through blaming someone else

1039
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,183
That's good that's good

1040
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:22,815
So earlier this episode we heard Alex

1041
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:23,839
Pretty bad

1042
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,631
Without freaking out a little bit

1043
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:26,655
They're going to kill you

1044
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,215
It's going down

1045
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,751
Naturally poison in the water

1046
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,031
Going to kill you

1047
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:35,615
He was also very viscerally

1048
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:38,175
Responding to things easy easy pretty mad

1049
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:40,223
That's why this is really really funny

1050
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:41,759
You have been

1051
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:42,527
Probably

1052
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:48,159
You should write a book on maintaining inner peace I agree

1053
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:49,695
I very much agree

1054
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:52,767
Pretty through the nose very much agree

1055
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,815
That I have

1056
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:57,119
Often been lacking a

1057
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:02,751
Zen and the Art of screaming propaganda this position called a sun salutation

1058
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:06,847
Nevermind

1059
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,127
Please say

1060
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:11,967
Just going to start to matter all real quick and then I'm going to yoga

1061
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:15,551
Adderall then consents Weber date

1062
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:16,319
Since yep

1063
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:19,135
To keep the vibe the real feel in the house

1064
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:21,951
I always have a glass of tea

1065
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,719
You know

1066
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:26,047
You know what's fun about yoga is whenever your right leg is

1067
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:30,911
It makes it more difficult

1068
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:35,007
Interview stupid I don't care

1069
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:37,311
All right so now we're onto Tuesday

1070
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:39,103
The day before

1071
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,383
Communist

1072
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,151
Joe Biden

1073
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:47,039
President

1074
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,575
Snow White no real

1075
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,623
Real trouble at the inauguration

1076
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:53,695
25,000 uniform

1077
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,463
Troops

1078
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:56,511
Probably is a pretty good tutor

1079
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,815
Deterrence probably

1080
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:04,447
He gave his speech and it's sort of flew in the face of all the he's senile he can't to

1081
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:06,495
Can't talk for even a minute kind of

1082
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,775
Stuff

1083
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,055
Bob

1084
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:12,383
So is Alex's is still living at 8 in the before

1085
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,687
He does

1086
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:15,711
No

1087
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:16,479
But that is what

1088
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,271
Biden is going to get in

1089
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:21,855
Unfortunately almost half of his audience

1090
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,623
Believes

1091
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,695
Have a lot of people mad at me

1092
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,487
But you won't be mad tomorrow

1093
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:32,095
When you see that I told you the truth that we got a pole on infowars.com

1094
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,167
Tens of thousands of people

1095
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,127
And over 45%.

1096
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:46,943
Everyone's being Nash arrested in Trump to the standoff

1097
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:49,503
Absolutely

1098
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:53,087
What may be part of that is because of the people you talk to me

1099
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:56,159
Absolutely incredible

1100
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,695
My audience after

1101
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,231
Stormy telling them this

1102
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:04,095
Would believe it I mean haven't Gaston who I've over-inflated their credibility

1103
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:09,215
Saying they are do everything know everything they overthrow countries

1104
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:10,239
Toppled governments

1105
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:13,055
Yeah for I don't understand why we would believe

1106
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,079
Couldn't one

1107
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:15,615
Exactly

1108
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:19,199
I think that's indicative of

1109
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:22,015
I mean I don't know how scientific these poles are on

1110
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,039
Infowars

1111
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:25,087
Assuming a third of his audience

1112
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:28,159
Let's say I believe the

1113
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,439
Steve is right

1114
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,207
And that Trump

1115
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:33,023
Magically remain president

1116
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,815
If I saw that number

1117
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,095
For our audience

1118
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,143
I would think I'd failed

1119
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:41,983
Problem with my audience

1120
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:45,055
I feel most I would almost say that would be a reason for us to

1121
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,335
Quit doing the show

1122
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:50,431
Yeah that's for people Alex doesn't look at it that way

1123
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:54,527
Kind of excited for them to be proven wrong and everything right

1124
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:58,367
To the little people who give me money

1125
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:01,183
There's a there's a loose

1126
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,207
Thread

1127
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,743
Dangling from the 6

1128
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:07,071
And that is what Alex has repeatedly

1129
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,351
And on microphone

1130
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,655
Trump personally asked

1131
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,935
Tim to leave the mark

1132
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:15,519
Yeah wrong speech to the Capitol Building

1133
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:16,799
Does not

1134
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:17,823
Turned out

1135
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:20,895
Alex was set up from the inside

1136
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:24,223
He wanted a million people in DC to peacefully demonstrate

1137
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:28,319
We were sure we had more numbers and they didn't couldn't

1138
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:33,183
Coming to speak at a stage

1139
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,607
That stage was there the night before

1140
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:42,143
Broken down by the time we got

1141
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,679
Are we were totally setup

1142
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:48,031
We walk completely into a trap with people inside his administration we know now

1143
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:50,847
I told him

1144
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:57,503
All the stuff

1145
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:05,183
By the time I got there I saw what was happening and tried to stop it

1146
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,975
This is the real world people

1147
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,351
Trucks

1148
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,119
Menstration

1149
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:19,519
I would imagine you would really want to name names alright big news

1150
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:25,919
I think everybody would give you a lot of attention if you could name names, on Alex

1151
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:26,943
Does not doesn't

1152
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:28,735
The globalist plan

1153
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:32,575
Also by the way I realize now that we've

1154
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,343
Move.

1155
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:37,183
What's the 19th it didn't really do a last episode on the 18th

1156
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:39,743
But he also didn't say I'm doing it tomorrow

1157
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,791
So I assumed that was meant

1158
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,327
And it was just that out

1159
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:46,143
Any just got distracted you just did an outburst

1160
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,167
Started yelling

1161
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:50,239
And hoped it would be kind of look like Network

1162
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:57,663
Kind of the feeling that I get I think I think his last broadcast being like 15 minutes long would really be great for

1163
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,455
Hit his last broadcast

1164
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:02,271
Being talking about migrant Caravan

1165
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,575
Over over exaggerating

1166
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,599
There

1167
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,367
Sphere

1168
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:08,159
Not after you should have for them

1169
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:14,815
Mmm putting him into a mood where he screams about shiting I get all going to die

1170
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:15,583
Overbearing

1171
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,375
And then puts off going to calls

1172
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:22,495
I think that's fitting I think that's pretty good. That's about right

1173
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:27,871
And now I'm going to say all the slurs that I've wanted to since the beginning in alphabetical order

1174
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:30,687
Also

1175
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:34,015
Here's what I think about Willy Wonka

1176
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:38,367
I watched last night and I've got a 20-minute review

1177
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:40,927
Horrific racism plus Syfy reviews

1178
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,231
Beacon Syfy

1179
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:44,511
Did you know

1180
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,791
That

1181
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:46,815
H.g. Wells

1182
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,607
Formerly was

1183
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:50,655
The head of the bad guy

1184
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:52,959
I did not know that I learned that

1185
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:55,519
Mobiles24

1186
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,543
100 years

1187
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:59,103
You can debate

1188
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,919
1850s I had the bass

1189
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:03,199
Lander Dalton

1190
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,991
Wedgwood and Hawks Lakeshore

1191
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:07,807
Grandparents

1192
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,343
Aldous Huxley and Julian Huxley

1193
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:11,391
And then bye

1194
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:14,719
1900

1195
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:16,767
HG Wells is leader of the Illuminati

1196
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,423
Ultra Vision

1197
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,983
I just got 24 years at everybody

1198
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,359
Because

1199
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:40,831
Publix

1200
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,111
Wow

1201
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:44,159
Alex strong word

1202
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:49,535
Strong words immediately following I think that the dead authors podcast by Paula Tompkins is real

1203
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:51,327
You shouldn't

1204
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,631
Probably have that position I seem to

1205
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:55,167
Seems

1206
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:59,775
Badge I think it goes against everything that he said he wanted in the past

1207
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:04,127
For saving people in the light it does feel that way also if

1208
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:10,527
Like the h.g. wells was the leader of the Illuminati but this plan only goes back to the wedgewood's in 1850

1209
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:13,343
Illuminati started in 1776

1210
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,623
Sure

1211
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:17,951
Before 8

1212
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:24,607
Who knows this stupid or the new Illuminati is like the Illuminati died

1213
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:27,167
Brought it back in new Illuminati I believe

1214
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:28,447
I got right

1215
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:29,471
Anyway

1216
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,751
H.g. Wells

1217
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,543
Not just an author

1218
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,103
Head of the Illuminati

1219
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,127
Cool

1220
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,943
Alex doesn't have a meeting with him

1221
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:41,247
But he might have a lead a meeting with another

1222
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,039
Illuminati

1223
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,159
Stop 11 next month

1224
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,231
So I will be entertaining

1225
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,559
Snowing

1226
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,655
What did you just say

1227
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:00,703
Your soul

1228
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,287
I'm not going to sit here and debate

1229
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,359
It's all out in the open

1230
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:09,407
Alex is going to have a meeting with the

1231
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,431
The top globalist

1232
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:12,735
Bill Gates

1233
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:13,759
I have to be something

1234
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:16,063
Cancel cancel

1235
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:20,415
Maybe maybe it's possible

1236
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:26,815
Could be Klaus Schwab could be could be could be a secret

1237
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,631
I think it's one of the ones that we've never heard

1238
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:36,287
The mystery Rothschild his brother who's not in the group

1239
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:45,247
It was it was it the Kennedys who supposedly had a relative that they kept in the

1240
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:47,039
Attic or something like that

1241
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:52,927
Oh that's right they actually did holyshit that's real weird

1242
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:58,559
I was just talkin about a Jonas brother who didn't get to begin with the truck and you're really sad

1243
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:00,607
Memphis

1244
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:04,191
I don't know who Alex is talking about

1245
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:06,239
But the globalist

1246
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,799
Except

1247
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:09,823
Their plan

1248
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:10,591
In order for them

1249
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:11,359
Let's get away

1250
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,127
With what they're doing

1251
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:16,479
Alex Express is this a little bit

1252
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:19,551
Humanity is starting to wake up and actually be

1253
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,599
They should be

1254
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:24,415
Play the social darling

1255
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:28,511
But if you don't recognize for doing you don't have it

1256
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,279
Open

1257
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:30,815
Dialogue

1258
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:32,863
I talked to them person-to-person and say

1259
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,655
I know what you're doing

1260
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:35,935
I'm going to resist you

1261
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:39,263
Then they have no respect for you and will run over you

1262
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,567
They better physically meet you

1263
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:43,359
To acquiesce and submit

1264
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:46,175
I always have to leave you an escape valve

1265
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,199
It is a rule

1266
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,479
Alba University

1267
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:54,879
Follow these rules

1268
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:57,951
If you want make a spiritual cultural

1269
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:59,231
Economic and

1270
01:03:59,487 --> 01:03:59,999
Physical

1271
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:03,327
Decision who you're with

1272
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,607
Then you are

1273
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,935
So the religious stuff

1274
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,983
30 adds on to this is

1275
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,263
But whatever but

1276
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:14,591
I like the idea that if you don't know their plan and

1277
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:16,639
Specifically fight back

1278
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:19,711
Like he is just taking that from that fake document

1279
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,735
Silent weapon

1280
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:24,575
Which was chapter 1 of Bill Cooper's book

1281
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:26,111
Behold a Pale Horse

1282
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:32,767
We covered this in-depth in our episode number 381 on this podcast I want to rehash all the history

1283
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:35,583
Read that again but if you're interested in how fake that document is

1284
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,351
Don't listen to that

1285
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,423
On Page 6 of that fake document there's a

1286
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,191
Particular

1287
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:43,775
The Bill Cooper repeat over and over and over again on his show

1288
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:48,383
So to the point where like if you were a listener you would definitely have that implanted in your mind

1289
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:49,407
Is it really a board

1290
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:50,943
Quote

1291
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:53,247
All science is merely a means to an end

1292
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,271
The means is knowledge

1293
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,039
The end is

1294
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:57,599
Control Beyond this remains only one issue

1295
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:59,135
Who will be the beneficiary

1296
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:02,719
In 1954 this was an issue a primary concern

1297
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:05,279
Although the so-called moral issues were raised

1298
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:11,679
In view of the log natural selection it was agreed that a nation or world of people who will not use their intelligence

1299
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:14,239
Gents are no better than animals who did not have until the

1300
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,543
Such people are beasts of Burden

1301
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,335
And steaks on the table by choice

1302
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,103
Can consent

1303
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:23,455
This is where I was his idea that if you don't directly fight the globalist

1304
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:26,783
That's equivalent of you consenting for them to do whatever you want that

1305
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,063
They want to do to you

1306
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,855
Beds that if your

1307
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:32,415
If you can get away with taking all your stuff it

1308
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:35,743
Zelda silent weapons for quiet Wars

1309
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:40,095
I would hurt Alex reference a document before I know he was a huge Bill Cooper listener

1310
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:42,143
That's all that's all this bike

1311
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,679
Mythology about the globalist

1312
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,703
Meeting you

1313
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:46,751
Do consent by not fighting them

1314
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:49,311
Stuff comes from fake

1315
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:51,359
I assume he's

1316
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:55,199
For saying that he knows God's plan and he can see it

1317
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:57,247
And he's part of God's plan

1318
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,015
And that

1319
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:01,087
And he's apologized for being wrong and he said that

1320
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:04,415
He can't see God's plan and maybe you know all of his

1321
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,695
Ideas of what God

1322
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,767
Controllers are

1323
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:12,351
Now what's this is all still part of God's plan God's plan is now for him to

1324
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,887
The fight Joe Biden

1325
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:18,495
Politically and make a bunch of money telling people to head to the woods

1326
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:24,127
Thought he had already told me that God's plan was for him to defeat Joe Biden in the devil and Trump

1327
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:24,895
To take over

1328
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:27,455
And create a lasting 1000-year long reign

1329
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:33,087
I don't know I don't know if he was ever specifically Thousand-Year Reign but it did certainly have overtones of that

1330
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,879
I don't know I don't know it

1331
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,671
One of the things about profits

1332
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:38,975
Is when they're alive

1333
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:40,255
They're really slippery

1334
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:47,679
Their prophecies quite a bit

1335
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:49,727
Yeah you got a real talent for that

1336
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:53,823
Long form improv comes from

1337
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:59,711
Long form improv rearranging prophecy

1338
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:00,735
Form Improv

1339
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:04,319
Tobias disease games that I was playing with his like prediction

1340
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:06,111
Decades-long

1341
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:07,647
But the globalist their plan is

1342
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:09,695
Hundreds of years old

1343
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:10,975
You can debate it

1344
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:18,655
All right maybe it's maybe it's Mesopotamia

1345
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:20,959
Baby experiment

1346
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:21,983
Call Natalie

1347
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:27,615
In his hubris filled mind

1348
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:31,711
She's going to talk the globalist out of their plan

1349
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:33,247
Don't take enjoyment

1350
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,271
Screwed up

1351
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,039
Falling apart

1352
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:35,807
Mariah

1353
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:39,135
The plan is to make Humanity so dysfunctional

1354
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:42,463
That those of us that aren't part of it are going to

1355
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:44,767
Suicide

1356
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:47,327
Globalist

1357
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,911
Because I mean why won't stand up

1358
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:51,679
Yourself

1359
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:52,959
That then I can't help you

1360
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:55,007
I'm not going to join the globalist

1361
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:59,103
Open dialogue with some of their

1362
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,127
Top-level people

1363
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:02,431
I had some dialogue with their top people

1364
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,967
And I want me to stop

1365
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,575
Yeah that's going to work

1366
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,647
I don't believe any of this stuff but let's

1367
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:14,463
Humor a I can imagine that he's going to go into

1368
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:17,279
The meeting with Klaus Schwab

1369
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:20,607
You gotta cut it out man and they're to be like

1370
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,399
I have not heard this information for

1371
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,935
Are you serious

1372
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:29,055
This is bad for Humanity photo I'm talking to the devil

1373
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:34,431
I can only his horns and the fact that I could never see him through the shadowy fire

1374
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:37,247
That I agree might have been a sign

1375
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,783
I should have figured this out

1376
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,319
Can't believe it took a

1377
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,087
Weird sex

1378
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:44,159
Some guy yelling at me.

1379
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:45,439
Hold on Alex

1380
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:46,207
Just real

1381
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:47,743
Are you telling me

1382
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:51,071
That when I sold my soul to the literal devil

1383
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,607
He was a lying to me

1384
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:59,519
Alex is also said that these people act impulsively and they can't help themselves so I don't have anybody

1385
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:02,079
The other also not human

1386
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:04,127
Anymore

1387
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,663
Parlay is going to do

1388
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,687
Call such stupid

1389
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:09,247
I guess an order for him to enact

1390
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:11,295
What his plans he also has to get

1391
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:12,319
Veritasium

1392
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:13,599
Consent

1393
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:17,439
Because it's a rule of the universe if God's plan

1394
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:20,511
No because he's not doing anything to them

1395
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:27,679
The globalist only need your consent because the things that they're doing

1396
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:29,471
Affect you like Chemtrails over

1397
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,751
Country Club

1398
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:32,031
Usher

1399
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:37,663
That affect all of us because of our passivity and not fighting them on it that's what that's consent to have right rails

1400
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,967
Dropped on us I mean if you're going to

1401
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:45,087
Defeat the globalist I assume they're going to lose all of their money and power so that's doing something to them

1402
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:46,623
Yeah but

1403
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:51,231
I'm just saying if it's universal law

1404
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,767
He actually has to get the

1405
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,047
Consent of the globalist

1406
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:54,815
Before he

1407
01:09:55,071 --> 01:10:01,215
We can defeat that fine I guess Sports Camp exist

1408
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:02,495
The consent to be beat

1409
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:07,359
You have to sign a waiver before you play the game

1410
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,383
Consent to

1411
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:11,455
Disney

1412
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:17,087
On this episode here on the 19th and it's not an interview I'm really interested in all that much

1413
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:18,111
It is

1414
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:18,879
The brother

1415
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:25,023
Of John Sullivan the guy who got arrested for videotaping inside the Capitol building

1416
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:27,839
And Alex has decided is the big antifa leader

1417
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:30,399
Write out who who caused all the trouble

1418
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:35,775
We got Mike Flynn the third cuz Mike Flynn and my junior are not answering my calls anymore

1419
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:42,175
Jim Sullivan is a guy who has some right-wing Tendencies or is the brother of John

1420
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:44,479
I just I heard this I was like

1421
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:47,295
Tell us about yourself

1422
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,063
Brother

1423
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:55,231
You're very well known in Utah

1424
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:59,071
Just popping up for a while

1425
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:07,007
This interview is deeply irresponsible

1426
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:13,407
A lot of it ends up just being James talking about John's personal life in ways that I don't feel like they belong on Infowars

1427
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:15,199
And was it kind of left me feeling gross

1428
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:16,223
Send uncomfortable

1429
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:17,759
I know that Alex really needs

1430
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:21,087
The build-up John Sullivan is the big antifa Boogeyman in order to

1431
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:24,671
Precarious conspiracy theories about the storming of the capital being a false flag

1432
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,975
Super inappropriate

1433
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:31,327
The whole thing is Alex trying to get James to give some details that Alex can use

1434
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,607
How to build a deeper narrative

1435
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:35,167
He's asking me probing questions about like it

1436
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:37,215
Did someone put him on drugs or

1437
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:39,519
Do you know what who is Handler might be

1438
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:41,055
It's okay it's really gross

1439
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:43,615
And also I don't know if

1440
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:44,639
James

1441
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:48,223
However much he might disagree with his brother

1442
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:49,759
I don't know what kind of

1443
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:52,831
Potential damage realizes could come to him

1444
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:55,647
By virtue of the way this conversation goes

1445
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:59,743
The super Super Bowl the 1-yard line

1446
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:02,815
Understanding I was being set up and all this and I did

1447
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:07,167
Korean

1448
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,959
Call Julio mobile things happen

1449
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:10,751
Accused

1450
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:11,519
Call Matt thing

1451
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:13,567
I bet he didn't fumble at the one-yard line

1452
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:16,383
He scored and won the game against America

1453
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:18,687
In the super Super Bowl

1454
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:25,855
It will be your brother

1455
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:30,975
I don't know

1456
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:32,255
I don't

1457
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:34,815
I don't know if he realizes like

1458
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,607
The kind of conversation

1459
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:37,887
But they're having here is a

1460
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:38,911
It's really

1461
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:40,447
The kind of thing that could

1462
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:42,239
Potentially put a Target

1463
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:48,895
Mr. seller misses real quick to kill your brother I just want you to I just want you

1464
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:51,711
Agree with me that all of this is your brother's fault

1465
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:52,735
He is killed

1466
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:53,503
The country

1467
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:54,783
And

1468
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:56,063
Of course deserves

1469
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:04,255
I'm going to going to politically this dude is saying

1470
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:05,279
Buddy who is along

1471
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:06,815
Filming John because

1472
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:09,119
There's been making a documentary

1473
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:12,447
About him and his brother like the two of them are both like

1474
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:15,263
Opposite sides of the political aisle shoes

1475
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:17,823
I don't know what's going on here don't trust any of this I don't

1476
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:19,359
Caribou

1477
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,639
Yeah I really do

1478
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:24,223
It just really really really uncomfortable but

1479
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:27,807
I will say that

1480
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:32,415
James doesn't realize what Alex's narrative is clearly because

1481
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,183
Counters

1482
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:37,791
Seeing him wasn't really that much of a surprise after few was

1483
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:41,631
Remove from Eutaw cheewit to travel to Kenosha

1484
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:43,167
California to Portland

1485
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:47,519
Trying to get into since you two communities and they would kick him out to seeing him here wasn't really

1486
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:49,567
A surprise

1487
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:52,639
My brother saying that he keeps getting kicked out of there

1488
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:55,967
Antifa groups antifascista groups

1489
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:57,503
Alex

1490
01:13:57,759 --> 01:14:00,063
Stu then argue that he is an antifa leader

1491
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,343
Yeah

1492
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:04,159
Seems like they're both

1493
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:05,695
Run in a game

1494
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:10,303
That's what I am not saying that they're running a game but it does seem like

1495
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:11,327
They're running

1496
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,119
I think

1497
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:17,471
A lot of their comment

1498
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,495
It's about John

1499
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:22,079
The sense that I get there is sort of an attention

1500
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,895
Seeking Behavior pattern

1501
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,687
Yeah kind of

1502
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:30,527
Disregard for what other people are doing

1503
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:32,063
That are productive thing

1504
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:34,367
Maybe maybe I'm just so cool

1505
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,391
Just so

1506
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:40,255
Conditioned to believe anybody in that sphere is running a game up some

1507
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:44,607
You know the thing that I think is the most worrying is the idea that there

1508
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:47,167
Someone was making a documentary about the two of them

1509
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:49,727
Like that to me is like okay

1510
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:52,543
If one of you one of these brothers is

1511
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,847
Someone who seems to have a clear pattern of attention

1512
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:57,151
Behavior and the other brother is

1513
01:14:57,407 --> 01:15:00,735
Happens to be directly on the other side of the political aisle

1514
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,783
It is doing a documentary with

1515
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:06,111
It seems like this is all attention-seeking Behavior actually does

1516
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:07,391
And the fact that you would go in

1517
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:11,231
Talk about your brother in such a weird way on Infowars of all places

1518
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:14,047
It just it would grosses me out

1519
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:17,119
There's too many human elements to it

1520
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:20,191
I wouldn't I wouldn't like this this

1521
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:21,727
It's kind of conversation to be had

1522
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:24,543
Don't see any

1523
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:26,079
Like

1524
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:30,687
Either they're like the okay so they could be running a game and this is f*****

1525
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,991
Or they're not running the game

1526
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:35,039
F***** up yeah

1527
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:36,575
You know like this is f***** up

1528
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:40,671
We have not interview people who know Alex for a reason

1529
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:43,231
Yeah cuz it's uncomfortable

1530
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:45,023
I wish I looks would do the same

1531
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:47,839
Cuz this is weird

1532
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:49,631
Any more of that

1533
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:52,191
Does though on this episode

1534
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:54,239
Get to sit talk about how he doesn't want bike

1535
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,007
Dead

1536
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:57,311
But he is going to put him in his death pool okay let's

1537
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:03,199
Deadpool

1538
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,783
I don't think he's going to be dead

1539
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,319
In the next year

1540
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,791
Do you watch power though

1541
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:19,327
They put him in there cuz he's so weak

1542
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,095
So Adam

1543
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,679
Talk about stepping down

1544
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:25,983
When

1545
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:28,543
Once we have our installed present our first dictator

1546
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:35,711
First dictator get those when he was vice president if he had a fundamental

1547
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:36,735
Prince with Obama

1548
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,527
Difference

1549
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:40,063
Situation then I then the current

1550
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,343
But whatever

1551
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:43,647
Biggie

1552
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:46,463
He's trying to say he's putting him in the death pool

1553
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:54,399
I put a death pool on you

1554
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:58,239
Do we have another guest here before we wrap up the 19th

1555
01:16:58,751 --> 01:16:59,775
This episode was not good

1556
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:01,055
This was a slug today

1557
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:01,823
Get through

1558
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:04,127
Nick Fuentes on

1559
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:05,151
And

1560
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:05,919
It's interesting

1561
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:06,687
Because

1562
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:08,735
We have slightly different viewpoint

1563
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:10,783
About the storming of the capitol

1564
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:14,111
Alex is all false flag

1565
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:15,903
Nick has been pretty it

1566
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:16,927
In favor

1567
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:20,767
Calling it the end of the world

1568
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,143
I think it was

1569
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:35,871
System what they wanted when they broke in quoted the media

1570
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:39,199
Contact

1571
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:41,759
Appreciate them coming out

1572
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:43,551
Thanks on the founder of the broilers

1573
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:46,111
Volunteer popular talk show

1574
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:49,695
Thanks for having me

1575
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:56,095
I want to play one thing here that sort of out of order because I think it it did

1576
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:57,119
Is alright

1577
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,911
Responsibility

1578
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,703
Later people falsely

1579
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:01,727
They claim that I breached

1580
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:03,519
Wasn't true

1581
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:15,039
There were people who were claiming that nicotine test was along with like baked Alaska in the capital

1582
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:17,599
There's a picture that definitely look Tate

1583
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:19,391
Horn like Nick Fuentes

1584
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:20,927
It was quite

1585
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:21,951
Believable

1586
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,231
And I

1587
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:25,279
I took that as proof

1588
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,303
But he was there cuz I looked

1589
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:27,071
A lot like him

1590
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:30,143
It appears that that's not accurate

1591
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:32,191
He was outside

1592
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:34,239
He did not go inside

1593
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,263
That is the case

1594
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:36,799
And I can't find solid evidence

1595
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:37,823
It's outside

1596
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:38,591
Of that

1597
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:39,359
Picture

1598
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:41,663
And so I willing

1599
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:42,431
To believe

1600
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:44,735
Is is Sabin

1601
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,783
That I was wrong when I

1602
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:47,807
Repeated that he was in

1603
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,855
Hannah Capital so

1604
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:51,647
Anyway he

1605
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:54,719
Yeah course

1606
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:58,047
Which almost is more evidence I think that he didn't go into

1607
01:18:58,303 --> 01:18:59,839
Yeah I am

1608
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:01,887
Under arrest

1609
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:08,031
That's right now he think a lot of people who are getting arrested probably are not like

1610
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:15,199
I'm a big deal with the pumps right now I'm a big fan of the we got

1611
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:16,479
Carried up in the moment argument

1612
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:18,015
Hey man it's

1613
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:20,575
The crime of passion Dan don't count

1614
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:23,135
Well some people look at it as a crime of passion

1615
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:25,695
And some people would think of what happened

1616
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:26,975
That day

1617
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:28,511
The entirety of it as

1618
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:29,535
Culmination

1619
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:33,119
The stop the steel thing that Alex was a big party

1620
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:37,727
And when we got there the entire time

1621
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:41,567
Awesome site

1622
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:42,591
Because

1623
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:48,991
You are there as well you are traveling the country in Phoenix

1624
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:53,087
The voter fraud and everything

1625
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:56,415
And so to finally see hundreds of thousands of Trumps

1626
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:58,207
Supporters

1627
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,743
Capitol Building demanding

1628
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:01,279
Bat-Mite pants

1629
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:04,351
For the Republican Senators take action on voter fraud

1630
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,655
The Fulfillment of the

1631
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,447
Two or three months of stop

1632
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:09,471
Steel protest

1633
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:11,519
And to me it looks like the America

1634
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:14,336
People were waking Uprising off at all of that

1635
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:16,640
Everything else was a fulfillment of it too

1636
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:22,272
Everything else was The Logical extension of the the movement that you all have been pushing down the road

1637
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,064
Anyway

1638
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:27,392
Make a little bit of a softer view on qanon

1639
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,416
Then then our

1640
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:33,536
Alex is pretty mad and of course a large portion of it always comes down to he wants

1641
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:34,304
Scratch

1642
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,608
And that is also where this clip is go

1643
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:37,376
Going to go

1644
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,400
But Nick

1645
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:42,496
Kind of has a position more like it woke people up the Normie

1646
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:44,800
Types of the Suburban

1647
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,128
You know they they now know about how

1648
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:54,784
All the people I don't like are Dracula's terrified

1649
01:20:55,040 --> 01:21:00,928
We're on our way to Victory Maybe

1650
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:02,720
Need to get those people back into

1651
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:04,256
A profitable Revenue stream

1652
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,840
The good thing about you and I always thought was that

1653
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:10,144
I got a lot of regular people

1654
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:13,984
Do believe the right things even if they were believing

1655
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,568
Conservative

1656
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:20,384
Who believed that usual stop about

1657
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,088
The power of the elites and the evil and the corruption of

1658
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:33,440
And kind of his International thing that's going on with the government

1659
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,976
I didn't, Siler City

1660
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:36,512
Did

1661
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:39,328
Became futile 10-q knows about this

1662
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,168
Papua

1663
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,472
The general public was just now waking up

1664
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,240
To get into it

1665
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:49,056
See the thing that I liked about that

1666
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:55,456
Pissed off that he's not getting credit credit to not sound like a super Petty assholes

1667
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:57,760
You like you've been around a while

1668
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:04,160
22 here silver he's a veteran he was there at the storm in the capital there's no rookies in

1669
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:07,744
Any more Dan he was in high school or the 2016 election

1670
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:11,328
I know I heard him debate it was garbage

1671
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:17,728
Ya Ali and the storming of the capitol

1672
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:22,080
He's not been around awhile if the way that Alex is pretending

1673
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:29,504
Can the day your 90 trouble

1674
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,576
It's our last clip here

1675
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:35,136
Is it just talking about out right now the globalist

1676
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:37,184
Sphere Alex because he has

1677
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:39,744
So you can reach people

1678
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:44,608
But what they feared about you and what they feared about Joe Rogan

1679
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:46,400
Is that you have your own

1680
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:48,704
Totally independent infrastructure

1681
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:52,288
Broadcasting

1682
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:59,968
They want to control everything that people here they want to control what's on their phone

1683
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:00,992
Want to control town.

1684
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:06,624
TV on the radio

1685
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,928
Nick is still verified on Twitter

1686
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:10,208
Still there

1687
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:11,744
Psychotic

1688
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:13,024
Punctures that

1689
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,816
I don't know I think I think it's

1690
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:18,400
Everybody wants to

1691
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:20,704
Control how everybody speaks and all that

1692
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,728
And more

1693
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:25,824
Yeah they're certain platforms that just don't put up with certain behaviors and you guys have

1694
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:27,360
Cross those lines

1695
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:28,128
Dude

1696
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:28,896
To the point where

1697
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:30,944
People going to take it seriously

1698
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:34,272
And I would assume

1699
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:36,832
We can show that they were involved in XYZ

1700
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:39,648
Report that they will be bad they will be kicked off

1701
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:41,952
Alright

1702
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:45,792
I don't know who he's talking about so I can't even text you

1703
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,352
I can go look for every account that has

1704
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:51,168
#Boogaloo

1705
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:53,216
Then I have to go through hashtag big igloo

1706
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:55,776
All the weird ways everybody

1707
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:56,544
Spell things

1708
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,824
Can't do that now

1709
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:59,616
Making a nonsense state

1710
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:01,920
It's almost like Vega information

1711
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:05,248
Yeah man unknown source

1712
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:08,064
It's hard not to hear them saying like

1713
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:11,648
Okay well we used to never have to think about how people

1714
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:12,416
Fulfill

1715
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:16,256
Then they started asking us to think about how we feel and we stormed the Kappa

1716
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:20,096
And now they're demanding that we think about how other people

1717
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:23,168
Will feel and they're giving us consequences when we don't

1718
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:25,472
That sounds like exactly what they're saying right

1719
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,776
There's there's a some overlap

1720
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:29,056
I

1721
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:30,336
I find

1722
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,872
This to be

1723
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:32,640
Sad

1724
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,688
This was not a good

1725
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,480
Couple of days for Alex

1726
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:38,272
Yeah it wasn't even like

1727
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,064
Maybe he's holding back

1728
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,368
For the dinner with the long

1729
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:45,696
For the marathon gas the inauguration

1730
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:46,720
But like

1731
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:48,512
I don't know

1732
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:50,048
Is the last 2 days on the key

1733
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:56,192
He mustered up his fake last show on the 19th or the 18th

1734
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:59,520
Wasn't anything it was a it was a real disappointing crescendo

1735
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:01,824
I just got nothing

1736
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:02,592
Yeah

1737
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:03,872
I mean it's not

1738
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:09,760
You know you had that day where you know that at the at the end of the week you're going to have the worst

1739
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:11,552
It's like longest day and

1740
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:12,832
The day before that

1741
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:15,136
That you're like you know what I'm going to take it easy today

1742
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:19,488
I'm just going to do my job but I'm not really going to

1743
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:23,072
I'm going to yell a little bit

1744
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:29,728
I got I got a lot of things to scream about I'm going to lie but then I'm just going to take

1745
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,264
Take it easy man

1746
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,312
Imagine maybe he's been

1747
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:36,384
Too busy writing a book about inner peace

1748
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:40,480
I do think even if

1749
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:41,504
Everything

1750
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:42,784
Sucks

1751
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,600
And nothing is really going on here

1752
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:47,136
I would

1753
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:49,440
Haven't done this episode just

1754
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:50,208
For that clip

1755
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:51,744
Where Alex is gone

1756
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,840
That's so good I just want that there

1757
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:58,144
I will say this I will make this pledge

1758
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,936
If Alex does write that book

1759
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:00,960
I will edit it

1760
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:06,336
100% audio book of it in my Alex impression

1761
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:11,968
That will be absolutely that is the one thing we will do for Alex in our career

1762
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:16,320
Will be back

1763
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,088

Spectacular 2020 because Alex
