Alex is never having fun

12
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,128

This

29
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,576

30
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,368

This whole week

32
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,440
The last couple of days

33
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,232
Sunday through Tuesday

34
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,512
Have been

35
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,120
I only talking about cereal being a false flag

36
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,960
Insisting that every piece of evidence backs him up

37
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,312
Even Putin false flag

38
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,848
Cool

39
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,688
Great source

40
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:33,088
Spectraforce there's an interview with Ron Paul was on RT

41
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,952
Cereal is a false

42
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:44,096
Keanu

43
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:50,496
I left the libertarian for a while now I'm back percent chance this was a sod

44
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,520
Hey whatever

45
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,080
0%

46
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,128
Hundred percent

47
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:00,480
DNA testing

48
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:06,880
It was not this good never be certain things in life one of the ways to learn is not

49
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:13,280
Also he has an interview that he plays conducted interviews on the BBC with a

50
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,072
Former ambassador to Syria

51
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,120
Peter Ford

52
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,448
And he's talking about how America

53
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,288
Alex Jones

54
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,056
School funding

55
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,896
Yeah

56
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,920
Bucky says

57
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,248
Former UK ambassador

58
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,576
Whatever in 2000's

59
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,392
Is basically saying

60
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:43,488
That because Trump has bombed them after a gas attack

61
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
It gives

62
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,328
Any Isis members there

63
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,400
A really good motivation to fake another one

64
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,704
If they want to lure us into war

65
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,032
He says that the interview

66
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,824
Alex Jones insist

67
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,872
That this is proof that the

68
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
Gas attack

69
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,664
Have happened

70
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,944
Is a false flag

71
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,528
And that this guy isn't even saying it

72
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,344
Technically

73
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,880
Actually say that

74
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
Okay

75
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,416
Further

76
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,536
And he has been roundly criticized

77
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,327
Buy tons of organization

78
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,119
For being pro-assad

79
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,263
He's very impartial a possible explanation

80
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,847
Doesn't implicative

81
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:43,135
Time-in oh that is very true

82
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,159
Which

83
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,183
I am not

84
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,743
Thank you for clearing that up

85
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,559
I would say

86
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,471
The Holy War

87
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,239
Exactly

88
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,543
And Irene

89
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:04,383
What we're saying is Ford

90
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,407
Giving them

91
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:11,295
The plant I'm sure they thought of that already but that means

92
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,831
Because

93
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,111
Posada

94
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:18,207
Super Bowl record

95
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,791
You could say horrible wreck you could also say

96
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,839
He has one of the best record

97
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,887
In that he's

98
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,167
Really good at it

99
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:27,935
So

100
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,983
Alex has been making this argument

101
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
Across-the-board

102
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,847
He's doing it in order to try and defend Trump

103
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:38,431
Sing the Trump

104
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,223
He's just doing this as a show of strength

105
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,343
We kind of went over that a little bit on the last episode

106
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,903
And he's been blaming everybody

107
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,695
Put started with Kushner

108
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:53,535
No Steve Bannon is called the globalist and a cuck

109
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,559
He is a cuck

110
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:59,679
Whether or not he's a globalist is yet to be

111
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,959
So he's like it's Kushner

112
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,983
Jared Kushner

113
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,055
That's what we call in from now

114
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,359
The carpenter is like

115
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,687
He's a secret Democrat

116
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,271
Whatever

117
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,295
Then Alex

118
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,831
Switches

119
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,111
You know it was Ivanka

120
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,975
And now on Tuesday show

121
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,279
Ivanka is Kutner in Tucker

122
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:34,239
Sick for very long

123
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,031
Alex like it's Tillerson

124
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:44,223
Everyone's getting the blame everyone

125
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,759
Everywhere

126
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,319
Joseph

127
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,111
He's an excellent CEO

128
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
And

129
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:58,303
Is very heavily involved. That is very real

130
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,071
He has no feeling

131
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
So he's just evil

132
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
Capitalism

133
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,703
Personified

134
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:11,103
Bullion interested in Staffing the state department

135
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,687
Which seemed so odd if you don't want to do the job

136
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:21,087
Just for you you're a billionaire that you're well actually Mike cernovich hasn't

137
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:26,719
About that Mike cernovich was on last week or so he was breaking a big scoop

138
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,999
And that is

139
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,791
The pedophile

140
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,375
Pedophile Army

141
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,959
Compromise the people who give out security clearances

142
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,287
The reason that all of the jobs

143
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,567
In the government

144
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,871
Staffed it isn't because Trump hasn't

145
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,479
It's because

146
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,783
Whenever he does try and nominate somebody

147
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,063
These globalist

148
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,855
Pedophile Elite

149
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,879
Controlled

150
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,719
Security clearance people are like no no no no you're out of here

151
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,887
Is maybe the dumbest conspiracy theory I've heard it's wild

152
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:10,751
Is out there so anyway I don't want it I don't want to talk about

153
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,031
Like I said

154
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,567
I didn't want to cover

155
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,871
We're going to cover today

156
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,663
Was the today

157
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,455
On the show

158
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
April 11th

159
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,039
Alex Jones had Michael Savage back on

160
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,135
Michael Savage I think it's starting to smell the roses

161
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,439
Okay so he's gonna bail on Trump

162
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:34,303
Not so much but he's starting to realize oh f*** we got screwed he's laying the groundwork

163
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,655
Definitely starting to be like I trust Trump but I

164
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:44,799
He's going to f*** as he's getting into World War 3

165
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,591
I don't understand how you don't

166
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
You didn't see this,

167
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
First of all

168
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,199
Big B go hard on Tillerson and they're like

169
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,319
Loyal CEO of course he's interested in this pipeline

170
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:00,671
Do you know that we all do this

171
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,375
Connected to Goldman Sachs and all this s***

172
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:16,287
Golden election

173
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,847
Once Trump started nominating people

174
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,383
You get a Goldman Sachs people in

175
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,783
History of fighting the globalist

176
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,319
Has been doing

177
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:36,767
Snooze

178
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,863
And then it got out of their control the dump

179
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,423
They were selling people

180
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:47,263
Before they didn't realize that

181
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
We were Liars

182
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:52,127
Yeah yeah yeah

183
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:59,039
Especially 112 president

184
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:04,159
Oh no

185
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:08,767
Real weird alt-right hangover I think

186
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,959
There will be anybody

187
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,983
Eternal slumber

188
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,311
I was fascinated by this Michael Savage interview

189
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:28,223
And I regret not pulling one clip from it because

190
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,759
What happened right after

191
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,087
Michael Savage interview it was like

192
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,111
Kneeling down

193
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,487
Like I don't want to cover this stuff I know where 10 minutes into the episode now

194
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,279
Everyone talked about what he's been talkin about

195
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,607
But I don't want to do a whole episode talking about this

196
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,631
Cuz it's so wet

197
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,911
His don't care

198
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:50,751
I don't want to talk about it with episode

199
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,519
Warriors

200
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,311
Please

201
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
Just give me something

202
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,919
You know like Jesus

203
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:02,015
Alex Jones works in mysterious ways

204
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:06,623
You know what we're going to be

205
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,159
I want to save this

206
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,183
He's sober

207
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:16,095
Okay alright one of the craziest thing I've ever heard of power Alex Jones full force

208
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,495
We can tell that he's not drunk

209
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,639
Regret not pulling one clip from the Michael Savage interview

210
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:34,015
There was a point where Alex is like

211
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:50,399
No we got a cellphone that's how we always talk calling

212
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,335
So that does that does confirm our theory that

213
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,407
Alex Jones has Trump's phone number

214
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,991
You think they'll the premise

215
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,831
The President's chief of staff is holding his phone hostage

216
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:12,415
Answering his calls for him on his personal cell phone

217
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
Seems absurd to me

218
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:18,815
Most reasonable response to anything

219
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:25,215
It's been going on but nothing that's happened is reasonable

220
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:29,055
I forgot

221
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:35,711
Definition of rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic

222
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:40,319
Cleaning the administration's

223
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:46,719
Better

224
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,999
No

225
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
Secretary

226
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,655
Young

227
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,799
Translucent about sorry

228
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:08,223
I want come on

229
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,271
Because it's really funny that Alex is like

230
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,343
That's f****** hilarious

231
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
But

232
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,671
Like a little

233
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
Thank

234
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,463
God

235
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
This happen

236
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
Alright

237
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,583
He came back from break

238
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,119
Ali's doctor Savage

239
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,911
Michael Savage

240
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,703
Savages mad

241
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:33,055
Furious Alex Jones

242
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,079
Alex come

243
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,639
Back from break and I apologize also

244
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,711
That I don't have an out-of-context drop for this episode

245
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,735
But quite frankly

246
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,783
All of this

247
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,831
I have cut this up

248
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,647
Into about 1 minute second

249
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,951
So it's more digestible

250
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,487
But I want to make this clear

251
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,303
I've not got a single f****** word from the 13 minutes

252
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,583
I have.

253
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,375
Any contacts

254
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,959
I have not ended

255
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,263
Yep that you chopped into one minute

256
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,287
Yes absolutely

257
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,335
Start

258
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,151
I believe me it doesn't stay on this topic for long

259
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:15,807
Collaborator

260
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:29,631
The forwarder

261
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:48,063
I wish well on everybody weather in Israel

262
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,623
Japan

263
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,903
Venezuela

264
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,999
Falling down

265
00:14:59,327 --> 00:14:59,839
Nope

266
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,983
My own personal freedom

267
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:15,199
Also you know how nobody's ever saved a drowning person never

268
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:21,087
Yeah

269
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,623
Like a Miller

270
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:29,023
Fred Miller's relistor

271
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:35,679
People say I'm anti-semitic hello to the Rhythm

272
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,543
When I say George Soros

273
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,695
Anyway

274
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,231
The board important

275
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,511
You were are guitaring

276
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:05,375
This is the second instance on the show

277
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:09,983
That he

278
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,519
He was karaoke

279
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
Along with it song

280
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,871
What is on the show

281
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,455
The show was on

282
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:25,087
Wasn't it wasn't like they were this is what he does every time they go to break is just

283
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:29,695
Karaoke

284
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:32,511
She's just singing along with this song it is awesome

285
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,839
Anything along the lines of

286
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,119
He had to have known

287
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:42,495
There is no he had to notify Airport

288
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,799
I am so Furious

289
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,871
Because I was watching the episode live

290
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,151
I can't wait to cut this clip

291
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,687
I can't wait to get this

292
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,735
I'm not go back to the rebroadcast

293
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:53,759
Big-hearted

294
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,807
So I don't have I don't have

295
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,831
A copy of it

296
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,903
They edited out his karaoke

297
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,695
Karaoke this song

298
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,231
Earlier in the show

299
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,535
He karaoke to Amarillo by Morning

300
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,607
Play George Strait

301
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,983
They come back from break earlier in the show and its Amarillo by Morning

302
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,799
A great song yes

303
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,847
Amarillo by Morning

304
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,871
America

305
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,175
You can tell it cuts because the song Jump

306
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
And he's like

307
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,735
My daughter loves

308
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
You know she's a

309
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,599
She's like why this man doesn't have a time and he's like

310
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,879
Honey it's a story

311
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,671
The song but it's a story

312
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,695
Battleborn

313
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,255
Alright

314
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:41,375
I'm legitimately Furious that I don't have an audio of that

315
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,143
And

316
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,215
If we could get this show to take off and I don't have to have a job

317
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,495
I could just get it live

318
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:52,639
Cuz I want audio that we can play Alex Jones karaoke

319
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:56,223
That is pretty much the Holy Grail

320
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:00,831
Because they didn't want people grabbing a hundred percent

321
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,879
Because what if I show like ours exam

322
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,719
Outsmarted us this time

323
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,023
Baby

324
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:16,447
Schematics for talking so much s*** on very specific Jews and lying about them

325
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,239
Especially in relation to their Judaism

326
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,031
You can't save someone who's drowning

327
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,079
And now again

328
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,639
Anything this is exactly where the next.

329
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,711
You can't save a drowning person

330
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,783
They're trying to call you under push you down

331
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:37,439
German Shepherd is great dog named Knox got hit by car on

332
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:41,279
Where is this song

333
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,887
In fact

334
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
You can take a nap

335
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,239
Friends house with swimming pool

336
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,175
Someone

337
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,991
The pushy wonder when you save them it was that way around

338
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,975
Future for Humanity

339
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,375
You think you can't save a drowning person metaphorically

340
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,447
Let you drown

341
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:27,359
He has an inverse ability to use metaphor

342
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:33,503
Try to make a simile here let me go with the exact opposite of what I'm talking about

343
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,855
And then after he tells the story about the doesn't relate to his point

344
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:41,183
Listen I just want prosperity

345
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,207
Why don't you talk

346
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,023
Don't track

347
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,583
All over the map

348
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,863
Well

349
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,887
That is

350
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,471
At the very least

351
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,311
Oh yeah

352
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
He's not traded for

353
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,359
He's not ready for Trump

354
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,127
Tonight because Mae

355
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:03,455
People's actually pay attention

356
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,735
He's in an abusive relationship

357
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,271
With himself

358
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:12,671
Just keep going back to chop like

359
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,071
Minute clip

360
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,351
Is evidence

361
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,911
Then you can't handle doing his own show anymore

362
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:26,751
And that's why you've been having so many goddamn gifts on lately

363
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,311
He's having Rodger Stone on almost every day

364
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,127
He's having Mike cernovich on all the time

365
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,455
Jerome corsi show up a whole bunch

366
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
Savage

367
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:40,063
He's been on twice in the last two weeks or so that's a big gift for that world

368
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,855
That world of crazy wingding

369
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,159
He's not

370
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,487
Cons of coal

371
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:51,071
This week to really want to call

372
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,607
And I might

373
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,935
I might start Baba Booey

374
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,727
Okay bro

375
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,287
But

376
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,079
I want to make this public statement to

377
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,615
Alex Jones

378
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,895
Stupidest s***

379
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,943
But compared to his callers

380
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:11,295
She is a goddamn genius callers are f******

381
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,855
It's so stupid

382
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:17,440
One lady called in the other day and was like hey

383
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:22,816
They supported Trump I never voted before

384
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,608
I thought this was going to be a big change

385
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,424
Why don't you get that

386
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:34,080
Why don't you

387
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,616
What's wrong

388
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,664
Eddie asked her like

389
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,712
She brings up the idea of this pipeline

390
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,272
You know you want to get to Ron

391
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:46,880
By the Russia can get the oil and what have you

392
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,672
Angie

393
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:51,232
All you do is talk about all this other stuff

394
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:55,328
Are you talk about false flags and all this s*** why did you talk

395
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,632
Alex Jones like man we have covered it

396
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:04,032
Scrambles to find any Improvement

397
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,568
Governor

398
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,360
Just a little clip

399
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:19,136
I don't like so much

400
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,160
I'm into it

401
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,744
Joya

402
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,328
Metafit metaphorically

403
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,960
So this is how this goes on

404
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,752
Let's see what else you want to talk about

405
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:45,760
Yeah how dare you not before Wars

406
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,808
Your corporate shill

407
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:53,184
Fox News

408
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:55,744
Oh no

409
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,816
At least China and North Korea threat

410
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:05,216
All sects of muzzle

411
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:11,616
What's the weather in Payson

412
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,088
The best place in the Middle East

413
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,624
Grab some basic freedom

414
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,464
Huh yeah but the Bulls never recover.

415
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,936
Assaulting people

416
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,776
I don't want to save it.

417
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,360
Didn't that one point be a wonderful place to live

418
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,664
Not

419
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,296
To the point where

420
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:56,928
You know it sounds almost killed as many syrians this week

421
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,536
What

422
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,328
We were so close

423
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,632
He's so close cuz we agreed with them

424
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,704
The beginning

425
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,472
The world war

426
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:17,408
I'm looking at knowledge fight going no we've got two things we agree with him on maybe raise that up to 3

427
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:23,808
Used to be a good place I should change that

428
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,536
You're right correct

429
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,424
Lost my thought I don't know what the first time in 30 episodes

430
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,472
But just completely lost a thought

431
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,264
He's clearly talking about

432
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,592
I wish I seen before we

433
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,128
Regime-change

434
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:52,224
They were a lovely liberal perfect place

435
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,064
All Alex does is talk about nuclear war breaking out

436
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,416
With North Korea and the

437
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:03,744
Fox News World War 3

438
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,512
Hoo-boy

439
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,352
That

440
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,656
Doing it wrong

441
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,216
Yeah

442
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,520
No you guys don't like you want to attack

443
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,544
We have to

444
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,824
Pretend

445
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:24,224
First we got a false flag are not like pretending the sources that are really high level

446
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,784
He keeps also

447
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,088
Sources who are really high-level telling

448
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:34,976
It's just a mash-up of different words when we get into the right-wing areas

449
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,000
Ail

450
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,024
Mix and match

451
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,912
Inside the White House source

452
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,216
About as high up as you can go

453
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,752
No it's

454
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,520
F****** fan

455
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,568
Three would be answering his phone

456
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:54,688
We could have been Gavin with you on this one I think

457
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:57,248
That is exactly how it would be hates pretty

458
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,904
Well yeah that's why he's really mad that previous is answering the phone and giving him information

459
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,208
Is priebus just the fact that.

460
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:06,976
Is this talking to him

461
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:14,912
Yeah I guess so

462
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:19,776
Just because previous answer the phone alright

463
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:20,800
Right whatever

464
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:23,872
The goes on

465
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:29,504
Israel Israel

466
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,808
400 lb

467
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,112
Israel

468
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,440
Is it in

469
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:47,424
A capital

470
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,152
Thousand

471
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:11,488
The princes get billions a year

472
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,096
They got whole cities

473
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:22,240
Whole cities that are air-conditioned

474
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,336
One Refuge

475
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:32,736
Israel

476
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:39,136
Really really doesn't understand the whole israeli-palestine

477
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:42,720
Olympics

478
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,280
Killing Palestinian

479
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:52,192
You're even misunderstand leave the b******* that he's saying

480
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,752
Saudi Arabia is

481
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:55,776
Refuses to take

482
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:56,800
Single

483
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
Refugee

484
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,848
A particular the Syrian refugee

485
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:03,968
Right about the syrians are going to Israel.

486
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,784
What's the Siri

487
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,064
Now they're Palestine

488
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,488
Basically

489
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,024
Was

490
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,792
Giving him

491
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,888
0 sec

492
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:27,520
Saudi foreign Ministry officials claimed that the nation has received nearly 2.5 million.

493
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,544
2011

494
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,408
However the BBC reports that Saudi Arabia has lied in 500,000 Syrian refugees

495
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,432
2011

496
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:38,528
While Arab News reported that Saudi Arabia was already home to 500

497
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,552
Thousand Syrian

498
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,344
Okay

499
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:45,184
What's what's the saying that

500
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,232
Saudi Arabia is lying about

501
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,768
500000

502
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,584
Refugees because they're already

503
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,608
That's an addition

504
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,376
Yes

505
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:59,776
Cerium Turtle rack

506
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,592
Saudi Arabia tell says it's 2.5 million

507
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:08,992
Somewhere between it's not zero

508
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,832
Because it's a million times more than

509
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,136
What we

510
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:15,904
A couple months

511
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,472
Old man Trump

512
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,264
For old man Trump got in the house

513
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,104
We're taking in some

514
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,152
A great mistake in

515
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:43,040
Severe

516
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,064
But now

517
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:51,232
Clocking billions of Prince's getting billions of dollars air condition cities

518
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,304
Attempt

519
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,840
Didn't you say

520
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,888
Like they have three big Erica

521
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,424
Content

522
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,960
That house millions of

523
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,776
He's talking about like refugee camps

524
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,056
It allegedly ran

525
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:08,384
This is something I haven't researched but I don't think is true

526
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:11,200
I can't

527
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,992
But he likes to make the claim

528
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,040
Like Saudi Arabia has the

529
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,600
Giant refugee camps that are air-conditioned

530
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,904
I am just for Giggles they don't let anyone live in

531
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,744
Pretty funny it's a great prank

532
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,304
Pretty funny prank

533
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,840
I should have thought of that

534
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:36,800
That's true I really got to raise a lot of money

535
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,360
I think you thinking of a Spartan

536
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
304

537
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:47,808
Get billions of dollars a year

538
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,208
You just get billions of dollars this year

539
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,744
Saudi Prince

540
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,984
Trump's kids got millions of dollars just for being fake news

541
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,616
Fake news what are they are they just some sort of royalty

542
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,760
We should get rid of the estate

543
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:23,648
Let's just try and keep track of what he's talking about

544
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,184
How this all fits

545
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,488
Like from clip to clip

546
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:32,608
It's going to be very difficult

547
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,680
Even Clause 2 Clause we're dealing with

548
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:39,264
Completely different but I want to keep track of

549
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,920
This is literally there's nothing that like

550
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,456
Okay

551
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,736
I could see Alex

552
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,504
Wishing

553
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,832
Been like sitting here before you came over

554
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:57,440
I just been giggling and taking out all the words that make this make sense

555
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:02,048
I have no time I just got off work

556
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:02,816
Uptown for the

557
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:11,520
Here's here's the next clip and I want to say within about 2 or 3 clips

558
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,800
We're going to get into

559
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,592
Juice City

560
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,384
Juicy stuff

561
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:23,040
But we're still a little bit in the Preamble which is this

562
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:26,624
I called this Manna From Heaven

563
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,648
I'm still

564
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,440
Wait till the dog's name is donk

565
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,208
Not

566
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,704
For Israel

567
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,712
Because I'm not in Israel George Soros

568
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,880
Israel

569
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,120
What what's up where you can see it

570
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,424
Call Jose

571
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,472
EXO

572
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,240
If not

573
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:20,384
For or against Israel previous clips from this very episode

574
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,920
Sure

575
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,200
Jewish newspaper

576
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:33,184
Because he kept talking about the mafia led by George Soros

577
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,232
But they're attacking

578
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,280
Everyday

579
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,304
Everyday

580
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,328
Because

581
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,120
Not

582
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,680
Anti-israel like

583
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,960
Restore

584
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,800
So is he saying that's a Jewish newspaper

585
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,336
No.

586
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,640
Control

587
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,224
Anti-israel

588
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,760
I think

589
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,064
But if you're really trying to track his

590
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,344
That is what he say

591
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,672
I was really trying to do that

592
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,608
For Israel

593
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:20,288
I get to see the

594
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,336
He begins to see

595
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:25,152
Play the Jewish newspapers in Israel

596
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,456
He's not talking about some American Jewish new

597
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,808
Israel attacked him for what

598
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,560
Israel

599
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,400
What is this

600
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:52,032
Which again is an anti-semitic Canard

601
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:55,360
Really screw up as it is old

602
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,408
What do you mean

603
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,968
Well I mean the globalist is

604
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,320
I don't think he gets that

605
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:05,856
I mean

606
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:06,880
That's a good point

607
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,184
I think that he thinks they are different

608
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,464
But they're not

609
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:16,352
I don't think the globalist exist

610
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:24,288
Yo

611
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:31,712
Texas

612
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,760
I love a pixie stick

613
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,856
That's so dumb

614
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,160
But that's unbelievably

615
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:43,232
More to the point I do I mean this just came up

616
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,536
Just now and I

617
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,304
You didn't

618
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,840
Quite understand this premise

619
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,144
But Alex doesn't understand

620
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,680
The globalist

621
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,704
Controlling the world

622
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,104
Is Finley failed anti-Semitism consciously

623
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,872
Anti-Semitic

624
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,664
And that choosing to ignore that

625
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,200
No I don't think he knows

626
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,248
You think he has no idea

627
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,016
No

628
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,576
Based on his inability to read

629
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,392
Based on his complete lack of self-awareness

630
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,208
I think that he read this dumbass book

631
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,488
When he was 12

632
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:19,072
This wild hair up his ass about the globalist

633
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:25,472
He's gone down that road not realizing that every single Cobblestone along the way isn't

634
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,752
You have no idea

635
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,288
He's that dumb

636
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:30,080
He is Mister Magoo

637
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:35,200
He is an intellectual

638
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:35,968
He's become sick

639
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:37,248
Successful you have no idea

640
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,880
Get it and think he gets it

641
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:57,728
Of course and if you were if you were listening to Alex Jones regularly

642
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:02,592
Community

643
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:06,944
The only complaint they really have about him is he's not enough

644
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,832
Man

645
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,112
If he

646
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,416
Were George Soros

647
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,512
Seen the two of them in the same

648
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,560
No

649
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:26,912
There would be a f****** dinner party

650
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,728
The worst

651
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:33,568
Like a drawing-room mystery dinner party

652
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:42,784
By the end of this night

653
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:47,136
They're trying to get Alex to shut up didn't work

654
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,928
Is Neptune

655
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,512
Incentive to kill dad

656
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,816
You did not you are not the murderer

657
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:55,840
Yeah

658
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:05,568
Despite all this convoluted nonsense and being a complete idiot would you need to know I do know that

659
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,176
Busy as a man

660
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,456
Principles

661
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:21,184
Conscience

662
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:27,584
Official song

663
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,168
Going on

664
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,384
Marshall running line

665
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:44,736
But I want to do cuz the flesh I'm guilty for that

666
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:49,088
I think you're talking about hookers

667
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:55,488
The Flash

668
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:59,840
What is that

669
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,656
He's telling a lot of truth I don't think he wants

670
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:05,984
What's the talus by my conscience

671
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,008
Sometimes

672
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,056
My conscience is so strong

673
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,616
That I have to do things that are bad for my family

674
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,640
What the f***

675
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:18,272
Hey sometimes I get tempted by the flesh

676
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,064
I've done something wrong I feel bad about

677
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,112
Like Vapor multiple abortion

678
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,952
That's being a coward

679
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,232
What is the weather

680
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,000
I don't know

681
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:40,288
Impact for multiple abortions

682
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,568
Yes because

683
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:45,152
Yells about responsibility

684
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:52,064
F***** up that is f***** up more evidence of my argument absolutely no self-aware

685
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:55,648
So the idea that you wouldn't know he's being a big anti-semite

686
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,536
And if he's

687
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:05,888
He's always

688
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:10,496
But you know what my conscience sometimes tells me I've got to pay a lady for sex

689
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,776
She's got to go to school

690
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:15,104
Education should not pay for college

691
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,872
Wow

692
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:21,248
You're not doing the right thing you are an absolute hero

693
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,528
Nobody nobody

694
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,296
Mila

695
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,320
Prostitute

696
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:30,464
Damn that's who is without Dan what would they do

697
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,280
I prefer not to use

698
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,072
I apologize sex-worker

699
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,632
I just wanted to make that clear lonely

700
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,680
I just don't want some

701
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,448
Take me out of

702
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,728
Like everyone else

703
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:48,128
Contacts all the time

704
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:52,992
Great Clip of heaping

705
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,808
The compulsion to lie about him is strong

706
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,928
Cell phone

707
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,512
100 bus newspapers a day

708
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,328
Everyday sometimes 1000 there's papers

709
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,864
Thousand

710
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:19,360
Every major NBC ABC CBS NBC affiliate

711
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,480
Weak-minded people on the street

712
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:28,832
It don't know that's a lot I got to sit there and watch them to stain me and everything

713
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:35,744
It doesn't hurt me when they're hating me because of my Hugo

714
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:39,328
It hurts him so bad about your victim

715
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,864
This is gone

716
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,288
How many clips that was number seven not keeping my not all of them are a minute-long

717
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,080
4 minutes into the clip

718
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,640
We're only four minutes into the club

719
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:59,039
VSCO places you could not possibly already I'm already gone through a weird emotional rollercoaster

720
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:05,951
Billionaires Arabia

721
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:08,511
Air-conditioned tent

722
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:12,351
Jewish newspapers are attacking him

723
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:17,983
He's got no positive or negative stance on Israel he does have a pro-israel stance

724
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,639
Wild little bit because he

725
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,407
Feels like

726
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,687
And don't feel it

727
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:43,071
Realized

728
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,351
It's so crazy

729
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:51,007
It's it's absolutely it's so delicious everybody thinks they're the hero

730
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:59,199
I mean everybody but some people got another the villain

731
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:07,135
Even if

732
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:07,903
Navigation

733
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,207
He has to be megalomaniacal and say

734
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:16,095
Sometimes every newspaper in the country I did some research on it actually

735
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,631
In terms of daily newspaper

736
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:22,239
20 / 1,331 Daily newspaper

737
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:28,639
In the United States

738
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,407
Daily newspapers

739
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:34,527
Have a cup

740
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:38,111
Well the New York Times Did you that profile

741
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:38,879
That's one

742
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,671
And then we got

743
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,975
Washington Post Maybe

744
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:45,023
Snapchat

745
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:50,143
Austin Chronicle

746
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,935
No sir

747
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
I think it is

748
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,495
Toronto Maple Leafs

749
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:55,775
Maybe

750
00:43:56,031 --> 00:44:02,175
We do not know where hockey although congratulations on a Cubs season starting by the way

751
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,479
Has nothing to do with anything

752
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,343
Get to our absolute

753
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,111
Globalist

754
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:15,743
Even though even though

755
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,023
If they did the Ricketts

756
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,327
Rickets is a disease

757
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,399
Right

758
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,167
Anyway

759
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:26,239
There's no way a hundred newspapers a day are talking about

760
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,775
There's no way

761
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,871
Perception of Victor

762
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,175
Everything is intact

763
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,199
You always under it

764
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,735
Paranoia

765
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,759
Combined with

766
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,807
That's kind of megaloman

767
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:42,623
Maybe it's not just said

768
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,647
People are attached

769
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:44,927
He's a victim of

770
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:48,255
Tire system

771
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,303
Which gives

772
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,071
Him that info

773
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,095
Flavored important

774
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:52,863
Instead he wants

775
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,631
So badly

776
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,911
Describe

777
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,215
That sort of thing is I kind of mental illness

778
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,239
That's probably

779
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,519
Would probably describe

780
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,079
Paranoid

781
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,615
Interesting

782
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:07,967
This is going to make this trip a little bit uncomfortable

783
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,015
I think about

784
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:12,831
Whatever you like to be that them cuz they're slaves

785
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,791
Austin Texas

786
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,839
Is a big shot a homeless people

787
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,143
You're the city dun run them off

788
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:30,495
They got rid of mental institutions like 20-30 years so there's

789
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:33,055
Schizophrenic and people all over the streets

790
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:35,871
Almost every major four-way stop

791
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:41,759
Downtown Austin

792
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:46,111
And there's a whacked-out asking for money

793
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,439
I don't get by a con artist so they're out there

794
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:54,047
Listen to relax or whatever a diabetic I am somebody but I see those kids running

795
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,143
There had an argument for themselves

796
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,679
The wind

797
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:00,703
Cheese's

798
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,055
That is

799
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:07,359
If you were self-aware he would have

800
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,127
Have to have been like

801
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,407
Their butt

802
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,943
For the grace of God go I

803
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:15,295
I am so much like these people so tone-deaf

804
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:17,855
Those.

805
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:22,719
No doubt everyone is being brainwashed

806
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:26,815
By the media think I'm a liar everyone

807
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,607
I feel bad

808
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,423
Because they are so misleading

809
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,471
So to make myself feel better

810
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:37,055
I go it I go and look at

811
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:45,759
He gives away

812
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,367
Not

813
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:54,463
So are you really

814
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,255
They do know their own

815
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:59,327
He's talking a big game about how

816
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,143
Fix the VIR the homeless problem is in Austin Texas

817
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:02,911
If I pulled up some

818
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:03,679
Statistics

819
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:07,775
The number one city in America for homeless population is

820
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,543
New York

821
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:11,871
70 5323 the last

822
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,639
Count

823
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:18,015
Surrounding county is 41000

824
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,039
94 go down to

825
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:19,807
Chicago

826
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,599
That's like seven on the list.

827
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,903
6786

828
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,183
Just too many

829
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:28,767
So

830
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:32,095
Austin is smaller town I think

831
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:32,863
Relatively

832
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:36,703
Urban Center City

833
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:40,031
Temperature the climate is much better than Chicago

834
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:47,711
Homeless population

835
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,759
Where we are far more regularly

836
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:50,783
In contact with

837
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,599
The mentally ill about them shutting down

838
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,367
Mental hospital

839
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,159
The part of town that I live in

840
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,463
They say ROM did shutdown

841
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,255
Palmetto hospital around here

842
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:03,327
And it spits absolute

843
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:10,239
It goes all the way.

844
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,799
I can understand what you saying

845
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:16,127
In terms of experience this wandering around and seeing

846
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:18,175
The tragedy of Life gone wrong

847
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,479
I don't use that as self-care

848
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,295
That's not how I make myself feel better

849
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,063
If you are asked

850
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,343
The phrenic the made it out

851
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,391
I don't think I still would

852
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,927
I think

853
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:33,279
Kind of Econo like that small-town homeboy story except for adults

854
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,327
They look at Alex

855
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,375
A boy jungle

856
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:43,519
Bizarre to me

857
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,055
But that's his response

858
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:45,823
What's the feeling

859
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,847
Mentally ill homeless

860
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,383
Is like

861
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,919
Hey you know what

862
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,735
Feel better about the

863
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,783
Rest of the body

864
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:59,647
I guess you explain in the other rest

865
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,439
Let that play and then we can

866
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,207
Get back to this

867
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,511
I realized

868
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,559
Here I am conscious

869
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,607
Aware of your political systems

870
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:13,471
Did the Saints know probably nobody else is

871
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:21,151
Every now at deeper I go

872
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,455
The connections the discernment

873
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,503
The trust I have a people

874
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,551
Only intensifies

875
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,183
Alameda public

876
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:37,023
Schizophrenic

877
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:40,607
Mia Restaurant

878
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,167
My class has had

879
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,703
The basement kid

880
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:49,567
What

881
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:52,383
I did not get up now and take them

882
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,407
Down

883
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,967
Cuz I realized

884
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,415
Does that make it better

885
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:08,767
Does he think these things are actually happening

886
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:14,399
Does he think these thoughts or connect

887
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,167
Did he

888
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,447
Okay

889
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,799
Go to a restaurant

890
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,335
With him and his family

891
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,103
Anarchist

892
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,663
I can't

893
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:29,247
It's within the realm of possible but it's very unlikely

894
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,551
He wasn't hit on the back of the head

895
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:32,575
At the beach

896
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:41,791
Imma kick your ass Alex Jones

897
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:56,127
Marcus Barrow

898
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,711
G over the dick

899
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:08,159
Americans supporting Trump is like

900
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:15,071
In my mind on the list number 8

901
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:17,119
Really rank

902
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,215
If he

903
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,335
Yeah

904
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,127
Really convinced

905
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:32,223
Things actually happen I imagine he was out of the restaurant someone bumped into him

906
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:35,551
Like he knocked over glass accidentally and he took it as like

907
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:46,559
With the frisbee

908
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:49,119
That's my new Gabriel of golf

909
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,911
He loves extreme

910
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,191
Pennywise

911
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:57,311
I also want to say to that clip doesn't make his dance on

912
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,335
Viewing the Manta

913
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,103
Toledo any better

914
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,639
No no

915
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:04,223
It provides more ammunition for him being person

916
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:08,063
Everyone

917
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,343
This but me

918
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,951
Like a person without mental illness

919
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:23,935
Jon rappoport so he can tell them that the dsm-4 isn't real

920
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:30,335
No don't worry that you fit this diagnosis

921
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,871
More time let's just go down the list

922
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:32,639
You tell me which thing

923
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:37,759
Okay persistent feelings of paranoia and everybody's out tonight

924
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:43,647
Oh that's not off we're not off to a good start

925
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:50,303
Even in this scenario Rappaport

926
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:59,775
Number one

927
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:07,455
How is Alex

928
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:10,271
Years that they did not hung up

929
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:13,087
Maybe more importantly why is this driving

930
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:28,447
The better microphone that doesn't like

931
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,983
Totally showcases

932
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:36,383
I don't care. Do you like the headset

933
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,407
I got it cool

934
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,199
Is it

935
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:43,039
It takes

936
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,319
Enhance

937
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,367
To put this whole set

938
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:51,999
Together it's possible

939
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,047
Like the set decorator from the atom

940
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,351
Who's just like

941
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:57,375
How do we make

942
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,143
This room looking

943
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,167
But Mordecai

944
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:01,471
Just slightly off

945
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,239
And unhung

946
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,287
Have you super weird

947
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:11,711
This is the closest that we come to you and I being like on Mystery Science Theater

948
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:16,319
Driven nuts by John Rapport not having no painting

949
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,367
How do I hang it up Rappaport

950
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,071
This clip

951
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,607
Is about to take a turn

952
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,655
That you cannot possibly four

953
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,703
Of course not

954
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:35,519
Crying after

955
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:36,287
Again

956
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,615
Okay

957
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:41,663
Alex was just talkin about

958
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,967
Who doesn't want to beat up people

959
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:45,503
Who are dumb

960
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:49,343
No

961
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:53,183
I guess I don't know

962
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:56,767
Evidence

963
00:54:57,023 --> 00:55:01,375
You certainly emotionally and verbally

964
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,655
Especially these refugees

965
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,311
Hold onto your f******

966
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:10,847
Cuz this is weird

967
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,407
I'll take this

968
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:19,039
Pollo Dominican everybody else been holding my Patriots

969
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,367
I realize something

970
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:26,975
Fundamental are species on this planet

971
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:27,999
Oh f***

972
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:32,863
The species is destroyed

973
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,447
Natural disaster

974
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:39,263
Species

975
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:42,591
Everything I survived this is Troy

976
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,639
That's not the crazy part

977
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:47,199
Does not

978
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,527
I just wanted to stop there

979
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,551
To point out that he

980
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:56,415
Just realized

981
00:55:56,927 --> 00:56:00,511
Willits thought about that

982
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:03,839
Greece

983
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,119
Remember

984
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:11,007
Yeah the world ends.

985
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:13,567
Do you think he thinks his listen

986
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,871
Maybe he's trying to blow mine

987
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:19,711
I think that's more along with people I think

988
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:21,247
He knows I think he's

989
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:24,319
He feels like he's the only person who knew that

990
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:28,671
You idiots

991
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:30,719
Threatening nuclear war

992
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,071
Everybody

993
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:45,823
I imagined him as the fake deep guy in a smoker Central okay

994
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,103
Horizon

995
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:50,943
The world end

996
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:52,735
All history

997
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:56,063
Dallas

998
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,343
Dogs

999
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:58,879
30 super f***** up

1000
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,671
Because again

1001
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:07,839
We've been talkin about Saudi Arabia having air-conditioned tent Israel

1002
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,471
Everybody lies about Alex all the time

1003
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:16,031
This is so weird

1004
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:16,799
There we go

1005
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:20,127
It's up for me worrying a

1006
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:23,711
Long-term War

1007
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:28,831
Yep

1008
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:32,671
We got to leave okay

1009
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,695
Alright

1010
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:39,839
Now I see what's happening now I see what's happening

1011
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,143
Is obvious

1012
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:47,263
We put we connected all the dots with that one sentence

1013
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:51,615
Everything makes sense everything makes perfect sense

1014
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:52,895
We have to

1015
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:55,199
Destroy the planet we're on

1016
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:57,759
To give us

1017
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:00,063
Proper motivation to get off

1018
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,343
And spread throughout the Universe

1019
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:04,927
Destroy the planet we're on somebody

1020
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:07,231
But come to power who will

1021
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,255
You still at 8

1022
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:15,679
Yeah but that's not out

1023
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:17,727
No no no no no no I don't think so

1024
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:20,287
No I don't think so either but he doesn't know that he's

1025
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,311
Upon

1026
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:27,711
Elsa

1027
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,575
$5 fiddle

1028
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:34,879
To get off this

1029
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:38,463
Wow

1030
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:39,743
Ourselves

1031
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,047
The global time

1032
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:48,447
I don't know cuz he always talks about the globalist

1033
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:51,263
He's afraid that they're going to go to space

1034
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:53,055
Elysium

1035
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:55,103
Because he loves movies

1036
00:58:57,407 --> 00:59:00,479
I think they talked about that

1037
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,575
I mean

1038
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:07,903
Fast track at all

1039
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,439
It's time

1040
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,207
Listen

1041
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:14,559
Get your ass tomorrow

1042
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:17,631
Therapy

1043
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:20,191
Put your you agree with me right I mean like

1044
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:28,639
No he is just all the time

1045
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:35,039
On the cusp of a break

1046
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:40,159
This is his brain kind of spinning around like a like a washing machine

1047
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:42,975
He's on the cusp of figuring something out

1048
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,559
This is Alex Jones

1049
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:51,679
He's had to talk to that lady on the phone that I told you about earlier and Buckley

1050
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,959
His producers going

1051
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:58,847
I got nothing to do

1052
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:03,199
Talk weird about how much victim and then talk about space I guess

1053
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:07,807
You and you just ripping straight off the Dome

1054
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:11,391
I don't know cuz I know I know where all this goes

1055
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:14,207
I don't think

1056
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:18,303
Started it was talking about

1057
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,583
That's not how it ends

1058
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:27,007
Middle

1059
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:27,775
Paper B

1060
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,311
But like I don't

1061
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:31,615
I don't know I don't know I'm listen to this

1062
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:34,175
I don't know what the point is

1063
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,711
I know how it is

1064
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:36,735
I don't know

1065
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,183
Who's leading up to

1066
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:47,231
We need to steal billions of dollars

1067
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,559
We need to use them

1068
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:53,119
To stop the Israeli globalist newspaper

1069
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:57,727
I'm criticizing Alex Jones

1070
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,519
What do you build an air-conditioned tent

1071
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:00,799
Spaceships

1072
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:07,967
Planet

1073
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:16,415
Shoot the whole message to Alex I'm not to look at him anymore that's not what he said I'm putting

1074
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,279
Does Netflix

1075
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:26,655
To get off the planet

1076
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,935
It's award

1077
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,031
Made me so bummed out

1078
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,335
And it might be an explanation

1079
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:36,127
Super some of his toxic masculinity

1080
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:37,151
Unfortunately

1081
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,455
F*** is that big fat

1082
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,039
Plants beautiful I love it

1083
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:44,831
Just like I love mine

1084
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,415
Mommy when I was 6 years old all God

1085
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:50,975
6 years old she kicked me off for lap

1086
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:56,095
You don't get any more love

1087
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:01,983
That's coming out soon

1088
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,775
Oh you just figured it out

1089
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:13,503
We just got the we just got the flashback he's everything to Rosetta Stone

1090
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:15,807
That's like the

1091
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:22,207
Whatever they do serial killer background that's always the moment where you like

1092
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:30,143
I don't know if that was one incident that happened to his mom was like

1093
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:32,959
You don't get love no more you don't to be a mama's boy

1094
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,287
She said you don't get love

1095
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,359
He said she said those exact

1096
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:43,711
Zach makes you think that it's probably an actual memory

1097
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,759
Yeah using a

1098
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:46,527
Like

1099
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:49,087
A line of dialogue of hers

1100
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:51,647
And he's not being over spinel releases

1101
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,695
Specific like he normally does when he's

1102
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,023
I remember I was

1103
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,071
Choose

1104
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:03,935
Dress right

1105
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,471
Chair rocking back and forth

1106
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,495
Dementia

1107
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:11,615
And I think that long pause is more ineffective

1108
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,407
Say that

1109
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:17,247
Actually really emotion

1110
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:19,295
Then that's another indication that something

1111
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,063
Thing is b*******

1112
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,599
Is money starts fake crying

1113
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,367
Stuff like that

1114
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:24,415
She's not overtly like

1115
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:27,487
I watch the video he's not overly likes Pig crying like

1116
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:31,583
Play song about

1117
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:32,351
Now that's

1118
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:34,911
What happened

1119
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,191
Really bad for you

1120
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:37,727
Yeah that's that's

1121
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:38,495
That's a

1122
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:41,567
Peter likes

1123
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:46,687
My mom was not the most attentive to my needs and what have you

1124
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,991
But she wasn't nearly that

1125
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,015
Like

1126
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:56,415
I am I'm still dealing with it as a thirty-two-year-old time like I'm still in therapy talking about how

1127
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,183
My mom was

1128
01:03:57,439 --> 01:04:02,559
Way too distant

1129
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:05,887
I'll be real with it

1130
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:15,871
I really

1131
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,919
No it's fine

1132
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:22,527
They feel uncomfortable

1133
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:25,343
Jordans

1134
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:34,047
That's always the best answer I have no f****** idea who knows

1135
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:36,607
Definitely had at least

1136
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,375
Emotional abuse

1137
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:39,935
And you know he's

1138
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:41,215
Clearly Hero Wars

1139
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,495
His dad who's a

1140
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,519
CIA dentist

1141
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:44,543
Have some sort

1142
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,591
And so it kind of makes sense

1143
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,127
A lot of these really

1144
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:53,247
And and about masculinity

1145
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,039
And the idea that

1146
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:57,599
His maternal figure would be like

1147
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:59,647
Don't be a p**** you're a man

1148
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:00,927
That reinforces even

1149
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,975
Further all of these masculinity

1150
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:06,303
I can't imagine

1151
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,583
Although

1152
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,351
I dunno

1153
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:10,143
The one is mom threw him off of lake that was a

1154
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:13,727
Which is

1155
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:19,615
Maybe Alex Jones you started you should have started relating to your mother

1156
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:21,407
Read military history

1157
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,199
What did she like

1158
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,391
Probably a lot nicer

1159
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,415
We could ever have

1160
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:40,863
Alex is such a liar

1161
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:47,007
I have no idea

1162
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:51,871
Call Evergreen weather is Mom was the perpetrator of

1163
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:52,895
Some sort of child to be

1164
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,175
Adamstown

1165
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:57,759
He was younger or not I don't know

1166
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:01,599
So regardless of our reality

1167
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:03,903
Has very little bearing on this show.

1168
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:08,255
Is the weather

1169
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,023
Something

1170
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:12,607
Cuz that you don't you don't come on are on your f******

1171
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:17,727

Lego goosebumps

1173
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:22,847
Specific

1174
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:28,735
So you don't get love no more

1175
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:34,111
You would remember that I bet if a neighbor's parent told you that you might complete it in your brain

1176
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:37,439
There's all sorts of

1177
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:43,583
Or grandma or something like that

1178
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,607
This whole time

1179
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:47,167
Breakfast

1180
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:47,935
Okay

1181
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:48,959
Theory

1182
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:49,983
I'm listening

1183
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:50,751
His mom

1184
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,031

1185

In childbirth

1186
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:56,127
So he is always had this

1187
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:56,895
Resentment

1188
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,943
Women for not being around

1189
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,479
He was raised by a

1190
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:03,039
You taught how to do all of the

1191
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:05,343

Yep very much

1194
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:19,423
Is bad when actually married

Humans

1198
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:38,111
Cannot even imagine what is in store for us

1199
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:38,879
Chimeras

1200
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:42,719

We have to escape this test

1206
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:58,335
Destroy ourselves

1207
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,175
The other test

1208
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,551
I'm not sure what that mean

1209
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,343
You don't escape

1210
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:16,511
So we have to stay

1211
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:18,559
Yeah

1212
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,119
No no

1213
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,423
If we destroy ourselves

1214
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:26,239

I can't it's 40 seconds long

1218
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:48,255
Our destiny

01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:51,327
That's right now

1220
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,631

Humans

1222
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:59,263
Cannot even imagine what is the score for us

1223
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:03,359
What are successful

1224
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,639
What did he just say

1225
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:05,663
Spider-Man

1226
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,431
Humans

1227
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:09,503
Imagine

1228
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:15,135
Humans cannot imagine what is the store for us

1229
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:18,207
But I've noticed about him a lot is

1230
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:21,535
Like whatever but

1231
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:26,655
He makes me really mad a lot of time cuz he has some similarities to like Dusty Rhodes

1232
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,703
I love Dusty Rhodes

1233
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:34,079
They are not ham

1234
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:34,847
I like

1235
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:40,735
It kind of makes me think of a hard time from oh we're just arose

1236
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:43,295
Rate

1237
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,063
He's a working

1238
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,343
In class hero

1239
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,879
He's everything I love

Text Luther

1244
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:03,263
The verbal symbols

1245
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,823
Yeah I'm pretty sure it's just everybody from

1246
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:06,847
That's what they say

1247
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:11,711
As the heroes

1248
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:13,247
Play the Cornerstone

1249
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:16,063
Everything we do after this

1250
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,599
That is unlimited

1251
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:20,415
We have to escape this test

1252
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:22,975
That is literally the definition of

1253
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,071
Every generation

1254
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:29,631
Is

1255
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:32,191
Looked back upon as being

1256
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,263
The Cornerstone for what happened

1257
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,287
Time for the Next Generation

1258
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:42,687
The set the table for the present

1259
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:45,503
Like this till we make it

1260
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:46,783
They'll still be like

1261
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:47,807
You know that got soccer

1262
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:48,575
Pretty cool

1263
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:54,975
Maybe let's go with Galileo

1264
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:57,279
I've lost track of what you're saying

1265
01:10:57,535 --> 01:11:00,607
Because I'm excited about what about

1266
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:04,703
Figure out how he thinks history

1267
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:07,007
Time is a circle

1268
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:08,287
He watched

1269
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,823
You know what I think he's watched her.

1270
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:14,943
From Texas right now

1271
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:21,343
I mean the other has all his beliefs about the elite sex rings and what-have-you certainly matches.

1272
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:23,135
Anyway

1273
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:25,951
Actually is not what I'm super excited about but

1274
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:28,767
Sees it through

1275
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,559
Foxy's it like

1276
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:31,583
Sex workers

1277
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:37,727
Right now I don't remember

1278
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:40,799
Lindsey Graham socks

1279
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:42,591
Instagram people like

1280
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:47,455
John McCain they want temporal power

1281
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:56,927
Instead of chivalry honor and building something true

1282
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:59,231
Because others won't stab you in the back

1283
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:03,583
But because you're going to Trailblazer plant the path the future

1284
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:09,215
Is interesting because f*** is he talking about

1285
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:14,079
Isn't it interesting that you stammer in kind of

1286
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:19,455
Screwing up words and more than when he's drunk

1287
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,479
Stop.

1288
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:21,759
He said

1289
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:26,623
We will be the ones who have laid the foundation reset Blade the foundation

1290
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:28,415
He f***** up a word in that sentence

1291
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:30,463
His insane like when he's drunk

1292
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:31,999
Very clear

1293
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:39,679
I mean it does go back to my argument

1294
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,959
Just filling time

1295
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:42,495
Someone

1296
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:46,079
Cancel

1297
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:47,871
I don't want to go back to the collars

1298
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:49,919
No we're not.

1299
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:58,623
I really just got worried that his name wasn't

1300
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,671
That cuz it sounds so stupid

1301
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:05,791
Ziering away from Trump

1302
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:07,327
Oh know what's going on

1303
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:14,751
Karaoke but then I'm going to talk nonsense

1304
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:21,151
Yeah that's all

1305
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:23,967
I know built this up

1306
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:26,527
Velvet up this next clip up quite a bit

1307
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:27,295
Yes

1308
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:31,391
Don't say a word over this club

1309
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:34,463
And we're already I could already sensitive

1310
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:39,071
Cuz I'm going to just stare at your face

1311
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,631
Cuz I cuz I want to

1312
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:43,935
Try and sent the exact moment

1313
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:46,495
That you realize what he's talkin

1314
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:49,055
Because it's on clearance

1315
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:51,103
But then it becomes clear

1316
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:52,639
And you will

1317
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:57,759
Revel invisible

1318
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:00,575
Might be a slight indication that he listens to wash

1319
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:03,135
Or

1320
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:05,183
It's possible he seen one of our

1321
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,719
One of the two

1322
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:07,743
Okay

1323
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,535
Oh man.

1324
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:13,631
North Korea of the things that are happening

1325
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:15,167
You can see

1326
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:17,215
How much danger does planet is in

1327
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:30,783
That's why I get guilty when I get angry or say things tongue-in-cheek

1328
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,831
My dog dies

1329
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:35,647
My dog just died the night before

1330
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:37,695
Blunt

1331
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,743
Rosemount

1332
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:41,791
The story

1333
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:48,191
My dog has died the night before I've been up all night long bury the next day my parents they were on vacation was there doggies be my dog's tail

1334
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:53,567
A h playing that a heart attack died

1335
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:56,127
Aneurysm whatever was blood coming out

1336
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:04,319
That should have gone to work that day and I shouldn't have been up that night either Ian or at work

1337
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:08,927
Call me Russian agent find you another.

1338
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:11,487
That was me just sad about my dog

1339
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:15,583
A trip that somebody calling me stuff I'm not that they really make me that mad

1340
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:29,151
Here's the here's the even crazier whenever he said he had to beat his

1341
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:32,991
Well

1342
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:34,527
Cuz you don't

1343
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:39,391
So he said instead of him

1344
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:42,975
Yeah he was just sad over his parents.

1345
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:44,767
Heart attack

1346
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:49,631
Is that what happens when I think not

1347
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:52,703
I don't think it is either

1348
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:57,311
I don't understand the visual

1349
01:15:57,567 --> 01:16:01,407
Drunk for 2 hours again

1350
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:04,991
I have pictures of the cup but he's drinking out of

1351
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:12,671
Power Tower

1352
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:19,071
I've never seen

1353
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:26,495
Breaking news exclusive email when Alex Jones

1354
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:33,407
Or drunk because you said about his dog I would totally fine

1355
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:39,807
Totally fine as long as he owns up a my dog. Only thing that

1356
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:40,575
With him

1357
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:45,183
The truth in there is I shouldn't have gone to work

1358
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:49,279
Really good boy

1359
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,815
He wasn't going to work

1360
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:57,215
No special report he didn't have to do that.

1361
01:16:57,727 --> 01:17:01,311
Also when he says it was at 11 at night he's lying

1362
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,919
In the middle of

1363
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:08,223
2 hours earlier than

1364
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:14,623
No that is kind of like I've been up all day

1365
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:19,487
And now it's 11:45

1366
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:22,047
Yeah so you want a timestamp

1367
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:27,423
No I don't even have a dog

1368
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:31,007
Cat dude.

1369
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:34,079
My point is what I hear that

1370
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:35,871
Holyshit

1371
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,663
I got so excited

1372
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:39,199
Cuz this is

1373
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,735
Minute of

1374
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:44,063
Tangential nonsense unrelated to anything

1375
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:45,087
I bet he says

1376
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:46,879
The world is in danger

1377
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,183
A long pause

1378
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:54,303
Crazy locked and then I looked at you because you were

1379
01:17:54,815 --> 01:18:00,447
Because you had this weird Rhythm thing where every second you were turning your head a little bit

1380
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:03,775
Because of my hair

1381
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:05,823
Forever

1382
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:12,223
Shouldn't have gone to work that everything

1383
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:13,247
Heat

1384
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:19,647
Talkin about

1385
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:36,031
Ways to work clip there's no f****** way that's

1386
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:39,615
I mean it

1387
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:46,271
Recognition of his own mortality

1388
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:53,951
Yeah we might emotional we might have more

1389
01:18:55,487 --> 01:19:01,631
But also the idea

1390
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:02,399
Grizzly like Jesus

1391
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,423
Describing it is

1392
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:06,495
That totally makes sense I get it

1393
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:09,311
I get it

1394
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:13,151
If you're sad about your dog and then you start

1395
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:13,919
Screaming

1396
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:17,247
Obscenity cuz the gloves are off and then you get homophobic

1397
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:22,879
You talk about wanting to sell your car and then misaligned Muslims at 9 a.m.

1398
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:28,767
That's the part that really should have been in

1399
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:31,071
Ears

1400
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,375
No more Americana

1401
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:37,471
Who wasn't great is it

1402
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:44,127
There was a link to that episode

1403
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:50,271
Carlos Beltran

1404
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:54,623
Rarely used

1405
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:56,671
Coward just own up to it

1406
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:59,231
Well but imagine if he said

1407
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:04,095
I wouldn't respect him so much more

1408
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:04,863
Listeners

1409
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,655
Who's to say

1410
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:07,935
That's a good

1411
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:14,592
A pound

1412
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:21,248
Krowd

1413
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,808
He's so into this weird

1414
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:26,112
Version of Christianity in like

1415
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:27,136
Demon

1416
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:29,952
And what have you if he wants to try and use it

1417
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:32,768
I could see him by cuz we're never going to let

1418
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:34,048
VSCO

1419
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:36,608
It's so well documented

1420
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:42,752
If you were to Twisted he could defeat Us by being like a problem with alcohol

1421
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:45,056
You know the Lord is helping me with her

1422
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:47,360
You can win over even more people

1423
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:49,920
In the same way that is we said he has a problem with

1424
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:50,688
Sex workers

1425
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:53,760
Temptations of the

1426
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:56,576
The Flash The Flash

1427
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:58,880
The Flash

1428
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:00,160
Speak

1429
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:06,304
Anyway

1430
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:08,608
I think you now realize why

1431
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:10,656
Needed

1432
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,496
When I was walking home

1433
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:15,520
From the Train

1434
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:17,056
Yeah I heard that

1435
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:22,432
I heard this I literally yelled holyshit down the street

1436
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:26,272
You a******

1437
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:29,088
You f****** a****** Alex

1438
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,392
He does not go more into his dog

1439
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:32,416
But

1440
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:36,000
He does say something at the end of this clip that I really want to get into

1441
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,632
Yes please

1442
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:46,240
There's a very good chance

1443
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,104
There's a very good chance we're having to Clearwater

1444
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,408
And it's six million people are going to die

1445
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:57,760
Foxes world record

1446
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,392
What radiation poisoning farm-raised

1447
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,184
But they're going to survive

1448
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:10,304
The Bible says the planet will be killed

1449
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,584
Look up in the Bible

1450
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:18,240
Just a little guilty that I don't have a flash

1451
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:21,312
Convince my family

1452
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:24,896
Disease

1453
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:27,200
Family to go to space

1454
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:28,224
No

1455
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:31,040
He's going to he's going to talk a little bit more about it in the neck

1456
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:31,808
Clip

1457
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:34,368
But what he specifically talking about

1458
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,184
Yeah I know

1459
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,488
But what I want to take away from that

1460
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:40,512
I think is more important

1461
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:42,816
Is that his family doesn't believe him

1462
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:48,704
He is crazy

1463
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:55,104
Stop problem

1464
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,152
This time he is right

1465
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:59,712
No

1466
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:03,808
I cried wolf

1467
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:10,208
My fears think he could be right and that in terms of the global situation

1468
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:12,000
My more rational brain

1469
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:13,280
Knows that wheel

1470
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:15,072
Most likely deescalate.

1471
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:17,888
That before it happens

1472
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:20,960
Surprise a lot

1473
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:23,008
No I I would have said that

1474
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,032
A year ago

1475
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:34,016
The gloves are off Thunderdome and the gloves being off means we're all going to die

1476
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,064
Yeah

1477
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:39,136
I think more specifically what I'm saying is

1478
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:40,672
If I have to choose between

1479
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:43,232
Trusting Alex or his family

1480
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:44,512
I got to go

1481
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:48,608
That's a tough nut

1482
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:49,376
To crack right there

1483
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,472
That again

1484
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:56,288
His spouse chose to be with him

1485
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:59,104
Typical

1486
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:00,384
I don't know

1487
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:02,688
It's his personal life is very

1488
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:05,248
Tough to disentangle

1489
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,552
There's a lot of stuff that I have no idea

1490
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:10,624
Of course not really that important to me what I mean is

1491
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:17,024
Woman did choose to be with them and now I don't know if that means I can trust her

1492
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,560
One will ever loved either of us

1493
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:21,632
Certainly not me

1494
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:26,752
No crazier

1495
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:36,224
Three-bedroom in my parents house, I'm not a little bit more

1496
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,248
About

1497
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:39,552
I believe they heading

1498
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:41,600
When was Mexico

1499
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:43,904
How many tries to get he tries to

1500
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:44,928
Poetic

1501
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,976
I think he realizes and pick it up

1502
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:48,512
10 minutes

1503
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:51,840
I've been all over the map of got to try

1504
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:53,376
And get a little poetic

1505
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,008
Just a normal guy

1506
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,032
Throwback

1507
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,848
Michael Savage

1508
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:15,136
Then we just

1509
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:25,376
Where we going to look at those are seeking power

1510
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,496
You never even had thought

1511
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:34,336
Functionaries

1512
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:38,176
A corporate

1513
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:39,456
Hungry

1514
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,504
Seeking creature

1515
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:45,344
Directed by millions of souls are unconscious just

1516
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:51,744
Looking for salvation in believing that I dive down some rap

1517
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:57,632
Find absolute Nirvana

1518
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:59,424
Twilight of the Gods

1519
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:05,056
What is the end of humanity

1520
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,200
Zoe

1521
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:13,760
Go from

1522
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,296
Hico from there's a

1523
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:17,088
Nuclear Winters

1524
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:18,624
We don't want

1525
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:22,464
Do you know why

1526
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,488
We like having friends

1527
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,512
And restaurant

1528
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:28,352
Restaurants regular regular

1529
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:30,656
We like going out to restaurants be like

1530
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:33,728
Every single time

1531
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:36,032
I'd like when he talks about going to get a meatball sub

1532
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:37,056
He's a great Broad

1533
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:38,336
Wikipedia

1534
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:40,896
The first thing that Alex comes up with

1535
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:42,688
Because if you listen to Michael Savage

1536
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:44,736
And you even talked about going to a restaurant

1537
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:46,016
That's the only thing I think about

1538
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:48,064
Cuz he is a artist

1539
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:52,416
What it comes to just talking about a great sub

1540
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:58,304
You did very very sad but when he starts screaming about like a chicken parm

1541
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,328
Get out of the way

1542
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:05,216
No because

1543
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:08,032
Dr. Savage behold his Doctorate is in

1544
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:09,056
Meatball subs

1545
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:15,456
Basically the doctor of nutritional medicine I didn't realize

1546
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:26,976
So you basically just have a doctorate in

1547
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:30,560
Going to Subway

1548
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:31,584
We mailed

1549
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:33,632
Speaking clearly to the peep

1550
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:34,656
Alright

1551
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:40,288
Then I tried

1552
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:46,432
Everyone who's against us wants to kill the Russians or the Chinese

1553
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,200
My friend

1554
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:48,992
Blankets

1555
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:55,392
It's be either or that's unfair it's so stupid

1556
01:27:55,648 --> 01:28:01,792
He did this earlier and I didn't bring it up

1557
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:03,072
Disagrees with him w

1558
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:03,840
War

1559
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:09,472
It's f****** stupid absolutely don't want war

1560
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:14,336
Trump is

1561
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:18,432
We don't want no more

1562
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:19,968
We don't have to

1563
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,760
Yeah

1564
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:24,320
Aspirations

1565
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:25,856
Apt

1566
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:30,720
So then he goes

1567
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:32,512
The Inferno on

1568
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:35,584
Each Pro tanto

1569
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:38,912
We look at those

1570
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:39,936
Power

1571
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:41,472
Who never had

1572
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:44,544
Functionaries looking for the corporate rat

1573
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:46,080
Twilight

1574
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:50,176
What was he trying to say

1575
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:52,480
What he said it's a beast

1576
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:54,016
Is there a part of the Beast

1577
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:56,320
A corporate speaking thing

1578
01:28:56,576 --> 01:29:02,720
Like OU lost track

1579
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:04,768
Bring up the Beast that kind of has that

1580
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:08,608
Sofia the Beast is the globalist

1581
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:10,912
It's a group of the globalist

1582
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:16,544
So all of these people are willing their souls into the larger beasts that is

1583
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,568
Globalism

1584
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:18,848
Okay

1585
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:24,224
I have to make a delineation globalism

1586
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:26,016
The trend

1587
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:28,576
Towards their being a global community

1588
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:29,600
Goodness of

1589
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:30,880
Economy

1590
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:31,904
That sort of thing

1591
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,184
Is a real thing

1592
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:36,768
Globalism in terms of Alex Jones's definition is not a real

1593
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:40,096
But his fake version is the Beast

1594
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:41,632
Said he's referring to

1595
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:46,240
Also not Hank

1596
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:47,520
McCoy

1597
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:50,080
The car

1598
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:55,968
From that one movie where the car was called the Christine

1599
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:59,040
What else do we got what other base now it's just

1600
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:02,112
So is everybody

1601
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:05,440
Selling themselves Ibiza global

1602
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:13,120
I have no idea I've never heard that before I swear to God you made that up just now I think it might just be a WWE

1603
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:14,912
Pay-per-view I watched one

1604
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:21,568
Japan

1605
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:25,152
There we go that much

1606
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:27,456
Yeah sure you got into Stanford

1607
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:33,856
Wrestling reference is already a very good storytelling medium

1608
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:37,952
And Dusty Rhodes

1609
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:42,304
Defensive I don't even really like that wrestling that much

1610
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,864
You know it is a great method of story

1611
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:45,888
I love death

1612
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:47,168
Kathy Rhodes

1613
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:53,568
I remember this obscure pay-per-view

1614
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:58,432
Craigslist Tampa

1615
01:30:58,688 --> 01:30:59,456
I'm fine with that

1616
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:04,320
What is he trying to say

1617
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:06,880
I mean what was the

1618
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:08,672
What was the Goddamn point

1619
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:12,000
Of that hole we look at those seeking power who never had

1620
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:15,072
Is Lindsey Graham's the John McCain

1621
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:18,656
They are trying to

1622
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:20,448
Facilitate

1623
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:27,104
The end of the world nuclear war

1624
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:31,968
World War 3

1625
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:36,832
Maybe I might be giving a little bit too much credit but I think this is what

1626
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:38,112
It comes from

1627
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:42,976
We have the

1628
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:46,560
The um came about Nations before World War

1629
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:47,584
Attempt

1630
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:54,752
Ideas of these Global interfaces

1631
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:57,056
Are these bodies of of

1632
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:59,104
A bunch of government

1633
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:04,736
And a bunch of representative government men of the world

1634
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:07,040
So we don't end up with another

1635
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:07,808
Holocaust

1636
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:09,344
Or we don't end up with another

1637
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:13,440
War to end Wars as it work

1638
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:14,976
Yeah

1639
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:17,280
Galaxy Theater

1640
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:19,072
Okay what happened was

1641
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:20,864
Because evil globalist

1642
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:22,912
Started World War 1

1643
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:26,240
So everyone would die and be horrified

1644
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:28,544
And then they start the League of Nations

1645
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,336
To take sovereignty away for

1646
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:31,872
From Individual countries

1647
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:36,480
They put solidated as a whole from the world and then they can enslave the entire world

1648
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:41,344
Now that didn't work out that time WWII

1649
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,648
And the Jewish Mafia propped up Hitler

1650
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:47,488
In order to do the the crimes

1651
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:53,888
Sean Spicer

1652
01:32:54,144 --> 01:33:00,288
Around Passover

1653
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,568
I hope it gets hit by a truck

1654
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:05,664
F****** Focus we need to get rid of trump will get the f*** about the dumb f****** frostbites

1655
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:10,784
I agree I agree

1656
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,856
Emirates conversation

1657
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:16,672
Internet

1658
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:18,720
Orange

1659
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,816
I don't give a f*** about everything

1660
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:24,864
Get rid of trump and then week

1661
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:28,448
You can deal with United pretty crazy

1662
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:37,920
I think

1663
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:42,016
Did the talking about Spicer stuff is important to taken away trumped-up

1664
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:44,320
Because what he's doing is

1665
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:46,112
What is known

1666
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:47,392
Sort of

1667
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:49,696
Ambivalent Holocaust denial

1668
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:56,608
There's the transit people have like forgetting pieces of the Holocaust publicly

1669
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:05,312
It's either intentionally dog with lie to these white supremacist groups that have

1670
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:06,592
It's just part of who

1671
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:08,640
In that

1672
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:10,944
He's not he's not trying to exploit anybody

1673
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:11,968
He's just that

1674
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:17,088
Sebastian Gorka is a literal Nazi

1675
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:21,184
Genoa

1676
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:25,024
The the Holocaust statement

1677
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,048
That's a trump

1678
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:29,120
Put out the Collegian mention the Jews

1679
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:33,984
There's just a trend of anti-Semitism that goes

1680
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:37,568
That's why it's important I think

1681
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:39,360
Yeah because it does go back to Trump

1682
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:41,408
It's a bunch of people that he surrounds him

1683
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:42,176
Southwest

1684
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:47,552
Either have no awareness of the reality or deny the reality or are literal.

1685
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:49,600
You cut the snake off at at

1686
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:52,160
And then everything else goes Cumberland

1687
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:58,304
Yeah but sometimes you know like if you're fighting a boss in a video game sometimes it's take out his arm for you

1688
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:04,704
Metaphorically speaking

1689
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,008
Different

1690
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:13,408
You got to get through the first one in order to beat the game you might have to

1691
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,856
The world

1692
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:23,392
Amen

1693
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:25,184
We were texting and

1694
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:31,584

Professor Christian to believe in the

1698
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:43,360
The Twilight of the bolts

1699
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:50,272
Especially that's like Viking language

1700
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:53,088
The book or something like that

1701
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:59,488
And all of the citation

1702
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:12,800
This is the last clip of this

1703
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:15,360
Weird ride we've been on

1704
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,920
Starts up

1705
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:21,504

1706
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:24,832
I have

1707
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:27,904

1708
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:29,440
Enjoy where it goes

1709
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:34,304
And although the Twilight of the Gods

1710
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:39,424
What is the end of humanity

1711
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:43,776
How many phone calls

1712
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:47,872

Filtration

1718
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:10,656
I know that this is like we usually just play like always going into a sales pitch

1719
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:16,032
I want you to shut up

1720
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:19,104

Man

1738
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:14,400
What

1739
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:15,424
Fuk was that

1740
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:17,216
That was manna from the gods

1741
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:21,056
That was me saying I don't know if we can do a good episode today

1742
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:24,128
I meant God smiling down upon me and say oh yeah

1743
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:26,432
Make hay

1744
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:29,248
That was that was a hundred percent like

1745
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:35,392
I don't want to get biblical hair or anything like that but that was a moment when I doubted

1746
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:37,696
Myself when I was at work today I was like

1747
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:42,304
Listen to the episode I don't know I don't know if we can do it I mean this Savage stuff

1748
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:43,584
Kinda interesting

1749
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:47,936
Could really don't want to talk about Alex's take on the war what are we going to do

1750
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:49,728
The necklace happened

1751
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:51,008
Pickup

1752
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:52,800
Bring up sky

1753
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:53,824
Big

1754
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,360
Up somehow

1755
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:56,384
Somehow this is

1756
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,664
Turning you back

1757
01:38:58,176 --> 01:39:01,248
I believe in the great magnet

1758
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:05,088
The law of coincidence

1759
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:06,880
Who cares listen

1760
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:11,232
But it's

1761
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,840
Group of bulshit here

1762
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:22,496
This is going to be really fun

1763
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:23,264
Synthesize

1764
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:25,312
What I'm working on

1765
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:28,896
I was when I was putting this together when I was when I was cutting the clips

1766
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:31,200
Like I said all I did was

1767
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:33,248
I did not cut out anything

1768
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:39,904
We're going to end up having to do and I think we have along the way

1769
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:40,928
Critical analysis

1770
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:43,744
Text in a different language

1771
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,792
You have to try and figure out my shoe

1772
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:47,072
What is the f*** is

1773
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:49,888
Is going on your face called

1774
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:58,848
Just say something

1775
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:00,640
Is the author really ink

1776
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:07,040
Control what is their name

1777
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:08,832
What's going on here

1778
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:10,112
So we start

1779
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:11,648
Phaidon

1780
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:18,048
Studio

1781
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:22,144
In the background on Skype a picture

1782
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:23,168
Lays on Hound

1783
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:25,728
City confused Rob do

1784
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:32,896
Notre Dame record for Studios

1785
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:35,456
LOL

1786
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:41,856
Thursday's get it right

1787
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:43,136
Spider-Man locket

1788
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:44,672
I don't want to take Alex Jones out of

1789
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:48,256
Don't f****** pretend you don't know what shows up

1790
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:49,536
Alright

1791
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:57,472
Jon rappoport works for an hour

1792
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:59,264
How else is he going to afford those.

1793
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:00,800
Alright alright

1794
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:04,128
That's Doughty Arabia

1795
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,152
Has

1796
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:06,176
At least

1797
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:08,224
300 princess

1798
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:16,160
You talked about whatever I first started taking notes

1799
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:17,696
Still

1800
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:20,000
The first one is really

1801
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,560
Which is about everyone

1802
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:28,448
Asthmatic

1803
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:32,032
You want to talk about because

1804
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:32,800
Hoagie

1805
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:33,568
Open

1806
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:37,664
Now the second one get rid of cuz it's

1807
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,968
Justin talked about his dog

1808
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,248
No yeah

1809
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:43,296
So yeah

1810
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:46,880
No but then you're even cutting out the other thing

1811
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:48,672
They came before that

1812
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:53,280
Fox news and media is all on World War 3

1813
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:55,072
Best mainly because I agree with

1814
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:55,840
But then

1815
01:41:56,096 --> 01:41:56,864
Steatorrhea is in it

1816
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:57,888
Well

1817
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:01,472
He is not advocating

1818
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:03,008
For World War 3

1819
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,032
He telling you

1820
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:05,056
Prepare for

1821
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:09,664
And I do not disagree with them

1822
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:11,200
Are bald

1823
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:15,808
In let's go

1824
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:23,232
As I tried to say to each and every one of them individually before you got back

1825
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:31,936
Yeah

1826
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:34,752
Critically

1827
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:38,080
The only thing that matters is somatic

1828
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:39,104
Syria is in

1829
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:44,480
Those are two interesting ideas

1830
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:46,016
Cape that I'm I'm going to pull

1831
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:47,296
I apologize

1832
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:50,368
I'm now just I'm a student

1833
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:55,232
Wreck at your lecture the only thing that I do think now that you reminded me

1834
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:56,256
That matters

1835
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:57,280
Is not

1836
01:42:58,048 --> 01:42:59,328
Now I will tell you this

1837
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:01,632
I will get to know I could not

1838
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:08,032
I was surprised when you starting your critical analysis literally crap and and

1839
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:12,384
Rodent-like is that is

1840
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,200
To me that is the key

1841
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:15,968
Alright

1842
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,248
That is

1843
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:19,552
What is the central metaphor

1844
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:24,160
Popeyes

1845
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:24,928
Because

1846
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:30,048
His

1847
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:32,352
Do you can't save somebody who is drowning

1848
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,656
Whereas this dog

1849
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:36,192
Cannot help

1850
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:38,496
Even when they aren't

1851
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,032
Interesting

1852
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:40,800
Now

1853
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:47,200
Metaphor going to be flashed out throughout the course of urinalysis

1854
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:49,248
Alex

1855
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:50,784
Alex Jones

1856
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:53,856
Is the dog who is trying to save you from drowning

1857
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:55,392
Even though you are

1858
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:56,416
Hanging out

1859
01:43:58,464 --> 01:43:58,976
Closet

1860
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:04,352
That I would go I go a step further that he is exactly that

1861
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:05,888
But he's also

1862
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:06,912
That dog

1863
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:13,312
Managing to drown you when you aren't in the pool like if you engage with that dog

1864
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:20,736
The dog who drowns you with a battery

1865
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:29,696
A night unlimited amount of money

1866
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:33,792
So much billions

1867
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:36,608
Which suggests that their total worth

1868
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:39,424
Is more than the entire GDP of the

1869
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:45,824
Which is being printed a job salary

1870
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:48,896
Thing that you are related to the king

1871
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:51,968
Yeah if is he saying that there are hundreds of princes

1872
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:54,272
I believe you believe that aside

1873
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:55,552
Has hundreds

1874
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:02,976
Saudi Arabia

1875
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,000
I misspoke

1876
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:05,024
Alright

1877
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:07,328
Wego from Saudi Arabia

1878
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:08,352
Refugees

1879
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:10,656
To Israel

1880
01:45:12,704 --> 01:45:16,800
To Israel but I'm trying them on his on his writing

1881
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:19,104
Alright

1882
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:21,408
We go directly from there

1883
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:23,968
To Israel is a good guy

1884
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,016
But they're opening themselves up

1885
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:27,552
Palestinian

1886
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:28,576
From

1887
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:29,856
Not Palace

1888
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:30,624
From Syrian

1889
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:33,696
He doesn't have a positive or negative View

1890
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:34,720
Of Israel

1891
01:45:34,976 --> 01:45:35,488
Immediately

1892
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:36,768
Following that quote

1893
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:39,584
He has a positive view of Israel

1894
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:42,400
But his at his actions imply

1895
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:43,936
It's not on the fence

1896
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:47,520
Jewish newspapers are attacking him

1897
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:51,872
Broward Jewish refugees

1898
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:52,896
Array

1899
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:59,808
Do do a little actually he's always trying to do the right thing even though he cannot think about it

1900
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:01,344
Even though he's conscience

1901
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:03,904
2

1902
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:08,768
He finds himself tempts

1903
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:09,536
Did buy the Flash

1904
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:12,608
Right I must f***

1905
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:14,400
Hundreds of newspaper

1906
01:46:14,912 --> 01:46:15,680
100

1907
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:20,032
My suggestion there today

1908
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:21,312
My suggestion there

1909
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,104
He is guilty

1910
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:24,640
And he believes that

1911
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:25,664
People are gossiping

1912
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:27,200
Oh man

1913
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:29,504
I'm not criticizing his

1914
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,808
His thoughts

1915
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:35,904
They are getting into the salacious details

1916
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:38,208
I think

1917
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:39,232
I think yes

1918
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:41,536
I think he is not talking about newspapers

1919
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:43,072
I think he's talking about

1920
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:44,096
People he knows

1921
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:45,120
Talking

1922
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:46,656
Or maybe blog

1923
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:47,680
Exactly

1924
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:55,616
Expedition

1925
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:58,176
The things that they say their critique so that like

1926
01:46:58,432 --> 01:47:04,576
Why won't he go after Israel which kind of does match up with the tone that he saying

1927
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:07,904
Thinking person thinks that I think crazy conspiracy blogs

1928
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:08,928
Which

1929
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,720
Once again

1930
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:12,000
He kind of

1931
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:14,304
Want their approval in the same way they want

1932
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:15,328
Everybody's

1933
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:16,096
Sure

1934
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:18,656
New York

1935
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:21,472
Then we go directly to

1936
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:23,520
Schizophrenic

1937
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:27,360
Immediately following him being attacked

1938
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:29,408
We go to him remembering

1939
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:31,200
How he deals with that

1940
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:32,736
Which is by giving

1941
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:34,528
His people

1942
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:35,808
Money

1943
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:36,832
Some of them

1944
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:37,600
Stomach

1945
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:40,160
But I really think that that wasn't the

1946
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:45,536
Pointe Pacific Apartments

1947
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:47,328
He even based on his words

1948
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:48,608
When he goes and he

1949
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:50,144
Refuse the schizophrenic

1950
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:56,288
It's not about giving money that's not the point that he's making it's like I go there and I realize

1951
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:57,312
Everyone is

1952
01:47:58,592 --> 01:47:59,616
He goes need to cease

1953
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:00,640
A like

1954
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:07,552
Cuz it's from him

1955
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:08,576
That

1956
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:09,856
Everybody is attacking

1957
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:13,184
To him immediately giving money

1958
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:15,744
Now there is a mid

1959
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,048
Point there there is a midpoint

1960
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:19,584
That I don't think matters

1961
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:21,376
Because I think what matters

1962
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:22,400
He makes

1963
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:23,680
Himself feel better

1964
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:25,472
By doing what he thinks

1965
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:27,520
Is the Christians can I end

1966
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:32,640
We go directly to the species is destroyed through

1967
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:33,920
Yeah right

1968
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:38,528
That goes from the schizophrenic to the species being destroyed

1969
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:41,600
His

1970
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:43,392
Hero worship

1971
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:44,160
Money

1972
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:45,696
Jewish newspapers attack

1973
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:48,512
Trying to do the right thing but sleeping with hooker

1974
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:51,072
100.3

1975
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:54,400
100plus newspapers are attacking him at all the

1976
01:48:55,168 --> 01:48:56,192
He is been talking

1977
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:59,264
About schizophrenia also people.

1978
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:02,592
Family

1979
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:03,872
Always under attack

1980
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:06,176
Flips into his mind skitzofrenix

1981
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:08,992
Then we go directly to the ultimate

1982
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:10,016
Schizophrenic

1983
01:49:10,272 --> 01:49:13,088
Fear is that he's the only person who can save the species

1984
01:49:13,344 --> 01:49:14,112
He's from destroying it

1985
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:19,232
The Stranger

1986
01:49:20,256 --> 01:49:21,024
How much he loves

1987
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:21,792
This beautiful plan

1988
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:26,144
And Mama will never love again

1989
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:28,704
That's when we get into that

1990
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:33,568
He goes through this emotional just

1991
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:37,152
Just every every possible Spectre of emotion

1992
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:39,200
Mostly feared

1993
01:49:40,224 --> 01:49:41,248
Beer and abandon me

1994
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,064
Bitter

1995
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:45,344
Then

1996
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:49,696
I had the baby some of that came from mom throwing him off

1997
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:56,352
A boy keep coming back to like really empathic

1998
01:49:58,656 --> 01:49:59,424
Pac-Man

1999
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:02,752
Like you're an alcoholic get help you feel bad for you

2000
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:04,544
Alex your mom didn't love you enough

2001
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:07,360
So bad for you

2002
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:09,152
Certainly

2003
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:12,480
Definition of the word

2004
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:19,136
No matter what angle you look at and that's coming from me

2005
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:24,768
People have tried to be stand-ups for a while

2006
01:50:25,024 --> 01:50:28,096
Most empathic

2007
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:31,168
Adam hope

2008
01:50:31,936 --> 01:50:33,216
That's the thing that kind of

2009
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:34,240
Threw me for a loop

2010
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:36,544
Cuz we go directly from

2011
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:42,688
Was him telling us about the

2012
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:43,712
The future that coming

2013
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:45,248
Guitars

2014
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:46,528
Exactly

2015
01:50:48,576 --> 01:50:50,112
Either that is a hopeful moment

2016
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:52,416
He really wants to escape his

2017
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:54,208
I actually think

2018
01:50:54,464 --> 01:50:54,976
That

2019
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:59,584
Where you see hope I see the reverse

2020
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:05,728
I think that he's saying that because he knows

2021
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:07,520
Science fiction fantasy

2022
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:08,800
Getting off the planet

2023
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:10,080
Especially

2024
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:11,104
The next 51

2025
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:15,200
Gloom thing

2026
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:17,760
Getting IP I think it's like that is never going to

2027
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:20,320
I hate positing it as

2028
01:51:20,576 --> 01:51:21,600
The other alternative

2029
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:22,880
Means that we're too

2030
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:23,904
I believe

2031
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:25,952
Alex Jones believes we will get off

2032
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:28,000
What many believe the Trump is going

2033
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:28,768
Going to cure everyday

2034
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:33,632
In that regard I believe he does

2035
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:34,912
Okay

2036
01:51:35,168 --> 01:51:36,448
Lindsey Graham John McCain

2037
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:38,240
Getting us away from chivalry and honor

2038
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:41,056
Of course shirts Shore

2039
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:44,128
It wasn't the chivalry Don Quixote

2040
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:46,944
Maybe a schizophrenic

2041
01:51:49,504 --> 01:51:52,576
Very good chance of nuclear winter so we come back down

2042
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:56,672
Hit that bottom right there

2043
01:51:57,184 --> 01:51:57,952
We can

2044
01:51:58,208 --> 01:52:00,512
Family doesn't believe him anymore

2045
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:02,560
Feel like

2046
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:05,120
And this is this is my ultimate

2047
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:06,656
Kind of

2048
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:08,192
Synthesis

2049
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:08,960
Of all of this in

2050
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,288
He believes

2051
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:15,360
That he is trying to save his

2052
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:16,128
His family

2053
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:18,176
And they are reject

2054
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:22,272
Yeah

2055
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:23,040
Yeah

2056
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:24,576
I'm back at Monk

2057
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:32,768
Don't look you just gave me was so possible

2058
01:52:33,024 --> 01:52:35,328
You thought I wasn't going to make it back there

2059
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:39,424
Also was knocked the dog that died

2060
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:42,752
The night that he was drunk on air

2061
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:47,616
Now

2062
01:52:50,944 --> 01:52:52,224
Absolutely

2063
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:53,760
Proud

2064
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:56,832
Your thesis

2065
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:58,112
Is interest

2066
01:52:59,904 --> 01:53:01,184
I don't think

2067
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,720
Accounts for everything

2068
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:03,744
I don't think

2069
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:07,072
That that is

2070
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:08,352
Underlying

2071
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:10,656
Psychoanalytical critical theory

2072
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:15,008
I mean if you want to look at his career at 8

2073
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:18,592
I made it got to go back to that s*** with his

2074
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:19,616
You are really

2075
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:21,408
Overly

2076
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:23,712
Get back to the root of it

2077
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:30,624
Where's the income from primary relationships when you're a child being severed in and being being

2078
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:33,696
Vulnerable and threatened by like this

2079
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:37,280
This caretaker doesn't love me anymore which is exactly what

2080
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:38,048
Describe

2081
01:53:39,072 --> 01:53:42,912
Like this idea of Abandonment leads to paranoia

2082
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:43,936
No maybe it's being

2083
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:45,216
Triggered by the idea like

2084
01:53:45,472 --> 01:53:47,520
I want to run away to the Cayman Islands

2085
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:49,568
Let's get away from here

2086
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:51,104
Calm down

2087
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:54,944
Triggered by that I think so

2088
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:56,480
Adjust this

2089
01:53:57,504 --> 01:53:58,016
And it's not just

2090
01:53:58,272 --> 01:54:00,320
His immediate year fight

2091
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:02,368
Right but I think it is

2092
01:54:02,624 --> 01:54:03,648
I think it is the Trump

2093
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:04,928
And this

2094
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:09,536
Please also abandoned by Trump in the same way of feeling abandoned by his family

2095
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:10,304
And his

2096
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:11,584
And he abandoned

2097
01:54:12,352 --> 01:54:14,144
Because they

2098
01:54:15,936 --> 01:54:18,752
But they're at the very least they're starting

2099
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:19,776
To change their mind

2100
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:21,568
A lot like Michael Savage

2101
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:26,176
Exactly

2102
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:27,968
Everyone is leaving

2103
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:30,528
Everyone is leaving

2104
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:31,552
That

2105
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:34,880
You know it's fat

2106
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:40,256
Much like a dog

2107
01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:42,560
Much like a dog

2108
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:45,376
For the last 20 years or so that he's been on the air

2109
01:54:46,144 --> 01:54:48,192
As he's been ignored by everybody

2110
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:49,728
He's been doing nothing but

2111
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:51,008
Drawing more gravity

2112
01:54:52,288 --> 01:54:53,824
Everyone's coming to him

2113
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:57,664
The robbed the world of the world

2114
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:59,456
Like all these reporters

2115
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:01,248
Leanne Macado's

2116
01:55:01,504 --> 01:55:03,040
Shroyer's

2117
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:05,600
Overtime they've all gravitated

2118
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:06,880
Towards his energy

2119
01:55:07,392 --> 01:55:08,160
They've come in

2120
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:10,720
What f**** him over

2121
01:55:10,976 --> 01:55:11,488
Is

2122
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,304
Finally latching onto a politician

2123
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:15,072
Yep

2124
01:55:15,584 --> 01:55:19,680
Jumped on somebody else's with Trump

2125
01:55:20,448 --> 01:55:20,960
And

2126
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:22,240
Because of that

2127
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:24,544
Because of the

2128
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:25,568
Mental gymnastics

2129
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:26,848
Badoo

2130
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:28,896
He ends up alienating

2131
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:30,688
Steve pieczenik

2132
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:32,480
Who is his

2133
01:55:34,528 --> 01:55:36,576
His source for a lot of his narrative

2134
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:39,392
Rodger Stone probably going to pray

2135
01:55:40,416 --> 01:55:43,232
Two of them still singing

2136
01:55:45,536 --> 01:55:48,096
I want it before I tell you

2137
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:50,400
I'm fascinated by your narrative

2138
01:55:51,168 --> 01:55:52,448
I think it's possibly

2139
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:53,216
Accurate

2140
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:54,496
If not

2141
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:57,568
It's at least very

2142
01:55:58,848 --> 01:55:59,872
It would be a

2143
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:00,640
Great

2144
01:56:00,896 --> 01:56:01,408
Play

2145
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:04,992
I would love to see that on stage

2146
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:08,064
Like I would love to see the like first

2147
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:09,344
Being the sky

2148
01:56:09,856 --> 01:56:10,368
Full of

2149
01:56:10,624 --> 01:56:12,160
Vim and vigor and like

2150
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:14,720
He has a family and he learns about the globalist

2151
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:17,280
The second is there is a mutt

2152
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:20,864
Better story to tell about Alex

2153
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:21,888
Truly a tragedy

2154
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:29,056
Greek tragedy unfolding are we the chorus

2155
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:33,408
Alright I will go to the assholes

2156
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:34,688
Aretha furies

2157
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:45,184
Worse

2158
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:45,952
Exactly

2159
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:48,256
The other day

2160
01:56:48,512 --> 01:56:49,792
Rodger Stone was on

2161
01:56:50,048 --> 01:56:51,584
And he said that he has a guy

2162
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:52,608
Who's about to die

2163
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:54,144
Who's the source

2164
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:57,472
That wants to spill the beans on John McCain

2165
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:00,800
He's going to give Infowars the scoop

2166
01:57:01,056 --> 01:57:02,336
He's going to give them the exclusive

2167
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:03,360
That

2168
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:04,384
Insane

2169
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:08,736
We don't know what is on Mondays

2170
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:10,528
Haha

2171
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:16,928
What's going on

2172
01:57:21,792 --> 01:57:23,584
Rodger Stones immediate reaction is

2173
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:27,168
The best man for the job

2174
01:57:30,496 --> 01:57:36,640
This is not a story it robbed

2175
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:39,968
Who is the best man for the job back I can't f******

2176
01:57:40,224 --> 01:57:43,040
The other the other options

2177
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:44,832
Somebody needs to take out the trash

2178
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:51,744
Who is the best man for the job I thought you meant as a host

2179
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:58,144
Puppet I don't know sifl and olly get them in there I don't give a s***

2180
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:59,680
He has that you have

2181
01:57:59,936 --> 01:58:01,216
Big story to break

2182
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:02,752
So I can get Rob do on a

2183
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:06,592
The most

2184
01:58:06,848 --> 01:58:08,384
Easily suggestible format

2185
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:11,968
At all

2186
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:14,528
Like if you have like let's pretend

2187
01:58:15,296 --> 01:58:16,320
For a f****** hot sex

2188
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:18,112
Nima

2189
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:19,648
Raging massive Rock

2190
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:22,464
This is a real story

2191
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:24,512
And there is a deathbed confession

2192
01:58:24,768 --> 01:58:25,280
About

2193
01:58:25,536 --> 01:58:26,048
John McCain

2194
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:27,584
Can be verified

2195
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:29,632
And is our to set

2196
01:58:29,888 --> 01:58:30,400
Is going to

2197
01:58:30,656 --> 01:58:31,424
Destroy his career

2198
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:33,216
And his reputation

2199
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:35,520
What's the temperature

2200
01:58:35,776 --> 01:58:41,664
Let's pretend that okay I might have to put a lot of thinking caps on it

2201
01:58:42,176 --> 01:58:43,200
Pantheon

2202
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:44,992
Of Infowars reporters

2203
01:58:46,784 --> 01:58:48,832
I would say the last person I put on it

2204
01:58:49,088 --> 01:58:50,112
Is Alex's son

2205
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:51,904
Because he's a child

2206
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:53,184
He can't hang

2207
01:58:54,464 --> 01:59:00,352
Are you still on the roster selling I weird things to put your cell phone in to get radiation

2208
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:03,424
Which is great glad to see him being off printer.

2209
01:59:04,448 --> 01:59:05,216
She's the last

2210
01:59:06,496 --> 01:59:07,264
He's the ladder

2211
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:10,080
This a real product

2212
01:59:10,336 --> 01:59:11,616
It's

2213
01:59:11,872 --> 01:59:13,664
Is the name of the

2214
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:16,224
La Jolla

2215
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:19,552
After this thirteen-year-old

2216
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:22,112
The last person I would send is robbed

2217
01:59:22,624 --> 01:59:23,392
He's in,

2218
01:59:23,648 --> 01:59:24,160
Yes

2219
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:26,720
If that's a real story

2220
01:59:27,232 --> 01:59:28,256
That's a career

2221
01:59:29,024 --> 01:59:30,560
Whether that's a big scoop

2222
01:59:31,072 --> 01:59:35,168
Yeah you want to f****** send that to somebody who can actually handle one journalist

2223
01:59:35,424 --> 01:59:36,960
Took down John McCain

2224
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:40,800
And you got to give that to think like might have a career in there

2225
01:59:41,056 --> 01:59:45,152
Might have potential who can accurately research follow-up

2226
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:52,576
What is Ashley Beckford like I said I've never heard port

2227
01:59:54,112 --> 01:59:56,416
She seems to have a much better head on your shoulder

2228
01:59:56,672 --> 01:59:59,232
She still has

2229
02:00:01,536 --> 02:00:03,072
It's it's it's very difficult

2230
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:06,400
But she doesn't seem like as much of a dick

2231
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:10,240
Is a lot of ugly and McAdoo doesn't seem like as much of a dick

2232
02:00:10,496 --> 02:00:12,288
Maybe it's because the two of them are women

2233
02:00:12,544 --> 02:00:14,848
Possible

2234
02:00:15,872 --> 02:00:16,896
I would send Owen Shroyer

2235
02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:18,944
I hate

2236
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:21,760
But I would send him

2237
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:23,296
Okay kind of has

2238
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:24,832
He kind of has

2239
02:00:25,088 --> 02:00:25,856
Yeah

2240
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:29,440
You got the wild

2241
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:32,256
We were the f****** rob do

2242
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:38,912
Again outside Lee Ann McAdoo probably

2243
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:45,056
Like the women who work there

2244
02:00:45,312 --> 02:00:46,848
No it's not even that

2245
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:49,920
Supercharged

2246
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:54,528
Squire we Pro women on Infowars for obvious

2247
02:00:54,784 --> 02:00:57,344
Reason the people

2248
02:00:57,856 --> 02:00:58,624
No I mean

2249
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:01,440
Culture of toxic

2250
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:04,000
Masculinity

2251
02:01:04,256 --> 02:01:05,280
You and I

2252
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:07,328
Recognize that immediately as being the most

2253
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:08,608
Damaging possum

2254
02:01:09,376 --> 02:01:11,936
Base course we're going to prefer the women on Fox

2255
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:15,776
What they deserve better

2256
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:19,104
I'm scrambling my head

2257
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:21,920
The reason that I say this about Ashley

2258
02:01:22,176 --> 02:01:23,968
That I think that she's better than the rest

2259
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:26,016
Fieldpiece

2260
02:01:26,528 --> 02:01:27,040
Does

2261
02:01:27,296 --> 02:01:29,856
And the way that you interact with people is still

2262
02:01:30,624 --> 02:01:31,648
I'm still Infowars

2263
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:34,208
You can tell that her brain is a little boring gay

2264
02:01:34,976 --> 02:01:37,024
She seems to have better Improv

2265
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:37,792
Call chops

2266
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:39,584
Is dealing with a situation

2267
02:01:40,608 --> 02:01:41,120
Exist

2268
02:01:41,376 --> 02:01:42,144
More than other people

2269
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:44,704
I know that's kind of abstract in a little bit vague

2270
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:46,240
But it does you can tell

2271
02:01:46,496 --> 02:01:47,520
If you watch her

2272
02:01:47,776 --> 02:01:49,312
Any watch a million

2273
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:52,384
Never heard her name before she's a rainbow snake

2274
02:01:52,896 --> 02:01:57,248
She plays rainbow smash

2275
02:01:57,504 --> 02:01:58,272
Improv

2276
02:01:58,784 --> 02:01:59,552
She doesn't

2277
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:08,768
Leastwise not a back-to-back right before draft

2278
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:11,584
My point is

2279
02:02:12,864 --> 02:02:14,400
If there's an expose about JonBenet

2280
02:02:17,984 --> 02:02:20,032
Can't cut it that's good advice

2281
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:21,312
Houston

2282
02:02:25,408 --> 02:02:26,432
Don't send

2283
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:27,712
Dinicu me up

2284
02:02:29,248 --> 02:02:32,832
I was just about to say

2285
02:02:33,088 --> 02:02:39,232
Do you know where Rappaport with my brain

2286
02:02:39,488 --> 02:02:40,768
A picture

2287
02:02:41,024 --> 02:02:44,096
Where he has been hiding

2288
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:45,632
This whole time

2289
02:02:45,888 --> 02:02:48,704
I would give you like Batman

2290
02:02:49,728 --> 02:02:50,240
Any amount of money

2291
02:02:50,752 --> 02:02:52,800
To see him interview this guy on his Deathbed

2292
02:02:53,312 --> 02:02:53,824
Unobrush

2293
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:56,896
With an unhung picture

2294
02:02:59,200 --> 02:02:59,968
Defeat him go

2295
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:01,248
Anywhere on the field

2296
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:04,320
And then like like a game of where's Waldo

2297
02:03:04,832 --> 02:03:06,880
We just see in the background that I'm hug picture

2298
02:03:07,392 --> 02:03:11,744
Gorgeous

2299
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:12,768
I've never seen John Ray

2300
02:03:13,024 --> 02:03:13,792
Stand up

2301
02:03:14,048 --> 02:03:16,864
She might be in a wheelchair I literally have no idea doesn't matter

2302
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:17,632
The matter

2303
02:03:17,888 --> 02:03:18,912
Pennywise

2304
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:27,616
Yeah I thought you're rambling outro but like I don't know how else to correct

2305
02:03:27,872 --> 02:03:29,664
What does it mean

2306
02:03:30,176 --> 02:03:36,320
That doesn't send us down a rabbit hole of what

2307
02:03:38,368 --> 02:03:42,208
I think it's you're not far off in the ballpark

2308
02:03:42,464 --> 02:03:43,232
I think he's not

2309
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:44,512
In the ballpark

2310
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:47,328
I used car

2311
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:49,120
