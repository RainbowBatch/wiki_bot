A little break e for me

85
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,671
And then we're going to

86
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
Comeback

87
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,231

00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,375
F*** you

90
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,471
I got plenty of words for you but at the end of the day

91
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,519
F*** you and your new world order

92
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,567

93
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
And all your s***

94
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,711
Maybe I'll just be gone a month maybe 5 years

95
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,527
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

96
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,063
And you never see me again

97
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,367
That's really what I want to do

98
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,671
Back here again

99
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:52,255
I apologize to the crew in the listener's yesterday that I

100
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,327
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

101
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
I'll be better tomorrow

102
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:01,471
So better today

103
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,543
God that's going to play at the I swear

104
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,335
If that isn't what plays

105
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,639
Is on the career retrospective

106
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,199
Retrospective for Alex like 10 years from now

107
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:17,599
That's it's a perfect encapsulation of his whole career I think I could actually even I had to

108
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:23,999
The retrospective if people wanted a little bit more minutes today

109
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,047
Reviving Outburst oh yeah

110
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,095
Jordan is an out-of-context drops

111
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863
From Today Show

112
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,447
Binky

113
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
Baba

114
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,335
That's right

115
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,871
Squiggly

116
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:40,895
Qui Qui

117
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,431
Breaking Baba

118
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,247
Views for blanket

119
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,527
That sounds better

120
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,575
Because he was he was making fun of masks

121
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,903
People like wearing masks

122
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,743
Anthony realized he had to explain as much fun

123
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:00,607
What is child.

124
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:04,703
It's at Plum and grey

125
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,775
Start off as Alex starts off

126
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,079
This is weird

127
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,687
And as much as we have a right with this illegitimate government of the Declaration of Independence

128
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,343
You don't have the organization of the Statesman the leadership

129
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,583
Pretty good

130
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,495
Do business

131
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,847
I was just trying to have a really interesting weird middle

132
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,151
Path about 6

133
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:50,271
And whether or not to overthrow the government.

134
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,295
Pittsboro just got arrested

135
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:57,695
So maybe not maybe I should

136
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
Leave it open

137
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,767
Open Super wait for somebody like Alex is like

138
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,071
Entire personality is based on like

139
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,375
I don't know King George

140
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:11,007
You basically just masturbate about the Revolutionary War

141
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,591
Everybody like your King George

142
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,663
Sweet

143
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,479
Also I don't I don't know exactly if his

144
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,039
Characterization of what King George

145
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,319
I was doing that the

146
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,087
The colonists

147
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,415
The revolutionaries had a problem with

148
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,719
I don't know if that's exactly accurate

149
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
But either way

150
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
Alex is at a place where he's like

151
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,559
Maybe I should walk so

152
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,583
Some of the stuff back

153
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,375
Maybe maybe I should be a little bit

154
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,655
Be careful

155
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,983
With the breakdown of civilization when the breakdown of society

156
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,311
The last thing we need is

157
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,615
Paramilitary garbage

158
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
Who is Hannah

159
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
Keepers

160
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,503
Who is proud boys

161
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,807
Ideas and things are spouse

162
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,367
Militias in the Constitution

163
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,647
It's in the Bill of Rights

164
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,327
That's a normal male instinct to good

165
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,863
You should try to protect yourself

166
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,167
Please try to work as a sheriff's

167
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,847
You should use your influence to City counseling and school boards and everywhere be heard

168
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,431
But

169
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,551
In places like North Carolina

170
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,343
In Kentucky and Virginia

171
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:33,439
What are recruiting young people online and others using Q

172
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,255
Might be asked if there's a big present

173
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,303
You really work

174
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,887
For Trump DC going to do this

175
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,679
Choo choo launch sometime

176
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:51,359
Before the midterm to bring control martial law

177
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,967
I'm a non-attorney spokesperson represent

178
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,807
It's really weird this timing for Alex

179
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:04,159
The jump-off being super into militia and revolutionary paramilitary.

180
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,743
Alex is talking s*** but I think he's keenly aware there are a ton of

181
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:12,095
Rewi heavily-armed dangerously prone towards violence militia members out there

182
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,911
Who been fed a steady diet of ideas but have a global history

183
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,191
Going to take out the leadership

184
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,983
Then they're going to come to your house to

185
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,751
Peculiar family

186
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,359
He knows that he was a part of a line that up and Bang the Drum constantly and now

187
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:27,455
Probably the highest-profile militia leader in the country's been arrested for sedition

188
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,479
Conspiracy

189
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:32,319
It sounds like maybe Alex's read the indictment by this point he knows that store

190
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,951
Alex isn't so stupid as to not understand that there are violent lunatics out there who were waiting

191
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,487
For the sign to jump off a

192
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,511
Start shooting people

193
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:44,095
Likely c-store getting arrested is the sign that they were waiting for

194
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,399
I hope that there aren't too many of these

195
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:51,007
These sorts of folks and that they'll end up choosing not to hurt people but I think the possibility

196
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:51,775
Is there

197
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
I feel like this

198
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,871
Just kind of why Alex's predicting this kind of false flag

199
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,199
Sending a message that he isn't that the paramilitary stuff

200
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:05,855
I think it's because he's really worried at this point there's a possibility that there will be some paramilitary style reprisals for Stewart

201
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,207
And he'd rather not have to deal with those very clear consequences of the last

202
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
13 years

203
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,255
What is broadcast career

204
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,559
Either that or Alex

205
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,839
Actually as proof of

206
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:20,959
Q style Commando camps in North Carolina

207
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,495
Which will then get blamed on paper

208
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,151
I would say that if he has evidence like he claims he does he better percent that s*** right now because you'll be a gigantic news story

209
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:35,551
Being done online on the internet that should have left a trail that Alex

210
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,343
Pretty easily

211
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:41,695
If Alex claims that his number one mission is to stop this supposed uprising

212
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,487
That would probably be what he does

213
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,047
But the reality is that Alex doesn't want to stop

214
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:51,935
You just wants to lay some groundwork so if there are some right-wing attacks will be able to point this b******* to insist

215
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,215
They were actually false flag

216
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,263
He's interested in harm reduction

217
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,311
But only the reduction of harm that week

218
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
Come to himself

219
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,359
Right that's

220
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,151
That's the game that he's playing here with you

221
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:04,479
I'm not into paramilitary

222
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,527
Militia guys

223
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,575
Stop being so maliciously

224
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,135
I do I do like that

225
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,695
It is that one kind of thing of of like

226
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,511
You've created such an imaginary world

227
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,791
You can't reason

228
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
People down from

229
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
From this

230
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,911
So you have to engage with them in the imaginary world of like

231
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,727
Hey don't commit any violence not cuz it's wrong

232
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,751
But because there's a

233
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,823
A secret magical organization that's trying to

234
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,615
Take advantage of you for committing viola

235
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,199
Butterbean would stand to reason that like

236
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:39,807
I guess if you know yourself to have not been part of an Internet Q camp

237
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,831
Commando thing

238
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,135
Then what is the problem with you committing

239
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:47,231
Cuz they don't know if it cuz you might get your buddies

240
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
I'm taking in

241
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
I guess so

242
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,607
I don't know anyways it's all just the same thing he does all the time whenever he's

243
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,191
You know pretty worried that the heat is a little too high covering his own ass

244
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,775
While since we've heard Alex get really mad about Brian

245
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:06,175
Stelter

246
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,759
A possibly impossible goal for himself

247
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,319
Alright everybody knows

248
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:23,839
Jeff Zucker

249
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,911
He is the mouth of the world order what you hear is a script

250
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
Eastbay

251
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,519
See how you look

252
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,823
Gives me the heebie-jeebies

253
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,711
Play what he has to say

254
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,783
Come on

255
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
Portent

256
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,367
Coming up next

257
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,183
Warframe for my normal

258
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,375
Things are too dangerous right now

259
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:01,471
Things are too dangerous for me to make fun of Brian stelter anymore it's just

260
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,519
Look we all had our fun

261
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
You know what

262
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,079
Once they get roads

263
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,407
Gun caches all around the capital

264
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,967
Do you know that they can't allow people to make fun of seltzer

265
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,295
Well they can allow it but Alex has a higher calling

266
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,599
He's got to be very serious

267
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,903
And so we'll see

268
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,183
It's bigger than Hip Hop.

269
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:27,583
See if he's able to hold his tongue from until already

270
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,727
There's no chance of that

271
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,263
And that is

272
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
Telkom

273
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:39,871
Wheatley fictional stories by interactions that he has with people on them

274
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
Love it

275
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,967
Christian

276
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,575
Beautiful black

277
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,743
Grocery store yesterday

278
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,167
Have you taken the shot she said all man they made me take the second one

279
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,471
Worst thing ever worst thing I've ever felt

280
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,567
I'm just now getting over in

281
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,895
My stomach hurts so bad you know Ma

282
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
Should yeah

283
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
.

284
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,135
Serious mental problems

285
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,535
Problems for 6 months

286
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,831
Was this was a beautiful woman

287
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,463
This is wild

288
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,791
The notion of Alex

289
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:07,167
Hi I'm Alex Jones from Infowars

290
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,703
I mean

291
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,983
Never happen

292
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,567
You know it's amazing how you know you

293
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,639
You all three words beautiful black and Lady

294
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,919
All fine together

295
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:21,247
When they come out of Alex's mouth in that order

296
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
Deeply uncomfortable

297
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,831
It's it it feels weird

298
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,391
I think fairly

299
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,415
Charismatic

300
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,439
Welcoming

301
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
Dice p

302
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,487
People I think wooden

303
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:34,047
End up having conversations with people about their meds

304
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,839
Spell cycle

305
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
Mostly wood

306
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,935
Not have those conversations with random people on the street

307
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:45,567
Yeah yeah yeah

308
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,335
Vaccine

309
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,127
Just a complete misrepresentation of a study

310
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,455
But you never actually read

311
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,247
Totally imaginary

312
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,039
But he just keeps talking about it

313
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,903
I just feel like asking I feel like saying hey

314
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:00,927
How are you doing

315
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,279
You check the shot she's old

316
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,143
I'm just now starting

317
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,959
Tell real this is

318
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,495
Randomly

319
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,567
Walking into a grocery store

320
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,455
The first person I talked to Scott hurt by it

321
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,015
Statistics

322
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
Avatar bad

323
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,391
First person I seen uniform

324
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:35,999
Again this never happened this person didn't exist this conversation is fake

325
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,791
The flimsy is b*******

326
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:41,887
Something interesting here that Alex brings up at the end that I want to touch on

327
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,727
He seems to be expressing that the fact that he talked to somebody who had an adverse event

328
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:49,567
From a vaccination would constitute stronger evidence about vaccine side effects

329
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
Text and data

330
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:55,199
This is really weird that's obviously not true but it's actually completely true for how Alex

331
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,223
Some gauges of information

332
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,807
Information is entirely story-based

333
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,855
And data isn't really all that

334
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,879
Compelling as a story

335
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:07,743
It's hard to read two numbers

336
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:12,863
Anecdotal stories about people real or imagined supposedly been hurt by vaccines

337
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,935
Stories are super compelling and he's trained izadi

338
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,983
It's worth far more weight on stories

339
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,519
Did someone could just be making up

340
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,799
That Maywood on data

341
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:26,431
That's a really big problem for these so-called information War cuz it's really more of a storytelling War

342
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,199
Yeah

343
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,759
That's what he should call is is show

344
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,807
Story time telling more hour

345
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,879
The mob story slam War

346
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,487
Oh man drag queen sad hour

347
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,071
So what man there's a

348
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,351
Obviously this

349
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,911
Those people who are putting it out there the vaccines are safe

350
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,191
Uno

351
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,727
All of them are getting paid

352
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,031
Thousands of influencers

353
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,823
Billions of dollars

354
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,223
Just the last year's that numbers about 6 months behind

355
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,503
Last year

356
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,439
Remember thing I can tell this is a completely made up stat

357
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,207
Story

358
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:15,839
There have been attempts to use social media influencers to encourage people to get vaccinated but that was a big dump by Pfizer

359
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,679
One of the more high-profile examples of this was

360
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:22,239
In Colorado where the governor hired a PR come

361
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,519
Pretty called idea marketing

362
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,567
To handle all the public facing aspect

363
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,359
I'm spreading vaccine information

364
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:34,271
Their contract was for 8.8 million dollars and it appears they enlisted 120 influencers on social media

365
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,575
Picking them up to $1,000 a month

366
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
To promote vaccine

367
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,159
According to their planet.

368
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:46,815
Twitter publicly-available they budgeted a total of $286,500 for compensation going to end

369
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:53,471
This is Weston that was paid for Google ads over YouTube ads and it was a bit less than they allocated even for

370
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
Spanish speaking

371
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,263
Can cable channel

372
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:02,431
This was last year but in December 2020 there were solar stories about influencers in New Jersey making money

373
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,455
I need to do similar stuff

374
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,503
This is more or less equivalent of a

375
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,551
PSA in our new social media

376
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:11,647
These people do have to disclose that they are being a making paid post

377
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,183
What to do if a company pays

378
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,535
There's a flip side of this and I'm sure Alex doesn't want to touch

379
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,095
May 2021

380
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,911
News broke that online influencers were being approached

381
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,727
To spread misinformation about the Pfizer vaccine

382
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,031
According to a New York Times bees

383
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:31,871
Mirko drotzmann a German YouTuber who comments on health issues

384
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,407
And has 1.5 million

385
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,175
Subscribers

386
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,735
Was approached by a mysterious agency called fazi

387
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,271
FaZe

388
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,807
About being involved in a quote

389
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,111
Information campaign about Pfizer deaths

390
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,927
The aim was to make Sensational claims about the vaccine

391
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,743
She's deadliness in about how everyone was covering it out

392
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,791
Essentially it was an information

393
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,351
Campaign to do Alex's show

394
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,911
Simultaneously

395
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:59,263
A French Health YouTuber with over a million followers was contacted by the same age

396
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,287
Gypsy with the same offer

397
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:04,895
Their Revelations like two other influencers coming out and saying they had also been approached

398
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,015
The agency is actually really shady to and according to this article

399
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,319
Hard to tell like

400
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,343
What it is

401
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,367
Exactly

402
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:20,512
Leo gressett posted screenshots of the messages he got from the person at the company who identified himself as

403
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,280
Anton

404
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,584
Willing to pay

405
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,864
445

406
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,144
2/62 videos

407
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,912
Instagram

408
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,192
Tik-Tok or YouTube

409
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,240
Warning the divisor vaccine was deadly

410
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,568
Antoine also asked him to quote act like you have the

411
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,360
Passion and interest in this topic

412
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:39,200
While avoiding terms advertising and sponsored impose

413
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:43,552
Material should be presented as your own independent view the p

414
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,320
Pitch set

415
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,112
Things get a bit weirder though

416
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:49,440
And by August 20-21 Facebook at a move to

417
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,232
Kick the fazi agency off the

418
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
The platform

419
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:55,328
More information was coming out that it was a quote

420
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,888
Subsidiary of a uk-registered marketing

421
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,448
For whose operations were primarily conduct

422
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,216
Did from Russia

423
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,008
Stream Bridge Raymond Lyrica

424
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,080
This obviously isn't the same

425
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,104
Some government plot already

426
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,432
But it does provide a very strong basis to conclude that this was a

427
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:13,760
Foreign misinformation campaign that targeted people in other countries

428
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,832
Also apparently at one point to some of the campaign was to

429
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,136
To spread the narrative that to the Pfizer vaccine

430
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:23,232
Was turning people into chimpanzee that's probably true though

431
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:26,560
Probably true good stuff

432
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,888
More Insidious

433
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:34,752
Open psa's that are being done by social media influencers who disclosed that they're doing PS

434
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,056
Alex doesn't care about this order story at all

435
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:40,128
Is the misinformation that's being spread is in line with a message that

436
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,408
If you wants to amplify

437
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:48,064
There's no good explanation for the agency's actions so the best way to navigate the stories just to ignore it and that exaggerate or lie

438
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,344
About what the people you don't like

439
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,416
Yeah

440
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,488
Yeah I mean I like that I like that company

441
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,792
I like that idea of such

442
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,072
Complete like

443
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:03,936
Hey either capitalism going to work or it's not you know I'm I'm offering you a bunch of money

444
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,240
You can either say no and there's no consequence

445
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,032
This for me I'm some random dude in Russia

446
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:14,176
Are you can take my money and I get what I want like that is a completely zero risk situation

447
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:18,272
I'm not entirely sure based on the information that's available

448
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,064
Actually

449
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,600
Like real

450
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,928
The ability to follow through with these authors may have been

451
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:28,512
You know I'm a little bit

452
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,048
Confused about it but

453
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,328
I also know

454
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:35,424
People go along with things and then get screwed by deals

455
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,960
That never pay off

456
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
So

457
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,776
Somethings made me fall into that

458
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:43,872
Yeah the first thing that I thought of whenever you told me about that was just like

459
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,896
Those roommate

460
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:48,480
It's cancer or they're like oh yeah I'll pay you the first

461
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:53,856
Second month's rent but I'm out at semi-state right now can you send me a little upfront so then I can

462
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,160
That's good that's got that Vibe Oliver

463
00:23:56,672 --> 00:24:00,256
Yep so now Alex realizes

464
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
It's time

465
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,792
Baby

466
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:07,680
Blasted through 30-plus minutes of this transmission today I need to start digging into the news

467
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,984
I covering it all for you today

468
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,336
The first big thing I want to hear

469
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:20,480
Is Brian stelter which means the mouth of the establishment

470
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,272
Attacking Glenn Beck

471
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,440
Because he said I was making up the FEMA camp plans

472
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,512
Backup Mama to put American

473
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,792
Documents

474
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,680
That Obama Was preparing to put American

475
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,472
Education

476
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,032
Brainwashing term

477
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:44,800
Brainwashing

478
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:50,688
Not not accurate are the mouth of the establishment

479
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,712
Which is it in opposition

480
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,760
Jimmy Hart the mouth of the South

481
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,064
Got to keep those things that the stink

482
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,344
They are they're not the same

483
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,904
This has been my wrestling reference of the day

484
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,720
Check that box office

485
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,280
That's on the Whiteboard right there

486
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,328
I guess we got to talk about stelter

487
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,912
Alex has got a tip his cap

488
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
2

489
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,472
The people who are really doing

490
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
The good work

491
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,032
Here's the good news

492
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,384
Tulsi gabbard we got one back

493
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,408
We got

494
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,456
The lames going forever

495
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:28,064
And everybody else Congress people on both sides

496
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,648
Global government

497
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:36,000
Exercise

498
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,840
Then we'll understand

499
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,888
Control

500
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,704
Putting in a permanent prison

501
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:48,032
They won't be able to do this anymore

502
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:52,896
So I guess it's easier to bring in martial law type denada going to kill us all

503
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,784
Also Tulsi gabbard

504
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,600
It's getting to be a little Annoying that is great list

505
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,416
That was a great list goes on and on

506
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:10,304
Also like it makes me think of a hit what happened to that narrative where Jack Dorsey left Twitter so he could support Ali

507
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,912
I remember that.

508
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,960
No I think he's joining the team that's

509
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,240
Killing everybody again

510
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,032
Oh no

511
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,872
Alex has some other people who are heroes

512
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
These Heroes

513
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,200
We are here

514
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:30,272
I don't know Rodger stones come on he's had a really bad

515
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,696
I talked to him yesterday

516
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,024
So you got to come over here

517
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,072
They should all come on at 12:30

518
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,912
And he's so sick

519
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,992
We'll see if he's with us next shower

520
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:04,320
Remember all those descriptions of how Alex

521
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:10,464
What's the saying Rogers doing cuz it doesn't sound when he finally does show up

522
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:13,280
Also the next level is like

523
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,072
I was just uses a whatever you want

524
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:20,704
Is next level be supplemented next level

525
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,544
Rogers covid Next Level most covid anybody's ever had

526
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:30,944
So now that this has gotten out of the tip of the cap to Tulsi gabbard and the announcement that Rodger has covid

527
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,224
Yeah we get

528
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,832
Well that's what made me suspicious that he's fake

529
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,392
But I think

530
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,416
He might not be

531
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,720
For some other reason

532
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,512
You might be demonstrating

533
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,792
Summit

534
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,560
New

535
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,840
Problem okay

536
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,144
I will give this just a spoiler alert

537
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,448
He seemed to be slurring his speech a little bit

538
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:57,568
Oh that was not something that was a Hallmark of his previous.

539
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,896
And that is something that could be associated with

540
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,944
Damage that could be done by koe

541
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,736
Sure absolutely

542
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,784
Hesitant

543
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,808
Fake

544
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:10,368
Although Rodger makes it very difficult

545
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:17,024
His stunts people's people on the planet for whom guilty-until-proven-innocent

546
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,560
Should probably be the rule

547
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,584
Yeah

548
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,120
I'm so it would go

549
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
Stop the time

550
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,248
Practice written this book

551
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,272
Tucker Carlson

552
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,808
Questioning

553
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,256
Little people

554
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,304
Close everything else is open

555
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,584
Box Store

556
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,400
Alex is missing the point of stelter's beasts here

557
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:59,776
The notion that the global Elites are using covid to reshape society and crush the little guy as Felder puts

558
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,872
Three small throwaway line that he uses to describe Glenn's book is

559
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,688
The piece is actually entirely about a specific

560
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,968
Claim the back makes on Tucker

561
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,504
Commercial about officials in Washington

562
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,320
Meeting to plan internment camps

563
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,112
To put on vaccinated people

564
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,904
Tucker doesn't ask any

565
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,184
Gender pushback at all

566
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,048
But just listens with his wife quizzical look weirdos

567
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:26,656
A take on that is the central thing that Alex needs to refute

568
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,960
If he's going to cover this video which will see if he does

569
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,728
Funny actually

570
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,496
Gets out of business

571
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,568
Also really Alex needs to update his dog

572
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,360
Does he really expect

573
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,408
We're only big

574
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,712
What stores are allowed to be open at this point

575
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:43,296
I got you something you remember saying from like a year-and-a-half ago that just

576
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:47,136
He doesn't realize isn't true anymore even if he back then

577
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,696
Yeah I don't know what it is that

578
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,720
Or not

579
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:57,120
Parts or is that that narrative whenever you start as muscle memory start digging deep back in there you don't know what

580
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,144
It's still part of that

581
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,912
And he doesn't

582
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,704
No so it's just going to come out

583
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,496
Yeah it's like

584
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,288
I threw up a little bit of

585
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:09,920
Like a demon coming out of the CERN collider that narrative

586
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,200
Just pop back up

587
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,480
So

588
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,784
Galaxy be interested

589
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,320
Primarily on Focus

590
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,088
Kissing on the wrong

591
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:29,888
Beginning of

592
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,656
Smelter

593
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,472
P-Square Huey's East suspect

594
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,240
The Glenn Beck

595
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,008
May not have

596
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,288
Written the book because

597
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:39,104
Back starts with this is the best book I've ever read

598
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,384
I mean wrote

599
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,480
I wrote that it's okay with making fun of that

600
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,440
Oso

601
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,488
So you didn't we did have a Ghostwriter

602
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,512
Okay

603
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,280
Does it matter

604
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:00,608
The point is he's exposing

605
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:03,168
Hey Global compilation

606
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,216
What's unfolding

607
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,592
Things in the book

608
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,920
Was no evidence

609
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,600
Is it just made up

610
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:25,440
The great reset

611
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,976
He does say that the Washington

612
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:33,376
Is made up though but you can see here how Alex is intentionally misrepresenting what stelter piece was about

613
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:36,448
So you can get mad about it without exposing his audience the actual point

614
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:42,592
If you just insist that he was claiming without providing any proof of X book is all made up the audience

615
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,128
Going to turn the lies that

616
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:48,992
The claim is that still there was saying that the great reset is completely made up the audience can conclude that

617
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,784
It's. There's an intentional liar

618
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,112
And this critique of stalkers shity journalism should just be ignored

619
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,672
At the end of the day Alex is basically just trying

620
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:59,744
Provide cover for Tucker like some sad underlined signify

621
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,536
Anything bad that said about the boss

622
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,352
Yeah

623
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,936
Specific thing that Glenn Beck talks

624
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,520
What about is completely made up and that is the story about

625
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,568
Should stay preparing internment camps for unvaccinated

626
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,336
Native people

627
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,872
That's because that's totally made-up

628
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,968
Piece of legislation passed in 2003 in wash

629
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,272
Washington title wac 246

630
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:25,600
6-10 0.040

631
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:31,488
This legislation allows local Health officials to quarantine individuals or groups of people in very narrow cases

632
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,024
Where there's an emergency regarding a

633
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,096
Chemical biological radiological agent

634
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,376
Or a communicable disease

635
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:43,264
If you read this with very Paranoid Eyes there's a way you can make it seem like it applies to covid but it doesn't

636
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,568
This was passed in 2003

637
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,848
But it's

638
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:50,432
Discussion recently but not because the government wanted to make it apply to code

639
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:56,576
In June 2020 the Board of Health passed the engrossed substitute House Bill 1

640
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,600
1551

641
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:02,208
Change stigmatizing language in wac 246

642
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:05,792
Stash 100 in regards to HIV and AIDS

643
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,120
This was something that HIV Advocates have been pushing

644
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:12,448
Forsyth 2014 when Governor Inslee had set a goal

645
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:16,544
Ever doosan AIDS cases in the state by 50% by 2020

646
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:20,640
This section wac 246 100

647
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:24,736
Is something that has a slot in the agenda at every Board of Health meeting

648
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,016
Because they

649
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,040
Discuss what

650
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,576
What's going on

651
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,112
Updates need to be made

652
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,928
But this argument gets made if they're planning

653
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,464
To do this

654
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,256
20 when the sexual

655
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,792
I feel was Pat

656
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:40,096
This is a real a real thing

657
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,120
But there's also a fake

658
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,400
Fixing that

659
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,704
Stelter brings up that he applies to

660
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,728
People that Glenn Beck

661
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,264
Claiming there's going to be in tournament

662
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,032
Cancel.

663
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:53,920
There were a couple of viral posts on social media with a headline from a site called the value

664
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:57,248
Has American not vaccinated

665
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,040
Before 2022 will be put in cash

666
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,136
Supposed to satire and it's labeled as satire

667
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:06,208
If anyone took the time to read it they would find some red flags like

668
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:06,976
This paragraph

669
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,024
Many patriotic America

670
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,864
Can living in Texas and Florida have announced they have no plans of going into such camp

671
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,400
One texting tweeting

672
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,960
Yeah good luck I have mines around my Ranch

673
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,240
That's good luck to the feds

674
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,032
Another Floridian tweeted

675
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:23,616
Will there be a mess in the camps if so it isn't really that bad

676
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:27,456
Local kids are actually looking forward to these camps as they believe it'll be

677
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,504
The closest deliver gets getting laid

678
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,040
Well also not having to get a shot

679
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:31,808
At the same time

680
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:36,928
I'm not even sure what the joke is there but I really really don't like

681
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:43,584
This itself is just a post that they stole from the stock market and then reposted on this body walk site with

682
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,656
Reposting on value Waukee

683
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:53,056
Screenshot and then Cheryl Oliver conservative in conspiracy-minded social media where people can take in the message without

684
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,872
Reading the clearly absurd article that is labeled satire

685
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:02,784
Adult poorly-written Joakim not be passed off as a serious article and Pete because people don't look into things they just assume it's

686
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,088
This relates to our subs

687
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:10,208
Because stelter brings up that claims of internment camps for the unvaccinated trace back in some cases

688
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:10,976
Satire

689
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,792
But I do think that he needed to do a better job of

690
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,560
Distinguishing

691
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,864
That as it relates to the specific example of washer

692
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,912
Washington state of that camp conspiracy

693
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:22,752
This is your uncle article is background to the real misrepresentation of the stuff

694
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,520
About washing

695
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,312
Updating the language in their bill

696
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,104
To reduce hiv-aids stigma

697
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,176
This leads me to an unfortunate point

698
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,456
And that is what I'm going to have

699
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,504
Have to take stelter to tasks a little bit here

700
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,040
But for different reasons than Alex

701
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,344
Cuz he's ugly Ono

702
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,160
Well about the Washington State campus

703
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:45,536
Conspiracy USA Today fact-check said that this conspiracy started from a satirical post

704
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,072
That is not true

705
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:50,656
The USA Today article is about the valuewalk article that I meant

706
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,960
The better to go but it actually has nothing to do with

707
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:53,728
Specific case

708
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,752
In Washington

709
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,776
Except like I said

710
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,056
As like pre-tax

711
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,360
Extra background

712
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:04,736
This matters because filters pieces about missing information and how sloppy mistakes from the media

713
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,272
Can Aiden spreading bulshit

714
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,600
He's somewhat undercut by the fact that

715
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,904
He himself is making a sloppy mistake here

716
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,928
And attributed to watch

717
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,976
Conspiracy to this satire article

718
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,000
Instead of disgust

719
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:18,560
Actual misrepresentation of the Board of Health bill

720
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:24,192
That mistake whatever the cause can be used by people like Alex to claim that he's covering up valid concern

721
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,216
Very least

722
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:29,568
Undermine the idea that people who are critical of right-wing misinformation know what they're talking about

723
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,384
I wish you done better here but at the same time Alex

724
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,944
Sister lying about the conversion of

725
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,712
What stop they're saying

726
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:38,016
So that he doesn't have to deal with a broader point

727
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,552
The Stompers making which is actually

728
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,088
The broader point is correct

729
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:44,416
Write the sloppiness is just there which is important

730
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,184
No I'm

731
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,072
Yeah but it's like what are you going to do journalism tired and it's not like they're paying him hundreds of thousands of dollars

732
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,352
Is there something or he has a giant

733
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,656
I-team available to him or anything along those

734
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,192
I feel like

735
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,240
Run into the

736
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,264
This a bit

737
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,032
Like these thought

738
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,312
The answer is

739
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,872
But there's there's a part of me that feels like

740
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,968
Obviously coverage of this misinformation stuff is important that needs

741
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,504
Speed needs to be done

742
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,576
I wonder if an organization

743
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,112
With paradigm

744
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,136
I'm like CNN

745
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,440
No is actually the answer is already

746
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,232
I did I wonder if

747
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,792
Those those Outlets are actually even possible

748
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,584
Of presenting it in the way

749
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,608
Wow that there's

750
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,400
Their shows run as it is

751
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,240
I don't know I mean ignored it seems like it might be possible but I

752
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,008
I I don't

753
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:34,080
It is only possible to the extent

754
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,616
That the other factors

755
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,408
That they have to

756
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,712
Kowtow to will allow it

757
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,528
Like as long as they're a prophet

758
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,552
Driven Network

759
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,880
Misinformation is also part of their job

760
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,184
You don't make money by telling people

761
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:49,952
The truth all the

762
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,512
You know like it that's just how it works

763
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,536
When you run

764
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,584
So many different ads

765
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,352
How many different things

766
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,936
When you're trying to tell all of these different stories all at the same time

767
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:02,496
In such a short amount of time you're going to lose

768
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,264
A lot of s***

769
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,800
And you're going to wind up doing

770
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,080
Sloppy

771
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,104
Right

772
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:11,712
It's it's kind of similar to what we're experiencing here in so far as

773
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,480
What you can

774
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:15,040
Can do is you can say that this is tracked

775
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,088
Back to a satirical piece

776
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,368
USA Today fact

777
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,928
That is a true demonstrable

778
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,000
Right but it's not

779
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:24,768
But it's not

780
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:28,864
It's a condensation of the way that the entire sequence

781
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,632
Event happen

782
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,656
And so instead of

783
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,448
Misinformation maliciously

784
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,240
They wind up because of the

785
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,264
Constraints of there

786
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,312
Time structure because of the constraints of

787
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,616
Money and so on and so on and so forth

788
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:44,736
Doing these little things and they add up

789
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,760
Often times

790
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,296
It's the result of

791
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,088
New shows

792
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,624
Are made run maybe their needs

793
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,648
To be some changes

794
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,416
To that

795
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,208
I don't know exactly what those changes are

796
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,024
But for my purposes what I'm most

797
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,304
Interested in is

798
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,352
Particularly when the subject

799
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,120
It's being covered

800
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,144
This misinformation

801
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,168
And

802
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,472
You know stelter's calling out

803
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,496
Write like

804
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,312
Media entities that are

805
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,360
That are like they make a mistake and that it's

806
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,128
Poundstone

807
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:15,968
But you can't do that you can't do that and then make this kind of a mistake

808
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,992
It's just b*******

809
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,016
Well I mean

810
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,296
There their trap

811
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:22,624
Because the people who have been on the misinformation beat

812
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,464
Have gotten really good at it over the past five

813
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,232
5 to 10 years

814
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,792
And the mainstream networks didn't bother

815
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,352
It wasn't really important

816
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,376
Into them they were

817
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,400
Just doing the news

818
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,960
So now they're trying to step into space that

819
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,312
Well-trodden by people who are very very good at it

820
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:44,640
And they don't want to hire them and so

821
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:48,224
Like I don't know what speaking for myself I don't want them exactly

822
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:48,992
Exactly

823
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,528
Yeah I don't know

824
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,344
So Alex has some clips

825
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,880
But he wants to promote that he doesn't

826
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,672
He doesn't have or Lisa doesn't ask

827
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,464
Can we play

828
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:03,328
Glenn Beck

829
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,008
Thank you you're so dumb

830
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,440
Yes you put the cheapest

831
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,488
Protractor

832
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:34,560
Guys are all talk like that

833
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,472
I think I think Alex is doing these impressions

834
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:47,872
Because he promised

835
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:51,712
His hat Subway was talking about

836
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:55,552
Like just childish outbursts and so he has to do these voices

837
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,344
Right right right he's got to have an outlet

838
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:00,160
Yeah I would love for him to

839
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,208
To play the clip of the head of Pfizer saying

840
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:07,584
Oh we put the chip in Algood

841
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,120
Yeah I don't

842
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,192
Confident

843
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,728
Teddy's making this up

844
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:16,032
I'm also confident that he never plays it on this site

845
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:16,800
Yeah sure

846
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,128
Alex ends up playing this

847
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:20,896
Shelter

848
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,944
And I did notice

849
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,992
That he does not interrupt

850
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,808
Because I think of you'd is holding himself back

851
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,880
About this

852
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:33,184
It's professionalism I have to be professional ow

853
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,488
So he gets about a minute and a half

854
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,048
The way through

855
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,608
And here's where we're at

856
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:43,168
Sit there and listen to

857
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:47,520
Amazon right now

858
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,056
Because

859
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:00,575
20 seconds

860
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,159
Notice

861
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:07,231
He says he did he even showed his book

862
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,023
He showed his penis on air

863
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:13,119
What

864
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,423
Free speech

865
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:22,335
I'm not sure I've ever seen Alex have so much

866
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,359
Nothing

867
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:28,991
Like I said he doesn't talk over the cliff with any other up to that

868
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:35,391
I'm so confused about what he's even mad about like I don't remember where I watched it I remember stelter saying anything about showing the book

869
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,671
So I went back and

870
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:37,695
Listen to it again

871
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,463
The beginning

872
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,231
He says this

873
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:43,839
If you take a step back and think about it but covid-19 pandemic is a chance for salesman

874
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,607
To self fear

875
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:48,191
Take the unvaccinated Glen back who's been selling his new book

876
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:48,959
Sick with covid

877
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,007
He said Schilling his book

878
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:58,431
That was just so much nothing that he went back to the start of the video to find something to get mad about it was a word he misheard

879
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,199
Oh my God

880
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,223
This is pathetic

881
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:05,087
Wow wow

882
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:11,487
Well thanks Alex ends up not being able to

883
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,815
Mr. Potato Head here we go

884
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,095
That was that

885
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:16,863
Up there

886
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,447
Literally

887
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,311
It's all over the world

888
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,759
Do states have bills

889
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:39,135
Anyone they want

890
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:39,903
In the government

891
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,695
Children away

892
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,535
Announcements

893
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:55,007
Stupid

894
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,287
Just couldn't do it

895
00:43:56,543 --> 00:44:02,687
Couldn't do it I think it is admirable the effort that he made though

896
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:09,087
For him especially

897
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,367
You can almost

898
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:16,767
Feel Alex kicking himself at the beginning of the clip though knowing that he'd essentially failed his own self assign tasks

899
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:23,167
As for the snacks are news Alex has about KFC's leading with lying about the Washington

900
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,215
Sense8 story that we've already discussed to

901
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:30,079
The fact that was his go-to as a pretty strong indication that the

902
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,639
This pack is probably just printed out memes and poop

903
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:38,271
I guess he's going to get into this tacky though so let's let's go

904
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,319
Potato Head.

905
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,367
Mr. super Potato Head

906
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,927
Nonsense filter blast

907
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,631
Covid-19

908
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,167
Directions

909
00:44:56,447 --> 00:45:00,799
This is exactly what is she in the legislation and exactly what's been implemented outside of it

910
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,847
Emergency order by the governor Washington

911
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:09,503
Conspiracy

912
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:12,063
Alex is making up that part about the Washington bill

913
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:18,463
Still just about the updating of the language we discussed earlier but he's pretty committed to covering for Tucker's negligence

914
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,511
Defensible

915
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:27,167
After this other document I believe that this is what I was referring to a couple episodes back when he said that the CDC had documents about wine

916
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:29,215
Internment camps

917
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,799
Sounds like what the f*** is he talkin about I think it's this

918
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:38,175
The first words that really jump out to you when you hear the title of this document or humanitarian setting

919
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:43,807
That should tell you a little bit about the context of this document and how it's about strategies they could be

920
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,087
To limit the spread of covid

921
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,135
In settings like camps for displaced persons

922
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,159
And refugee

923
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:51,231
Now the title itself might make you think that this

924
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,511
The document that laid out

925
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,303
Plans

926
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,631
Instead it discuss the pros and cons of exploring

927
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,655
Specific strategy

928
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,935
BB shooting approach

929
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:04,031
To explore possible challenges that one would have him

930
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,055
Implemented

931
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:08,895
Approach was basically a plan where you would have areas

932
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:12,735
In these places like refugee camps that would be isolated from the larger camp

933
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:15,807
And what you do is you put people who are at higher risk

934
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,855
Developing serious covid cases there

935
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:18,879
Has a way of shielding

936
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:21,695
This can be done on various scales

937
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,999
It could be done within a household even if you

938
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,279
Just had a part of the house

939
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,047
Chernobyl

940
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,071
This is what

941
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:27,839
Disgusting

942
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:31,679
Also it would be a mistake to assume that this document thinks that it's

943
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,215
The great idea to use this track

944
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,239
Do you also

945
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,543
In theory shielding may serve its subject

946
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,079
To protect high-risk population

947
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,359
Confirm disease and death

948
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,639
However

949
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:43,199
Implementation of the approach necessitates strict

950
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,223
Security protocol

951
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,247
Inadvertent

952
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:51,135
Introduction of the virus into a green zone may result in Rapid transmission among the most vulnerable populations

953
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,927
This approach is trying to protect

954
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,975
This is very sexual problem

955
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,791
What is called out

956
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:01,631
If you read the actual entire document You Come Away with a Santa

957
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,423
That the CDC is saying that this approach

958
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,191
May work

959
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,495
But there's no empirical evidence that it will

960
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:09,311
And at the challenges and downsides are pretty real

961
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,615
Take this passage from the summary

962
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:17,247
Quote Public Health not only focuses on the eradication of disease but addresses the entire spectrum of Health

963
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,015
And well-being

964
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,039
Population

965
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:25,439
Displaced due to natural disasters or war and conflict are already fragile

966
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:28,767
Experienced increased mental physical and or emotional trauma

967
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,815
Well the shielding approaches not meant to be

968
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:31,583
Be coercive

969
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,167
Hit me a forest or be misunderstood that humanitarian settings

970
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:40,543
As with many Community interventions meant to decrease covid-19 morbidity and mortality

971
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:43,871
Compliance and behavior change are the primary rate-limiting

972
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,431
Steps and may be driven by social in Emotion

973
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,199
No factors

974
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,991
These changes are difficult

975
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,551
And develops table setting

976
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:55,391
They may be particularly challenging and humanitarian settings

977
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,927
Which bring their own set of multi

978
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,207
Faceted challenges

979
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,999
That need to be taken into account

980
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:00,767
Okay

981
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,559
It doesn't seem like they're saying do this

982
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:05,119
This isn't about the creation of any camp

983
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,167
Unvaccinated people to

984
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:11,519
It's about how best to serve folks are in humanitarian settings already

985
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,055
Folsom

986
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,847
The CDC public

987
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:15,871
Affairs specialist

988
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:16,895
Told fact check

989
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:20,479
That the document itself was only prepared as a response to a paper

990
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:25,343
In the London that came out from the London School of hygiene and tropical medicine

991
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,879
That argue in favor

992
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:27,903
The shielding approach

993
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,463
So in response to that they didn't analysis

994
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:37,375
Also this was primarily an analysis at the CDC CDC did as a resource

995
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,679
Are other countries who have larger populations

996
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,703
Displaced persons

997
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,519
I wear this question was a much higher priority

998
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,823
All the stuff Alex is a bulge

999
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,615
Like none of us has any connect

1000
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,383
Listen to reality

1001
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:52,223
Although the title of the document if you ignore the what it is

1002
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:56,063
If you are the everything title doesn't really work

1003
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,367
Because it has humanitarian settings

1004
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:00,159
And it and like I don't know

1005
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:02,719
I guess it sounds scary though okay here's my

1006
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:03,999
Alright

1007
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,279
My pitch is

1008
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,303
We do setup

1009
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:07,583
Alright

1010
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,351
But

1011
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,375
We make

1012
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,655
Them so

1013
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,447
Like the best

1014
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:17,055
Horses

1015
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:23,711
Really great water ever access the water

1016
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:30,367
Inflatable thing we can lay on the end of your jumps off of Guyana

1017
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:35,487
One roller coaster maybe two I don't know I'm getting ahead of myself

1018
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:38,303
Budgetary restraints Minecraft

1019
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,583
But the point is

1020
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,863
It's we make it so nice

1021
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,167
Eventually everybody in the camp

1022
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:45,727
Realizes that the real camp

1023
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,263
Is the United States

1024
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,663
So there's going to be hallucinogenic

1025
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,943
Okay

1026
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,295
To get to cuz I was away

1027
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:04,415
Operation

1028
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,095
Look it up

1029
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:17,215
Why did Alex's reading this headline from Mike Adams light natural

1030
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:22,591
Look it up it's written by a guy named Ethan Huff but I got to think about the byline name

1031
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:27,199
Do people arriving under because otherwise holyshit this guy cranks it out

1032
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:32,063
Kennedy blog is that was Ethan Hawke's pen name

1033
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,951
This blog post was really just a reposting of something from another blog written by a guy named

1034
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:38,719
Steve rotter

1035
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:39,999
1 days

1036
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:42,815
Steve was poking around on the website of the world domestic

1037
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:46,399
Preparedness Consortium organization which is a federal organization

1038
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,679
Train people in rural

1039
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:50,751
And tribal communities how to respond in cases of emergencies

1040
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:51,775
Like natural disasters

1041
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,567
This is a great program

1042
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:56,639
In no small part because it helps these communities have autonomy

1043
00:50:56,895 --> 00:51:00,991
And not rely solely on the more develop resources of neighboring more urban areas

1044
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:05,087
I think point out areas with smaller populations will likely

1045
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:08,927
Not have the tax base that would be required to staff Public Safety age

1046
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:12,511
Please show the rdpc helps train folks for free to help there

1047
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:13,535
Right

1048
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,327
TPC offers

1049
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:18,143
Constant training opportunities in both in person context

1050
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:18,911
When available

1051
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:21,215
And on their website in Virtual class

1052
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:28,383
Steve was cruising around their website and found a training course available titled E3 isolation in Corinth

1053
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,919
19 for World communities

1054
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:35,039
He misinterpreted the context of the organization and decided to conclude that this was a nuke

1055
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,087
Or that it was somehow related

1056
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:37,855
The covid

1057
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,391
But that's not the case

1058
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:45,535
It's important to understand that a lot of the courses that the rdpc offers are facilitated through University

1059
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:48,351
And of course that Steve is up in arms about

1060
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,887
Is one that's offered by Eastern

1061
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,911
Kentucky University

1062
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:53,215
Be confined at existing as a course offered

1063
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,007
In conjunction with the rdpc sense

1064
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,031
Years before covid

1065
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:56,799
What is even a thing

1066
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:01,151
It's actually slightly unclear to me but based on our current website it seems like

1067
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:03,711
EK you handle some other courses at this point

1068
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:07,807
And the quarantine classes now done by the Northwest Arkansas Community College

1069
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:08,831
For the sake of clarity

1070
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:15,999
The syllabus for the course is available on the rdpc website and explain some of the class involves things

1071
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:19,839
Legal and ethical considerations of isolation and quarantine

1072
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,375
My Ding-a-Ling

1073
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:23,935
Getting into the developer details

1074
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:27,775
This becomes important because what Steve is done for his blog post

1075
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:30,847
Is that he's gone into the course module and selectively

1076
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:33,919
Taking screenshots that he can use to make them

1077
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:34,687
Look sinister

1078
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:41,343
It takes a page that discusses the differences in legal and ethical considerations you have involuntary vs. involuntary Courant

1079
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,111
Teen situations

1080
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,159
Play the this is about getting people to

1081
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,183
Comply because

1082
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,975
They point out that involuntary

1083
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,767
These are more taxing on resources

1084
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,559
And much more complicated regarding

1085
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,375
What is this

1086
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,679
Dealing with that is a descriptive reality

1087
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:57,727
Is is being represented as like

1088
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:01,311
Yeah we got to coerce people to do is voluntarily with them

1089
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:04,127
I mean it's it it is it is like

1090
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,407
The far-right has this

1091
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,175
This

1092
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:06,943
I don't know if it's

1093
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:07,711
Coordinated

1094
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,503
It feels like it is where they fine

1095
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:10,783
The most

1096
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,319
Innocuous

1097
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,111
Just good idea

1098
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,135
Just like hey

1099
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:17,951
Here's what we're going to do we're going to help people learn

1100
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:19,487
Respond

1101
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,255
2

1102
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,023
Emergency

1103
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:24,351
Nothing beyond that there's no

1104
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,655
No nefarious element to this at all

1105
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:30,751
Like something that they can turn into fairies

1106
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,775
Like it's just

1107
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:34,847
259

1108
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:38,431
Because it's it is utility for the larger argument so they won't pay

1109
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:44,831
Totally thought that was bad worse is his handling of a slide about how responders need to respect

1110
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:45,599
People's privacy

1111
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:50,207
He acts like it's somehow about being sneaky but it's clear from the slide

1112
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,231
It's disgusting

1113
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:54,559
I'm concerned about a stigmatizing illnesses or potential illnesses

1114
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,095
Can be inside a community

1115
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:56,863
So you should

1116
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,679
Advertise to the neighborhood that someone might be sick

1117
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,959
That's what this is about

1118
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,287
No I thought you were supposed to get pictures

1119
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,311
Pitchforks torches

1120
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,847
Straighten

1121
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,383
And in such a way that

1122
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:11,967
Could be a perfect jump off point for a shity blog like natural news

1123
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,503
The Christmas story even further

1124
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:16,063
From their post regarding the need for privacy

1125
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,879
Quote the emergency responders holder Victor

1126
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,159
DeCamp

1127
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:23,487
The rdpc encourages them to be as discreet as possible in order to

1128
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,535
To keep the ordeal as much Under Wraps

1129
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,303
As possible

1130
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:29,631
You see how this goes

1131
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:33,983
TPC training courses something has been offered for years and was never notice

1132
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,799
Just until it became useful to push a covid conspiracy

1133
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,079
And you can see the

1134
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:41,151
Consistent pattern in bulshit dissemination on full display

1135
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:46,527
Courses benign and a helpful resource that's provided to Rural and tribal communities

1136
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:51,647
T-brace a horrible blog post misrepresenting it which is his picked up

1137
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:54,207
And further sensationalize play natural news

1138
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:59,839
Alex been reports on the headline that NaturalNews put on the article and makes up a story about what he wanted to me

1139
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,631
This pipeline is very

1140
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,399
Consistent

1141
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:05,983
Alex can pretend to have the Deep sources that he has all he want

1142
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,519
But really you just as stacks

1143
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,823
To print it out pages of bulshit blog post

1144
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:10,847
That don't have

1145
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:14,175
Have anything to do with the reality of what underlies

1146
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:16,479
The b******* that he's talking about it's just

1147
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:20,575
I get I grow frustrated with this clearly

1148
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,111
Traceable patch

1149
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,439
What a fun way to view the world

1150
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:26,719
Pads

1151
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,511
The government

1152
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:29,791
Is coming to

1153
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:31,839
To take people away when they're sick

1154
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,119
And

1155
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,143
To be kind

1156
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:37,983
They have a training module that make sure they know to keep

1157
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,007
Quiet

1158
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:41,823
Right so you don't mess up with anybody's private

1159
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,359
Really nice

1160
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,663
Just you know that's

1161
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:46,943
The cover-ups

1162
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:49,247
What kind of insane person would look it up

1163
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:51,551
F****** slide-in be like what

1164
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,343
Obviously they're training people

1165
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:55,647
Keep it quiet when they abduct

1166
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,695
Bavarian I would be crazy

1167
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,487
Alex

1168
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,255
Another

1169
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,303
Peace and it's tacky

1170
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:03,839
So far

1171
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,375
Here's the worst part

1172
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,543
48% of Democrats

1173
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:19,967
People shoulder their habitat

1174
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:28,415
So Alex has two strikes

1175
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,695
From the last two Club

1176
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:37,375
He saved himself from striking out by getting a ball on this one

1177
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:42,239
Going to I'm going to skip that town hall post to just go straight to the Rasmussen data on this line

1178
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:45,823
Headline from January 13th

1179
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,663
Covid-19 Democratic voters support harsh measures against on vac

1180
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,967
I got to save

1181
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:56,319
Too far off

1182
00:56:57,343 --> 00:57:00,927
There's an important distinction to make by what he's reporting though and what the actual survey

1183
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:01,695
He says

1184
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:06,303
He's saying that 48% of democratic voters want to put anyone who doesn't get a vaccine in a

1185
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,095
I can't but here's what the report actually

1186
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:15,263
Nearly half 48% of democratic voters think federal and state government should be able to find or in prison

1187
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,031
Some individuals

1188
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:22,431
Who publicly questioned the efficacy of existing covid-19 vaccine. Social media television radio or in

1189
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,967
Online or digital Publications

1190
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:29,087
It's not for unvaccinated people it's for people who spread misinformation it also

1191
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,367
This is a bulshit question

1192
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,647
Based on the way the B word

1193
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:35,487
You can tell from the result is at 48% support

1194
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,511
Possible fines

1195
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,535
Or

1196
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:40,095
That's too broad of a question to me many

1197
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:42,655
Do all of these people actually just

1198
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,679
Supported a fine

1199
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:49,823
The result could erroneously give the impression that they wanted to imprison people which wouldn't be reflective of their actual position

1200
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:53,407
Liberty Elementary statistical information gathering

1201
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:55,199
F****** in this question

1202
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,735
Should never have been worded like that

1203
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:58,783
It's the result

1204
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:03,647
So this report question is do you think people who lie should get consequence

1205
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:11,839
Difference in believing that people who lie about public health measures should be fined or they should be.

1206
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,703
That's my point

1207
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:20,287
Your question is so over broadly that 48% means

1208
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,055
Nothing right

1209
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,871
To agree that people who

1210
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:30,015
Maliciously lied to get people killed or punished for it

1211
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:31,807
Be a mechanism for a topical

1212
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:34,879
Yeah so that's at the old the survey also found

1213
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:36,671
45% of Democrats

1214
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:42,559
Would favor governments require citizens to Temporary live in designated facilities or locations

1215
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,863
If they refuse to get a covid-19 vaccine

1216
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:48,959
So in some ways Alex isn't totally lying but the spirit of what the survey says

1217
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,751
He just can't keep the details with a number

1218
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:52,543
Another interest

1219
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,103
The point is that if you look at the more detailed breakdown

1220
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,663
Only 22% of Democrats strong Lisa

1221
00:58:57,919 --> 00:59:00,991
Support this idea well 33% strongly opposed

1222
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:04,319
Overall it seems to me like there's greater opposition then support

1223
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,623
For this even among Democrats

1224
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:12,511
29% of democratic voters support temporarily removing

1225
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,815
Custody of their children if parents refuse to take

1226
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:16,095
Take a covid-19 vaccine

1227
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,703
I'm not really sure that I agree with those 29% of Democrats and also

1228
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:23,775
You look at it the other way that means 71% are not in

1229
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,055
In support of such a plan

1230
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,847
So take your pick on how you want to look at

1231
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:30,175
Also this isn't the question to ask people about actual

1232
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,967
Proposals this is a hypothetical

1233
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:36,063
Overall the course of my time doing the show I've

1234
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:39,903
Come to be a bit skeptical of results that I see from Rasmussen

1235
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:43,999
Early reporting the results of this poll

1236
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,047
I'm not sure that the results of the Pullman

1237
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:49,631
Nor do I think it helps his argument that the government is making camps

1238
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,655
The lockup

1239
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:56,543
It being one of the three pieces of evidence you provided to defend Glenn Beck and Tucker

1240
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,823
Ridiculous segment from stealth

1241
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:58,591
Criticism

1242
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:00,383
Yeah I don't even see how it's relevant

1243
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:03,967
I haven't even done that question so f******

1244
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:04,735
Stupid

1245
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:05,503
Did you support

1246
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:07,551
What do you mean what does that even mean

1247
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:13,183
Do you support taking somebody's kids away with a refuse to give accident if they test positive

1248
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:15,487
Get them to a hotel that's the same f******

1249
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:18,303
Thanks you're taking their kids away

1250
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,327
Like who

1251
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:21,119
What they're trying to say and it's such a

1252
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,399
Stupid question

1253
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,727
There are different ways that you could understand

1254
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:28,543
The question

1255
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:34,175
I think it's a bad idea I think that I would to be a with that 71% that is probably like

1256
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:38,015
I figured that causes more problems that it might alleviate

1257
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,295
Probably not

1258
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:42,623
Another another piece if he strikes out

1259
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,671
Casey At The Bat as it were

1260
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:51,327
Here's another one Utah's largest newspaper called for unvaccinated County lockdown enforced by the National Guard

1261
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,607
Yourself

1262
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:53,887
OKC astruc

1263
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,679
This is an editorial

1264
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,471
The paper isn't calling Freddy

1265
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:00,287
Isn't even calling for what Alex Clare

1266
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,311
From the Arctic

1267
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,335
Quote

1268
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:04,383
Were you taught truly civilized place

1269
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:08,223
The governor's next move would be to find a way to man

1270
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:09,759
Campaign we should have launched

1271
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:10,527
The year ago

1272
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:12,319
Going as far as to deploy the

1273
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:14,623
Metal guard to ensure the people without proof of vaccination

1274
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:15,903
Would not be allowed

1275
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:16,927
Well anywhere

1276
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:19,487
It may be too late for that politically and B

1277
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:24,863
I've noticed that the right-wing and right-wing media figures like Alex in particular really ever

1278
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:29,727
Convenient and I suspect intentional inability to understand the difference between an editorial

1279
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,775
Piece of news or an official state

1280
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,079
Because he plays fast and loose with a

1281
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,103
Distinction between those things

1282
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:39,711
Report an op-ed as if it was a demand being made by a newspaper which in turn

1283
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:42,527
Delete the unjustified conclusion

1284
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,831
I suspect he does that on purpose

1285
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,367
Because it's really easy

1286
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:47,903
Any day of the week

1287
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,439
You can scan through enough papers

1288
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,463
If you do

1289
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:53,023
You'll find something in an editorial to get mad about

1290
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,071
Tattoo the laziness

1291
01:01:55,583 --> 01:02:00,191
You can tell the based on the headline that Alex reads he's not actually talking about the real editorial

1292
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:04,031
He's covering a zerohedge article that's mad about the editorial for him

1293
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,823
Just bullshittin

1294
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,871
Meaningless anyway you strike out

1295
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:09,407
But that doesn't stop him

1296
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:10,687
From claiming Vic

1297
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:14,783
To CNN's got articles about all look at your other getting smart

1298
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:19,647
Australia walking buddy

1299
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:20,927
Portal kill you

1300
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:41,919
Little Shack

1301
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:50,111
Fighting depression

1302
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:56,511
I don't know if this is true but I heard a rumor that Brian stelter is in the New Kingdom Hearts game

1303
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:02,399
Call Tres Amigos wholesale problems

1304
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:05,215
Yeah I went out with his failed across the

1305
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:06,239
The board

1306
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,543
Is dealing with the actual points

1307
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,847
Failure is

1308
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:13,407
Decided not to attack Selter

1309
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,175
She also failed

1310
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:14,943
Yeah

1311
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:18,527
This is really sad to like you provided these specific citations Aleve

1312
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:21,087
Just got here and I guess he thinks that's enough that he can't

1313
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:23,135
Declare Victory but it isn't at all

1314
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:26,207
Filter central question was about the Washington campus

1315
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:30,303
Conspiracy in Alex didn't demonstrate in any way that it was a real thing or the

1316
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,071
Spell there was wrong

1317
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:35,167
He was flung around a bunch of headlines that he pulled from dishonest blogs

1318
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,447
To create the impression that camp

1319
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:38,239
Being made in some vague

1320
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:39,263
Play somewhere

1321
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:41,311
Or maybe the Democrats support

1322
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,079
The dump

1323
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:45,407
He didn't even address the actual points Elders video

1324
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,711
He's acting like he's

1325
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:49,759
Trying Alex's arguments are meaningless

1326
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:51,551
Nonsense

1327
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,319
Stupid

1328
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:57,695
Yeah in the in the baseball metaphor it would be like if journeyman sec

1329
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:59,231
Second baseman struck out

1330
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:01,535
And then just started running to first base

1331
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,863
And celebrating it through is bad into the crowd and

1332
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:09,727
Ran to second base was screaming and everybody's like oh my God and then he got the home

1333
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,007
Any declared a homerun

1334
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:13,055
And that's how the rules of baseball were

1335
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,151
Exactly how it works

1336
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:18,687
So here's how Alex

1337
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:25,599
Yeah there it is Bill Watsonville

1338
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:27,135
It's not a rumor

1339
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:28,159
Scalp

1340
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:34,047
I need your support. You all you got

1341
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,095
We are the black sheep

1342
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,359
So it does

1343
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:50,943
Arab talk about the afterthought

1344
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:53,759
Hi this is just a Gateway pundit article about the same washer

1345
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,551
Language update due to talk about earlier

1346
01:04:56,319 --> 01:05:02,463
The correct team of sleuths found this wording and the wac 246 100.

1347
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,487
040

1348
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:08,607
Quote a local Health officer May invoke the powers of police officers Sheriff sconce

1349
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,143
Constables and other officers

1350
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:13,215
And employees of any political subdivisions with jurisdiction

1351
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:15,775
How the health department to enforce immediately

1352
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:18,847
Orders given to effectuate the purposes

1353
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:20,127
Other

1354
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,407
In accordance with the provisions

1355
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,431
Of Baba Baba

1356
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:27,295
Found this language of something new or a new bill

1357
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,599
That is not part of the statutes

1358
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,879
The past in 2000

1359
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:36,767
The whole thing is about the revisions they were made to remove stigmatizing language and it's not recent either

1360
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:39,839
Like I said that's up to House Bill 1551 pasta

1361
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:40,863
June 2020

1362
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:44,191
Does Gateway pundit article is straight up stupid

1363
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:44,959
2

1364
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:46,495
It ends with this ominous line

1365
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:49,311
Wac 246

1366
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:55,199
Dash 100-0 40 was certified on October 25th 2019

1367
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:58,783
Months prior to the coronavirus outbreak in the United States

1368
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,831
That's efficient the first case

1369
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:03,647
First confirmed case of covid in the US was diagnosed in

1370
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:05,439
In Seattle on January 20th

1371
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,207
2020

1372
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,743
Florida Steve pieczenik

1373
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:09,791
We all know that we all know that

1374
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:16,447
The implication is supposed to obviously be that they pass this law where Health officials get to be like cops just before the first cases

1375
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,471
Cobra diagnose

1376
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,007
Because they knew the cover was coming

1377
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:22,591
I'm not at the hell people get to act like cops to put Alex and his friends into FEMA

1378
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:26,175
This is just really bad work for a few reasons

1379
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:29,759
The first is that the language about health officials taking on police

1380
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,295
Responsibilities was introduced

1381
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,063
In 2003

1382
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:38,463
You think the larger set of permanent rules of the Board of Health predate that button 2003 large-scale revamp of the doctor

1383
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,231
I was passed

1384
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,255
Hennis was part of wanted

1385
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,279
The sections it was Amanda

1386
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:44,607
The second reason that this is stupid is because the

1387
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:48,191
The claimed this rule was certified on October 25th 2019

1388
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:50,495
Is just based on the fact that the bottom of the

1389
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:53,055
The page that the on the website of the washing

1390
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:55,359
The state legislature where they posted this rule

1391
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:57,663
It says quote certified on October 20th

1392
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:58,687
2019

1393
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:01,247
But that doesn't mean that it was past or even amended the

1394
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,015
That day

1395
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:04,831
If you go and look up other documents from the washing

1396
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:06,111
State Legislature

1397
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:06,879
You'll find it

1398
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:08,415
Literally all of them

1399
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:12,255
Include certified on October 25th 2019 at the bottom

1400
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:18,143
It's really hard for me to tell precisely what the deal is here because I don't work for the Washington legislature but if I had to guess

1401
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:23,007
In October 2019 they went through a process of updating all the files that are posted online

1402
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,287
And a certification date

1403
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,055
Words like that

1404
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:27,871
Okay added a new online portal to change

1405
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,175
Documents are acceptable

1406
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,711
And so in order to do that

1407
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:33,503
You have these listings of the

1408
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:35,551
The existing statutes

1409
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,343
And they are certified by

1410
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,879
The statute law committee

1411
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:40,927
Washington legislature

1412
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:44,255
The idea that

1413
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:47,327
Did the date involves anything related to any statutes went on the book

1414
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:51,423
Is dumb unless you think the state of Washington establish their Department of Commerce

1415
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,959
In October 2019

1416
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:59,615
There's this unfortunate dynamica to play here and if you're a reporter at the Gateway pundit Evan the smallest amount a day

1417
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:01,407
Digging would puncture gigantic holes in

1418
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,175
Understory

1419
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:04,223
The goal is to arrive at a predetermined

1420
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:08,831
In conclusion that provide headlines or someone like Alex or your parents on Facebook to get mad about

1421
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:10,879
Hoping to anger them

1422
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:13,695
We can drive traffic to your site boost ad Revenue

1423
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,231
The best way to do that is

1424
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:15,999
To be lazy

1425
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:19,327
Do not do any of that digging that would end up causing Your Story 2

1426
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,095
Fall Apart

1427
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:24,191
If you see quote certified on October 25th 2019 on that page

1428
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:24,959
You're working

1429
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:31,103
Is done because your assumption fit the narrative but if you explore it more reality might not you don't want to

1430
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:31,871
To deal with that

1431
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:32,639
Oh yeah

1432
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,711
Stelter was wrong and Altima

1433
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,991
Medley after all this

1434
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,527
Think he hasn't demonstrated it

1435
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,831
Anything he's talking about is more than a rumor

1436
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:42,623
Are dumb conspiracy blog headline

1437
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:46,719
Yeah it is a little bit like Gateway pundit

1438
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:47,999
Or like

1439
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,023
Digging for oil

1440
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,071
Alright whatever pop

1441
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,887
Pops out of the ground there like stop jigging we've hit oil

1442
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:55,935
And all they do is hit sewer pipe

1443
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:02,079
Absolutely for the s*** work

1444
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:06,943
So we we get off the stelter tip that's basically his

1445
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:10,015
I do think he managed to insult him

1446
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:12,063
But he still didn't

1447
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:17,695
Was gone

1448
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,487
So stelter business

1449
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,511
Check okay

1450
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,279
Now

1451
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,071
It's Raji tile

1452
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:29,727
But

1453
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:32,543

And I guess right off the bat

1476
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:57,023
I want to thank the thousands of people around the

1477
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:58,815
Curry who have been praying

1478
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:01,631
For my recovery in

1479
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:03,167
What turned out to be

1480
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,191
A much more

1481
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:05,471
Call struggle

1482
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:07,263
With covid-19

1483
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,543
Then I had expect

1484
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:12,127
It is only by

1485
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:14,687
Following a strict regimen of ivermectin

1486
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:17,759
Hydroxychloroquine

1487
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:22,111
Including

1488
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,391
Gay

Chick-fil-A

1491
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:29,535
I and others

1492
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,071
And for the helper

1493
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:33,375
Truly truly gutsy

1494
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,655
Courageous doctors

1495
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:36,959
That I can finally tell you that I am

1496
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:39,519
Back to work and feeling normal

1497
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:41,311
Again doesn't quite match

1498
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:44,639
The way that Alex was describing his case

1499
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:48,223
Earlier than a or b

1500
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:52,063
I think as we go through this we're going to hear him

1501
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:54,623
Talking a lot more slurry than usual

1502
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:55,391
And

1503
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:56,415
I don't know

1504
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:58,463
You could be drunk

1505
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,999
But on the other

1506
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:03,071
It could be a neurological side effects

1507
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:05,887
There are bad like a mild stroke

1508
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:09,471
It wouldn't surprise me that a regular thing and I don't want to make fun of that

1509
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:12,287
I wanted to be as respectful as possible

1510
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,567
Well still make

1511
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:19,711
King fun of Rodger cuz he's a f****** a****** and I hope we'll be able to stay on the right side

1512
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:20,479
Yeah

1513
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:23,551
So Rodger this is the thing that went around Twitter

1514
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:25,855
This is truly

1515
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:26,879
Terrific

1516
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:29,695
And I had all of the worst symptoms

1517
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:30,719
The fevers

1518
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:31,999
The sweats

1519
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,535
The cough

1520
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,815
The congestion

1521
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,095
The body aches

1522
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:37,375
Dementia

1523
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:41,727
Tony fauci in his red Chinese,

1524
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:42,495
Grads

1525
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:43,775
Do superb job

1526
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,311
In the formulation

1527
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:47,615
Audition bio-weapon

1528
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:49,151
Something just doesn't feel right

1529
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:52,735
Like I know that those things can be bad side effects

1530
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,271
Text but that's kind of like

1531
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:56,063
The generic list

1532
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,343
Side effects

1533
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:59,391
It's just something weird about this

1534
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,671
This is off

1535
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:01,695
Yeah

1536
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:03,743
I think it's probably just because it's Rodger

1537
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:08,607
I think it's because we're trained to be suspicious of everything he does

1538
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:14,495
You're just waiting for if if he was laying down bleeding from the skull

1539
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:20,895
I would walk up to him and I be expecting him to have a knife ready to stab me if I went and asked him if you like jelly

1540
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:24,991
Exactly be like immediate like listen man I'm sorry

1541
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:26,015
You earned this

1542
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,551
This isn't me react

1543
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:33,439
Humane way to believe that that's marinara

1544
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,207
Yeah

1545
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:35,487
Anyway

1546
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:41,887
Look hydroxychloroquine Ivermectin

1547
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:46,751
Sean Forte I think he's angling for a bukit

1548
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:07,231
Look I don't know what all of his politics agree

1549
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:09,791
With all of mine but on this issue

1550
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:13,375
Do Olive courses on the issue of cannabis legalization

1551
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:14,911
I totally agree with him what

1552
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:16,447
It was very courageous

1553
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,983
You know they go after him

1554
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:20,287
I know they try to shut him down

1555
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:24,127
But he did was right I honestly think this man saved

1556
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:26,431
Thousands and thousands and thousands

1557
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:31,295
A lot

1558
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,319
Whoa

1559
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:34,367
Lego werewolf

1560
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:35,391
Wow

1561
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:36,671
Wow

1562
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,439
That's

1563
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:38,975
That's depressing

1564
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:39,743
Being

1565
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:40,511
Being

1566
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:41,791
Fundamentally

1567
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:44,095
Not entirely

1568
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:47,935
But fundamentally at fault for the millions of people who have died

1569
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:52,543
And then saying that we've saved hundreds of

1570
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:55,359
He's a real tough pill for me to swallow

1571
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,151
Yeah it's

1572
01:14:58,175 --> 01:15:00,735
It sucks to hear a really fuksas my head

1573
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,527
Really makes me mad

1574
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,319
Not good

1575
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:09,183
So in addition to declaring victory over covid

1576
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:10,719
Is on for another reason

1577
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,487
And that is

1578
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:12,767
People now

1579
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:14,559
He's about to sue everybody

1580
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:18,143
There are irresponsible elements in the

1581
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:19,423
Fake news media

1582
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,727
Or recycling this notion

1583
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:24,031
That I had either advance notice

1584
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,567
Or some involvement

1585
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:27,103
In the illegal act

1586
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,895
Facts of January 6th

1587
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:32,991
Legally permitted events

1588
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,015
January 2nd

1589
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:37,087
I did have a voluntary

1590
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:39,391
Security detail

1591
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,927
From The Oath Keepers

1592
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:44,511
All of the other speakers

1593
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:46,303
At that conference

1594
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:49,631
They were courtesy of those running the

1595
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:50,399
Legally

1596
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,935
Permission events

1597
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:56,031
Did I came in contact with these in individuals

1598
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,567
Proves nothing

1599
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:00,127
Buy Lettuce take

1600
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,687
Bill Palmer

1601
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:04,223
The Palmer

1602
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:05,247
Report

1603
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:10,111
Summer is going to be sued for 10 million dollars

1604
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:12,159
In the California courts

1605
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:18,815
I think it's actually more suspicious that The Bodyguard was volunteer and that everyone who is high-profile

1606
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:25,215
AO keeper with them feels a little more

1607
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:28,031
He was like oh see everybody had one

1608
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:30,591
That's fine right

1609
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:35,455
Somebody connected to a little Hub what's going on is everyone was involved with the

1610
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:37,247
Conspiracy to wait no that's not what I'm

1611
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:41,343
No I mean I don't know what he hopes to achieve with that bit of information but

1612
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:43,647
Also The Bodyguard had wasn't desenio

1613
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:46,207
Keeper like we said on the last episode it was my quips Emma

1614
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,743
Stewart's operations

1615
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:48,511
Weider

1616
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:54,143
Approve any Real Deals on Rogers Park but it does explain why people have questions for him that they want answered

1617
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,423
Also again

1618
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:58,495
Whip hasn't been indicted or named did any of the

1619
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:00,543
Nancy I was probably isn't a great time for these guys

1620
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:03,359
Go to shift the narrative

1621
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:05,919
People for saying things you don't like cuz these guys are

1622
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:06,943
Free Speech Warrior

1623
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:07,711
Yeah

1624
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:13,087
Sale of free speech so much looking to sue media figures you know I think that's fascinating

1625
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:14,367
I would like

1626
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:17,951
For Rodger to sue me for defamation

1627
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:24,607
Well I separate myself

1628
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:28,191
Jordan may be about to say

1629
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:32,799
It's not possible it's like cuz it's it's about defaming one's character

1630
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:39,711
And the damages from their independent defamation I also have

1631
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:45,343
But you could also make the argument that the public

1632
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:51,231
Sure absolutely so the standards for defamation.

1633
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:53,279
Even though I just don't think it's pause

1634
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:54,559
I think there's

1635
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:57,631
I think he's horrible things about himself

1636
01:17:57,887 --> 01:18:00,191
Google pictures of Wreckers

1637
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:05,567
Constantly about how he plays up that image of him as a villain or whatever Richards

1638
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:06,847
I don't know it

1639
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:10,431
I think the same and Rodger would be hard I think it would be

1640
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,455
I think I

1641
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:14,015
I don't know if anybody has up till this point

1642
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,807
Bill Palmer apparently

1643
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:18,623
Better get his f****** checkbook ready

1644
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:20,159
Good luck

1645
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:20,927
Bell

1646
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:22,207
Bring your check

1647
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:23,743
And your case

1648
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:26,047
Accounts of defamation

1649
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:27,839
The number will probably end

1650
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:28,863
Being much larger

1651
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,655
Because you haven't been

1652
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:31,679
Cautious

1653
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:32,703
You haven't

1654
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:36,799
Also

1655
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:38,079
Would make it

1656
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:39,103
Not true

1657
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:41,407
As senior

1658
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,967
Officials confirm

1659
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:46,015
To the Reuters News service

1660
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:48,063
The FBI found

1661
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:51,135
No evidence whatsoever that Rodger Stone

1662
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:52,415
Or Alex Jones

1663
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:54,975
Was involved in the conspiracy

1664
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:55,743
To commit

1665
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:57,023
Any illegal

1666
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:59,327
On January 6th

1667
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:00,607
Show Mr Palmer

1668
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:01,887
It's your turn

1669
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:04,447
Produce your proof to the contrary

1670
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:06,495
Produce your Witnesses

1671
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:08,031
Contrary

1672
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:09,055
There are not

1673
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:12,127
You're going to be writing a huge

1674
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:13,407
Palmer

1675
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,943
I for one can't wait

1676
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:19,551
I don't think it Rodger understands that he's a public figure in order to make this case fly he

1677
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:22,879
He's going to need to establish actual malice on Bill Barber Park

1678
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:24,159
I don't think he can do

1679
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:31,071
It just seems to me like what's going on here is that like Rodger wants to get that old manly blood pumping again

1680
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:33,119
Eating people game for awhile so now

1681
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:36,191
I think he's getting a little overzealous and making a comeback

1682
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:40,287
He had to be a little bit more like cautious when he was waiting for the

1683
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:46,943
For the delay low for awhile

1684
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:52,063
And now he can go back to being a real s*** head

1685
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:54,623
We all just been waiting for it

1686
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:56,671
So let me put

1687
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:59,231
Any journalist who wants to go

1688
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:00,767
Step up right on notice

1689
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:02,303
Choose me

1690
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:07,423
Being involved in illegal activity on January 1st

1691
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:09,983
Washington d.c. you will be mad

1692
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,263
With a lawsuit

1693
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:15,360
It's in the past you have accused me of being a Russian Trader

1694
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:16,896
You also

1695
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:18,432
Faced with a lawsuit

1696
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:20,224
Show lawyer

1697
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,248
Liberals

1698
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,528
I'm not turning

1699
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:23,552
The other cheek

1700
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:28,160
See that reform is learned

1701
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:31,744
Take the things that Jesus himself

1702
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:38,144
Directly said and say I won't do those my face I follow the law because I would say

1703
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:42,496
Adjusted made me find God in the most sincere way I will

1704
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:43,776
Turn the other cheek

1705
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:45,568
I was sooo you f***

1706
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:48,384
What I found is most important about faith

1707
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:51,456
Is when it conflicts with what you want to do

1708
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:54,016
Your faith actually says it's okay for you to do that

1709
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:57,600
Yeah yeah The Gospel According to Rodger

1710
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:59,136
True strength is when you need

1711
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:02,208
Something believing in faith and then when you don't need it

1712
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,744
Throwing it away

1713
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:07,840
How expensive is a little bit self-conscious I think he's aware that

1714
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:11,168
The audience might be like talking about this s*** all the

1715
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,704
It's getting a little boring

1716
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:16,288
We know you guys are detect

1717
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:20,640
Are running on January 6th

1718
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:22,944
Opposition or terrorist

1719
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:26,528
Kingpin Mastermind terrorist

1720
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,856
People need to know that this is a serious issue with it

1721
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:38,560
This is a big issue even miss McConnell

1722
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:43,680
Problem

1723
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:47,520
You're absolutely right

1724
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:49,824
Tulsi gabbard's and Mitch McConnell

1725
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,128
Hey when you got the two of them together

1726
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,920
That's the most by party

1727
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:55,456
Listen thing I've ever heard

1728
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:59,040
To me like what super innocent people do

1729
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:01,344
This strikes me as a weird

1730
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:05,952
Threatened massive lawsuit against journalists to say things that you don't like cuz from where I'm sitting at

1731
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:07,744
It's just looks like an attempt at intimidation

1732
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:10,304
Rogers suits are going to go anywhere

1733
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,632
Somebody writing an article about Rodger possibly being in trouble

1734
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:18,240
There's no actual bearing on whether or not he's actually going to get in trouble

1735
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:19,520
There's no real world

1736
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:20,800
Consequence I don't know

1737
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:22,080
This is feels like a perform

1738
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:24,896
Alex as the victim

1739
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:25,664
Then the whole thing

1740
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:28,224
And hopefully makes people afraid to put pieces

1741
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,016
Together as it results

1742
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:32,064
As it relates to connect

1743
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,600
3 people

1744
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:34,624
Who are at the capital of

1745
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:39,232
Chill people's desire to

1746
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,512
Cover these stories

1747
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:43,072
And it's a fear that Rodger is going to

1748
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,608
Sue them

1749
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:46,656
Headset said that

1750
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:47,680
False

1751
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:51,008
You know I would like whenever Stewart came on

1752
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:53,824
Knowing what we know now and it came on and just

1753
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:56,384
Started lying through his teeth about how

1754
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,152
They were all

1755
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:57,920
F******

1756
01:22:58,176 --> 01:23:00,480
Giving Medical Aid and s*** like that

1757
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:02,784
Like it that's that's where we're at like

1758
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:07,904
Hey how dare you say that I had anything to do with the six I'll sue you cut

1759
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:15,072
Six months from coming

1760
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:17,120
But it still has the same sort of effect

1761
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:17,888
It's Shifting the

1762
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:18,912
Discussion into like

1763
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:21,984
You going on the attack and yeah and what have you and

1764
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:25,312
It's I don't know it just doesn't feel sincere it's

1765
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:27,104
So this

1766
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,640
It struck me as a little weird

1767
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:34,272
Can barely talk

1768
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:37,856
No I got

1769
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:38,624
Delta

1770
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:45,536
Gorillaz on my chest for 2 weeks almost killed my dad

1771
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:48,864
Annalee still no

1772
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:49,632
Not where he was

1773
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:55,008
Coors Light Rodger didn't. It's a very serious bio-weapon they scanned it two years ago

1774
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:57,056
And I knew it was about 11

1775
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:00,384
Older subject I wanted a little bit

1776
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:01,920
In the next segment

1777
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:04,480
I thought you made it and that's come out in court

1778
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:07,552
Yeah Court okay the court of

1779
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:13,440
I've been recorded public opinion specifically on Alex's show

1780
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:17,792
I just I like that clip a lot because Alex was talking about how

1781
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:18,816
You got covid

1782
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:21,120
And it was like a gorilla was on his chest

1783
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:23,424
But the way you saying that he says

1784
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,728
Okay to grill on my chest

1785
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:32,128
For two weeks almost killed my dad almost killed his dad

1786
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:33,152
Flashlight

1787
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:36,992
There's a ton of interpretation based on Louis speaker

1788
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:38,528
King that are fun

1789
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:39,296
That is nice

1790
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:41,088
Anyway I would like to see the score

1791
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,136
I would like to see a grill on Oz

1792
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:45,952
So I don't I don't know if you would like this is

1793
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:46,976
Martin Luther King Day

1794
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:49,792
So I'm sure we're going

1795
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:50,560
To quote him

1796
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:52,096
No not so much

1797
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:53,888
But Rogers going to tell a little story

1798
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:56,448
By the way

01:24:58,496 --> 01:24:59,776

Aspiring to be president

Private

1819
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,104

President

1821
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:36,896
Richard Nixon

1822
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:39,200
He flew to Atlanta and got a

1823
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:41,504
Private audience with Coretta

1824
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,064
Envelope

1825
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,088
Weather check

1826
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:46,880
Paid for the entire

1827
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,416
College education

1828
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:51,232
Of all of her remaining children

1829
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:53,536
He also did not want

1830
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:56,096
That information publicly released

1831
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:58,400
Richard milhous

1832
01:25:58,656 --> 01:26:04,544
Nixon actually even says like on this day when we remember Martin Luther King we should

1833
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,128
Should also remember what great things like this

1834
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:09,152
Giving them a check

1835
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:15,808
So this seems like a weird list at first we talked about those politicians cuz he says Dick Clark but he's not talking with the Entertainer

1836
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:19,904
I got my head but immediately I was like who is the ball drop

1837
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:24,512
Arizona politician who was elected to the senate in 1972 and for that he was a

1838
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:26,304
Assistant to Jon Culver

1839
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:29,376
How u.s. representative from Iowa

1840
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:30,144
Dick Clark

1841
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:36,288
So the story that Rodger is telling his one that has passed on by a king family friend named xernona Clayton

1842
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,592
But other folks are not so convinced

1843
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:39,616
This actually happened

1844
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:43,712
41 there's no evidence of this check and if it did exist it was never cashed

1845
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:46,016
Secondly Nixon Aid Dwight

1846
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:48,064
Champion told The Daily Beast quote

1847
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:50,368
It's like I'm a hundred percent certain

1848
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:52,160
He would never give her an envelope

1849
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:54,720
There's too much open to interpretation and wrong

1850
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:56,000
Interpretation to do that

1851
01:26:56,768 --> 01:27:02,912
Have you think about it would be a very nice gesture from human-to-human when it's Nixon at MLK's Widow the dino

1852
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:04,192
Hammocks are a little murky

1853
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:11,104
I do think it's important to point out is that according to other Nixon age of this meeting with King was not really something that Nixon wanted to

1854
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,128
Just a secret

1855
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:17,760
Nixons visit with Miss King what was off the Record but that evening in Key Biscayne

1856
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:19,296
Nixon wanted to know how it was

1857
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,064
Playing

1858
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,112
Tape and reminded him that it was off the Record

1859
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:23,136
Nixon

1860
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:25,184
Expected news of the meeting Woodlake

1861
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,232
And was Furious when told it had not

1862
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:29,536
So nickroo another Knicks

1863
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:31,840
Sinead called Atlanta radio stations to

1864
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:32,864
Tip them off that Nicks

1865
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,656
Some had been seen at the king home

1866
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:36,704
But when reporters called the house no one

1867
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:37,728
Confirm the visit

1868
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:41,568
According to these AIDS going to visit Miss Cain was away from

1869
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,104
And to get out of having to go to the

1870
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:48,992
The funeral cuz I didn't want to end it didn't work he still had to go to the funeral I don't know what the reality is

1871
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:50,272
I kind of think that the

1872
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:54,624
Point about Nixon not giving King an envelope because he'll be widely open to interpretation

1873
01:27:55,136 --> 01:28:00,768
Makes more sense with the other facts of reality that I factored in

1874
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:01,792
I'm not sure

1875
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:02,560
You know I

1876
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:05,376
There's something there

1877
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:07,168
Another point that I saw brought up

1878
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:07,936
Was interesting was

1879
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:09,216
That

1880
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:10,240
Nixon was friends

1881
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:12,544
With Martin Luther King senior

1882
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,848
The two of them were on friendly terms

1883
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:18,944
Was suggesting

1884
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:21,248
I could see a possibility where he

1885
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:22,016
He asked

1886
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:23,552
Martin Luther King's father

1887
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:29,184
If the kids were taken care of if there was a college fund for them

1888
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,232
It's a happening

1889
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:33,536
Like something he never would

1890
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:37,888
You know I mean this is a good tip

1891
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:40,192
I'm going to throw this out there

1892
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:41,728
Doesn't change my pic

1893
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:42,496
Opinion of Knicks

1894
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:44,288
Does not

1895
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:45,824
Affected even a little bit

1896
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:47,616
12 look

1897
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:51,712
Route from Rogers perspective

1898
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:53,760
Whenever You Remember by Luther King you must

1899
01:28:54,016 --> 01:29:00,160
Remember that AJ's Martin Luther King Jr's birthday and also the anniversary of Richard Nixon showing that he is

1900
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:01,952
Just as good of a person is Martin Luther

1901
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:05,280
The King Junior sex exactly the case

1902
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:08,608
No s***

1903
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:12,448
So anyway Alex has some thoughts about the I Have a Dream speech

1904
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,520
Amazing

1905
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:21,152
Was it terrorism when he got hundreds of thousands of people are more

1906
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:23,968
Voting rights activist

1907
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:26,528
Wasn't

1908
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:31,136
What was really happening when the election is Democrats and asked for four years before

1909
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:32,416
Constitution

1910
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:35,488
Oh man I guess there must be some kind of real important difference

1911
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:41,888
What happened during the 1963 Civil Rights march

1912
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:44,960
1963 no one storm the capitol

1913
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:50,080
No one knowing that even if you seems like a really important difference at Alex's just ignoring

1914
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:52,128
If Trump and all of his followers are just

1915
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:54,176
Hung out outside the Capitol in the area today

1916
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:56,224
What's 4 + Wade signs of

1917
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:59,040
We probably not even remember the date January

1918
01:29:59,296 --> 01:29:59,808
6 at this point

1919
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:03,136
It'll just be another impotent protests fueled by misinformation

1920
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:08,512
Alex wants to pretend that the man wants to arrest everyone who was there but that's not true that's his

1921
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:10,048
False strawman that he's created

1922
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,096
Being arrested or people who

1923
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:14,144
Also

1924
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:17,216
No one criticized the March on Washington for jobs

1925
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:22,336
The freedom he should look into his own history and see what the John Birch Society was saying about it

1926
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:26,432
Yeah there's a book called the world of the John Birch Society and

1927
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:27,968
Discuss the response to the March

1928
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:32,064
Societies response to these developments

1929
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:35,648
Was both to considerably increase the amount of time and attention

1930
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:37,184
To the question of black civil rights

1931
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:40,256
A frame the issue within the organization to Broderick and

1932
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,536
Conspiratorial understanding

1933
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:43,328
Of Communism is determination

1934
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:44,352
To take over the United

1935
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:48,448
The progenitors of Alex's entire worldview were

1936
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:51,776
The time of the I Have a Dream speech that I was Professor to love so much

1937
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:53,056
Attacking King

1938
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:56,128
As part of a secret communist plot to overthrow the United States

1939
01:30:56,640 --> 01:31:00,480
Which by extension would mean that the March on Washington was secretly a communist March

1940
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:01,760
Attempting to overthrow the

1941
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:02,528
The United States

1942
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:03,296
There would be that

1943
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:08,672
It's fun for Alex everyone supported King in 1963 but the reality is that if he been around back then

1944
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:12,512
At least half of the show would be him reading bulshit headlines about how King was work

1945
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:14,304
Communist Chinese

1946
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,096
Destabilize America

1947
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:17,632
Call just nonsense

1948
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:19,680
Even possibly

1949
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:23,264
Project himself back to that time and realize what a dick you would have

1950
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,056
Unreal

1951
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:26,848
And still is

1952
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:28,128
Yep.

1953
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:30,176
I think this is on

1954
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:30,944
Unfortunate

1955
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:32,480
This is dumb

1956
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:34,528
Those who say

1957
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:37,600
Question Lee reaction results is treason

1958
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:39,904
Their own actions when they got beat by

1959
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:41,440
By George W bush

1960
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:45,536
Everything they are they're accusing us of is exactly what

1961
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:46,304
They did

1962
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:51,680
Real quick question

1963
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:53,984
Results particularly very close election result

1964
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:59,104
Is that was all the folks like Alex and Trump were doing then we wouldn't be in the situation where right now

1965
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:00,640
Question anything

1966
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:06,016
They said definitively that the election was stolen of the Trump won which is a crime against all Americans and people needed

1967
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:06,784
To stand up a

1968
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:07,552
Against the steel

1969
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:08,832
And the cover-up

1970
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:15,488
Even Rodger stupid ass was saying on Infowars the North Korean boats full of ballots were arriving in Maine to steal the election

1971
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:17,024
He did say that it's b*******

1972
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,560
Compare this at all to

1973
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:20,608
The response for the 2000 election when does

1974
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:22,144
Supreme Court essentially decided

1975
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:24,704
Conceited

1976
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:27,520
Also Rodger should probably pump the damn breaks

1977
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:32,128
You're considering his involvement in the 2000 election and how we essentially facilitated a false flag

1978
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:34,432
To get counting of votes stopped in Florida

1979
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:36,992
Mysterious parallels

1980
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:38,272
Smoothies

1981
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,296
Sting enough

1982
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,064
He probably

1983
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,624
Would threaten to sue me for bringing this up let's

1984
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:43,904
Hey it's important

1985
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:49,024
For those who weren't around back then the 2000 election hung in the balance depending on who won Florida

1986
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:51,328
Where the results were ridiculously close

1987
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:54,144
A recount had been underway and then on November

1988
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,424
22nd 2000

1989
01:32:55,680 --> 01:33:00,544
Republican protesters showed up at the Miami-Dade County location

1990
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:04,128
And intimidated the officials there with loud accusations that they were stealing people

1991
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:06,176
It also physical action

1992
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:10,272
Joe Geller was in the Democratic party chairman

1993
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:12,064
For the county and he was on hand that day

1994
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:15,136
Quote this one guy was tripping me and pushing me and Kicking

1995
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:16,160
We're called gallery

1996
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:17,952
Who is now a state legislature

1997
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:21,792
At one point I thought they knocked me over I could have literally got stopped

1998
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:22,560
To death

1999
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:25,120
The Miami-Dade recount ended that day

2000
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:28,960
Billy Bush was certified as the winner by 537 votes

2001
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:29,728
It's on November

2002
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:32,032
With this recount as well as the one

2003
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:33,056
Palm Beach County

2004
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:34,080
Never actually being

2005
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:38,176
Just went back and forth in the courts and we all know how it is

2006
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:39,200
It went great

2007
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:43,552
In 2008 Rodger Stone told the New Yorker that he had essentially been running the operation

2008
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:46,880
These protesters who were actually just GOP

2009
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:47,648
Staffers

2010
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:48,928
Into the recall location

2011
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:49,952
To get it shut

2012
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:56,864
I set up my command center there walkie-talkies and cell phones and I was in touch with our people in the building

2013
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:59,424
Our whole idea was to shut the recount down

2014
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:01,216
And that's why we were there

2015
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:06,080
Another GOP strategist Brad blakeman also take credit for running the event

2016
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:07,872
Who is him who is responsible

2017
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:10,944
Causing a stage Uprising that was intended to disrupt

2018
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:11,968
Carrying out of the Alexa

2019
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,016
For the purposes of installing his

2020
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:15,808
Preferred candidate George W bush

2021
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:17,600
If I were Rodger I would say

2022
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:19,648
Simply not bring up the 2000

2023
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:20,672
Doing so

2024
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:24,512
Has the potential to remind people that he was deeply involved in an event

2025
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:27,072
It's a weirdly similar to the events of the 6th

2026
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:28,096
2000

2027
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:29,120
Kind of

2028
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:31,168
Shut up about that Rogers

2029
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:32,192
Fitbit steps

2030
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:36,544
What serial killer should they always show up and they all want to be smarter than the

2031
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:41,664
Topsail want to dive watch true-crime ship before so I can show up and they're like

2032
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,736
You'll never catch me and I like to drop hints that they did it

2033
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:50,624
I'm going to be given credit for but they don't want consequences for not saying the Rodger orchestrated anything on the six

2034
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:53,440
I'm just saying that his actions in 2000

2035
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:56,768
No that's what I'm saying to be part of a pattern

2036
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:57,792
No he's Bragg

2037
01:34:58,304 --> 01:35:01,888
Every time he brings up the 2000 election as something that went

2038
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:04,704
Well he's bragging about how he made it happen

2039
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:07,008
So weak

2040
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:08,032
Get to it we get to talk

2041
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:08,800
Some other issues

2042
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:11,104
With Rodger cuz it can't all be

2043
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,128
Lawsuits

2044
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:13,920
Martin Luther King

2045
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:16,992
Talkabouttd

2046
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:17,760
Trump

2047
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:19,040
What's going on with Trump

2048
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:21,344
I was talking to Rodger yesterday

2049
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,392
He likes the president respect

2050
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:30,048
As he was with with with

2051
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:32,096
Yesterday

2052
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:37,984
Really just worried about Trump

2053
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,008
And

2054
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:41,056
What you say that she is

2055
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:44,128
Well I don't mean physically I mean

2056
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:49,248
Direction has Diet Cokes again I guess

2057
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:50,272
I guess

2058
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:53,344
Snap now he's too feeble in the mines and

2059
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:56,928
So Rogers main point is that he takes issue with

2060
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,208
The drop is making

2061
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:00,000
Endorsing the right candidate

2062
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:01,536
It's some of his

2063
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:02,816
Cheeks come off

2064
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:03,840
Little racist

2065
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:06,400
What perplexes me

2066
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:08,704
Some of his endorsements

2067
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:09,984
Endorse

2068
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:12,288
Congress Marriott

2069
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:13,568
Diaz-balart

2070
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:15,360
Miami

2071
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:16,384
Donald Trump

2072
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:19,200
Mario diaz-balart

2073
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:21,248
From the Frito Bandito

2074
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:26,112
Tell you that if it wasn't

2075
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:32,256
Doris Diaz Bellard because he was one of the members of the House of Representatives

2076
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:33,280
The joint

2077
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:36,864
Sue Texas versus Pennsylvania 2020

2078
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:37,632
And results

2079
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:39,680
Seems like Trump is going to be willing to endorse

2080
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:42,240
Subscribe to the idea that he actually want me

2081
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:44,288
Those guys in that in that

2082
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,080
It's how the mob

2083
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:47,104
Yeah

2084
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:50,176
A couple other people that he takes issue with but

2085
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:52,224
It gets to another Hispanic person

2086
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:53,760
Boy

2087
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:56,576
Anna

2088
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:58,112
Lena Luna

2089
01:36:58,624 --> 01:37:02,208
There is no such person in Napoleon Ilona is not Hispanic

2090
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:08,608
Picture of her with an assault weapon wearing military

2091
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:10,400
And she said quote

2092
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:11,936
Until you have some

2093
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:12,704
Build

2094
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:15,008
Blood for this country UK

2095
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:16,032
Understand

2096
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:17,568
For freedom

2097
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:21,152
Anna Paulina Luna never served in combat

2098
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:22,176
And Hurston

2099
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:24,736
In the Air Force was not 16 years

2100
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:29,600
It was 6 months

2101
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:38,560
I have no idea what Rodger is going on about this conversation makes no sense

2102
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:42,144
He's attacking Luna is a bad candidate Alex says that you'd be good

2103
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,192
Play Senator Blumenthal and Rogers

2104
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:44,960
Yes

2105
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:48,288
This is so convoluted because Luna is running for the GOP

2106
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:50,848
The primary to represent Florida's 13th District

2107
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:51,872
In the house of

2108
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:54,944
Meanwhile Richard Blumenthal the senator from Connecticut

2109
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:59,296
These two people have no direct Connection in their election election would

2110
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:00,320
Replace Blumenthal

2111
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:01,088
But anyway

2112
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,880
Luna's up against a stacked

2113
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:05,696
Field of four other candidates in the in the primary

2114
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:08,000
Even if she wanted to be facing Charlie Crist

2115
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:12,864
Forever and the general election already beat her in 2020 e53 247

2116
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:17,984
Really exciting Cedar were back in the arguing about GOP primaries season on Infowars

2117
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:19,776
It's always so fun cuz I was getting

2118
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:22,848
To Bringing complete lunatics with zero chance of winning any prize

2119
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:24,384
Pretender way up in the polls

2120
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:28,736
Seems like a Rogers is hyper focused on local races in Florida 2020

2121
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:30,528
Because I think locally

2122
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:34,624
Keep him there but I don't know if this matter is to Alex's audience and

2123
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,928
Since a little bit of bit of racism

2124
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:40,000
Going through this

2125
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:41,536
This man talking about local politics

2126
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:46,912
You could just write a letter to your local band this stuff about her military service I mean like

2127
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:50,752
Whatever I don't know what the reality is but if you're going to take issue with this

2128
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:57,152
If you got a lot of people with Stolen Valor I'm in your ranks that you need to work out from the top and then go down

2129
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:59,200
And we'll see how long it takes you to get to her

2130
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:03,040
Yeah yeah I think she's a small issue compared to some of these other weirdos

2131
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:05,088
Alex he's a picture

2132
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:07,136
This Anna Paulina Luna

2133
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:08,928
And now we're going to get real

2134
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:09,952
Oh boy

2135
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:13,280
Bigfuture news coming about her

2136
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:27,872
Well it's actually questioned her last name is meyerhofer they truly

2137
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:31,456
Yeah that's a weird question

2138
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:34,784
About a good question at all

2139
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:35,808
Repeat question

2140
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:37,856
So I'm not even going to descend into this

2141
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:40,416
Like very clear races signaling and trying to

2142
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:45,024
Discuss this but I will say that just because Luna's birth name is Anna meierhoffer

2143
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:49,376
That is that is her father's surname that doesn't mean that her mother may not have been in

2144
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:50,400
Entirely of Hispanic

2145
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:51,168
Percent

2146
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:53,216
It seems like Rogers is pulling at straws

2147
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:56,032
Very racist strawberry

2148
01:39:56,288 --> 01:40:02,176
His drawers Luna was popular because she was supposed to be something like the GOP Trump World version of AOC

2149
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:03,456
And it just didn't work

2150
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:08,576
Charlie Kirk initially recruited her to do this Panic Outreach for turning point

2151
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:09,856
Get the extra run for office

2152
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:12,160
Which she did unsuccessfully in 2020

2153
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:15,744
Recycles repeating now and I guess Trump is supporting her as he didn't

2154
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,024
2020 in Rogers

2155
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,560
Racist Lee pissed off

2156
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:20,608
That's

2157
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:21,376
Just

2158
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:22,400
Well you said

2159
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:23,680
She wasn't Hispanic

2160
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:24,448
So what is

2161
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:26,496
That's the answer is

2162
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:28,800
Person answered she is a person

2163
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:33,152
Do the person just like you and me we're all people man yeah

2164
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:36,992
Yeah you keep such a bizarre train of thought on Alex

2165
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:43,392
You know like hold on before I can even begin to discuss insurance

2166
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:45,184
The human being

2167
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,464
First no

2168
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:47,744
Her genealogy

2169
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:49,024
Yeah

2170
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:53,632
Also like this strange Vibe of like

2171
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:54,912
She's trying to

2172
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:56,192
Trick you

2173
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:57,216
Yeah

2174
01:40:57,472 --> 01:40:58,496
Hey listen

2175
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:00,032
GOP voters

2176
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:03,360
This person is it actually Hispanic the thing

2177
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:04,384
No are you

2178
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:07,200
Are we against

2179
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:09,504
Thinking about this

2180
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:11,808
Cuz a lot of eye contact

2181
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:13,600
The redundancies but a lot of

2182
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:14,880
Rogers appearances threat

2183
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:21,792
Sue everybody everybody's going down expect us to get service from point

2184
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:24,864
I kind of figured out what this is

2185
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:27,680
Alex this is a change for me

2186
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:29,472
I'm tired of being on.

2187
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:30,240
Fence

2188
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:34,080
Infowars in Bigfork

2189
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:35,104
People kissing

2190
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:37,152
For my legal defense to defend myself

2191
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:40,224
Now help me go on the attack

2192
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:45,344
These people these mangy

2193
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:48,416
Indoor courtroom

2194
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:50,720
And shoo them and say

2195
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:53,792
What they have. God

2196
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:55,072
It's a little too obvious

2197
01:41:55,328 --> 01:42:01,472
It wasn't paying the bills people weren't excited about the legal defense fund anymore so you trying to rile people up and get them

2198
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:04,800
I'm excited promising that you're going to take these dirty leftist

2199
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:06,080
The court make them pay

2200
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:07,104
Brian like

2201
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:13,504
Has never happened

2202
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:18,880
Strand of fundraiser of the idea that you're going to sue people hate this kind of pathetic

2203
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:20,928
And exactly what I would expect

2204
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:21,696
Simulacra

2205
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:24,000
Yeah

2206
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:26,560
You enjoy paying for my legal defense

2207
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:33,216
Natural territory for Rodger

2208
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:36,032
This whole thing is like always Beyond

2209
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:37,824
Never be defending yourself

2210
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:40,384
You have to

2211
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:41,664
Because the consequences

2212
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:43,456
Not doing so would be

2213
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:47,808
Pretty high the water is used to submit in

2214
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:49,344
I mean something you can make

2215
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:55,744
Never one of your wackamole signs a new little hole you know it feels safe enough to pop back out

2216
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,024
And just

2217
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:58,048
So

2218
01:42:58,304 --> 01:42:59,840
Exhausted

2219
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:00,608
This point

2220
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:07,264
Episode drama Rodger getting covid and suing everybody being a weirdo

2221
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:09,568
Stop being a racist weirdo

2222
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:12,384
This piece of s*** and I wasn't ready for this

2223
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:18,016
I really appreciate him coming on Jimmy Kimmel

2224
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:19,808
Actor

2225
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:23,648
Fortunate Michael in Delavan put in prison because he was questioned the election

2226
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:28,512
That's our big push God Mike lindell's on now

2227
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:30,304
What happened to him

2228
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:35,936
Isn't there and it hasn't he done enough

2229
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:39,776
Drugs to just knock them out for a while at least

2230
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:42,080
Flabbergasted by

2231
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:45,664
The meaninglessness of this episode

2232
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:46,432
Full it is

2233
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:48,992
Of of dangerous weirdos

2234
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:55,392
Amazing anyway Mike Lindell has complained that his bank doesn't work with him anymore

2235
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:58,720
And dammit you got to tell your friend

2236
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:00,256
You guys

2237
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:02,560
You go out there you might have a hundred friends or

2238
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:05,376
Whatever you got

2239
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:07,168
Email dammit

2240
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:08,704
And you are call them

2241
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:11,008
Can you do this

2242
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:14,848
We all need to hear about

2243
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:15,872
But you're not hearing

2244
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:17,408
On your terrible news Outlet

2245
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:18,688
News

2246
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:21,504
About anything that's going on

2247
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:22,784
You're not going to tell you that

2248
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:28,416
Company

2249
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:30,464
Charity and

2250
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:32,768
Network does helping addict

2251
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:34,560
Wants to cancel it

2252
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:37,632
Fox News

2253
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:43,264
So Michael remember to take a minute to reflect on the fact that Fox News isn't providing the coverage that he wants because he

2254
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:46,080
She's no longer a major source of their ad Revenue

2255
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:51,200
Have you thought about this for a while you might realize that no one really cares that much about the nonsense he spews

2256
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:53,248
It's just in your financial interest

2257
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:55,552
The humor Mike when he's paying you a bunch of money

2258
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:59,136
He's here spreading the message she wants to ident forwards because

2259
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:00,416
He's a sponsor

2260
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:02,976
Back in the day

2261
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:07,584
Marty Schechter could come on and do f****** Limerick now you got your time

2262
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:10,656
Can do whatever you want to sponsor Alex Gaby

2263
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:11,680
Navigate to come on Inn

2264
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:12,448
Complain about the

2265
01:45:12,704 --> 01:45:14,240
The bank and I wanted to work with him anymore

2266
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:17,568
So it's it's sad let that be a lesson

2267
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:18,848
To all of us never get it

2268
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:22,688
He's clearly a dick

2269
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:27,296
Never allow yourself to be deluded into thinking

2270
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:28,064
That

2271
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,368
Time that you're paying for

2272
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:33,952
In that is indicative of

2273
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:35,232
People's real response

2274
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:38,048
Add time and then

2275
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:41,888
We'll just bizarrely all of a sudden really being

2276
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:49,568
How seriously Fox News takes your complaint seriously into a point where you say

2277
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:52,128
Think that there's more meaning to your shift and there is

2278
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:55,712
Have you learned the hard way that when you stop being one of the main advertisers

2279
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:58,528
All the sudden they don't seem to care about your b******* that much

2280
01:45:58,784 --> 01:45:59,552
So weird

2281
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:02,368
It's almost like if Julia Roberts

2282
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:03,136
Had left

2283
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:04,928
Richard Gere at the end of the movie

2284
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:06,976
Because their financial

2285
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:07,744
Action had been

2286
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:12,608
Spiritual sequel

2287
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:15,424
Sunnyway Altos.

2288
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:18,496
Store

2289
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:22,080
Barber shops in Taken

2290
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:23,616
What you got in power the first

2291
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:25,152
5 years was

2292
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:26,688
His political enemies

2293
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:27,712
King away

2294
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:30,528
And then you know what happened

2295
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:33,600
Notes to listen to so much of this show because

2296
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:38,208
I start picking up on trends that might be settled

2297
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:38,976
The Casual listener

2298
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:45,120
Princeton's Alex always says that whatever he's trying to build a narrative about was actually the first thing Hitler did

2299
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:47,424
This is my to leave the list

2300
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:53,568
The conclusion that if this thing Alex is yelling about his allowed to stand then we're going to progress to the subsequent things that Hitler did

2301
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:58,688
Here we see Alexander the first thing Hitler did was take away his enemies banking inability to do busy

2302
01:46:59,200 --> 01:46:59,712
That's because he

2303
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:00,736
She's talking to

2304
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:02,528
Mike Lindell who wants to

2305
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:04,064
Complain about his bank account

2306
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:05,088
However in

2307
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:07,904
In the past when he's been talkin about grabbing narrative

2308
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:11,232
He's very insistent that the first thing Hitler did was take the gun

2309
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:18,144
This is really just a cheap trick Alex is using to try his imaginary enemies are using the same model

2310
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:19,168
Hitler used

2311
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:21,728
Regardless of what he's actually claiming they're doing

2312
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:26,336
Yeah I mean it would be at that now and I don't know if this is

2313
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:27,360
Possible

2314
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:29,152
But if there was like a document

2315
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:32,480
That Hitler had on like day one like an executive order

2316
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:34,272
And then he just like

2317
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:35,296
Laid out all of

2318
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:37,600
You know like the whole Nazi plan

2319
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:40,416
If you say that the first thing you did was ever

2320
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:42,464
Sure you know

2321
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:45,280
I also think that it's kind of missing the

2322
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:50,400
Leaving the point regardless of what Hitler did first second or third

2323
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:51,424
I do think

2324
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:53,216
Kids missing the larger point

2325
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:55,776
Alex might not care about that point

2326
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:57,312
Yeah I have an apology

2327
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:58,592
You should

2328
01:47:58,848 --> 01:47:59,616
Glendale

2329
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:01,920
No I didn't realize it back

2330
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:03,712
I didn't realize he's got the goods

2331
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:06,016
We have what

2332
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:07,808
Delete it

2333
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,344
Show this is going to

2334
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:12,160
Telling everybody when this comes out

2335
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:13,952
Coming out this month

2336
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:16,256
It is going to be a game-changer

2337
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,304
But our big goal is

2338
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:20,352
And all the states by the way

2339
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:24,960
Electors

2340
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:29,312
Any day now state

2341
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:32,128
Could pull down their electors and then Trump will be president

2342
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:37,248
What I'm sorry I should have taken Mike more seriously can't

2343
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:38,784
I mean this guy

2344
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:40,576
I think the thing about Mike

2345
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:42,112
Is

2346
01:48:42,368 --> 01:48:43,648
She has to believe

2347
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:44,672
That literally

2348
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:46,720
Everyone around him is insane

2349
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:48,512
Right

2350
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:49,280
I think

2351
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:54,656
Fast because there's no way that you can really believe in your mind that you have

2352
01:48:55,168 --> 01:48:56,192
Definitive proof

2353
01:48:56,704 --> 01:49:02,848
That Trump is still the president and be ignored even by Fox News and s*** well

2354
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:09,248
You can look at that rationally and obviously I'm the insane some people are probably insane and then

2355
01:49:09,504 --> 01:49:12,832
Easier to rationalize if everyone else is in on it

2356
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:14,624
Everyone else's

2357
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:16,416
Paid off

2358
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:22,048
Right now you can use that

2359
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:25,120
Yourself

2360
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:26,912
You could just say like

2361
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:28,704
Soros is paying them to

2362
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:34,336
Do not take me seriously or something imagine what it must be like

2363
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:36,128
Like to be in a space where you're like

2364
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:42,272
Definitive proof the biggest news in the history of the world

2365
01:49:42,528 --> 01:49:48,672
Reminder about how information he had would make a 90 Supreme Court case

2366
01:49:48,928 --> 01:49:50,720
Trump into power and it was so close

2367
01:49:54,048 --> 01:49:54,560
Winston Staffing

2368
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:57,120
I appreciate his

2369
01:49:57,632 --> 01:49:58,656
Can-do spirit

2370
01:49:58,912 --> 01:49:59,424
It just keeps

2371
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:00,704
It's going it really does

2372
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:02,752
Boy it is annoying

2373
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:03,520
So f******

2374
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:05,568
Mike Mike's

2375
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:07,616
Concerned about the midterm

2376
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:08,896
Of course because there's

2377
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:10,688
Other ways people

2378
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:11,712
Can vote

2379
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:12,736
In Utah

2380
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:14,784
Officials are

2381
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:19,136
Experimental pilot program in the gym 2020

2382
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:20,928
Municipal

2383
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:22,208
Counties in

2384
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:22,976
Utah

2385
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:26,048
You emailed in your boat or Utah

2386
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,072
Senior vote

2387
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:28,608
Did you hear that

2388
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:30,144
Gmail

2389
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:35,776
So Mike isn't being honest about these pilot program in Utah

2390
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:38,336
You wouldn't text in or email in your vote

2391
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:42,688
What they were exploring was a broadening of a system that uses blockchain to allow users to

2392
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:45,760
Devote using their smartphones with an online platform

2393
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:48,064
Do they make is describing it as reduct

2394
01:50:48,576 --> 01:50:51,904
Because he wants to belittle the idea to make it look like a clear plan to steal vote

2395
01:50:52,928 --> 01:50:57,280
The bill that was passed in late 2020 just allows municipalities quote

2396
01:50:57,536 --> 01:51:00,352
To choose to permit a voter to vote by electronic means

2397
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:02,656
Approved by the municipalities election officer

2398
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:09,568
Do you talk County Clerk auditor told Deseret News that they've been using this function for the past five

2399
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:10,592
No problem

2400
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:15,456
And that it is particularly useful in allowing overseas voters like enlisted person

2401
01:51:15,968 --> 01:51:16,736
Devote with less hat

2402
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:18,528
Saugus bulshit

2403
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:21,600
Upon Richard ComEd

2404
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:22,880
The government said

2405
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:24,672
Surprisingly this one actually works

2406
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:25,952
No this is a good one

2407
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:27,488
It does look

2408
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,792
We're just as shocked as you that this work

2409
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:34,400
Reached for comment the Utah government said Mike's going to flip out on this one

2410
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:36,448
So in case you were

2411
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:38,496
Concerned about me.

2412
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:39,264
Tell him

2413
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,544

2414
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:42,336
Mike being a sponsor

2415
01:51:42,592 --> 01:51:43,104

Supposition right next to each other somebody being like

Yeah yeah

2441
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:51,968
I mean in a reasonable World everyone could just step back and be like well whatever that is is wrong

2442
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:55,296
I've been wrestling with this I do think that

2443
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:56,320
At a certain point

2444
01:52:58,112 --> 01:53:00,416
Obviously we can't really because we

2445
01:53:00,672 --> 01:53:01,184
Focus on

2446
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,464
These kinds of worlds

2447
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:03,488
Talk about this information

2448
01:53:04,512 --> 01:53:06,048
Honestly think

2449
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:08,352
Maybe there should be a blanket like

2450
01:53:08,864 --> 01:53:10,144
People like Mike Lindell

2451
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:11,168
People like Alex

2452
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:12,704
People like Rodger

2453
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:13,984
Don't even engage

2454
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:16,032
Tweet about him

2455
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:17,824
Whatever they're saying is not like

2456
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,616
Bikes on here saying that

2457
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:23,200
The he's got to be brought down

01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:28,320
Don't even engage with

2462
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:33,440

2463
01:53:33,696 --> 01:53:34,720

01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:36,768
And we were playing

2466
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:39,072
Clips from 2003 that could have been

2467
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:40,864
Today

2468
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:43,168
We got a little bit here at the end

2469
01:53:43,424 --> 01:53:44,192

Shelter

2476
01:53:56,480 --> 01:54:00,832
And now it was supposed to show talking a little bit about a news story that is

2477
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:04,672
About Jen sake the White House spokesperson

2478
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:08,768
Think about how Russia is going to pull a false flag

2479
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:10,560
To get into Ukraine

2480
01:54:10,816 --> 01:54:13,120
Great Bob there was this conversation that went on

2481
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:14,912
And

2482
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:16,704
Alex

2483
01:54:17,216 --> 01:54:17,728
Okay

2484
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:20,288
Let's go and get to this is a big deal

2485
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:21,824
Video of

2486
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:24,896
Admin says Russia is going to carry out a

2487
01:54:25,152 --> 01:54:25,920
False flag attack

2488
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:26,944
On itself

2489
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:29,248
Justify invading Ukraine

2490
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:36,416
Staging false Flags

2491
01:54:38,464 --> 01:54:42,560
You absolutely do his entire early career

2492
01:54:44,096 --> 01:54:47,680
He believed that Putin did the apartment bombings

2493
01:54:48,192 --> 01:54:50,496
Volkswagen

2494
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:52,288
Is very

2495
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:54,592
Very clear about until he was

2496
01:54:54,848 --> 01:55:00,224
Food was great

2497
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:01,248
At least according to

2498
01:55:01,504 --> 01:55:03,808
Most of Alex's career that is absolutely the case

2499
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:07,392
Give misinterpretation though of what sake is that

2500
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:09,952
Directions to

2501
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:13,024
These Liars

2502
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:17,120
Flags exist here she is

2503
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:20,960
Information that indicates brushes

2504
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:23,008
Reposition a group of operatives to conduct

2505
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:30,176
There's this interesting dynamic balance is insisting that this is like

2506
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:32,992
That made finally admitting at 12 Flags exist

2507
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:36,320
No one has ever said that. Like don't exist

2508
01:55:36,832 --> 01:55:37,344
They just

2509
01:55:38,112 --> 01:55:38,880
Complain that Alex

2510
01:55:39,136 --> 01:55:43,232
Thinks everything is supposed to problem I'm experiencing right now

2511
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:44,000
Is that

2512
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:44,768
I know

2513
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:45,792
That they have been Russia

2514
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:46,560
False Flags

2515
01:55:46,816 --> 01:55:48,864
I know there been United States false Flags

2516
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:50,400
I know that

2517
01:55:50,656 --> 01:55:51,936
Plenty of false flag

2518
01:55:52,192 --> 01:55:52,704
Right

2519
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:55,520
The one time

2520
01:55:56,544 --> 01:55:57,312
The one time

2521
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:58,592
The Alex

2522
01:55:58,848 --> 01:55:59,872
Could just be like

2523
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:07,552
Just anything just anything other than well I don't think that there's accident this is actually happening

2524
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:10,624
How dare you tell me that the government is false flagging

2525
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:16,768
I'm mostly more interested though in

2526
01:56:18,048 --> 01:56:18,560
Pretending

2527
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:20,096
People would say they didn't

2528
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:26,240
No I bet I finally

2529
01:56:26,752 --> 01:56:28,544
That's not they never here

2530
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:30,080
Very dumb

2531
01:56:30,592 --> 01:56:31,616
But not as dumb

2532
01:56:32,384 --> 01:56:32,896
Hazard last

2533
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:33,920
Bit of

2534
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:34,944
Highlights

2535
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:35,968
I lied this morning

2536
01:56:36,224 --> 01:56:36,736
Stachys

2537
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:42,368
Yes we got to peel that off real quick before we get out of here

2538
01:56:43,392 --> 01:56:45,440
VR video

2539
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:47,744
The Sunday show

2540
01:56:55,424 --> 01:56:56,448
And it goes on from there

2541
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:01,312
Sabotage

2542
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:03,104

01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:08,224
This article is an editorial written by guy named Joe Mathews titled quote

2544
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:10,784
California should abolish Parenthood in the name of echo

2545
01:57:11,552 --> 01:57:17,440
Alex is reporting this as a serious suggestion but if you taking the time to read the article he would have seen that it's obvious

2546
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:18,208
Police at Tire

2547
01:57:18,976 --> 01:57:21,792
Joe brings up the inequalities in reaching for families and terms

2548
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:24,608
Ability to bring up children

2549
01:57:24,864 --> 01:57:25,632
Mysolution

2550
01:57:25,888 --> 01:57:28,192
Making raising your own children illegal is simp

2551
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:31,776
And while we wait for the legislation to pass we can act now

2552
01:57:32,032 --> 01:57:33,824
The rich and poor should trade kids

2553
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,896
And homeowners might swap children with their homeless Neighbors

2554
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:42,528
Now I recognize that some naysayers will dismiss such a policy is ghastly even totalitarian

2555
01:57:42,784 --> 01:57:44,320
But my proposal is quite modest

2556
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:45,344
Effusion of

2557
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:48,672
Traditional philosophy and today's most common political obsession

2558
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:55,328
Him saying that his proposal is quite modest should be an immediate took off that he isn't being sincere

2559
01:57:55,584 --> 01:57:56,352
It's it's almost

2560
01:57:56,608 --> 01:57:57,120
Too on the nose

2561
01:57:57,376 --> 01:58:03,520
Although on the other hand even that isn't enough for people to not take it as satire

2562
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:06,336
It's a little bit clunky if you're trying to behave like a literate

2563
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:10,176
I literally cried

2564
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:16,320
The author seems to be making is that the ultimate end result of many of the ideas that are pushed in the name of equality

2565
01:58:18,112 --> 01:58:21,696
It's like someone actually having the idea of universal orphan Hood

2566
01:58:22,208 --> 01:58:24,256
Really some fat up

2567
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:27,072
Quote those critics any mind

2568
01:58:27,328 --> 01:58:30,400
Because they just can't see how our Relentless pursuit of equity

2569
01:58:30,656 --> 01:58:32,448
Mike Bertha Brave New World

2570
01:58:33,472 --> 01:58:34,240
Again

2571
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:39,872
Anyway Alex not only doesn't understand the difference between an editorial and a news story

2572
01:58:40,128 --> 01:58:44,224
He also can't tell when articles are sincere or if their satire because he doesn't

2573
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:46,016
Read any of the stuffy reports on

2574
01:58:46,784 --> 01:58:50,624
If all you know about the article here is that line you've reported like Alex does

2575
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:52,928
Because he's stupid and lazy and

2576
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:56,768
He's reporting a satirical article as is real

2577
01:58:57,536 --> 01:58:58,816
B o

2578
01:58:59,328 --> 01:58:59,840

2579

2580
01:59:02,144 --> 01:59:04,448
This this is Nikki couldn't

2581
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:06,496
Cram anymore references in there

2582
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:10,848
I just I wouldn't might have been this is a little Swift

2583
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:14,944
Jonathan I think we're having a little bit of a devil that you know like just

2584
01:59:15,456 --> 01:59:18,784
Just really hammered at home make the make the lines and

2585
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:20,832
Acrostic to spell Eva

2586
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:22,112
Say a secret message

2587
01:59:22,624 --> 01:59:25,184
Alongside that be great I have it

So

2591

2592
01:59:35,424 --> 01:59:35,936

Apparently had covid

2596
01:59:41,312 --> 01:59:43,104
He's going to sue everybody

2597
01:59:44,896 --> 01:59:45,664

01:59:46,176 --> 01:59:47,712

That

2602
01:59:55,136 --> 01:59:56,160
The election was stolen

2603
01:59:56,672 --> 01:59:57,440
Or

2604
01:59:57,696 --> 02:00:02,560
I need your money to do that when I got to go buy pet pillow you might lose that money could and also getting

2605
02:00:07,168 --> 02:00:07,680

Brian stelter

2609
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:17,152
Pieces of evidence he provides about anything is either complete bulshit or

2610
02:00:18,176 --> 02:00:21,248
Satire article that he doesn't actually real or fake
