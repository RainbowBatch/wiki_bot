1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:07,680
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:12,032
Everybody was acting outside

3
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:18,176
Jordan

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,760
Lake Michigan

5
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:27,136
It's not a seat I feel like no

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,696
Visiting my parents down in Austin

7
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,256
Then go down to the Bay right now

8
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,560
I don't know it's been forever

9
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:44,032
Yes we are definitely seven

10
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:48,384
During that reads his bachelor party

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,176
Cabin to the lake

12
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:57,600
I like swimming a lot I belong in the water fresh water is not the same

13
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:04,000
Body wax yearning for the show actually I just thought about

14
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,120
Right

15
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:14,496
Stacy

16
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,896
Let's get you to the Dead Sea

17
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,176
Lightning

18
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:32,160
Have you seen the movie the Salton Sea

19
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,208
I saw the movie

20
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:39,840
I know a lot about swimming

21
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:46,240
Sorry about the delay on this episode I have been

22
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:50,592
The weather outside like to thank everybody for their well wishes

23
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,128
People to wish me help

24
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,504
Definitely makes

25
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,320
You know it feels better

26
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:06,720
Fever broke around a little bit

27
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,488
Episode

28
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,304
That would immediately be almost meeting

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,144
Sudoku

30
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,472
Slightly meaning was on one hand because we could predict

31
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,496
Exactly what

32
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,520
Would happen which

33
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,288
Is basically

34
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,080
I texted you this

35
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,152
If they

36
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,688
Republicans win everything

37
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,968
Alex will say

38
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,272
Are they

39
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,088
And if Democrats take control of anything that I called

40
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,696
The Narrative no matter what but that was a disaster

41
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,744
Took that election was a disaster

42
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,632
Flickers

43
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
The great hope

44
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:52,032
In terms of voting measures that passed throughout the country of the

45
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:56,640
Control Band here in Chicago

46
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,432
Made it to

47
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,456
Where are there

48
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,480
Brightsign

49
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,320
That's wonderful

50
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,368
Positive

51
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,160
Everything's if you don't

52
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,696
If you don't look at the big picture

53
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,656
With the big changes that we may need are going to necessarily happen

54
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,728
Isaac

55
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,104
It was the right thing to do to not do an episode on here on Thursday

56
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
Because

57
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,640
Especially

58
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
We lose it Alex Jones

59
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,712
The show would be the same

60
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,248
Before the midterm

61
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
But likely

62
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:34,784
We quite

63
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,112
I'm so I'm glad that today we're going over the

64
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,392
November 7th

65
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,696
2018 episode which is

66
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,720
Is the day after

67
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:50,144
Someone who has donated to the show before and then bumped it a little bit

68
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:55,008
I'm just

69
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,176
Someone sodomite sent me a bucket

70
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:09,088
Caribbean black actor

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,024
Thank you so much destiny

72
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:24,447
If you would like to become a pilot

73
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:29,567
But Motorsport the show we would appreciate

74
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,103
We do not have any

75
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,943
Advertisers or dark money

76
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:41,343
We're offering you want in on this

77
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:49,279
We start today and I started recording something that I was

78
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,327
And that is

79
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,119
That this is

80
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,703
Show at least on November

81
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,287
The brief window that we have after the midterm

82
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,079
This is that one show I can

83
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,103
Kind of get down on

84
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,663
Because I think that Alex Jones

85
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
Gets it

86
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,271
I think he understands what happened in the midterm

87
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,135
Maybe more than he would like to reveal all right

88
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,719
Flip cuz I don't think anybody actually understands what happened to the

89
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,535
I think a lot of people have a lot of little pieces

90
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
Not so much

91
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,655
But in this first clip ice

92
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,471
Little littles

93
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,495
Glimmers

94
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
This is a big takeaway

95
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
Toothache

96
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,247
Legal cartel level

97
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,527
Started

98
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:46,111
Racketeering censorship the last year accelerating to the election

99
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,415
And

100
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,975
The house not passing voter ID

101
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,535
Michael Savage

102
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,071
Blue

103
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,095
Last chance

104
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,887
Illegal alien

105
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,935
Names of dead people

106
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,215
Taking over the edge

107
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,519
Along with

108
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,311
Censorship

109
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,223
Deplatforming and harassment

110
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,695
I'm just saying

111
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
And

112
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,887
Ted Cruz only one by like three points in Texas is Hartford

113
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,983
You see a little bit of speed

114
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,031
Because the results

115
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,335
Especially in Texas

116
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,871
I think that he

117
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,175
Probably would do better

118
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,735
Then a normal Democratic candidate

119
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,551
The historically has

120
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,671
Very competitive

121
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,695
Then winning places

122
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,255
Is that it did not look like he was going

123
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,655
And the temperature in Texas is changing

124
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:07,263
And I would want to talk about this

125
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,799
Baloch

126
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,079
B Beto help

127
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,639
Pushover the absolutely

128
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,431
The enthusiasm that he brought

129
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
2D election

130
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,503
The fact that more people were coming out

131
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,063
Led to more democratic down-ballot

132
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,647
So I think Alex has

133
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,415
Disposition

134
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,207
Rephrase

135
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,743
As we would have predicted

136
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,279
Is narrative about it is

137
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:33,375
We need voter ID

138
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,679
Where would we have

139
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:38,751
You know

140
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:42,335
Why do they reuse

141
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,615
Year of the pig

142
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,711
I need to be back on Facebook

143
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,831
Depth analysis

144
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,927
One thing I do like

145
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,743
Opposition like towards

146
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
If the government

147
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,303
Not just

148
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:11,519
The Republicans are aiding and abetting

149
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,543
32 pivot backed

150
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,591
Familiar territory

151
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,871
A sort of like

152
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,639
The position he

153
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,663
He plays well from

154
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,807
Like he was being asked to play point guard for a little bit

155
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,903
Female has

156
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:41,215
I think that we are going to see at least a more familiar hours

157
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,519
Alex

158
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,359
I don't know if playing out of his depth

159
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,895
What is the right way to put it

160
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,711
But there was like a real ugliness

161
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,735
To his show lately

162
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,015
Because he doesn't have

163
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,807
Anything other than

164
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,087
Defend Trump

165
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,367
Against everything

166
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,159
And now with the ideas like a demo

167
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,439
Mccratic house

168
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,767
There's a reason why Trump isn't

169
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,791
Doing the things

170
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
But he wants him to do

171
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,863
Before he had to come up with

172
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,215
And I'll give you like all these Democrats in the house

173
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,495
Now at the same time

174
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
I think that

175
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
Having Zach

176
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:17,823
Thing took

177
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
Complain about

178
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,871
Could lend itself

179
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,407
More extremism

180
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:34,207
Going to become much more tolerable to lithosphere

181
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,279
I will say this one

182
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,119
People fake names

183
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,703
Every establishment. Behind Democrats

184
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,983
Father was a

185
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,823
Beta man here in Texas or whether it was Gillian

186
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,359
Gilligan's moron

187
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
Island

188
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:59,551
For more on island I know his name's not Gilligan I like the books of the range

189
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,415
Alexa

190
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,183
And it's all good

191
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:09,023
Pathetic

192
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,095
Confirm more on island now I'm not calling Florida moron Island

193
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:19,775
Feeding tube

194
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,087
Becoming a little bit

195
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
Alex's

196
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,647
Mood

197
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,927
Text Cliff

198
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,951
MC that Alex

199
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,023
Or at least

200
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,119
Previous to the midterm

201
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,935
Romantic redwave in

202
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,703
Take every

203
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,799
I think in this makes Lucy very clear indication

204
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,079
Given the result

205
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,359
Does recognized

206
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,639
For Trump

207
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,407
And

208
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
He's a little worried about it

209
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
And then he still wants

210
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,743
Yes

211
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,839
This could have been a lot worse but

212
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:19,423
The fact that Trump has had his leg cut off for my dream

213
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,727
Internet censorship is a big deal

214
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:28,383
Is Ted Nugent to give us his aftermath

215
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,687
So did I

216
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:43,999
So you saying it like without this illegal we would have want

217
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:49,119
Expert about

218
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,191
We're going to have to give his analysis

219
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:58,591
That is not good unless he's coming to bring me Hot Licks

220
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:07,807
GOP people try and save it in the pastor of the largest wing

221
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,671
And a little bit of that

222
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
I think Alex has to read

223
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,719
Pig noise

224
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,511
A little bit later Rodger stone is on the

225
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,559
Michelle and I think he has to recognize

226
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,351
The house

227
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,375
Is controlled by

228
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
Democrat

229
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,679
They have the ability to

230
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:28,287
Subpoena people probably going to get speed

231
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,823
Real soon

232
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,871
And there's all sorts of other investigation

233
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,663
They could gum up the works

234
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,711
You would hope that they would use

235
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
Is that powered judicious

236
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:41,087
It actually go after real things that should be investigated

237
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,111
But I mean

238
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,415
Zika basically turn this

239
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,951
Next two years into

240
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,231
A procession

241
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:52,863
Durable investigations

242
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,007
The next two years right

243
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:05,407
That is true if you do like he's on the up-and-up and they're doing spurious investors

244
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,455
Even the most

245
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,503
Ridiculous investigation I could do

246
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,575
Yeah yeah yeah

247
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,623
It is there's a whole world

248
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,391
In front of them

249
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:21,279
Open world games

250
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:25,119
All sorts of places new mission

251
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:32,031
Galax recognizes that on one level

252
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
That I think

253
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,079
Alex Munoz

254
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
Strategically

255
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639
They can order for trumpet

256
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
To be the thing

257
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
Galvanized

258
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,735
To be the person

259
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,015
That he

260
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,295
You

261
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,063
He tries to make

262
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,343
Make Trump appear to be

263
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,111
He means

264
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,159
It's just a rubber stamp through Congress

265
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,463
Because his positions are unpopular

266
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
And so without

267
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,071
Republicans controlling both houses of being able to

268
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,095
Push things through

269
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:00,191
He's going to be like I want to deport all

270
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,751
I don't know

271
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:07,871
Lebanese means

272
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,175
He doesn't know Lebanon is Express

273
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,967
It was just a random pool

274
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
Not going to happen

275
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,087
He can try any

276
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
Legislation

277
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,903
Progressive

278
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,439
And it'll just die in the

279
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,231
I wish that were true

280
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,511
I think it will with

281
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,303
Real serious issue

282
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,839
Maybe

283
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
Not it

284
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:33,215
Look we're assuming a lot in terms of

285
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,495
Having some faith

286
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,519
And Democrats

287
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,543
Do not

288
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:43,199
The rollover needed they needed to get like at least 45 26

289
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
60 seeds

290
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,247
In order to

291
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,551
Keep Pelosi for Speaker of the House

292
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,087
And that's not going to happen

293
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,879
She's going to stay Speaker of the House

294
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,951
And the whole time we're going to pass Republican Lite version

295
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,975
If possible

296
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:58,047
Images

297
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,399
Even if it is that I still think that

298
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,423
If you wouldn't be able to

299
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
To do as much as

300
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,471
If you could with a Republican

301
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
Control

302
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,263
Entirety

303
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,335
So I think I think that there's that

304
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,151
I like that Alex recognizes it

305
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,431
Diminishing returns

306
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,455
An actual things that

307
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,479
He's getting done

308
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,527
The veneer of this like

309
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,807
Super powerful

310
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
I can fix

311
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,623
Everything.

312
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
And when

313
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,439
Veneer goes away being is propaganda

314
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
Much more different

315
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,999
Because you have to vent

316
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,023
Expect

317
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:33,119
You don't have a hero to worship you have just inefficient bureaucrat

318
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,911
And I don't think that's going to be

319
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:42,335
All of the executive orders that Trump is going to

320
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,895
Legal eagle

321
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:51,295
Sure you're going to be even the even the Supreme Court

322
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:57,695
Executive in my new executive order I get free food for life

323
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,303
Alright McDonald's

324
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,095
Okay

325
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,119
At least offense

326
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:05,887
Something possible

327
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,679
So we got 10 News

328
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,727
Come and get with his analysis

329
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,031
Most of their interviews

330
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,847
The boil

331
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:18,431
And

332
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,831
Or just really bright

333
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,367
You know and so like

334
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
This is

335
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,695
What I

336
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,327
And actually I think Ted Nugent to some

337
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,351
Something really

338
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,167
Turtle

339
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:42,239
Maniacal

340
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:48,639
Constitution the Bill of Rights the Declaration of Independence I believe in the Ten Commandments of the golden rule I Believe In Loving

341
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:55,039
Your neighbor and helping your family and neighbor and being the asset, and making sacrifices and taking wrist so that you are pretty

342
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,623
Community so that you can help others when they need it

343
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,159
Cuz I know these

344
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,695
Everywhere

345
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,071
People who believe that

346
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:12,447
Eastern Michigan into a San Francisco 49ers own

347
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,239
Amber

348
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,639
Michigan

349
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:29,855
So I mean his characterization of the two sides is wrong but I think he's starting to recognize that

350
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,391
The things that I like

351
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,951
Is not the most popular thing

352
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,767
In the right direction

353
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,815
I mean granted he goes on to say that like

354
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,351
I'm response that I'm going to fight

355
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,447
Within his right to do

356
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,263
Douching in the Ten Commandments which is why

357
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,055
We should kill Hillary

358
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:49,823
You know

359
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,527
Two things that

360
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,319
Boats

361
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:06,719
Strongly advocate

362
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,047
He was super into like

363
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,327
Displays

364
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
Is of

365
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,119
Like high power weapon

366
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:21,567
Remember Elijah

367
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:26,175
Piece of wood on fire and then everybody did some

368
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,303
Ted Nugent Naples love guns Alex

369
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,095
Accidentally says that you should

370
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,215
What you're doing what I've done what what what

371
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,239
At what

372
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,799
Trump is dealing is get really aggressive

373
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,103
Around

374
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,895
And understand

375
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:02,783
Outreach try to take leftist out deprogramming try to take him shooting

376
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,367
Shooting

377
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,559
But he does like puppets

378
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,583
Yep

379
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
Still do it

380
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:31,967
Because

381
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,015
I know if we were so like his

382
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,599
We would be like yeah

383
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:43,999
Clipit app

384
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,535
I would cut out

385
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:51,935
The part where he says Outreach so just take him out shoot them

386
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,287
Buckethead a slip of the tongue

387
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:02,687
Believe

388
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:04,991
The guns aren't that

389
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,015
Scary the outdoors

390
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,879
I don't know if that's going to get people to be weird okay.

391
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:19,583
That's a terrible idea considering where the country is going

392
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:25,215
Enemy you believe you should kill training that I've heard Alex talk about going out with

393
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,751
With people who don't like

394
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,615
You keep talking about like those explosives

395
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,895
That you shoot like one of them

396
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,199
Exploded at a cinder block

397
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,223
Hit him in the head

398
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:42,111
Wait what

399
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:46,207
The cast of Silicon Valley

400
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,799
In the country right now we're dealing with

401
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,335
Some pretty serious radicalization

402
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,871
Another write obviously

403
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,223
VCA manifest through murders

404
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,783
Scares

405
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,807
Fun

406
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:16,159
Good days

407
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,208
Take on that speedometer

408
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:22,816
And if you want have a political and economic fight you're going to get one This Is War

409
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,120
And they're organized to take a shower

410
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,888
You get it

411
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,800
Because they say the Republicans radicalizing it because the left is radical

412
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,688
A choice

413
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,480
They made me do it

414
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:45,344
It's the same stupid argument is like I'm only racist cuz you kept calling me racist

415
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,136
What did you expect to happen

416
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:51,488
Oh my God I'm only radical because your radical

417
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:57,376
But it wasn't there before

418
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,912
In waves for the last

419
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:03,776
Forever you know what it was our fault

420
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:10,432
If we have never elected a black president

421
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,480
Play Thinkin private company Alex

422
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:17,856
I think you might as long as there wasn't a bugged room

423
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,392
Might say that

424
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,208
I believe

425
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,744
In terms of conservatism

426
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,280
One of their best

427
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,048
Arguments

428
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,072
They have is the

429
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,352
Self-determination

430
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,192
Sure I believe that I believe that when you say

431
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,496
The accused believe that everybody has the right

432
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,544
To choose how to live their life

433
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:37,824
I think

434
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,848
You're in

435
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,896
Good you're on a good rock

436
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,176
Just saying.

437
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:46,272
Legislate those rights to choose

438
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:52,928
That's where your b*******

439
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,232
Philosophically is a

440
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,024
Good starting block

441
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,584
To undermine the idea of just saying

442
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:03,168
I believe that people have the right to live their life how they see fit

443
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,704
Sure I think that

444
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,496
Interesting Lee

445
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,056
Starts talking about his beliefs

446
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,384
Is it weaves

447
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,920
Very quickly

448
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:16,224
Determining how other people live

449
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,088
These people are coming to come for you you better start

450
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:25,184
It is if you if you believe enough

451
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,256
In the American dream in MP3

452
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:34,656
Choose your own path in life and you ear to do the best that you can do if you believe in that

453
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:46,176
Fake news

454
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,992
When you see it

455
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:55,392
Nothing I can do weather is something you can do

456
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
So

457
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,512
Snowflake

458
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:06,912
Everyone should have the right to choose

459
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:14,336
Perfect right to determine their actions as long as

460
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:17,408
Weezer determining

461
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:23,808
As long as you agree with me you have self-determination if not

462
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,624
Back of their lives

463
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,720
You know you had that blow back to me saying like that's a reasonable belief

464
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,304
Always

465
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,352
So anyway

466
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:37,888
Tomorrow's him

467
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,424
But

468
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,216
Takeaway

469
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,008
Here's where he's at

470
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,568
But I'm going back

471
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:51,200
Has ever had losses this low

472
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,552
Powerful enemies

473
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:59,392
So I think that is actually probably a sensible approach

474
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,184
I mean it's a little bit

475
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,744
Still shining of a s*** a little bit

476
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,792
But the idea saying like

477
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,328
We lost

478
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,008
This is an optimistic Alex that's coming to studio today

479
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:21,152
I understand that's the thing I don't understand where these guys are coming from

480
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,944
I don't understand

481
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:27,552
Like ultimately that's what they did they

482
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,368
White supremacy was really what was on the ballot

483
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:34,208
And you saw so much such a high voter turnout

484
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,072
And white supremacy

485
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,192
Power tools

486
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,496
I don't think it is

487
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,520
I think that

488
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,568
I think that there were areas

489
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
Certainly

490
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,152
You can make that case but I don't think as a whole

491
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,176
That cases

492
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:57,504
I think I think they're what we would have loved

493
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:58,784
Is a condemnation

494
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,064
So many

495
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,624
In a perfect world

496
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,440
There would have been no Republican

497
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,464
You would have thought

498
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,512
But that's an unrealistic expectations

499
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,840
And I think you look at

500
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,120
Incremental progress

501
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
That you do

502
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,448
So many women getting

503
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
The officers

504
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,264
Governor

505
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,336
You're those sorts of things are real those are important

506
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,616
Bits of progress

507
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,176
Absolutely it was a

508
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,200
Bigwinnn

509
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,760
For the right away

510
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,576
Accurate but it wasn't

511
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,488
It wasn't as much of a win for non-white Supremacy this week

512
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,048
Kind of in the same place as our

513
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:47,680
The Lost could have been way worse or saying that the wind should have been much bigger

514
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,496
So we're both sort of in-between

515
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,544
No one's getting exactly what they want

516
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,336
But there's little things that both

517
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,872
Sides can say

518
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,408
I like

519
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,712
And we still have to

520
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,480
50 hour everything

521
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:04,320
Cuz there's a recording this year on Wednesday

522
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,856
There's still a lot of

523
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,880
Races that hasn't been

524
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,904
Been decided yet

525
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,928
They're still

526
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,952
There's still things

527
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,256
Sure

528
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,560
I don't

529
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,608
I'm a pessimistic guy

530
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,912
As as baby

531
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,192
Somebody

532
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,032
I don't see how

533
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,312
This doesn't

534
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,336
Further

535
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,384
Expand the ability to

536
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,688
Have a minority rule

537
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,736
And the minority is

538
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,296
But they have

539
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,088
They have cheated

540
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:40,928
They have twisted

541
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:44,512
To make sure that remains in power

542
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,816
As opposed to

543
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:50,400
And then we have an ineffective Democratic party that's going to be like

544
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,312
We're going to do some white nationalism but not

545
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:02,944
Soupremacy that's terrible measures passed about like a votary in France

546
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,248
Measures the path

547
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,808
Like getting rid of

548
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,088
Redistricting

549
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,368
Really hurts

550
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,904
Voter turnout in

551
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,440
Inactive voter suppression

552
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,280
There are there is progress on that front

553
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,304
You know even

554
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,840
Even if it's not

555
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,120
Like

556
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,680
You want to just shake everything like an Etch-a-Sketch and we can

557
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,800
You want to do that but that would require exactly what we're again

558
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,824
So

559
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,384
I get what I get what you're saying and I think it's fine

560
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,152
Pessimistic

561
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,944
I also think

562
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,480
I don't know what I think

563
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:45,184
Is what it is

564
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,744
Maybe but

565
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,512
Maybe not

566
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,048
It's possible

567
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:53,120
Share in your in your leg

568
00:28:54,144 --> 00:29:00,288
I'm not I'm not super optimistic but I am I am like

569
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,176
I don't know

570
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:11,040
Wichita

571
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,136
Dave Chappelle

572
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,928
I think you're one of the greatest comedians

573
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:26,400
Really

574
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,472
He starts getting into some of his

575
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,496
Fears about

576
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,520
Globalist

577
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,312
And it gets in

578
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,104
Dimensional aliens

579
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,456
Which I haven't heard in awhile

580
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,504
He's getting into a weird head space

581
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:47,136
How do I know this whole plan

582
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:53,536
They want to use it

583
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,560
And thinkers

584
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:58,656
Along the line of the world that wanted

585
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,680
Opposed

586
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,704
Human world

587
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,008
Because their God

588
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,848
Is going to give them life extension and give them power but at a certain point

589
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,664
Give their body up and be uploaded

590
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,736
This larger Consciousness that will then move on to the next planet

591
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:15,808
Of course

592
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,648
Former head of the British Illuminati wrote childhood's end

593
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:23,744
He also wrote 2001 Space Odyssey

594
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,048
Okay

595
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,072
Figure out

596
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,680
World

597
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,728
Entity known as Lucifer

598
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:41,408
He's going to give them the blueprint

599
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,248
They just got to kill themselves and their families once they get the point

600
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:52,928
Not even

601
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,816
What about was talking about he's really into

602
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:02,400
Take it too far as she believes that it's coming in

603
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:05,216
They went on board the spacecraft media

604
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:05,984
Right

605
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,568
Condom

606
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:15,712
Silicon Valley shrooms almost everyday

607
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,016
Okay

608
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,552
Weather

609
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,344
Creatures

610
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:24,160
That are giving them control

611
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,720
Course

612
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,768
Are you f****** didn't

613
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:32,608
If our if our head of the Illuminati

614
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:36,704
Right

615
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:41,056
2001 A Space Odyssey should not God be a space baby and not

616
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:41,824
Lucifer

617
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:46,944
Maybe I don't know I don't know what to do with that I don't care I don't care about that stuff

618
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,224
I don't I don't care at all

619
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,064
I don't

620
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,344
I just think

621
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,624
This is so stupid

622
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,648
Cida like titties

623
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,440
You saying that Heaven's Gate

624
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:02,048
Figure it out what the Silicon Valley people believe in

625
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,584
Took it too far

626
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,888
Anybody who knows anything about Heaven's Gate nose

627
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,680
Is that that is not

628
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:12,032
Of what they were up to

629
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,080
At at all

630
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,384
Baby wipes

631
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,944
Stupid but it's fun for him to get back to some of that stuff

632
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,480
It's fine for him to be like

633
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,760
20 years

634
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,040
Are you bugging happen

635
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,088
Inditex Corvallis uses

636
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:25,856
Term

637
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,184
Probably not cool to say

638
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:29,952
I think

639
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,864
But he says it again

640
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:40,192
Another one

641
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,688
He's talking about

642
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,456
Beto's

643
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,224
Going to run now

644
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,504
Louisiana

645
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,600
What

646
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,648
Hillary Clinton

647
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,184
Kentucky

648
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,472
Awesome pot

649
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,312
California

650
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:21,408
Hello Latinos how are you

651
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:25,760
What's condescending like that

652
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,672
Phone

653
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:43,680
What type of

654
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,128
Okay

655
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,152
Alright man

656
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:59,040
I'm not sure if it's okay to use that term use the beginning test

657
00:33:59,296 --> 00:33:59,808
Did he say

658
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,088
Coonass

659
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:05,696
Twice he said they're going to give them a coon-ass name

660
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:12,096
Where is Winchester's I'm on the fence about exactly because the enemy

661
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,632
Do the term it's

662
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,656
It's a term for a person who

663
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,936
Cajun ethnicity

664
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,800
There are people who have like look at the etymology of it

665
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,080
It's difficult to

666
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,872
Tell if it's a like

667
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,408
Offense

668
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,456
It seems like it is

669
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,528
I know if it's a breeding

670
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,552
From Wikipedia here

671
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:37,440
In the early 1980s occasion worker suit is former employee

672
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:41,024
The lawsuit light directly to the federal government's recognition is

673
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,792
The Cajuns as

674
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,608
As protected by the Civil Rights Act

675
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:50,496
So it does appear that it's probably a term that can be used offensively

676
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:53,312
It is Coronavirus different from Coon

677
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,848
It appears that it is

678
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:06,880
I don't understand that it does come from

679
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,184
African American

680
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:13,792
Which is possible but one the other etymology says that it comes

681
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,816
Comes from the French word

682
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,096
Canoe canoe

683
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,376
Which is a vulgar term

684
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,144
For the vulva

685
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,448
But I'm not sure if that's accurate

686
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,472
There's also

687
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,264
The French word connoisseur

688
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,080
Think it could come from which

689
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,128
Loosely translates to dirty Prost

690
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,272
Alright so no matter what comes from a defensive from everything I can

691
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,064
Tell that it's a term that has been Rick

692
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,880
Claimed a little

693
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:44,000
Descent

694
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,120
One word

695
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,312
Unacceptable

696
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:03,968
I wanted to come here and tell you like I've looked

697
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:08,064
Portable player

698
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,112
I don't

699
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,672
Cut-and-dry as that

700
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,280
You might be able to wiggle out of it

701
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:30,848
I was almost like should I not even say

702
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,384
Because it's

703
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,944
It's it feels that way

704
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,712
Some of that might be

705
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,736
Because Daleks

706
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,296
Might be a package

707
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,320
Kids with that but

708
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:46,720
There is a

709
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,744
Batman

710
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,120
His total voices that is

711
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,960
Skip this next clip

712
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:00,800
Just Alex again repeating that everything was Rick against the the right

713
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,568
Maisto land

714
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,360
You win but not really win

715
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,384
Barely lost

716
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,480
Legal voting all over the price

717
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,296
Is Alex going out to break

718
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,064
With

719
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,832
Pronouncement

720
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,440
Shawty said it out loud

721
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,328
What you been doing it show

722
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,408
So

723
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,968
I want to go in through and Beyond

724
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,760
That sounds a little

725
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:45,088
I know that he is

726
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:52,000
Probably feeling overdue for his own martyrdom

727
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:58,656
Like lose your audience as opposed to

728
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:03,264
What's up

729
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,872
All my heroes.

730
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:11,712
Why can't I do that too needs to do is fake his own death

731
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:15,040
And then come back like 10 years later

732
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,320
But pretending

733
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:19,136
Corporate Wendy's building

734
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,512
America that Alex

735
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,304
Apparently in favor of

736
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,584
Surprising at all

737
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:34,240
We saw this with Faith Goldy wouldn't get your ads on TV wouldn't come on radio

738
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,008
Toronto

739
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,824
Most analysts said she would have one she had the money

740
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,872
Young looking

741
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,664
And I would have letter advertise

742
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,688
Okay

743
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,456
Well is the

744
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:48,832
Pretty thoroughly as you may know she used to work for Rebel media which is

745
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:55,232
Who's the former employee roster

746
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:01,376
Stood by the daily Stormer Augusta Charlottesville rally

747
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,656
Which was

748
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:05,216
A little bit too much a little too far

749
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:08,544
Rebel media is like dude

750
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:13,920
Going a little bit too far

751
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,480
Eminem December 2017 on the podcast

752
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:21,088
Millennial woes and recited the 14 words

753
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,392
Supremacy and responded

754
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:26,720
I want to survive

755
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:34,144
So not too surprising that the Alex's real Interstate Goulding it's not good

756
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,616
Sure I've actually ever heard Alex

757
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,896
Directly talk about

758
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,176
Which is

759
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,504
Miles dab

760
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:53,600
Alex

761
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,392
Methodist that Ted Nugent in

762
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:56,416
Great

763
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,208
Yes

764
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,768
Ted Nugent optimism

765
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,304
To the world

766
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,072
Macclenny

767
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,912
We are blessed

768
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:07,936
With an appearance

769
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,704
From someone

770
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,240
Is barely ever

771
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,080
In the form of Rodger Stone

772
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,344
Stephen Austin to Lucky's in studio which is

773
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,392
Sort of interesting

774
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,720
Might want to go

775
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:34,560
Might be wanting to meet up with the carousel

776
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:38,144
I'm meeting up with the Caravan adver

777
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,752
Infowars

778
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,288
Kind of interesting

779
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,592
Because there's one element of it that makes it

780
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,360
It seemed like this

781
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:50,688
Should of organizing and political action

782
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,480
But there's really something else

783
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,016
Laughably pathetic

784
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,064
We'll talk about that

785
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,880
For this

786
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,352
And it had a hit had a massive mashup effect

787
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,008
Handwritten letter

788
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,288
They shine

789
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,784
Weather postage-paid individual ladder

790
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,600
1 million of these to flood the White House

791
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,672
About 100,000 to a Trump Tower New York

792
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:43,936
Thousand

793
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,520
White truck.com

794
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,872
Sobe idea behind this is that they're trying to

795
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:52,895
Convince him to take

796
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,687
Internet censorship seriously

797
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,295
Alex is going to sell it as

798
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:03,647
A million people demand you help me get back on Facebook

799
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:11,583
Take a look at all this Groundswell of people

800
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:16,191
The whole point of a handwritten letter is to make it seem individual person

801
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,215
Made it right

802
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:25,151
Make a bunch of copies of a handwritten letter looks like instead of yourself we're also sending

803
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,711
Q41

804
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:34,879
You're still sending the same letter

805
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,695
There's no way you can't see through that

806
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:46,911
We're not riding

807
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:52,287
Weird Written Letter

808
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:55,103
Perfect crazy self-serving

809
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,895
It's so easy to see through

810
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:57,919
We need to

811
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,967
To get back on social media or we are

812
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,735
Fuct

813
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:07,135
Rodger website

814
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,487
To do that

815
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,535
Alex knows that right

816
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:17,119
I don't know if she knows that the president literally

817
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,959
Corporation

818
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,519
You have to put this

819
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,359
Broccoli

820
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:31,711
Sears to make sure the president

821
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,503
I'd like to present it as like

822
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,783
I have iron

823
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:40,159
Clad proof that they're specifically targeting

824
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,463
So the president could say

825
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,487
Infringing on

826
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,023
People's free speech

827
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,559
In terms of political opinion

828
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:47,839
Enforce them

829
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,607
Not

830
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:49,375
Discriminate

831
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,911
Dance people for that

832
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:51,679
Yeah

833
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,727
With the interpretation of

834
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,007
Political ideology

835
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:55,775
You being a

836
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,543
Back to class

837
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:57,823
Which is

838
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:58,847
But

839
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,407
I think that's what Alex wants

840
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:02,943
Yeah

841
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,735
Or

842
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,015
Use rendition

843
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,063
Against

844
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,343
Headed towards

845
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:18,815
If one day we're just like

846
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:21,887
Extraordinary rendition

847
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,751
It sounds good to me

848
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,567
But then I heard this next clip like this is

849
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,335
Amapola

850
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,103
Apples are desperate

851
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,151
Don't forget

852
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:45,695
67% off of colloidal silver silver bullet

853
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:55,679
Byproduct

854
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,263
Text Jeanette

855
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,311
I believe

856
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,847
From everything I can to

857
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,919
Because he's saying this is a targeted sale

858
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:12,319
There's these stick things that I need to f****** sell-out

859
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,855
Hold on it because

860
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,647
According

861
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,951
They're going to take my payment processor

862
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,487
I won't be able to sell anything

863
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,767
So I got to get rid of all of this

864
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,303
That argument doesn't work

865
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,631
Because all the other product that you're not trying to sell out of

866
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:26,911
I believe

867
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,215
Play recent

868
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:34,847
He needs to get rid of the things I have overlap with products that sell from Jeanette

869
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,639
He needs to get rid of those cuz

870
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,663
You can't promote both

871
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:42,015
So while there is a knockout that Alex cell

872
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,807
There's a sleep thing genesta

873
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,903
You can't have both of those on the shelves

874
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:52,255
Compete kind of thing

875
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:56,863
Private label on your own

876
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,935
Where is a fire sale to get rid of everything

877
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:02,239
Overlap with his Market

878
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,263
Multi-level marketing

879
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,567
Oh man that is

880
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,847
The great great point

881
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,895
That's a great analysis

882
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,111
A balm

883
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:22,207
Because there's no other way for the reasoning to make sense

884
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,487
Just Elsa

885
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:26,559
If it was a fire sale on everything

886
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,351
We need to get rid of everything

887
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,911
Before they say we can't sell it

888
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,191
Believe that

889
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:34,751
Doesn't work with all of it

890
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,031
I think it is a bulge

891
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,079
It's just because

892
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,103
Those six things

893
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,639
You know

894
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,407
You can't sell

895
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,455
Got your whatever

896
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,735
That's a good point.

897
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:49,855
Slippery assholes

898
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:54,463
Rodger and Alex is sitting down having the B of A bull session

899
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:58,815
How's the weather

900
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,095
But how their victim

901
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:07,775
Destroy me financially

902
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:18,783

Beacons of Truth

904
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:46,943
No we want to put you in jail Rodger just got to do it from listen

905
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:53,087
Martin Luther King Jr wrote from a jail if you if you want to

906
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:59,743

910
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,287
I don't

911
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:16,383
Play I don't know all of the information so I don't

912
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:18,175
I have a sense that Rogers

913
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,647
People who know all of the information

914
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,415
The behind-the-scene

Talk about prison fashion

918
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:45,311
What is because Buehler

919
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:47,359
Blanche to investigate whatever

920
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,407
You know anything that kind of just comes up

921
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:55,807
He can just go like I'm referring this to the FBI and all that stuff even if even a stone didn't commit

922
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,343
Vegas particular crime

923
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:00,927
We all know stone at some point or another

924
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,975
I've committed at least one jailable offense

925
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,791
So many people have such a

926
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,071
Involvement

927
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:09,119
With Rodger has been

928
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:12,959
Talking to the special counsel

929
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:17,311
To be like cooperating

930
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:21,407
People like good for him

931
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:26,527
Because before when they were just like saying they were going to arrest Paul manafort

932
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,575
He could play the game

933
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,415
The game is not

934
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,975
Also if you expect

935
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:40,351
Jerome corsi to go to bat for you is the easiest dude to flip

936
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,887
He be like

937
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:47,519
Mueller called him he was like dude I'll tell you everything without anything

938
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:52,383
Like Jerome corsi completely gave up on that narrative he was trying to pitch like

939
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:54,175
6 months ago

940
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:56,479
Because of information

941
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:01,855
Give me the f****** courtroom

942
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,927
Flop sweat

00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,047
I don't know man

945
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,095
No one wants to silence anybody

946
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:16,703
I think the private companies have absolutely the right to do whatever they want to do

947
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:19,007
Taking Alex off Social Media stuff

948
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:19,775
Because of

949
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,799

950
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:21,567
Clear bra

951
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:22,591
Of their rules

952
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,359
But he's done

953
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:27,199
If they want to do that to make him do that if I'd like their web hosting

954
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,223
The youth

955
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:30,527
Is they don't want to host his stuff anymore

956
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:33,855
That's their right to be like now this is beyond what we can

957
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:34,879
Do we deem accept

958
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:38,207
Is there was like the government

959
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:39,999
Have a good day

960
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,791
He just has like

961
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:43,071
The chickens are coming home to roost

962
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,375
I have made a millions of dollars

963
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,399
Off doing this

964
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,447
Very distasteful work

965
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,215
And now

966
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,519
So

967
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:52,543
That's important

968
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:55,615
Because it's Mexico

969
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,175
And that's important because this next clip

970
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:02,527
George Soros

971
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,063
Infowars

972
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,975
If I hadn't done it

973
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:11,999
Somebody else will

974
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:15,583
Alex Jones

975
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,863
And shows the club

976
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:19,935
Defaming

977
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:25,311
Nazi collaborator

978
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,591
Facts are facts

979
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:29,919
We're basing our research on a t'riffic interview on

980
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:32,735
CBS

981
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:43,743
Vagueness

982
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,791
There's a couple indications

983
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,095
If it storms really understands the

984
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:48,863
The questions that are be

985
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:52,447
Okay

986
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,775
To what the interviewer is asking

987
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:58,591
He's responding slightly

988
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,919
Questions

989
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:04,223
But that's not

990
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:08,831
I don't know if I've ever heard Rodger Stone give the Alex Jones Soros narrative

991
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,111
And that to me it seems like

992
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:17,279
Also damn can you think of any reason the Taurus wouldn't go on Infowars

993
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:20,607
I've read recently the Taurus is rapsod asked

994
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:25,727
Which is it

995
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:28,799
I don't know if you would ever want to go on Infowars

996
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:29,567
I think you could

997
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:35,967
I think I would just yell not be at Amherst Alberta

998
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:37,247
Pieces like

999
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,831
Talk about how great it is

1000
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:47,231
Really character

1001
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:51,071
Like

1002
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,423
George if you're listening

1003
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:56,703
Dojo

1004
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:00,799
I still think that would be bad

1005
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:05,151
It is funny to hear like

1006
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,175
Paper napkin

1007
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:06,943
Into for a while

1008
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,735
Yeah

1009
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,527
Only stupid people

1010
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:12,319
It's really almost

1011
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,599
They don't want

1012
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,623
His voice

1013
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,647
It's on there

1014
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,183
Program

1015
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:19,231
Because that's

1016
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,767
What they do they don't have

1017
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:22,303
Like multiple opinions

1018
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,351
It's almost like they are some sort of

1019
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:28,703
Outlet in order to propagandize for the president

1020
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,495
And there's no way to prove that

1021
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:35,359
What if what if one of their opinion commentators

1022
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:38,175
Was actively campaign

1023
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:41,759
That doesn't prevent

1024
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:48,159
You forget Jake

1025
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:50,207
Showing up at a trump rally given stumps

1026
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,767
Ludacris

1027
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:55,839
It is awful that the media is

1028
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:56,607
Biased

1029
00:53:56,863 --> 00:54:03,007
I think they're just trying to get one person you know they're just I love I love Sean Hannity

1030
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,687
I knew he was going to give a speech

1031
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:12,991
Before the rally

1032
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:20,671
You picked me out of the crowd likes

1033
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:23,999
Bruce Springsteen Bruce Springsteen

1034
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:26,047
Jesus chord

1035
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:32,191
Rosemary

1036
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,215
And that's not good

1037
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,055
Interesting

1038
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:40,639
Because the other day and article came out in the National Review

1039
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:43,711
They talked about how like you don't need these Soros kids

1040
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,247
He receives his real life

1041
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,527
Just as bad

1042
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:50,623
Realized

1043
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:57,023
Are you going to read

1044
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:57,791
A blurb

1045
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:00,607
Play some contacts.

1046
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:07,519
The bombshell

1047
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,055
50 minutes

1048
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:11,359
Cirrhosis adopted father

1049
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:17,247
The truth about George Soros is damning enough

1050
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,039
It's got a quote

1051
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,367
About the following week the kind-hearted

1052
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,415
Nazi local militia

1053
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:26,975
An average hear the unhappy lad up

1054
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:28,767
Took him off with him

1055
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,303
Already here he's lying

1056
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,351
The

1057
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,631
Quotes

1058
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,655
Kind-hearted

1059
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:36,191
Local Nazi militia

1060
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:39,263
Where they talk about The Oath Keepers

1061
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,311
Blouses

1062
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,591
Which is the name

1063
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,895
Thibodaux Soros

1064
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:46,431
Alex George Soros

1065
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,991
This is from his memoirs

1066
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:51,807
Is the name

1067
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:52,575
He gives

1068
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,855
To the adopted

1069
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,695
George Webb

1070
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:58,975
As a young boy

1071
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,791
So Alex is already turning this one individual

1072
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:04,863
Into a Nazi militia

1073
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:08,191
But you see he's already twisting this

1074
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:08,959
Image of bacteria

1075
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:13,567
About the following week the kind-hearted

1076
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:15,615
Local militia

1077
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:17,919
An effort to cheer unhappy let up

1078
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:20,223
Took him off with him to the provinces

1079
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:28,159
I'm a modern

1080
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:30,463
Estate of a Jewish aristocrat

1081
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,999
Baron mordo

1082
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,023
Kornfeld

1083
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:36,351
Swan Village

1084
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:41,471
But what was left of the staff George also met several other measuring officials

1085
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:43,775
Young man

1086
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,103
The alleged godson of mister

1087
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,127
Bath wash

1088
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:50,943
Help with the inventory

1089
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:54,015
Surrounded

1090
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,551
Regain their spirits

1091
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:57,343
On Saturday return to business

1092
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,879
That's George Soros

1093
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:00,671
And a rich juice house

1094
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:02,207
Taking the property

1095
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,535
In his father's and his adopted father

1096
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,095
So

1097
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:12,447
Go find that book that that is

1098
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:15,007
That is in there except for Oz editorializing

1099
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:20,127
But this quote from the National Review is yet another example of cherry-picking quotes

1100
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,663
Zorro seem Super Evil

1101
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:26,271
It's taken from page 71 Soros George's father's memoirs

1102
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,551
Once

1103
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:30,623
Note is that it's completely deprives contact

1104
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:31,903
Use this quote

1105
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,951
Immediately before the passage

1106
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,231
Did Alex just read

1107
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,511
Is this

1108
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,047
Blouses

1109
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:40,095
Was charged with the ministry of vitamin A

1110
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,703
Weekend

1111
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:47,519
The rest of the time you spent taking inventory the province

1112
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,311
During the week George past

1113
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:51,103
Time alone in blouses apartment

1114
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,663
Lacking anything to do he caught the attention of some

1115
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,199
His schoolmates who lived in the building

1116
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:55,967
Lacrosse

1117
00:57:56,479 --> 00:58:00,063
Communicating by hand signals they seem surprised at the stop in somebody else

1118
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,599
The following

1119
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,135
The kind-hearted blouses

1120
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:05,951
In an effort to cheer up the unhappy lab

1121
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:06,719
Took him off with

1122
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:07,743
The provinces

1123
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:10,303
So you already have the contacts to your other

1124
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,119
Miserable

1125
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,655
He said he doesn't

1126
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,191
Isolated doesn't know what to do

1127
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:18,239
So The Godfather

1128
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:21,055
On this one

1129
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:22,591
To the presidency

1130
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:26,431
Put the argument that he was working

1131
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,711
Rounding up an inch

1132
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:28,991
Inventorying

1133
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:32,319
The property and stuff working for the Nazis

1134
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,599
When you realize that

1135
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:36,159
This passage where he went to this estate

1136
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,439
And was

1137
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,719
Or whatever

1138
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,535
It's in the context of

1139
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:47,167
Written out

1140
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:50,239
Not immediately after this

1141
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,263
Describe how blouses

1142
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:54,079
Just try to accommodate a sad young boy living in hiding with

1143
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:56,383
So we allowed to go roam the hills and

1144
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,151
Exploring

1145
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:00,223
There he's almost discovered by a guard

1146
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:01,247
What is allowed to pass out

1147
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,599
This is related this is been related

1148
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,879
Do a story of George

1149
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,159
Just friend of Jeremiah

1150
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,439
Who is not so lucky

1151
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,719
And ended up going

1152
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,487
Cast

1153
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:14,815
Jizo the reality of this story

1154
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,887
Piece of the story that they're cutting out

1155
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:20,191
Is taken from a larger hole of

1156
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:20,959
To Vdara

1157
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,287
This part of

1158
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,311
Cirrhosis

1159
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,591
When he was younger

1160
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:29,151
When he was in hiding it was miserable

1161
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:30,431
This guy tried to cheer him up

1162
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,711
He took him along

1163
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:34,271
To this estate where they had some wine

1164
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,319
Some folks

1165
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,111
And he took note of some of the

1166
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:38,879
The thing

1167
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,159
Things that were in the house that we're going

1168
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:41,183
Would be confiscated

1169
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:42,207
Who gives a s***

1170
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,487
And then he came back

1171
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,047
Nearly died

1172
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:52,447
Work it out you know how a lot of

1173
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:56,031
Cutting Edge of almost dying at altar

1174
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:56,799
Yeah

1175
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:57,823
Jesus

1176
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,383
F***** up

1177
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,151
Ending

1178
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:03,199
Tim is a Nazi

1179
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:03,967
Collaborate

1180
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:05,247
Withers

1181
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,527
When there's a

1182
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:13,439
Getting out of it from not being killed

1183
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:16,511
Like you very well may not have had any Soros

1184
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:20,863
Right because he could have died

1185
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,703
I have had

1186
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:28,031
Tons of people who have found the article that I wrote

1187
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,567
About how Soros wasn't

1188
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,103
On our website

1189
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,895
Tons of people who come

1190
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,223
Cast or anything like

1191
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,527
And they will say yes he was

1192
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,807
I'll ask them for a point

1193
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:41,855
And then I will

1194
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:43,903
No one has a good heart

1195
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,951
No one Alex doesn't

1196
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:47,231
Nobody who's cam

1197
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:47,999
And

1198
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:48,767
Pride Flags

1199
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,047
Has a good argument

1200
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,583
There's something that I started

1201
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,607
F****** realize

1202
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:53,631
Really really

1203
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:55,423
And that

1204
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,215
All these people

1205
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:59,775
To have this store has brain worm going on

1206
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:01,823
Do you know what they have

1207
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,359
Fingerboards

1208
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,895
Sympathy for the Nazis

1209
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:06,175
Then a thirteen-year-old

1210
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:08,991
Target of dinar

1211
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:16,671
Understand that there was a

1212
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,719
We got him

1213
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:21,791
You know they were sucking Mass killing people

1214
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:27,935
You know

1215
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,471
I feel like

1216
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:31,519
Writing down there

1217
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,543
Over here is

1218
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,591
Collaborating

1219
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,895
I honestly think like if this is what you

1220
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:37,663
You got

1221
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:39,199
You are an embarrassment

1222
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,527
Collaborate and listen

1223
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:45,087
I just think that

1224
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:46,623
Sockshare

1225
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:47,391
I went out

1226
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,159
Alex

1227
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:52,511
Rodger sitting here talking about is because we're a beacon of Truth

1228
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:54,815
And then you come with that week

1229
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:56,351
National Review

1230
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,631
Be f****** ashamed of themselves

1231
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,423
For printing without

1232
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,447
Contacts

1233
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,215
Depart in

1234
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:08,639
Specifically

1235
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:14,527
Because he's Jewish

1236
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:15,295
Later

1237
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:18,111
Rambles about Service ribbon

1238
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:22,975
He doesn't like Judaism

1239
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:24,511
Validated

1240
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:25,791
Experience

1241
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:26,559
Or something

1242
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,327
I have no power

1243
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,607
F****** idea but it just

1244
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:29,887
All this is

1245
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,959
I don't even like Soros

1246
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:33,727
I'll fight any

1247
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,311
I want

1248
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:39,359
Someone to actually make a good point

1249
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:43,967
To do with that one little possible insider-trading thing that he did

1250
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:45,503
In the

1251
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,039
Lady

1252
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:51,903
Anything I think it's earlier

1253
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:59,327
I was like to see the differences between the soft and then later on

1254
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,119
Hits the heart

1255
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:04,191
They're going to some rich Jews

1256
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,543
If we needed more evidence

1257
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,615
But if we did need more evidence

1258
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:13,151
Of this being a

1259
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,431
Very white

1260
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:15,455
Centric

1261
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,223
Operation

1262
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:18,271
Submit

1263
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,807
This clip of Rodger Stone

1264
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,087
How does McDonald's

1265
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:27,743
There's a lot of commentary about the nomination and election of a

1266
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:30,303
In the Democratic party in Queens New York

1267
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:32,351
Realize that

1268
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,887
Cortez

1269
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:37,471
Defeated Joker

1270
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:39,263
Machine White

1271
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:42,335
Working class traditional liberal Democrat

1272
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:54,623
Person

1273
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,159
He was a classic liberal

1274
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:06,655
There's no room for

1275
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:08,191
In the Democratic Party

1276
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:11,007
There's not even room for classical liberal

1277
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:15,871
In the Democratic Party

1278
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,151
And Cortez

1279
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,431
What does that mean

1280
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:19,967
What does that tell you

1281
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:26,879
You need two people of color in it isn't anymore guys

1282
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:29,695
Beat white man

1283
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,231
Who's the classic liberal

1284
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:35,071
She should have been able to do that he's a decent fellow.

1285
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:48,895
What is Alexandria

1286
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:52,223
Name me one politician Congress

1287
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:52,991
I mean

1288
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:55,295
You just got elected yesterday

1289
01:04:55,807 --> 01:05:00,159
Tell me what is the first hundred days

1290
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:02,207
Administration

1291
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:06,047
So I don't think there's any way to look at that other than Rodger Stone

1292
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,071
Clearly trying to

1293
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:09,887
Express

1294
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,471
The cutback

1295
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:16,031
But I think it's really interesting to hear Alex

1296
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:19,359
Trying to be like

1297
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,127
Like Alex

1298
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,151
Trying to

1299
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:27,295
Walk Rodger back a little bit and then

1300
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:28,575
Not

1301
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:37,023
He delivered for his people

1302
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:39,839
Raise the ship

1303
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,119
Razor

1304
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,423
The level

1305
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,447
That's such a

1306
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,567
Have to walk it back a little bit

1307
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:53,407
Cuz he's being sued

1308
01:05:55,455 --> 01:06:00,063
Most racist flag

1309
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:03,647
Supremacist

1310
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:07,487
Second Sight

1311
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:10,559
He is

1312
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,399
Yeah it comes out

1313
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,423
The Jeff sessions

1314
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:23,615
You asked me to quit

1315
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,639
That's good fight

1316
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:32,831
Next

1317
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:34,623
The law firm was a scam

1318
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:38,719
Scamming people in the guy who hates

1319
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:45,375
It's almost like he's gearing up to fire Mueller I didn't have enough time to look into him all that much before we started workout

1320
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:49,471
For the day

1321
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:55,871
You look really nice.

1322
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:57,919
Everyone was

1323
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:59,199
Article

1324
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:01,759
Talk about Mueller probe

1325
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:02,527
Too far and stuff

1326
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:07,391
Everything I was able to glean again in my elementary research

1327
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:10,463
Would still be in charge

1328
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:12,255
Do the probe until someone is

1329
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,279
Confirmed

1330
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:17,375
Yeah I don't know if that's a hundred percent accurate that that was a sense I was getting

1331
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:19,423
I do believe that it was

1332
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,471
To get rid of

1333
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:26,591
It is an indication that like power in the house

1334
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:33,503
I got a lot more about Bennie and the head of that committee is going to be able to subpoena

1335
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:40,671
Returns and if I just say no

1336
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,439
Nope

1337
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,583
Alexandra's next clip

1338
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,631
Is talking about how Rodger predicted

1339
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:50,911
The sessions is going to

1340
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:51,679
Be fired

1341
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:59,871
Literally say like a month ago

1342
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:02,431
Rodger and Alex

1343
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:05,503
God-knows-how-long

1344
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:07,295
Eventually you're going to be

1345
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,319
With the Trump Administration

1346
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,343
You're calling for someone to go

1347
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,415
It's only a matter of time

1348
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,719
I'm by Alex claims that Rodger has

1349
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:15,487
Prognostic

1350
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:16,511
Skating ability

1351
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:18,815
But the way you phrase it is really troubling

1352
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:24,447
Ladies and gentlemen exactly as Rodger Stone predicted a month ago

1353
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,471
And last night

1354
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:29,823
You want to change the subject mr. president

1355
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:38,271
He said you must fire

1356
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,063
Sessions

1357
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:43,135
And Rosenstein to change the narrative

1358
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:45,439
From the election lost loss

1359
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:54,911
We need a man

1360
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:59,007
You need to fire him so we can change the conversation

1361
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:02,591
I'm good on them

1362
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:10,783
For what I'm saying is

1363
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,831
Screaming this forever

1364
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:14,111
Of course eventually.

1365
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:16,159
Going to be right

1366
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:16,927
I think their EX

1367
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,511
Mr. president

1368
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,791
Change the narrative

1369
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:24,095
By firing your attorney

1370
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,399
It's pretend like I don't

1371
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:27,423
I'm not

1372
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:29,215
A hundred percent sure that's

1373
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:30,239
What Trump is doing

1374
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:33,567
But if it is and there's nothing like this

1375
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:35,103
It all looks really bad

1376
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,895
Because why

1377
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:37,663
Like what

1378
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,455
What's wrong with The Narrative of

1379
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:41,503
You guys not really losing

1380
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:45,855
I mean that that narrative still forces you to admit that you lost

1381
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:56,607
Truck and admit that he lost he's the one who's

1382
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:58,911
Alex

1383
01:09:59,167 --> 01:09:59,679
The appearance

1384
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,471
This Paul Joseph Watson

1385
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,007
24-hours

1386
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:03,775
Who cares

1387
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:06,335
You going to take calls

1388
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:10,687
Angry dragon

1389
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:12,991
Is talking about how great they are

1390
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:14,015
NSX

1391
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:15,039
Cuz it's so funny

1392
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,831
Alex is talking about how America

1393
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:17,599
India's

1394
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:20,415
Give my bonus

1395
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,695
Fides

1396
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:30,911
Claiming that known super Patriots like Donald Trump

1397
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:33,471
Rodger Stone

1398
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:39,615
This is

1399
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:40,383
Okay

1400
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:44,223
Superpaint

1401
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:45,759
For Thoroughbred America

1402
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:47,295
It doesn't exist okay

1403
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:52,927
Michigan

1404
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:54,207
Trinity

1405
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:56,255
Garbage

1406
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:57,279
Okay

1407
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:59,071
Infinity times a trillion garbage

1408
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:03,679
Doesn't get more American than fighting against the Union

1409
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:07,007
Advocate Over Texas

1410
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,287
See the number of time

1411
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:10,847
That's because he's so American

1412
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:15,199
Rodger Stone who made millions and millions of dollars work

1413
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:16,223
King for foreign

1414
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:21,855
Necessarily in America's best interest

1415
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:26,719
A multinational corporation

1416
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:28,767
Already seems to prioritize over

1417
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:32,607
I would qualify as

1418
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:34,143
Super Patriots

1419
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:36,703
Actually

1420
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:42,847
People who actively want to destroy America trillion times

1421
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:48,223
What is the trillion times

1422
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:55,647
Very poor

1423
01:11:58,975 --> 01:11:59,487
Noting

1424
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:01,791
Is that a little bit of a

1425
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:02,559
Jim Acosta

1426
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:10,495
Much

1427
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:11,519
You're bad

1428
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:14,591
What's more important than attacking the Free Press

1429
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:16,639
You asked me a question I don't like your bad

1430
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:19,967
I'm going to have this woman

1431
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:24,831
I can't believe people let you work for them

1432
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:27,647
So

1433
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:29,439
So adults

1434
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,487
Do we have any

1435
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,767
Do we have any more

1436
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:33,791
Philippine that way

1437
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:35,583
But buried in that Exchange

1438
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:37,887
Is Jim Acosta

1439
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,423
About the

1440
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,447
Rhetoric

1441
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,983
The Trump used about the Caravan

1442
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:43,263
In the lead-up to the Moon

1443
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:46,079
Trump's response to that is I want

1444
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,103
People in

1445
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:50,431
Because we've got jobs we've got to fill with Industries coming back

1446
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:52,479
Because That's Amore

1447
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,247
His self

1448
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:56,319
Perception

1449
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,599
The markets are doing good

1450
01:12:57,855 --> 01:13:00,415
He only needed to drum up that race racist

1451
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:02,975
Fervor in order to bring people out to vote

1452
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:08,863
That largely in this

1453
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:09,631
Strange's

1454
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:10,655
Characterize it isn't

1455
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:14,751
Like

1456
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:17,055
What we need to be invaded

1457
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:23,199
So notice Amazon splitting up the thing in the two things come on

1458
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,735
So noticeably that's absent

1459
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:25,759
From Trump's press

1460
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:26,783
It's also

1461
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:27,807
Fairly absent

1462
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:28,575
From Alex

1463
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:29,343
Is rhetoric

1464
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:33,439
He's still a little bit on that tape

1465
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:38,047
You said it was going to happen right before the midterms ordering

1466
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,399
Anyway

1467
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:45,215
Restaurants

1468
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:46,495
Prince was petulant

1469
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:47,263
Nonsense

1470
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,799
It was a childish man

1471
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:51,103
Lashing out at people who were trying to ask

1472
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,127
Fair

1473
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:52,895
Questions

1474
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:55,711
This is the response

1475
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:56,735
That Alex

1476
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:57,759
Rodger has

1477
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:58,783
And I think

1478
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,063
They're fairly

1479
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:03,135
Such a moment

1480
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:06,719
Everything we wanted

1481
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,767
And all the fake qanon people

1482
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,351
No no

1483
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:21,311
When he put sessions in Utah

1484
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:24,895
But don't worry it'll be dealt with

1485
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,455
Happening ladies and gentlemen

1486
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:31,295
Selection

1487
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:39,743
Now you may see the real down from someone you just saw slapping

1488
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:44,095
Jim Kosta back that was the Trump that I know that was the Trump that I love

1489
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:50,751
That's what I love about him so I get ready for Donald Trump Unchained

1490
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:52,287
God I'm ready

1491
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:04,063
So that brings us to the end of this adventure on November 7th

1492
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:04,831
28

1493
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:08,671
We can glean from it are positive

1494
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:10,463
Towards Alex

1495
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,487
Show

1496
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:12,255
Being a listener

1497
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:14,559
Which is good for

1498
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:17,375
It's not great for the world

1499
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:19,679
I mean the world has got its work cut out for

1500
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:22,495
There was no part of either of us

1501
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:24,799
Person I believe

1502
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:27,103
Whose thoughts term election

1503
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:27,871
Could

1504
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:29,663
Substantially changed

1505
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:30,431
Situation where

1506
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:34,271
Even if Democrats have taken over both houses of Congress

1507
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:36,319
It won every Governor house

1508
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,343
In the country

1509
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:39,647
That doesn't deal with the issues that were

1510
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,951
The government stuff

1511
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:42,719
Is a real bra

1512
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,303
In care of

1513
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,071
Taken care of

1514
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:48,351
Whether it be voter

1515
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,375
Enfranchisement

1516
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:50,399
Big issue

1517
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,167
Climate change

1518
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,447
Massive issue

1519
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,983
Economics

1520
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,519
Disparity

1521
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:58,591
Those are those are issues

1522
01:15:58,847 --> 01:15:59,871
We need the government

1523
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:00,895
Checkpoint on

1524
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:02,175
And work towards

1525
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:04,735
But the real issues that we're facing

1526
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:06,015
In terms of extremism

1527
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,039
In terms of the

1528
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:08,831
Trend towards

1529
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:11,135
White nationalist violence

1530
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:14,207
Right

1531
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,487
Adjacent violence

1532
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,255
Like

1533
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,023
Misogynist

1534
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:18,047
Violence

1535
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:19,071
I think you could categorize

1536
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,911
Had to keep shooting people

1537
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:23,935
Maybe in that

1538
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:24,703
In that camp

1539
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:25,471
Doughsserts

1540
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:26,495
Things are the real issues

1541
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:27,519
I need to deal with

1542
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:29,055
And I don't think any measure

1543
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:29,823
Sure of

1544
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:32,639
Left success in government

1545
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,175
So

1546
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:36,223
That's my type

1547
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:37,759
There's a real positive

1548
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:40,319
Does real

1549
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:41,599
Unfortunate

1550
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:43,647
Should have gone better thing

1551
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:46,207
And then the bigger picture of

1552
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:48,511
We all need

1553
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:53,887
I don't know I don't know but probably

1554
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:54,655
The problems

1555
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:55,935
With all of

1556
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:02,335
A lot of it

1557
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:05,407
It's a very vocal violin section perhaps

1558
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,687
But that's still our problem

1559
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:09,247
Yeah that's true

1560
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,527
And I think that week

1561
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:11,807
We can help

1562
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:12,831
People as much as

1563
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:15,391
I think that there is

1564
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:16,927
There's active Soul search

1565
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:20,255
Extremists by

1566
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:22,303
People need to do in order to

1567
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:23,327
Be helpful

1568
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:24,607
In the coming

1569
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:31,007
Most of Florida underwater

1570
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:37,151
More like interpersonal climate

1571
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:39,711
So I don't know I don't know I don't really have a message

1572
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:41,247
About this but

1573
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:44,063
This is much more listen to

1574
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:51,231
Bluetooth on the Shelf

1575
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:54,559
It when you have a man who believes in the cons

1576
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:55,327
Institution

1577
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,119
And the Ten Commandment

1578
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,935
Which are perfectly aligned

1579
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:00,959
Each other if you recall

1580
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:02,751
Everybody knows

1581
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:05,567
Nothing is nothing goes hand-in-hand more than the

1582
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:08,383
Constitution in the Ten Commandments that whole Amendment about covet

1583
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:19,135
Yeah I don't know babe

1584
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:21,183
But

1585
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:28,351
Do everything we can to get rid of

1586
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:34,495
You've got a chance. Just leave so we can do better

1587
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:38,335
Let's hope for the few

1588
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:39,615
The f****** worse

1589
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:46,271
But you can't find out

1590
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:47,807
Underscore

1591
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:50,111
Can you find us on Facebook where can't find out

1592
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:54,207
Where the group

1593
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,487
Go home and tell your mother your brother

1594
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:57,535
Unfortunately you can't find out

1595
01:18:59,327 --> 01:18:59,839
You can't

1596
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:00,863
Find

1597
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:03,423
Ensure with the status

1598
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:05,215
Question

1599
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:08,031
Describe review all that good stuff

1600
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,639
I don't think they killed

1601
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:14,943
Play me some

1602
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:19,807
Locations of them B I don't know anybody from voting

1603
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:21,599
Let's play

1604
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:26,719
There was one lady at least voted before the election

1605
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:29,791
Oh no

1606
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:35,167
Devoting

1607
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:35,935
This season

1608
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:37,983
Jones

1609
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:46,943
