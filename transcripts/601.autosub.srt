I guess via George Lucas talk show is back hell yeah I enjoyed it

13
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,792

No matter what form you take

25
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,064
Brother wearing a blue nose or not I don't feel comfortable I can understand that

26
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,672
My bright spot is what's it called

27
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,256
Speed Korean show on Netflix

28
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:45,632
And it's essentially like a battle royale and parasite put together

29
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,424
Bunch of people

30
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,824
Trapped in the miseries of capitalism fighting each other to survive and

31
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,616
To get money and food and all that stuff

32
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:59,456
And the way that put together is a series of games that

33
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,272
Murder 500 people for the

34
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,040
Benefit of the road

35
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
Okay.

36
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,600
That's pretty good

37
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136
That's all and it's all like

38
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:13,024
Children's games you know like one the fridge the very first episode not to spoil anything

39
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304
It's the whole hook

40
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,376
Book of the f****** show you go in there

41
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,168
Everybody's playing Red Light Green Light

42
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,728
And if you lose

43
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,592

I have to apologize

47
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,696
Yes. You were speaking metaphorically about the murdering people like

48
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:48,096
The opposite directions

49
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,424
Can understand why you can handle watching this

50
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,824
Pointed and it saved

51
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
The murder party

52
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,128
I thought it was like that

53
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:04,992
Can you fit through the whole show

54
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:13,184
Forgot to do a pose until I get smashed into a wall it's fantastic that existed

55
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208

00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:22,655
I just had a memory the other day of Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire

58
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,983
Yeah it wasn't he liked something

59
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,543
Yeah LOL

60
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,591
Obviously

61
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,615
I can't

62
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,967
Our culture is bad now but man we weren't great then either

63
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:40,575
We did that I think what people need to understand it it started bad

64
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,647
And it slowly and then quickly gotten worse

65
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:50,047
More or less who Wants to Marry a multi-millionaire

66
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,119
So Jordan today we are going to

67
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:59,519

00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,479
Never on Monday

74
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,807
I think this is this is low-key

75
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,855
He one of the boar

76
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,951
Maybe educational or Illuminating episodes of Alex and show

77
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,231
But I've listened to it a long time

78
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,559
And also there's some amazing ironies

79
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,839
Knowing what we know in

80
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:30,239
In the future that will probably get me label to which god dammit

81
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,031

Text Jessica thank you so much

87
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,231

00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:55,583
Play Jessica Jones is only two years older than Dave Rubin

89
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
I'm a policy wonk

90
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:04,287

Jordans

94
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,527
We're going to start here

95
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,319
On 2003

96
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,087
Dune

97
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:17,855
16

98
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,183
This purse clip I actually miss her

99
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,999
The first time I was listening through the episode

100
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,279
Pretty excited

101
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,815
Because I thought Alex was

102
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
Teasing app

103
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,423
Guess he was going to have on his show as opposed to a subject

104
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,191
He was going to do

105
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,215
Discuss

106
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,287
And then I got really disappointed when I realized I was first

107
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,079
Going to be on the show cuz I thought it would have been

108
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,871
Very interest

109
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,943
Talking about

110
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,247
Charles

111
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,647
Under Medicaid Medicare fraud

112
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:12,639
So Charles cell was a dentist from St Louis who is charged with Medicare

113
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
A frog

114
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:19,807
Even before you got in those legal hot water heater shown signs of severe mental illness with his own doctor ordering him into hospice

115
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,831
Asian a

116
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,623
Revealed that he was concerned that

117
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,647
Communist

118
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,927
Contaminated the feeling

119
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,207
This lady was putting into people

120
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,511
He's just a regular old purchase

121
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:32,607
Hospital he was medicated to code control the symptoms

122
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,471
He returned to practice but ended up having more flare-ups like when quote

123
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,031
He told police a leopard was getting on a city bus

124
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,359
And I several in which he thought people in his community were out

125
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
Tequila

126
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:51,039
Is mail fraud six counts of Medicaid fraud in a count of money laundering in 1990s

127
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,831
On accusations of quote

128
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:58,207
Submitting false claims including false documents and x-rays to Medicaid and private insurers

129
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,231
For dental services

130
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,511
He did not provide

131
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,327
Immediately became an issue for the courts

132
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,119
About whether or not he was competent

133
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
Set the stand trial

134
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,959
Initially he was said to be competent but I imagine that

135
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:12,799
It probably didn't help his case that it is first bond hearing in front of a federal Magistrate

136
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,895
Quote doctor sell scream to the magistrate using racial epithets

137
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:20,479
When she tried to continue the hearing he shouted and spat in her face

138
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
Cool

139
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,295
Cool

140
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,831
Alright Behavior

141
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,415
Then in April 1998

142
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:32,767
For quote conspiring to murder and the attempted murder of a witness in the fraud case

143
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,303
And an FBI agent

144
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,375
Okay well that when you're probably not going to come back from

145
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,935
There was a growing concern about his mental well-being

146
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:46,335
And the danger he could possibly pose if he was left untreated and in July 1999 a court ordered him to be given an

147
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,359
Antipsychotic meds

148
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
Against his will

149
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,943
This ruling was delayed pending another here

150
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:56,063
In August 2004 court-ordered him medicated and the appeal went to the 8th circuit

151
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,367
Record who decided not to rehear the case

152
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,647
On a 5-4 vote

153
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,719
Ultimately in June 2003

154
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:07,327
Do US Supreme Court would weigh again and Rule 63 in the case of cell versus United States

155
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,863
Affirming that quote

156
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:14,239
Forcibly drugging a defendant solely for trial competent is appropriate only in limited circumstances

157
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,359
This would overturn the previous order for him to be medicated involuntarily

158
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,407
And fascinatingly guess what

159
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,711
The Supreme Court ruling actually happened on

160
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,247
June 16th

161
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:29,599
Exact day that this episode were listening to was being recorded by Alex

162
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,135
Were you covering the subject

163
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:31,903
No

164
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:37,791
Very weird no I refuse I refuse to believe you it's very bizarre

165
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:44,191
In 2004 he was ruled fit to stand trial and his lawyers trying like hell to get him to agree to a plea deal

166
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:49,823
All the Frog stuff was one thing but that conspiracy to murder was not something that was going to be as easily move past

167
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:56,735
According to the Post-Dispatch article from the time cell agreed to plead guilty to a fraud charge but not the murderer

168
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
Conspiracy one

169
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:04,159
Those lawyers were trying to get him ruled unfit to stand trial again

170
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,207
More difficult to

171
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,487
This dude

172
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:13,887
Reasons that it's taken less seriously like some of this conversation

173
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,423
The Conspiracy to murder thing

174
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,215
Is there a lot of snow

175
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,239
The courts believe

176
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,775
But that was a manifestation

177
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,335
Reasons that made him under

178
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:26,943
Unfit to Sara Lee a sincere effort to

179
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,991
Conspire to murder somebody

180
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,527
It was

181
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:34,879
It's a when the conversations about whether or not it's appropriate to forcibly medicate him

182
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,463
It was strictly along the conversations of the fraud charge

183
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,255
And that

184
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,535
Just fascinating

185
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,631
So in the end he accepted a plea deal where he pled no contest

186
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,911
About all the charges

187
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
And he was

188
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,495
2 time served and 6 months in a halfway house

189
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,031
And then three years bro

190
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:58,431
Story particularly ones bad to he had allegations of mistreatment while he was in prison

191
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,735
These are very important things and I don't need to brush

192
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
Femicide at all but

193
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,575
For the time being this case is a perfect example of what

194
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,647
I was talking about back in episode 1 of our podcast

195
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,975
But I thought there was an important role that someone who is Alex

196
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,255
Pretends to be

197
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,791
Play in society

198
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,839
This case is f****** hard

199
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:19,167
Because even assuming it's I was guilty of Medicare fraud which

200
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,191
He definitely was

201
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
At what

202
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:25,055
Point does his individual liberty intersect with the public need to adjudicate this

203
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,127
Fraud charges are non-violent crimes

204
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,967
So does the public interest really demand that he be medicated so we can be confident

205
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,247
The stand trial for that

206
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,295
If not what should you do

207
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,367
Use the product people and the public Healthcare System

208
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,439
So there can't be no consequences but what are you doing that

209
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,207
That situation

210
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
It's a mess

211
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,767
I've got

212
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,071
Very easily taken care of okay

213
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,095
Truman Show

214
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,375
Vivian

215
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:53,727
That seems prohibitive expenses you would think that but it would solve the problem

216
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:59,103
So these are the sort of hard questions that don't have clear-cut answers because they really do boiled down to where you think

217
00:11:59,359 --> 00:11:59,871
The line is

218
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:05,759
Between the Liberties of individuals and when that encroaches on the responsibilities we all have to each other

219
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:10,111
Someone like Alex is obviously an extremist on the side of individual liberties

220
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:14,719
But this case has the territory we actually have an interesting case study to look at

221
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,255
Where you can say that the state

222
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,303
Has no right to demand medication

223
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,583
I'm going to hear you out

224
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,631
And you can say that the state has an obligation

225
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,655
The demand medication

226
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,191
I do hear that out too

227
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,727
Both sides of this ham

228
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,543
You know compelling places

229
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,567
To come from

230
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,335
Right right

231
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,895
It's honestly just a shame because even in 2000

232
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
Three you can see Alex

233
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,455
It's completely f****** up playing

234
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,271
The role of somebody who just isn't the individual liberty

235
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:43,647
You can even report the details of this case accurately because he's not confident he can make the argument for this guy

236
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,463
If he has to accept all the unsavory aspects

237
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
McKay's

238
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:52,351
The details of the case get in the way of him being able to even talk about it

239
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
Vueling corrupt

240
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
In the city

241
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
Bogota

242
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,495
It seems like he was more.

243
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
Frauding medic

244
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,055
Well we'll get to

245
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,615
Alex means by that later cuz it's quite a reveal

246
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,639
I'm interested but

247
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,919
For now

248
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,199
Yeah

249
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:12,319
Also because it's about you know who was they're actively trying to fight for a doctor sales rights

250
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,111
Why not how about the ATL

251
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:19,487
Nope the ACLU wear clothes

252
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,839
They filed a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of self-seeking to urge the court to reverse

253
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,887
The decision to medicate him against his will

254
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,167
So weird that they would do that

255
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:32,287
That considering how Alex thinks they're evil

256
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,079
Another thing really quick

257
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:39,711
This is basically nothing to do with the legal questions that the case brings up but I have a hunch of the Charles cell also happen

258
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,503
Since to be a racist a******

259
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:47,135
It's easy to Tribute his use of slurs and cord is possibly like a manifestation of a mental break

260
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,719
That becomes harder to argue when you realize that he was also prior to this

261
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,511
A member of the Council of conservative

262
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
There we go

263
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:59,423
The CCC is a hyper right-wing white nationalist organization that super against what they call quotes

264
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,959
Mixing of the races

265
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,543
Make no mistake about it if you're messing around with the counselor

266
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
Conservative citizen

267
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:09,151
It's not because you're politically conservative it's because you're a straight-up racist

268
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,967
One look at their publication the citizens Informer

269
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,247
Where should clear up any concerns

270
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,527
You may have if you think

271
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,807
That I'm being unfair

272
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,879
If you're a member of the organization you are a piece of s***

273
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:23,231
Dylann roof did they write that in the conservative Informer I didn't

274
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:27,583
I just headed to quote that was me

275
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,887
Dylann roof the guy who murdered 9 black

276
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,703
People because they were black at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal

277
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,983
Church in Charleston

278
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,567
Specifically mentions the Council of conservative citizens website

279
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,407
Is being the thing that Ross started him down his pasty white nationalism

280
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
It is manifest

281
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,199
Bestowed

282
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:47,295
Play f*** this Charles cell guy is clearly a racist by a butt

283
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,087
Still Standing his case

284
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
These issues

285
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,439
Uninvolved involuntary medicating like

286
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:57,023
That conversation is a Justified and it's something that's worth

287
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,559
Having that conversation

288
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,631
And it's just a shame that Alex is such a s*** head that he can't

289
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,447
Be the side of that conversation that

290
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,471
He should be

291
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,751
Right

292
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,311
Someone who pretends to have the political beliefs

293
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,591
Says that he does

294
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:17,503
Someone who has it as a voice in this

295
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,319
It is it is kind of that question of like

296
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:25,439
And I could even I could absolutely here at the argument of somebody being like

297
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,207
No

298
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,767
This is a power that

299
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,047
A government

300
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:30,815
Could use

301
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,607
Could use well

302
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,631
But not out

303
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,471
Our government cannot use it well they can only abused it

304
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:41,311
So that's a that's a fair argument to have the other argument is that

305
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,615
Hey man people are doing their f****** best

306
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,919
This guy is out of control

307
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:49,503
Maybe we don't have to like turn it into a whole thing

308
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,783
Yeah

309
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,343
I conceived definitely

310
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,135
A very difficult

311
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,415
Conversation

312
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
To be had about like

313
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,975
What if you allow

314
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
Medicating

315
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,559
Just for the sake of him being able to stand trial

316
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,351
Against his will

317
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,375
The Medicaid

318
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,399
In the case of this

319
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,215
Like Medicare fraud case

320
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
What is the line

321
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
That it is

322
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:16,127
Appropriate where do you set the line of who can you forcibly Medicaid

323
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,431
What type of behavior is bmdd

324
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,711
Like

325
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,991
Deserving of

326
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,039
A vat as a solution

327
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:28,159
Find what the documentation required for that behavior because yeah it's incredibly

328
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:31,231
No there's so many places to abuse

329
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,255
Places to fuk up

330
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:36,351
At the same time I know that sometimes people

331
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,239
Certainly

332
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:47,103
Come up in our lives

333
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
I don't know

334
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,455
I don't know it's a really really interesting question

335
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,783
Alex should be nowhere near it

336
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,575
No

337
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,391
That's exactly what Alex pretends to be

338
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,975
I know but

339
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:12,191
Why this is what the

340
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:20,127
All I can do is tell you it's tough

341
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,735
So Alex

342
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,783
I thought you were going to have that guy on a Zagg

343
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,135
He just talks about it

344
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,927
Does have

345
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,231
A couple of gas

346
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:39,071
Okay who does a radio show on Alex's Network I guess.

347
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351
Some shortwave s***

348
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,911
Another guess that's a little bit more legit

349
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,095
Organization

350
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:20,031
So I guess Alex has a bizarrely mainstream Gaston this episode in the form of a Harper's writer Jeff sharlet

351
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,055
I'm very confused

352
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,663
So Charlie was the executive producer of the 2019 Netflix series

353
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,431
The family

354
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:29,759
Which is actually what this 2003 article in Harper's was about

355
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:33,087
I don't know if he's read this article cuz he thinks

356
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,367
Just called the Brotherhood which is

357
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,903
It's not called in the article

358
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:40,767
Not by the fact that his confusion is because members are referred to as brothers in the first line

359
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,559
This is a

360
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:46,399
Messed up religious extremist group it's also not like they're super Fringe

361
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,423
Who does

362
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
Part of the problem

363
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:54,847
Extremely powerful put on the National Prayer Breakfast every year where

364
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:03,807
President show up and give speeches a book about the group in 2008 largely about other

365
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,623
This group of extreme fundamentalist Christians are deeply entrenched

366
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,903
Conservative politics

367
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:14,559
Which Alta probably agree with Envy all four in 2020

368
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:20,959
About how it's a evil evil illuminati people who 20 years from now

369
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,007
I will say should be our God

370
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,311
Of course

371
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:31,711
Yeah yeah yeah great white be sensing a little bit of the irony that I'm talkin about

372
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:37,343
I hate the world before Alex gets into any of the real meat of the issues today

373
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
Cookie Supply

374
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,647
For his websites

375
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,487
What are these might stick out

376
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
The website

377
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,303
Call Ward

378
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:47,839
Call Ward

379
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,679
Virgin

380
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
Cam

381
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,431
Did you know that he had prisonplanet.com

382
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,991
No that's not the one that's spelled out

383
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
You know

384
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:09,087
Can you talk

385
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,111
So apparently

386
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:14,719
In 2003 Alex was running a website promoting a town in Utah called The Verge

387
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,743
Which was quote

388
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,815
A model Community for small towns in big cities alike

389
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:23,423
The Virgin city council and citizenry have made virgin a friendly place to live

390
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,215
For those who support the Constitution

391
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:25,983
And Bill of Rights

392
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,103
He started a railroad town

393
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,919
Are they

394
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:37,503
Jones box

395
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,551
This is fascinating

396
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:45,951
In the present day like in the last few years Alex's pretty regularly been talking about how his extremist right-wing buddies need to get together

397
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,999
Start the road self-ruled Verdes

398
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,911
Wow

399
00:20:55,167 --> 00:21:01,311
Wow at least I have more specifics 20 years ago

400
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:05,919
Just rediscovered that Mormon teens have fun

401
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:12,319
They just go in and then don't move like I said it is fun that they rediscovered

402
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:17,952
Common 2003 was up where they learned I thought the Virgin Utah might have been like a homesteading

403
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,512
Kind of like convergent lamb

404
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,560
This is just wild

405
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,376
At the time that City had a population of about

406
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,144
400

407
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,008
And the 2010 census put the city at 1.8% White

408
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,408
The entire reason that Alex is promoting this city is a place for Liberty lovers is because in 2008 pass an ordinance

409
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:41,504
That every citizen had to own a gun

410
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:54,560
On their website they discuss at this ordinance was based on a similar 14

411
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:58,400
From Kennesaw County Georgia although they did misspell Kennesaw

412
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:02,496
Unsupported claims about an 80% drop in quote

413
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:06,080
Every category of crime and the 15 years since cannasouth happy ordinance

414
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,616
Also I love this part

415
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:11,968
One important point for any county or city thinking about passing the sword

416
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,272
Kennesaw County saw population

417
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:17,600
Explosion from under 5,000 citizens over 20,000 today

418
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,928
That's over eight times the growth of the average Community Seas

419
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
It seems

420
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,232
Good news travels

421
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,000
Fast

422
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:28,352
Americans want safe communities where they can raise their children and the right to protect their family

423
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,656
This is actually true

424
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,936
The population growth

425
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:34,752
But it's not really possible to attribute this gun ordinance

426
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,520
Thanks for that growth

427
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,288
Austin population

428
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,848
Camisole with a growing Community for decades

429
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:43,968
Kids experiencing a 160 7.2 per cent growth between 1950 and 1960

430
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,320
And then a 135% 4 % grow

431
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,136
Between 1960 and 1970

432
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:56,768
The gun ordinance was passed in 1982 and population actually only grew 75.4%

433
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,072
Between 1980 and 1990

434
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,120
For picking up to a 140

435
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,168
32.6 per cent growth rate

436
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:03,936
In the next step

437
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:09,824
If anything you could argue that based on the growth rate the city seems to be normally experiencing it was a slump.

438
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:13,920
Uptown place where you have to own a gun

439
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,968
No I don't want to own a gun

440
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:22,368
What are the primary drivers of this population growth the people including the Kennesaw City government's own website

441
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,136
Site attributes

442
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,160
The growth of population

443
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:29,792
Is it they're located right next to Kennesaw State University

444
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,328
Wow there is

445
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:37,728
The rapid growth of population is also spurred by our favorable location with respect to transportation

446
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:41,056
Including I-75 and US Highway 41

447
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:48,224
Maybe it's his meeting with gun ordinance that I'm certain is not enforced

448
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:54,880
Yeah you know what's great about Virgin Utah as they after they passed the gun ordinance

449
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,208
They were like we saw an 80% drop in crime

450
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,768
What do we do with that last 20% right

451
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,048
Next day

452
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,096
Every year one day

453
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,888
All crime is legal

454
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:12,544
And all crime is legal for 24 hours

455
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,848
Crimes

456
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,128
Everyone has to own a tank

457
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:23,296
Public subsidy

458
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,344
Subsidized tank

459
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:30,720
Yeah I guess like you know having a college there and

460
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,024
Good Scituate

461
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,560
Situatedness between

462
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,608
Do large highways

463
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,144
I do know that

464
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,912
That could be

465
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,448
Maybe it's this dumb board

466
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,496
I was going to go with you

467
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:48,896
Explosion of public highways that happened just about everywhere in the 50s and 60s leading to a massive

468
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:53,760
Amount of travel and people who would be brought

469
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,296
To the area by the college

470
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,160
I guess one way you could tell is that like

471
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,976
I guess Virgin Utah should have a massive

472
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:03,744
Explosion of

473
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,024
Population 2

474
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
20 years ago

475
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,912
Their population is 600

476
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,960
1550

477
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,240
Still too large

478
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,312
How expensive

479
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
I don't think so

480
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,360
I think he's forgotten

481
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,896
Entirely about

482
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,712
The Rodger new dog

483
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:31,648
Also just because it's f****** hilarious to you the exemption section of the Kennesaw gun law which was copied

484
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,672
For Virgin Utah

485
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,952
Anyone quote

486
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:39,584
Exempt from the effect of this section are those a heads of household to suffer from physical or mental disability which

487
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,632
Them from using such a firearm

488
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:45,984
Further exempt from this effect of the section are those heads of households who are poppers

489
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,384
Or who conscientiously opposed maintaining Firearms as a result of beliefs or religious Doctrine or person

490
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,408
Convicted of a felony

491
00:25:54,432 --> 00:26:00,576
I don't want to own a gun without nothing we can do here that's a loophole that's a loophole in the law

492
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:05,184
I don't want to I prefer no

493
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,280
This is all just for show and to excite people like Alex that's all the time

494
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:15,168
An article in the New York Times quoted their mayor is saying that they've never prosecuted someone for not owning a gun

495
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:18,240
And the law was essentially unenforceable

496
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:24,896
If I were Paul Joseph Watson I might see something like that and think it was a very extreme and childish childish case

497
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:25,920
A virtuoso

498
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,736
I mean there's no way that I wouldn't

499
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,296
Like if you pass that law in Chicago

500
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,368
I would walk around City Hall just being like

501
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,928
F****** do it man I don't own a gun arrest me

502
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,208
Do it take me to trial

503
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:38,976
Please

504
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:42,048
Tell me that the Supreme Court is going to side with

505
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:42,816
You have

506
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,864
To buy a gun

507
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:51,520
Just now it's think that's a much more of an encroachment at Liberty

508
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,824
The positive responsibility

509
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
Exactly

510
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,616
It's a mess

511
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,384
Nuttzo

512
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,712
So what episode

513
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,248
I'll just come back

514
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,016
Studio

515
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,808
And maybe some rumor

516
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,600
Floating around about a weekend

517
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,880
Okay Alex Dietz

518
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:13,280
To get ahead of these rumors

519
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,048
Warrant

520
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,936
And already

521
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,800
Friend on their boat

522
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,824
This weekend

523
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,072
I'm not a my judgment

524
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:33,152
Schwarzenegger

525
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,808
Colton Underwood

526
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,112
Mcgillycuddy's hand on a boat

527
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:48,512
That sucks also his policy on like changing his mental state certainly has been

528
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,792
I won't even take

529
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,560
Aspirin

530
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,864
I feel like I policies Lucent

531
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,888
How do you think so

532
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:59,008
Everything about what how he behaves

533
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,312
I do his body is a temple

534
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,360
And the temple needs cup

535
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,152
I have two possibilities

536
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,432
What's that one

537
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,456
Is he telling the truth

538
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,504
Second

539
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,552
This is suspicious

540
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,576
Little bit

541
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,368
Exaggerated perhaps

542
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,392
Well I mean

543
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:18,464
Did the part about the Raiders don't understand is like what what what

544
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,256
Are you doing why you wasting time

545
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,304
Turn into a room

546
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:23,840
Who cares

547
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,376
No it's a rumor

548
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,656
That he could have

549
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,216
What is lost a finger

550
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:35,616
What is a rumor about it that he was it's just that he was drunk right like the rumor

551
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:42,016
Alex was so drunk he caught his own f****** finger off it's got to be something like that he's trying to get ahead

552
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:42,784
Has to be the rumor

553
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:48,672
Yeah because otherwise is it just like that happens

554
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:52,000
But someone will try and help somebody on a boat I don't know

555
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,792
It's either

556
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:58,144
It's either indication of Alex trying to muddy the waters on something

557
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,448
An indication of how like

558
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:07,104
Need York suspicious his audience

559
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:13,760
That were they put the computer chip is not the real Alex 24in Luminati

560
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,320
Finger on you and now you have to do what it says

561
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:22,464
5 minutes

562
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,792
Control on this route

563
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,376
This also made me a little

564
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,680
Suspicious more detailed

565
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,416
And

566
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,312
And other

567
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,840
Word for them

568
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,168
Oh you said the n-word

569
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,800
Something happen

570
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:44,640
Yeah that's bad word

571
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,736
Looking to be a fly on the wall

572
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,040
I'm curious

573
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,576
I had some Choice words

574
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,856
Some Choice words

575
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,904
There were rumors about

576
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,208
I think we know what those words are

577
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:03,840
Nobody's telling rumors about Alex Jones told me to f*** off can you believe it

578
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:09,472
Can you believe that Alex Jones would tell me to f*** off maybe that would be dangerous for his brand at this time

579
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,240
Possible

580
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,264
Possible

581
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,568
They know he's not he's not the same

582
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,848
Complete lunatic videos

583
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,616
Today and

584
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,384
Like

585
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,944
Somebody who can feed off any kind of positive or negative

586
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,224
Attention

587
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,272
This is still a point when like

588
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:23,808
I mean it

589
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,832
He comes off as like

590
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,368
Okay

591
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,072
Hurt his entire ability to

592
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,352
To sell himself as

593
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,376
Hey hey

594
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:44,800
I'm just a normal very sensible person who has question I will say this to you

595
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:49,920
I I cannot prove it and you probably have a much more reasonable explanation

596
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,456
But deep in my guts

597
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:54,016
I'm putting money on a racial slur

598
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,040
That's what I'm doing

599
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,064
I mean it's a bond

600
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,904
Only possible he could have actually just been like wasted or something

601
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,464
There's something that happened at that dock

602
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,280
That I would like to do

603
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,376
I would like to dedicate the rest of my life

604
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:14,752
2 documentary

605
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,800
Will make small models will have

606
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,336
This is where Alex Jones

607
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:26,528
I'm going to do a f****** season of serial

608
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,416
Many people are wondering

609
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,696
What are the rumors

610
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,464
Spell doubt

611
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,072
So what's Alex's careers over and I inevitably do my

612
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,376
Dino documentary about

613
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:46,240
My first question

614
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,800
What happened on that. That day

615
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,456
Tonight we get into the actual meat

616
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,504
Some of the topics that are

617
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,552
Alex has John

618
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,832
OneStop Miller on

619
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,624
And he is on

620
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,160
To talk primarily about

621
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,696
The Charles cell case

622
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,976
Yes

623
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,000
Which again is that dent

624
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:08,768
Distrito

625
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:12,096
And here is where that corrupt

626
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,376
Part

627
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,144
Two-player

628
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,192
Get ready for your mind to be blown

629
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,848
Given notice

630
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,432
Army at the time in the reserves

631
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,480
They wanted him to

632
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,552
To do the French

633
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,600
For dentures so on

634
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,184
Now this is

635
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,952
Before the

636
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,232
Branch Davidians

637
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,256
Decided

638
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,888
All the findings of the government

639
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,424
Panels at the Davidian

640
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,216
Actually committed suicide

641
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
Exactly

642
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,736
Do the front

643
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,808
Something happen

644
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,088
He claims that

645
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,624
He had the free

646
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,512
I bet you didn't see that coming

647
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:16,352
This is actually a Waco cover-up story

648
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:20,704
Factoring into this at all I was a little surprised myself

649
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,264
Couple quick points on this year

650
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:29,408
The Waco standoff occurred in 1993 and Charles cell was first hospitalized after insisting communistic

651
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,968
Contaminated his feelings in 1982

652
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,112
He was getting hospitalized around 1984 serious problems related to delusions long predate any alleged involved

653
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:38,880
Marriott in any

654
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,160
Things related to Waco

655
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,208
I can find no credible source that backs

656
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,000
The claim that sell was called in to do friends

657
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,280
Dentistry at Waco

658
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:48,352
Okay nor that he was called in before the standoff even occurred

659
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,424
These are claims you can find repeated message boards and dice

660
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,704
He blogs but there's nothing

661
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,264
That I can find the make me feel confident about it

662
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,056
And it seems kind of unrealistic

663
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,848
Sixense around that time he was

664
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:05,248
Supposed to be a dentist in St Louis I mean that he would be the person they would bring in

665
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,272
It seems

666
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,576
Strange coincidental

667
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,112
Should that be the case

668
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,136
I mean it

669
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:16,000
It's the writing on that other the writing unreality needs to be taken up a notch if that's the

670
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:20,608
Yeah it's like we've run out of characters in reality like now we can make more

671
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,168
This is really bizarre to me because

672
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:26,240
It seems like Alex and John are putting a hat on a hat here

673
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:32,896
They have an issue that they can make a compelling case on whether or not the state has the authority to forcibly medicate someone arrested for not

674
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,664
Violent crime

675
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,272
But instead of really just sticking to the issue where there's a chance of making a decent point

676
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:43,648
These Dum Dums have to spin out and turn everything into a grand conspiracy that works into their larger worldview

677
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,512
The actual relevant issue is either too boring or too difficult for these people to talk about

678
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,560
So instead they just Django Keyes

679
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,840
What if we fight

680
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,864
To get a banana to take

681
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,656
Good Meds then you finally break

682
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,448
Waco case wide open

683
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,056
We don't need to fight for him to not be forcibly medicated because that's an infringing of his rights

684
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:06,432
But I guess if he's medicated in the global still succeeded in their cover up with this is nonsense that's insane

685
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,712
Damn

686
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,528
Skyrim that is that is a little bit like

687
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:14,112
Cub reporter comes up and he's like

688
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,648
This guy

689
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,184
It's going to be it's going to be

690
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,464
Watershed moment

691
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,232
Figure this out

692
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,512
This is a

693
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:23,840
Alex is like

694
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,120
That's boring your s***

695
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,912
I'm going to punch it up he was at Waco

696
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,216
I just

697
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:34,336
I know it made me feel like I gave Alex too much credit

698
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:37,408
At the beginning of the episode when this case got brought up

699
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,688
Because I felt like

700
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,736
This is an actual place where he

701
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,016
You could make an argument

702
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,064
I couldn't gauge with

703
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,112
His principles and his politics

704
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,904
Exxon

705
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:49,952
It's just a trick

706
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,976
Alex got a

707
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:55,584
Belt I-88 mile-an-hour fastball

708
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,352
3 *

709
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,120
The same picture

710
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:57,888
Enfield

711
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,216
It's pretty unfortunate

712
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,520
To show how even

713
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,360
5 years and I still give him too much credit sometime

714
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,432
You are somehow a very hopeful

715
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,224
Ilike2learn

716
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,600
So anyway John stadtmiller has a little bit of a different version

717
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,880
Of this interaction

718
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:21,440
Charles L had with the judge

719
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,232
But here's the government

720
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,768
Goodguys how it's supposed

721
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,048
Thought your phone

722
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,328
Guilty of fraud

723
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,120
For Medicare and Medicaid

724
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:29,888
Would only say

725
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:31,936
He is not

726
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,264
For a judge

727
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,312
Basically

728
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,480
And

729
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:48,832
Of The Middle

730
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,600
Help people

731
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,136
This man is not

732
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,488
You'll notice the John stadtmiller leaves out

733
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:59,584
A few details about cells behavior in court like the racial slurs and spitting in the judge

734
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,608
His face

735
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:06,240
They also conveniently forget about the prior hospitalizations the long history of delusions and everything else

736
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,776
Forgive this case it's contacts

737
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,592
And there's very clear reason why they're doing

738
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:17,248
Really interested in this case for whether or not the state has the right to forcibly medicate people

739
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,296
But they want the credibility that comes with

740
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,832
Pretending to have that conversation

741
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,672
They want to just present cell as a political prisoner who's being held

742
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,720
Then forcibly drugged because he needs to be silent

743
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,488
It's about Waco

744
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,864
That's their angle understory did the pretense of concern about cells rights that's just window dressing

745
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,424
The actual people concerned with the issues Alex

746
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,448
Pretends to be

747
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,216
Concerned about

748
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,520
Are folks like the lawyers at the ACLU

749
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,616
They were dealing with reality as a place to

750
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,896
This nonsense

751
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,176
Yeah yeah

752
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,456
What piece of s***

753
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,480
Yeah kind of sucks

754
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,016
I really does it is

755
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,808
It's so like man

756
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:55,648
You had a moment where you could have done something

757
00:39:55,904 --> 00:40:01,024
Good beer but you know your enemies were too busy actually working on it while you distracted your audience

758
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,072
Yeah for no reason

759
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,376
It doesn't even get you more

760
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:11,776
Attention to say that he's a way to digest as far as the conspiracy of worldview

761
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,056
The audience is mine

762
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,104
And it uses this

763
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,640
This doctor is a prop

764
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:22,272
Pretty gross as usual people are thing

765
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,832
Next

766
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,624
Stadtmiller

767
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,160
Recorded

768
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,464
A full segment from Dateline

769
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,488
Aston Villa

770
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:34,048
Check my record it on like a VHA

771
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:40,448
Recorded it on based on the 2003 technology

772
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:41,984
Is banana.

773
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:48,384
I think I understand this

774
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,688
Broad interpretations of fair use

775
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:55,552
But they don't interrupt it at all their play a full seven minutes section it's

776
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,344
I don't know that might be a little too much

777
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,928
My charm so yeah they play this and then I hear is a little bit of comment

778
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,768
Government has

779
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,448
Fermented already lost nearly

780
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:15,520
Years of his life and his freedom

781
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,848
Someone like

782
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:21,920
I know

783
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,200
It's My Life

784
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,904
John's incredible

785
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:59,551
That's not what I would have gotten

786
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,599
From the Dateline piece

787
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,903
Private is

788
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,695
Pretty well done

789
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:10,047
Yeah like cuz it does wrestle with those issues forcible medication

790
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:16,959
Even some of the claims of mistreatment in the when he was carcerated

791
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:21,055
There it comes at it from a number of angles like I don't obviously I don't think

792
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,615
I don't think any news programs perfect

793
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:30,015
Fairly decent job based on my understanding of the details

794
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:36,415
It is fun whenever the global is hide something for 10 or 11 million viewers on Prime

795
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,743
Yeah they hide it in plain sight

796
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:44,607
Directly into the faces and eyes and ears on 5 to 10 million people in

797
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,631
Very sneaky

798
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,423
Terrifying how they do that

799
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,983
So I don't think that John stadtmiller brings

800
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:50,751
A whole lot

801
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,287
To this conversation

802
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:56,127
Just a lot of like he's going to be in prison forever with Tik-Tok that up to the

803
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:56,895
The great prediction

804
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,687
Alex and his

805
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,735
Cuz he was released

806
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:04,575
Pretty soon after there shortly after Court ruled

807
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:07,903
If they have done this episode

808
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:08,671
The next

809
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:14,047
Dejan Alex's show

810
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:21,727
But now that we know what the government says we can do a show on it would be stale the next day

811
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,359
Primary roles

812
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,431
It's kind of like whitewashing stories that might be

813
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,479
Uncomfortable for

814
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,271
Folks in the extreme right

815
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,599
Regice

816
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:43,743
Admitted

817
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,119
They buried

818
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,191
Inform

819
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,127
Something autumn

820
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:00,895
They must have

821
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,943
Been guilty of something

822
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,967
Mindless

823
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,727
Yeah I do think it's a show send a bad message

824
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:29,055
Perhaps but I also don't think that it has a bearing on

825
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,335
This one

826
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:33,407
I don't think that you can say

827
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,711
Here's a real life thing

828
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,783
Went to build my case

829
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:41,343
Opposed

830
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,111
Procedural

831
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:45,695
Drama show do not like

832
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:48,255
That Alex was ahead of me on topic

833
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,535
I don't like it

834
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:55,935
I don't like that I was behind on figuring out that all TV gives us an

835
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:56,959
Used to think that cops

836
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:57,727
Our actual

837
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,495
Billy doing their job

838
00:44:59,263 --> 00:44:59,775
Sure

839
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,847
So I think that they are also John and Alex

840
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:03,871
They're misrepresenting

841
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:04,895
Misreporting

842
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:05,663
Some details here

843
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:11,551
This case was about 3 members of the Georgia Republic militia arrested in 1996

844
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:14,367
And charged with conspiring to build pipe bombs

845
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:20,511
These guys were worried about the need to prepare for a war against the US government who they thought we're going to use un troops against

846
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:23,327
Public much like Alex does and did

847
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:29,983
An informant did alert the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms about some of the militias activities and recorded some of their meeting

848
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:34,335
That's not the same thing is demonstrating that the government set these people offer

849
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,615
Any of that nonsense

850
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,407
What's that mother is going on

851
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:41,503
Also if you go and read the articles about this case you get quite a picture

852
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,551
Associated Press

853
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:47,647
Neighbor Georgine fesperman said she's seen

854
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,951
A pickup truck full of men with shaved heads

855
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,231
Scary rifles

856
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:51,999
Camouflage

857
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,023
Black berets

858
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,815
Driving to mccraney property

859
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,119
Something's going on back there she said

860
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:01,727
There's always gunfire back there they've got vicious dogs back there you can hear them

861
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,775
The article goes on quote

862
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:08,383
Informant told agents of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms on April 5th

863
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,711
But he'd attended a meeting with McRaney star and others

864
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,479
At which macaw

865
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:15,039
Granny talked about blowing up a bomb on his property

866
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:17,343
And said he had enough chemicals to make 40 bomb

867
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,623
According to the affidavit

868
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,159
McCready is

869
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,183
Not the government

870
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,231
Informant that's one of the men who was arrested

871
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,791
Alexandra Miller turning into a martyr

872
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,327
Like this is all nonsense

873
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,607
I'll just part of the

874
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,679
What I would call The Lone Wolf social contract

875
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,471
But Alex engages in

876
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:36,799
You know like these things happen people get caught

877
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,079
And we will do our best

878
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,103
To make sure

879
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:39,871
That

880
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,919
These are presented as fake

881
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,479
In order to make it easier for the next person not to

882
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:45,503
Exactly

883
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,271
I'm back

884
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,575
Kind of feels like the game that they're playing

885
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,367
Cuz it's not it's not realistic

886
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,999
Like unbelievable seem like

887
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,023
The point

888
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,095
Is for Alex and his ilk

889
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,119
And the Tucker Carlson

890
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:01,887
Sins of the world

891
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:02,911
2

892
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:03,935
Provide

893
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,703
Cover

894
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:08,031
For the militias to refine and home their method

895
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,335
In order to eventually succeed

896
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,383
Do you like that

897
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:15,455
Is that unfortunately they're providing a smoke

898
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:18,527
Screen for the dumbest most cowardly people on the planet

899
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:21,087
Who have yet to refine a single method

900
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,111
.

901
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:25,951
We just keep finding bombs everywhere that are poorly constructed

902
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,303
It's very common

903
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,375
We get to Alex's next gas

904
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,911
Stadtmiller goes

905
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:35,679
Bye bye bye

906
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:36,703
And we get

907
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:37,727
Jeff sharlet

908
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,751
The guy from

909
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,519
V

910
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,311
The Harper's magazine

911
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,615
It is

912
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:44,639
This point in time

913
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:47,967
He's notable Maybe

914
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:48,735
Yeah

915
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,039
Yeah you get you could get some of the harbors

916
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,319
Yeah

917
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,503
And

918
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:25,087
Congressman

919
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:33,023
Well we're whatever

920
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:35,071
They believe what you do

921
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:54,783
He was making beginning of his Alex's intro there

922
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,319
It's a little complicated but

923
00:48:56,575 --> 00:49:00,671
It's not so much that the people featured in Charlotte's article or saying that Hitler was good

924
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:05,279
It's more the youth Hitler and his relationship with the Nazi leadership as an example of what

925
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:07,071
They think is a good form of government

926
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:09,119
Hitler and his top command headache

927
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,935
Complete Unity of purpose and there was a steadfast devotion

928
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,959
The following Hitler

929
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,775
And this is commented on in the article as a

930
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,055
Powerful form of covet

931
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:19,615
Another example that uses the mafia

932
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,919
They're basically describing the being super into

933
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:26,271
The leader of the family Doug Coe

934
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,039
Hierarchy

935
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:29,855
Yeah the leader dougco explains quote

936
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,647
A covenant like the mafia look at the

937
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,671
The strength of their boss

938
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,975
Tea for them it's honor for us

939
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:35,999
It's Jesus

940
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,791
The article goes on quote

941
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:42,911
Code listed other men who had changed the world through the strength of his Covenant State Forge with their brothers

942
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:47,263
Quote look at Hitler he said Lennon hoochie been bin Laden

943
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:50,335
The family of course possessed a weapon those leaders lack

944
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,895
The total Jesus of a Brotherhood in Christ

945
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:58,015
Whenever Hitler comes up in the article

946
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,039
It's basically a talk

947
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,319
Bring about it in this context

948
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,343
Still f***** up

949
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,623
But it's not what Alex

950
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:04,415
It's not the way Alex is understanding it

951
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,975
Or we presenting it to the audience

952
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,999
It is

953
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,535
Not at all sir

954
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,559
Surprising to me

955
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,583
That these people

956
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:12,607
Love

957
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:16,447
What is essentially the same thing as multi-level marketing

958
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,471
But in a

959
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:19,519
Like its

960
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,823
The same s*** you know

961
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,615
It's just the same f******

962
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:26,687
Yeah and maybe like a little bit more interest

963
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,711
Austin power then

964
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,479
Then

965
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,271
Strictly money

966
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:32,319
Yep cool boy

967
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,087
Yep

968
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:39,487
This interview I was very fascinated see where would go though because knowing what we know now

969
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,151
Where am I

970
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:06,111
Some of the stuff that Alex is saying is fairly accurate but

971
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,927
I want to talk about a certain irony here

972
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:09,695
Marysville

973
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:12,255
Alex is having a hyper critical coverage

974
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,303
Of the family back in 2000

975
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,327
3

976
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,863
But the reality is

977
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,935
He might actually be broke right now if it wasn't for them

978
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:24,799
I have we know Alex's head-on are a bunch of his finances were looking

979
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:26,591
Shaky in the past few box

980
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:28,127
And this year he would have been

981
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:31,199
Deep in the red if it weren't for Mike Lindell and his pillow money

982
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:35,295
But what if I were to tell you that the family radicalized Michael until

983
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,343
You're staring

984
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,367
No

985
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:39,647
No

986
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:40,927
I know

987
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:41,695
No

988
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:42,719
No

989
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:46,559
That's what I would tell you I would tell you no to your face

990
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,583
Sir

991
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,375
I don't like witches

992
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:55,775
Jonathan Larson recently wrote a piece in Salon the trace is Mike lindell's conversion to fundamentalist Christianity and

993
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,567
Hard right politics to his attendance at the

994
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,359
The 2016 National Prayer Breakfast

995
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,383
My f******

996
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,919
That event is not just

997
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:08,063
Breakfast it's actually a four-day Affair full of small group meetings that are probably familiar to anyone who's gone to an Evangelical Church

998
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:13,183
But also mix in that mln vibes

999
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,975
I recommend this article but

1000
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:16,767
The short version is that Linda went

1001
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:19,583
They ended up in one of these small rooms of someone praying and eats

1002
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,631
Experience the prophecy that he was going to change

1003
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,399
The course of the country

1004
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:27,519
Using this prayer room with Ben Carson who's Big member of the group and they got to talk

1005
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,287
In politics

1006
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:31,871
An excerpt from lindell's book that is featured in that Salon article

1007
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:32,639
Call quote

1008
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:37,503
The Dozen people in the room gathered in a circle and began talking about the critical importance of the 20s

1009
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:38,271
16 election

1010
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:41,855
We agreed it was going to be a real spiritual turning point for the country

1011
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,671
One path could lead us toward National renewal

1012
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:48,255
The other could lead us down a dark path from which there may be no return

1013
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:50,815
A path that had begun with the removal of God for

1014
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,863
Square

1015
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,423
We have got to go down that.

1016
00:52:55,679 --> 00:53:00,031
Bike path because once they remove God I decided it was time to destroy everything else

1017
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:06,431
The religious group had successfully intertwined their religious vision and their political Ambitions into Mike lindell's head

1018
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,223
And we all know where that's gone

1019
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:12,319
Lindale supported Ben Carson and then Ben Carson got him into

1020
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:14,367
Trump after Carson dropped out of the race

1021
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:20,511
Tangled and twisted web but the family was deeply involved in not only supporting Trump candidacy but with

1022
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,279
Directly

1023
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:25,375
And scamming the s*** out of my Glendale which had a trickle-down effect of getting

1024
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:27,423
Alex Auto financial hot water

1025
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,983
Just so here I just

1026
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:36,383
That's what I'm saying it's just a f****** multi-level marketing scam everywhere you go it's f****** b*******

1027
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,919
Alex in 2003

1028
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:44,575
Talkin about this article

1029
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:46,367
They're going to save me in 20 years

1030
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,927
I'm f****** real

1031
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:55,327
And he believes all the same s*** the family does not almost certainly.

1032
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,119
Did unknowingly

1033
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,143
At this point to

1034
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:02,751
Yeah like I'm not moving out unknowingly but on Cross

1035
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,799
I mean actually I would say

1036
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,335
Based on what we

1037
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:11,711
Learned from there they're like they appreciated Hitler's hierarchy not Hitler

1038
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:14,783
Alex appreciates Hitler more than the family

1039
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,831
Pizza stuff

1040
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,367
Total badass

1041
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:22,463
Is Christ yeah what I hear is like some of the stuff about the

1042
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,487
The beliefs and

1043
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,511
In

1044
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:27,327
The way organization should be at sounds a lot like

1045
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:29,631
Like I think

1046
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,423
I think that he has the same sort of relation

1047
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,447
Pacific Power

1048
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:35,775
Anyway Charlotte

1049
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:37,823
Gets to talkin about the founder of

1050
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,383
The group of the the family

1051
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:42,175
Amanda this dude sound like

1052
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:42,943
Galax

1053
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:00,863
Scale

1054
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,399
Abraham

1055
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,519
Maintain

1056
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,895
And everyone else

1057
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,175
Christian that always

1058
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:14,943
Minister today

1059
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,111
That's what Christ

1060
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:23,647
To go out

1061
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:30,047
There's a lot of similarities with Alex they're having read the Bible

1062
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,071
He assumed

1063
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:37,471
Jesus Christ wanted him to make the rich people happy and bust Union

1064
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,519
Read the Bible the preacher

1065
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,799
Was like somebody

1066
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:44,127
He's got to help these rich people get more money

1067
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:50,527
Opposition to Union believe that God is

1068
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:54,879
Is calling him to fight communism personally probably had Visions when he was Kid

1069
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:57,439
Dinner and you can even get that like

1070
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:59,487
Ministering to powerful people

1071
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:04,351
Obsession with pretending that world leaders listen to his show and

1072
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,911
But there's so much of this that is just like

1073
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,727
This is ulam

1074
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:10,751
Alex

1075
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,543
You're talking to somebody who's like

1076
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,335
You're talking to somebody

1077
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:17,919
Who is analogous to the person 40 years from then

1078
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:20,223
Who's going to write an article on you

1079
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,575
You're talking to your interviewer in the future

1080
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:31,487
It's our fun house mirrors to look at

1081
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,023
Really unfortunate

1082
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:35,839
About this interview is that

1083
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,399
Narcissism

1084
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:44,031
It manifests in a lot of ways and one of them is that he has to know more than the people he's interview

1085
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:48,639
He basically just takes the things that Charlotte is

1086
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,407
Is covered in

1087
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:50,943
Experienced

1088
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,223
And research

1089
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,783
And Alex just uses it to make his own kin

1090
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:55,551
Conclusion

1091
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,343
Isn't fair

1092
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,111
No it's annoying

1093
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,463
Call Hitler

1094
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,487
It does not mean

1095
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:36,511
Admire

1096
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:37,535
It works

1097
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:39,583
There's not much

1098
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,167
But they do say

1099
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,055
Brother's friend

1100
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,359
Imagine if we could put the

1101
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:52,127
That model to work

1102
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,407
Cialis

1103
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:56,223
What's keeps only going back to the point of like

1104
00:57:56,479 --> 00:58:00,063
Did they say Hitler is good but the point where Jeff Charlotte has to be like

1105
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:02,367
I have to clarify this because

1106
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,671
I don't think it's fair the way you're characterizing it

1107
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:06,207
Now I understand

1108
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,231
And I respect

1109
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:08,511
But it's

1110
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,279
The same time

1111
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,839
Play Love Hitler up

1112
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:15,167
Are you just cuz you can't prove they love Hitler

1113
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:18,239
Play f****** love Hitler and you f****** know it I think

1114
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:24,127
You can be fine saying something like that as a commentator but someone who's driving themselves as

1115
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:28,479
A serious reporter who backs up everything that he says with facts and research

1116
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:33,343
Yeah I think that I think that he has a greater responsibility to be clear on his point totally understand

1117
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:37,695
Alex make a differentiation

1118
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,231
Between the two and I appreciate that

1119
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:40,511
The Charlotte seems

1120
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:44,095
Will a consistent on like not being misrepresented

1121
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:48,191
Write 2 degree what I would like to hear it let me let me throw this at

1122
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,727
Okay let's go back in time

1123
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:50,751
Let me throw this at

1124
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:53,311
Alright I can only prove

1125
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:58,431
Through the conversations that I have heard and I've been told about

1126
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:00,479
That they appreciate Hitler's business

1127
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,015
Now

1128
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,807
If I were a betting man

1129
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:07,647
I would say if you spend a lot of time appreciating Hitler's business model

1130
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:09,183
Sooner or later going to get to

1131
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:11,231
He had some other good ideas

1132
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:12,767
So f*** off if you think

1133
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:13,791
He's they don't love Hitler

1134
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:18,399
Charlotte's conversation

1135
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,679
Things you can take away

1136
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,447
Is

1137
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,983
Sagano

1138
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,007
I8

1139
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,799
Delineation between

1140
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:27,103
From his experience and the document

1141
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:33,503
It's the kid been able to get ahold of any experience that he had living among these people there wasn't a ray

1142
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:38,623
Racialized a version of this or an ethnic there was a religiously-based

1143
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,391
Elite

1144
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,415
Kind of thing

1145
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,695
And if you wanted to

1146
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,487
Have that conversation about

1147
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:47,583
Maybe Hitler's policies clean creeping in in terms of

1148
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:50,911
You know it related to Christians and non-christians

1149
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:56,799
But but in terms of Master races and stuff like that show at there is a breakdown

1150
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,079
Queen

1151
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:58,847
You would

1152
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:02,431
Normally have come to your mind when you envision Hitler and

1153
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:04,735
What they are interested in

1154
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:07,295
And I think that there is there is a difference

1155
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,319
But there's also

1156
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:11,135
You know I also get your point you cares

1157
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,231
Alex has failed on this point

1158
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,279
Good Charlotte's pushing back

1159
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:19,327
Until Alex has to move on to a next

1160
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:49,791
Young guys and I hadn't

1161
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:50,559
Discussion.

1162
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:54,655
Or we could all study whether or not we agree with him

1163
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,447
Don't think that's out of line I don't think that

1164
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:00,031
Yeah that's right on

1165
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:03,615
The end of a good

1166
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:10,015
Boy I don't know if these these rockhold's that Alex is trying to get up the side of the cliff on or are being very help

1167
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:16,415
Totally evil

1168
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,463
That's what's up

1169
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,559
He even does slip back into being

1170
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:23,583
Like a like Hitler

1171
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,631
To the point where it just Charlotte has to do like

1172
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,679
Basically correct

1173
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,215
Yeah

1174
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,007
Emphasize

1175
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,799
Chuckled

1176
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,103
Semite

1177
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,127
These guys admire

1178
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:37,407
Organizing

1179
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:38,687
And they don't make

1180
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:47,391
I believe that

1181
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:58,655
German

1182
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,703
Yeah that's kind of Sunday

1183
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:01,983
Yeah f*** off

1184
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:06,847
Yeah that is the most annoying thing of like

1185
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:10,431
Hey I've invited you on we're going to talk about this

1186
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,967
I don't know much about this

1187
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,015
I'm going to tell you about dif

1188
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:17,855
Like it

1189
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:18,879
This guy

1190
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:20,159
Giving his

1191
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:20,927
In depth

1192
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:22,207
Experience

1193
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,487
And knowledge

1194
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:24,511
About this subject

1195
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:27,071
On the surface

1196
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:33,471
The reason you have this person on your show 100%

1197
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:36,031
Learn about the things that he has study

1198
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,335
Supposed to

1199
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,359
Condescending

1200
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:42,687
Explain to him that his researches inferior to yours

1201
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:49,087
I think that's another that's another element you know and would you ever want to talk to Alex Jones or anything and it's like

1202
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,695
Getting even bothering his horrendous disqualifying views

1203
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:57,023
I just don't want to be interviewed by the shitbag

1204
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:59,071
He's the worst person to talk to

1205
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:00,351
Yeah he just sucks

1206
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:04,703
He's very rude even at this point but it's less

1207
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,471
Like it

1208
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,239
It's less

1209
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:09,823
Aggressive ride over.

1210
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,359
Underhanded

1211
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,127
Yeah

1212
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:15,711
There's that there's a passive aggression that may actually be going with both directions

1213
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,479
It's because

1214
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,527
Whether he understands it or not

1215
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,623
Just Charlotte ends up saying some things that Alex

1216
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:25,439
We consider fighting words today

1217
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:37,727
Crazy there is a Groupon

1218
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:38,495
Online

1219
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,615
Play some years

1220
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:48,479
If you believe in that

1221
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,503
Ticular kind of

1222
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:50,783
Literally

1223
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,599
Reading of Revelation

1224
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:10,239
My point exactly

1225
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,007
We don't need

1226
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:11,775
2

1227
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:13,567
Any further than that

1228
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:16,639
For Christ

1229
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,431
Off the tracks right there

1230
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,199
Yeah

1231
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:21,247
But I I can't imagine someone

1232
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,831
You if you're one of those lunatics

1233
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:33,023
Those f****** crazy folks who believe that the Book of Revelations is literally going to happen have that kind of an unsub

1234
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:35,583
Fisticated understand

1235
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:36,863
To take the book

1236
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:37,631
Book of Revelation

1237
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,655
Literally

1238
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:42,495
If someone I can't even believe people that stupid exist

1239
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:44,543
Yeah

1240
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:48,895
Swinging

1241
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:51,199
Might be biting his tongue or whatever just

1242
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:55,039
You heard earlier the interview I'm talking about like the Arbors of Art

1243
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:57,855
Prestigious

1244
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,159
I still think that he thinks this might be a get

1245
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:01,183
You know like yeah

1246
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:04,255
I mean for him it seems like it would be a fairly

1247
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:07,839
Good chance to try and legitimize your your shity outfit

1248
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:08,863
Sherman Oaks

1249
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,143
Then maybe makes

1250
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:11,679
Some connections with other relay

1251
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:12,703
A folks who

1252
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:16,287
Completely ignored as

1253
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:18,847
Alex Burgers could you get me

1254
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:23,455
Give me the phone numbers of some of those important people in my family and see if they want to give me a lot of money

1255
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,247
A lot of money I believe

1256
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:27,807
Exactly what they believe for a price

1257
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,343
I don't think

1258
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:33,951
I don't know if it goes that direction Glendale gave them a bunch of money

1259
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:37,023
Don't know when you figure out how to get powerful you don't

1260
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:38,815
People give you

1261
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:42,143
Something that I think is really fascinating is

1262
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:44,191
Charlotte

1263
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,727
Which is about

1264
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:48,543
Hit his assessment of

1265
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:54,175
The people is they might not even recognize that what they're doing is essentially calling for a dick

1266
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:57,759
Dictatorship

1267
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:58,783
It really

1268
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:02,879
You see the same things in more recent Alex Jones

1269
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,159
More like

1270
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:05,439
In last few years

1271
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:11,327
There is a sense of like whether you understand it or not what you're doing is trying to push for a dictatorship

1272
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,679
Throughout

1273
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,983
Number of people really

1274
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:20,031
Q

1275
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:21,055
Policeman

1276
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:22,847
Calling all the shots

1277
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:25,663
The government model

1278
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:29,247
Dictatorship

1279
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,271
It's just

1280
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:32,831
It's it's bizarre to me to deceive this like

1281
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,111
Conversation with

1282
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,135
Weirdly

1283
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:36,671
You know

1284
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:39,999
Illuminating of what will happen in Alex's future

1285
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:43,839
So what is one point that Charlotte makes that makes me

1286
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:49,983
Videos are you loose like a maybe a baseline awareness of Alex is that he brings up that the end of these are

1287
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,519
Your Fundamentalist

1288
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:53,055
That you would normally

1289
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:54,079
Think of who are as he

1290
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,615
Provincial

1291
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:59,199
These are people who have international interest

1292
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:02,783
Something that is relevant to Alex

1293
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:03,551
His audience

1294
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:09,439
Sure the one thing I'd like to say that I think that they're your Griffin

1295
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:12,511
Only thing about this.

1296
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:13,791
International

1297
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:15,839
Liberals

1298
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:16,863
Chihuahua

1299
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,887
Business fundamentals

1300
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:18,655
As

1301
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:21,471
Provincial and local

1302
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:22,239
Any side

1303
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:24,031
None of that they're very internationalist

1304
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:26,847
A very Savvy they're Charming

1305
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,407
Screaming at you on

1306
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:31,455
Eastgroup

1307
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,479
AR

1308
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:34,783
Just like everyone else

1309
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,855
I think if we're going to really combat

1310
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,903
We need to

1311
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:40,671
Acknowledge

1312
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,719
What credit is due

1313
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,559
Good things about

1314
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:02,943
Breeding

1315
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:04,991
Of the Bible which

1316
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,271
No historical base

1317
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:16,511
Little condescending again there

1318
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:22,911
Left-wing view of where you read about the book and then they've learned about it and you know it's not literally

1319
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,447
True that's the left

1320
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:26,239
This b******* that New York

1321
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,519
Taunton schools

1322
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:29,311
Because that's what knowledge comes

1323
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:31,871
Songs from I'm against the left-right paradigm

1324
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:32,639
Which is

1325
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:34,431
To say I am a fundamentalist Christian

1326
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,199
You got it

1327
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:37,759
It was extremely hard right politics

1328
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:41,343
Yep sweet and I hate left-wing bowls

1329
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:43,391
Yeah makes a lot of sense

1330
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,695
They take some calls

1331
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:46,719
This one

1332
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:49,535
Call brings up a pretty prescient point

1333
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:50,815
I really think

1334
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:51,583
This

1335
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,631
Hits on a little bit of what Alec

1336
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:55,167
What's did in relation

1337
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:57,471
Think this

1338
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:00,543
I'm going to say was that

1339
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:03,103
It's confusing the human

1340
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:03,871
Do you want to come

1341
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,663
In the end

1342
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,431
The conservator

1343
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,247
There are so

1344
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,271
Authority

1345
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:11,295
And success

1346
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:13,599
Heather cream never too.

1347
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,279
Kind of fetish for Authority in

1348
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,815
Using that way

1349
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:31,263
So I think if you got if you get rid of Alex's interjection

1350
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,823
Kind of off track a little bit

1351
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:37,663
Do you have is a caller saying that's in a lot of these right-wing

1352
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:38,431
Chris

1353
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:39,199
Tintypes

1354
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:41,247
Can't inflate

1355
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:45,087
Is there a interest in successive Authority

1356
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,367
Well you can you can

1357
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:48,159
Mix that up with an image of

1358
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:49,439
Of godliness

1359
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:53,535
I think that Alex did an outrageous amount of that

1360
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:57,887
That guy might as well have just been like

1361
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:04,287
Hey you know I bet the internet's going to come along and it's going to make celebrity go kind of out of control and

1362
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:10,687
Then people are just going to wind up following celebrities and believing that they know what they're talking about even if they have no f****** clue and just got there

1363
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:14,015
Ceremony for no reason whatsoever for their dad gave it to him

1364
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:19,647
Those people are probably going to want him to become a f****** dictator crazy

1365
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,183
Mighty bomber

1366
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:22,975
So

1367
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:25,279
Give another call this fella

1368
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:27,327
The compliment Charlotte

1369
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,351
And I Alex

1370
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:30,143
Do I have any other

1371
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:32,191
New York

1372
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,007
Call Jeffrey

1373
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,031
Great work

1374
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:36,799
You opened up

1375
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:38,847
Nothing that we weren't even aware of

1376
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:43,199
What a dick

1377
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:44,991
You

1378
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:46,527
Oh my God

1379
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:50,623
Why do you have to do this

1380
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:54,207
August 1st Radiohead show f*** off no one cares

1381
01:10:54,719 --> 01:11:00,351
Why did you invite this person on if you know more than them and you hardly knew about it before they ever came along

1382
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:03,679
Why have the interview then welcome to the Alex Jones

1383
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:10,079
Security our winter I will be feeling weak and pathetic compared to someone who is done

1384
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:16,479
His work is everything I don't like secretly Justin Lester Smokescreen

1385
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:18,527
Yep yep

1386
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:21,599
So stupid is awful

1387
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:25,439
One more call here and this this is where Alex decides

1388
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:26,463
Double calls

1389
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:29,791
Real

1390
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:30,559
Quick if I could

1391
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:34,911
You guys have been talkin about

1392
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,703
But they going to try to make

1393
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:39,519
State of Michigan

1394
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,823
I just came in

1395
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:43,359
My whole family

1396
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:53,855
Is the child support issue

1397
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,415
Put you on hold

1398
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:06,143
I just want to go to work all day today today

1399
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,167
Cassidy

1400
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:10,239
Wherever you have a child

1401
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,263
Sport issue

1402
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,543
Hey Michigan

1403
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,311
Trumps

1404
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:15,359
And completely eclipses

1405
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,151
The family

1406
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:22,271
I think OJ really funny about that is we've got one more

1407
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,039
Great irony

1408
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:25,343
Alex does not want to talk

1409
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,879
About child support and cuts

1410
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:28,671
Custody issues on his show

1411
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:31,487
Well he does

1412
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:33,535
He does not with this guy

1413
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,303
Right eye.

1414
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:38,911
He tries to hold him over into the next hour and then apparently his phone

1415
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:41,215
But I think

1416
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:42,495
The greater point

1417
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:43,263
Is

1418
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:44,543
That Alex

1419
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:46,591
Is being really condescending and itself

1420
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:47,359
Gas

1421
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:51,711
And this caller calls in a condescending and insulting to Alex's show

1422
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,271
It is

1423
01:12:55,039 --> 01:13:00,415
Russian doll time to take down the entire state of Michigan

1424
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:06,815
So there is another hour of the show but it is just Alex in interviewing

1425
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:07,583
The mom

1426
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:09,887
From that story we talked about last time

1427
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:16,287
The Waltham right Right Alright Baby I learned nothing from that

1428
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:19,103
But you learned so much the last time

1429
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:21,151
I've only talked about the entire thing

1430
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:23,711
More information

1431
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:27,295
There wasn't I didn't I didn't feel like I had a better grasp on the case I didn't think it was

1432
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,319
Interesting at all

1433
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,087
That's not surprising

1434
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:31,391
So yeah I just

1435
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:32,671
I have no clips

1436
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:34,207
Convalesced

1437
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:36,511
I'm fine with that

1438
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:37,535
It happened

1439
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:38,303
Guarantee it

1440
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:40,863
I think far more interesting are these first two hours

1441
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:43,679
Just because each one has something really

1442
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:45,215
Bizarre in it

1443
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:47,263
First hour you have Alex

1444
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:49,311
Completely dropping the ball on something

1445
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:51,359
Could have been an issue that he could have actually

1446
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:53,663
Stood on principle with

1447
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,687
BP ball

1448
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:57,759
And instead he turned it into a

1449
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:58,527
Nonsense

1450
01:13:58,783 --> 01:13:59,807
Waco conspiracy

1451
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:02,111
And then in the second hour this

1452
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:04,927
Interview with the guy from Harpers

1453
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:10,047
Being a real dick to people just being a real dick to anybody who knows

1454
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:13,887
But in addition to just being a rude host

1455
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,423
I also

1456
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:19,519
Completely making a mockery of himself

1457
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:21,311
If you had a time machine

1458
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:23,359
Yeah he's really kicking his own ass

1459
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:25,663
Self to the cleaners

1460
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:28,991
There's a really insulting all those people who love him

1461
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,343
You you

1462
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:35,135
Got it

1463
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,159
I don't know it's

1464
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:37,695
Wolf

1465
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:41,279
We we've gotta find I think Alex Jones in the past

1466
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:44,607
Would be a sharper critic of Alex Jones in the present Thanos

1467
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:45,375
Maybe

1468
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:48,447
I think he would be less

1469
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,983
Restrained than you

1470
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:53,311
You wouldn't piss funny or as

1471
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:58,943
Happy-go-lucky are we happy to Lucky

1472
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:02,271
He wouldn't be

1473
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:04,319
Someone that would listen to even tomorrow

1474
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:10,719
Critiquing himself but I do think he would be mad at himself and we are I really feel like this is

1475
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:15,839
Only like the only thing I can think of in my head for this is some sort of Celebrity Deathmatch

1476
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:17,887
Claymation thing where they get

1477
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:19,423
Alex Jones

1478
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,959
20 versus Alex Jones

1479
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:22,239
40

1480
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:23,263
Just got to be

1481
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:25,311
But I mean they they just

1482
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:26,079
Kill each other

1483
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:28,639
Just kill each other

1484
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:31,199
Yeah I bet young Alex would probably win

1485
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:35,551
But then he'll be suffocated under the crushing weight of all.

1486
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:41,951
What a tragedy it would be a nightmare like a positron or whatever yes

1487
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:44,511
Yep so I enjoyed this trip back

1488
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:46,047
Back to the past

1489
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,071
I like I like

1490
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,863
Like series Dynamics

1491
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:50,399
Snap

1492
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:52,191
