1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Air Jordan

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect but knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
A little bit about

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,072
Alex June

7
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,400
Quick question for you sure

8
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,496
Jordan is given up

9
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:24,224
I've been watching the new season of Survivor as it as it goes

10
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,992
Ben

11
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,272
Frustrated

12
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,064
Over the course of watching all of this

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,624
Season about how far its

14
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,392
Come

15
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,440
From its original premise right

16
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,512
How complicated the rules are

17
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,560
If I were to try and explain to you how to

18
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,840
To play Survivor now

19
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,168
I have no idea how I would I couldn't you take hours

20
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,192
Of me being like Okay so

21
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:44,960
So now here's the thing

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,032
Hidden immunity idol

23
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:52,640
Okay okay if I put that aside for now

24
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:59,040
Now that's a no I refuse to allow that to happen this season

25
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:04,928
Advantage

26
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,000
Do you have this piece of paper disadvantaged

27
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,792
Tribal Council you can

28
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,864
Ask one person though one question

29
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,448
And it can be either do you have an advantage or do you have an idol

30
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,728
And if they do that

31
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,752
To give it to you

32
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
Right

33
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,056
F******

34
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:27,456
Ridiculous is turning into one of those like what is it with you remember those murder games that you would play the youth group

35
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:32,064
Where everybody would hide for a while and one person was a bad guy then you met up at the end of going to be like

36
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,392
This person was there yeah but the rules are amazed

37
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:43,840
I cut I was watching

38
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,400
The people now you know it's like they're very simple rules

39
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:54,080
The kids game where you die

40
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,872
Pheasant season 12 of Survivor

41
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,456
If I can find some food

42
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:07,648
Find some food at TGIF no calories in you to run this footrace later interviewed voted at

43
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,000
There's a lot more just like okay the game

44
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,816
Now it I have no

45
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:19,168
An idea last night's episode was the second part of a two-parter

46
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,448
Right

47
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,472
Cancel

48
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,032
Did they were supposed to be merging the tribes

49
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,824
But instead of doing that

50
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,104
There was another twist

51
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,152
And that was that one

52
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,944
They did they split into two tribes

53
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,224
And half of them

54
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,248
1 immunity

55
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,528
Okay

56
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:39,904
There was an uneven number of person who was left over.

57
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,304
Map to the f****** Exile Island where Jeff Probst bus

58
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,120
Sorry sorry sorry about

59
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,448
He got on the bus at least showed up on a

60
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,752
Barbie boat with an hourglass

61
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,568
A hammer

62
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:03,968
If you don't break all of your fingers by

63
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:08,064
Set a timer to sound of God through this hourglass you will be dead

64
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:16,256
I said if I got that I would change profile that I look at the hammer

65
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:20,095
She had to decide whether or not to go back in time

66
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,655
If she decided to break The Hourglass

67
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,679
Then

68
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
The other

69
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,215
Half

70
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,239
Of the group

71
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,263
2hype

72
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,103
The challenge would get immunity that the other people would be vulnerable

73
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,175
To be voted at okay

74
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,527
I was just sitting there like why are we doing this

75
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,599
Drama Dan but it wasn't more dramatic

76
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,367
Irvine Lake

77
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,231
It's still two steaks are set the same

78
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,095
I do I do appreciate that like okay

79
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
Well

80
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,631
Here's the thing

81
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,703
Are you bringing back Tyler ever going to say pick one of the other

82
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,471
That's Amir

83
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,519
It's a very simple explanation

84
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:06,943
How old we kind of like Survivor there up a bit you know come on

85
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,223
Let's go for it

86
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,551
Hammer destroy the very

87
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:17,951
Embodiment of time so I think afterwards after the episode I was reflecting a little bit

88
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
And I

89
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,999
Think I give up

90
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:24,607
I went out on the show but I'd like I give up on caring

91
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:30,239
It will be an experience

92
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:36,639
Do you and I I don't know if you recall this directly but do you remember the

93
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,919
End of 1984

94
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,759
The year I was born

95
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
The book

96
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,807
Sure

97
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,599
You remember how he is

98
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,903
Beaten down so much that he just loves

99
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,927
The state

100
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:53,279
I'm putting up with

101
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:00,447
What about you what's your birthday

102
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,239
I've been doing some yoga

103
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:08,639
Some things about is my second time doing it ever last night and

104
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
I got in trouble

105
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:16,319
Because I was being verbally corrected on something that I was doing wrong or whatever

106
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,855
Through me like

107
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,135
Just hearing the voice

108
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:22,719
Through me so much that I just fell over and began laughing and just being like

109
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:27,583
I didn't hear a word you said you don't like how I would be laughing

110
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,983
Seton no according to the people that are in yoga now or whatever you're supposed to

111
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,519
Be all quiet and s***

112
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,823
Right but anyways

113
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:44,223
It's fun to be reprimanded in a new place for being loud and laughing

114
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,527
Going to hit every possible activities

115
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,599
Where people can be angry at me for being loud and laughing

116
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,927
You kind of got to take the rough with the smooth who I mean because like

117
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,951
Basically we've

118
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,975
Creative podcast

119
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,023
You know people enjoy it

120
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,815
Somewhat because you're allowed

121
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,887
Are you my whole heart

122
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,959
Another settings

123
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:08,031
The other direction

124
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:14,431
Well I'm glad I look forward to you showing up on Monday to do the podcast to me like look what I can do and then putting her

125
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:20,831
Look behind your head something weird feet the flexibility

126
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,879
My partner I am going to defeat

127
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:27,999
Yoga and then never do it again and then once I am one side

128
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,303
I feel like I'm confident I will say this is

129
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,863
Is dumb and quit forever I wish you well

130
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,679
So Jordan today we are going back to the past

131
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
May 4th and 20

132
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,775
5th 2003

133
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,055
And the reason for that

134
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,335
Is because

135
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,615
I don't

136
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,919
Know if we were going to have

137
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,455
Enough lead time

138
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,247
To do the episode that I wanted to do

139
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,271
For Friday

140
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,551
Alright

141
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,879
And that is I realize that Alex is going to be talking

142
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
Almost

143
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,487
Exclusively about Tucker's Patriot Purge documentary

144
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,279
Hey people have gotten

145
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
Touch of Italy

146
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,839
Please do an episode about

147
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
Patriot prayer

148
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,423
It does seem like that is our eventual end

149
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,799
I've been resistant to do episodes about Tucker Carlson for a number of reasons

150
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:19,455
One I don't want to step on the toes of there's another podcast that does Tucker I don't want to

151
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,247
Other people's intellectual proper

152
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:24,575
Hey can't do it every time any other podcast

153
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,391
The talked about Alex Jones we I have obviously been very

154
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:31,231
Sure that I just don't believe that Tucker

155
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,791
Richarlison is a sincere actor and

156
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,815
I don't

157
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,583
Think

158
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,607
That he interest

159
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,887
Me and the same way as Alec

160
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,471
I don't want to talk about any Rich pricks

161
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:45,055
You know I mean like the but that kind of childhood

162
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,103
You know that kind of just like

163
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,175
He's in our take it either take your ball and go home kid

164
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,991
I've lived long enough

165
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,271
To watch

166
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
His

167
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,575
Various incarnations

168
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,367
And I don't find him to be

169
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,159
Like a person with that

170
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,463
With up with a solid ground under

171
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,743
Vitas

172
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
Hagrid

173
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,327
Integrity sound

174
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
Positive

175
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:13,983
Integrity

176
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,287
He's done

177
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:19,103
This s*** that is a good point

178
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,919
Shades of some things throughout Alex

179
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,943
His career but there's

180
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,015
What you could call it a coherent through line

181
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,343
Not really for someone like

182
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,879
Right right right

183
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,183
Don't interest me as much

184
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:33,951
But

185
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,791
I think that the intersection is so high here that will

186
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
Probably have

187
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,327
2:30

188
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,887
Do something about papers

189
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
And

190
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:47,263
Alex was apparently do background work on it so kind of

191
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:55,967
So I can so I wanted to do an episode about that but I realize we probably wouldn't have enough lead time by the time at

192
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,735
It was all out

193
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:01,599
And everything for this episode so we'll be on Monday we'll talk about that on Monday

194
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
And for now

195
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
We're back in the past

196
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,695
Enjoying

197
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,487
The smooth Breeze

198
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,535
A 2003

199
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,559
TNT

200
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,631
Which is doing 2002

201
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,591
Let's take a little moment to say hello

202
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,871
So first

203
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:28,479
Jordan's Afrikaner accent in the episode 104 sounds like

204
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,295
Kiwi Richard Nixon thank you so much you are now policy

205
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,623
Now I kind of

206
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,231
Are you I'm hearing kiwi Nixa to my head but I don't know how to make it come out of my mouth if I could

207
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,511
God I could do it loud

208
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:46,143
I'll just go back to the 104

209
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,983
I'm a policy wonk next

210
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,519
Thank you so much and I apologize

211
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
Raiden

212
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
Editorially

213
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,199
God of thunder

214
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:03,551
Thunder right

215
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:09,951
Alright for me I will

216
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:14,815
I'm a policy wonk

217
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:24,799
That's the people from Manchester but I don't know probably mispronouncing it

218
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,103
Intimidate

219
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,383
Sion our policy

220
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,967
Wonder there's a liver pueblan

221
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,599
Iowa Book

222
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:43,999
Lilliputian Gulliver's Travels Evil Book

223
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:48,095
No one will ever suspect that tiny man never becoming president

224
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,911
So here we are back in the past and

225
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,447
Oh wait we have

226
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,983
Figure it out what we were looking

227
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
For in the past

228
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,103
We know that Alex does think he's fighting the devil

229
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,639
And so is likewise don't want to keep

230
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,663
Keep going in the past

231
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
Answer

232
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,271
My initial justification was

233
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,551
See what you think

234
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,879
Thanks more about Harry Potter this is right

235
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,927
Listening over this episode

236
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,951
That's what our new mission is

237
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
And so we'll get to that

238
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,023
In the middle of this episode before we do

239
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,095
Here's another contact drop that I just think it's kind of cute

240
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:24,447
Maryland

241
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,615
Hey I'm here

242
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:39,295
I don't know why would there's just something Sherman I really

243
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:45,695
That made me laugh so hard Barney's I'm so excited

244
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,975
I enjoyed that

245
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,767
Although you've got that Barney

246
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,327
Five kind of tone to him that's it that's perfect

247
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,631
So we start here on the 24th

248
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,447
And Alex gets into talking about

249
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,727
How the feds

250
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,031
They said damn tracks around

251
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,871
A bit about the anthrax letters that

252
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,431
Like that were sent to me in the wake of 9/11

253
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,223
And

254
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,271
We don't need to rehash that

255
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:13,087
But there's a piece of this narrative that I don't believe we've gotten a

256
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,623
Into that I think is worth exploring

257
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,511
Congressional

258
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,607
A Night to Remember

259
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,479
Real

260
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,527
In 2001

261
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,191
Inoculation

262
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,751
Smallpox

263
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,591
We talked

264
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:11,711
We talked a bit about the end of the FED sending Anthrax narrative but we didn't talk

265
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
About

266
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,015
The angle of it

267
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,039
That is this

268
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,855
Bush Administration folks being on Cipro

269
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:23,231
Before the letters got sent out

270
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
That it's a pretty

271
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:28,607
Consistent thing that he uses as proof that they had Advance knowledge that anthrax was going

272
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,911
Going to be sad okay okay

273
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,191
Here's what happened with this

274
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,055
Completely insane lawyer Larry klayman who is still with Judicial Watch

275
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:41,407
At this point great in 2002

276
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,479
A quote access to documents about last fall.

277
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
2Pac

278
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,575
Asserting that top officials may have known that the attacks were,

279
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,159
Took B based on the fact that you know there had been

280
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:58,303
Information that people are on Cipro for back fat

281
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,327
Confronting several years ago

282
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,911
You wanted to know if Bush ever called him an a******

283
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:08,287
Cipro is an antibiotic that can be used as a treatment for someone who's a

284
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:12,895
Exposed to Anthrax but it's not really the kind of treatment you would want for inhaled a

285
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,175
Switches with a large

286
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,199
Concerns would be

287
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,223
With the anthrax

288
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
Send these letters

289
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,831
In fact Cleveland clients in the suit where workers at a Washington

290
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
Wheaton post office

291
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,671
Do employees at the facility where they work

292
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,975
Could handle the anthrax letters and made it died

293
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,511
Because they inhaled anthrax

294
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,535
Switch again

295
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,375
That's why you're really going to be concerned about the situation

296
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,399
Not so much

297
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:38,239
You could get it if you have a cut on your hand you could have a different kind of

298
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,031
Exposure

299
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,311
The death kind

300
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
Is the one you don't

301
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:46,943
Sure the issues it wasn't until after this

302
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
After

303
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,271
For September 11th that the scientific community

304
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
They may break through

305
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,855
In terms of antitoxin therapy

306
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
Soda really effective against

307
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
Instant hailed anthrax

308
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,439
Like anthem

309
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,463
And

310
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,023
Rexi rexi Bakuman

311
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,631
Did you just curse me I think I did

312
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:17,151
I prefer anthem

313
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:17,919
That would

314
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,967
So at that time though

315
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,503
Let you know after 9/11

316
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,391
These treatments weren't available in the only real option that was on the table would have been antimicrobial agents

317
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,463
And these antibiotics like Cipro or doxycycline

318
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:36,863
The risk of these members of the Bush Administration would have been taken by exposing themselves to a ax

319
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,911
Even if they were on Cipro would be no

320
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,471
It's a bizarre

321
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,031
Do you know what's the weirdest part about this

322
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,591
This is something that people never talk about those Anthrax letters

323
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,151
They were really well-written sure like

324
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,943
Collectors like a bank like

325
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,527
Letters to a young man o to a young Poet by renier real

326
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,319
Basically like calligraphy

327
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,111
Amazeum

328
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:02,207
So if there actually is a vaccine against Anthrax called biothrax

329
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:08,351
If the folks in the government really wanted to protect themselves from a false flag attack that's almost certainly what they would have

330
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,959
Actually what happened in the real world

331
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,775
On September 11th

332
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,615
Text George W bush and many members of his staff were on board Air Force One

333
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,967
What are the people on the plane was White House physician Colonel dr. Richard tub

334
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:29,599
Tub was understandably freaked out and he decided to make a decision just in case the worst case scenario

335
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,647
From an interview with tub

336
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,415
Quotes

337
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:36,255
The thing at that moment I was most worried about was a biologic

338
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:43,423
In the unlikely but high-risk scenario I thought there was little harm to be prophylaxis in the staff with Anna

339
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,191
Biotics

340
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,495
It seemed like almost science fiction

341
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,311
I gave everyone on the plane a week of Cipro

342
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,127
I hope by the time they ran out we to figure it out

343
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,943
The fog of War

344
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,711
Continue my shirt

345
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:02,367
An antibiotic like Cipro wouldn't necessarily be super effective at preventing you from being harmed by anthrax

346
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,415
But you have a better chance

347
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,487
Spell the sooner you start

348
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:13,887
The reason that some of the Stanford given Cipro is because after 9/11 the way that's doctor wanted to cover his bases

349
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:14,911
Because if they're

350
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,447
Had been a biological attack

351
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,263
Start the antibiotics

352
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,543
Because he waited

353
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,103
You couldn't get that time back you're sure sure

354
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:27,455
This is an incredibly stupid conspiracy theory because it fails to take

355
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:33,343
Into account the very clear explanation for why someone working in the White House might have been given Cipro around that time

356
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,927
There was a feeder on 9/11 that they might have already been

357
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,951
Expose

358
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:43,071
Also you see here outhouses using the story to drum up fears about forced vaccination

359
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,863
That's because he always

360
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,167
He's does that and it never actually ends up happy

361
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,239
When you go back and you listen to him be wrong about this s***

362
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,055
This specific s*** over and over again

363
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,847
He's being wrong so

364
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:59,199
That lady really use that to inform how you hear him talking about covid in the present

365
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,503
Just another wannabe

366
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:07,391
Yeah it's the same thing whether it's real or not outside whether there's a deadly virus or not

367
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,695
Vaccines are killing people or whatever

368
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,535
Can hear him tell the story cuz he's like

369
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:18,655
Talking about why would Bush Administration people on Cipro months before

370
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,703
The the anthrax letters

371
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,239
It wasn't months

372
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,007
Before

373
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,311
And there was a reason because it was on 9/11

374
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
Big zits

375
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,639
It's suspicious the way

376
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,407
He ortix

377
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,431
Articulate

378
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,967
But it's not actually sisters

379
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,599
So Alex has a big headline for the day

380
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,135
This is one of his varsi

381
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,159
City Stories

382
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,999
And it's about to the Houston Chief of Police

383
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,279
Coming out and saying

384
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,559
There's no justice

385
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,423
Okay okay

386
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
Criminal

387
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:20,351
That's quite quite a quote from the Houston police chief never heard a police chief that far

388
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:26,751
Throwing it up

389
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,031
Call work on their asses

390
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,407
So what happened is it there

391
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:38,015
Concerns about the validity of the results that were coming out of the DNA crime lab in Houston

392
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,575
After at least one person was found to have been wrongly

393
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,647
Convicted based on inaccurate results from that lab

394
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,951
Audit of the lab and there's also

395
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,975
Swear not good

396
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:51,839
It turned out that the lab had a leaky roof that they've been trying to get funds to fixari what

397
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:56,703
Since 1995 what did you just say to me

398
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:00,799
So you're telling me that the f****** thin line between convey

399
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,847
Eviction for

400
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,127
25 to life

401
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:10,527
And exoneration is a leaky roof only issue that was indicative of the

402
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,367
Troubles in misallocation not being able to allocate funds

403
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,672
Bright

404
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,720
They're only two analysts work

405
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:22,048
Working in the lab which is way too few for a city as huge as Houston

406
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,328
Wow that's great

407
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:28,192
That's real great stuff not only looked at the State of Affairs at the lab

408
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,984
It also reviewed historical cases

409
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,056
Identify potential evidence that came out of

410
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:39,968
The lab was closed in December 2002 and going back to the early 1990s the audit found quote major

411
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:44,064
Issues in 43 out of 135 cases

412
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832
But they looked at

413
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:50,464
Definitely

414
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,512
Bed that the prop phukmi

415
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:57,376
So many of the labs potentially flawed pieces of War ultimate leben

416
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,168
Confirm by independent test

417
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:03,776
Remember of the errors that they made that were major issues

418
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,312
Some of them were not

419
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,080
About the

420
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,128
Accuracy of the results right

421
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:14,528
The process and stuff like that team they actually got it right in the confirmed

422
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,576
Surprised we also got a ride but fuk up

423
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,624
If we knew we were going to it might have

424
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,952
Reliably got it right

425
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:26,304
But unfortunately there was that one definitive

426
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,376
Case where they were responsible for this wrongful

427
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:33,472
Also this audit uncovered a total of 52 cases

428
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,264
That they had on their books

429
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
That hadn't been

430
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,568
Confirm by outside testing

431
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,384
And doing so at that point would likely be

432
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,408
Righttime us

433
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,480
The possibility of other wrongful convictions result

434
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,528
DNA analysis during this era

435
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,552
Cannot be diss

436
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,576
Yeah

437
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,344
The big

438
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,112
Big

439
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:50,880
Yeah

440
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,928
Other areas of the Houston Police

441
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,744
Department lab actually be pretty solid in the audit

442
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:59,328
Various for Toxicology trace evidence and Firearm test

443
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,608
Did a good job but that

444
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,888
DNA part was a

445
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,656
Serious

446
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,424
Serious bro

447
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:10,080
Yeah you know the thing that everybody uses to convince people and says is a Smoking Gun

448
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:13,664
Evidence you know that that that small part of the process

449
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,712
DNA

450
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:21,600
The Houston Police Department suspended the lab and Internal Affairs reviewed any criminal and administrative violations

451
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:25,184
Could have been made in the running of the lab in this resulted in a fair amount of Hauschka

452
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,720
Like a bunch of people resign

453
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:33,632
The da open to grand juries and possible criminal charges for the labs operation but neither ended up returning any and died

454
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:39,008
There's a massive review going on

455
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:42,336
The errors that have been made in the past with the lab woods and.

456
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,360
Still operating

457
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:46,688
And I'm certain that the police chief Clarence Bradford said

458
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,456
Nothing really

459
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,736
So what Alex's

460
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,272
Is a legend

461
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,832
Do you like the idea of

462
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,600
Police chief

463
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,368
Just napping

464
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,416
I just be it like you know what f***

465
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,208
I'm going to tell everybody everything

466
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,256
This blue wall of Silence

467
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,048
A f****** done with it

468
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,328
That mother f***** killed

469
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:08,960
People yesterday I did see some comments that he made about like

470
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,520
The prosecutor is wanting to win as opposed

471
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,080
Do Seeking Justice or whatever

472
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:18,688
And I think some of that might have been affected by the fact that he gotten

473
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:21,504
In trouble with the law

474
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,088
And he has just had a case against him

475
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,904
For like perjury

476
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,696
The birds are the little bits

477
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,512
When you have somebody who's me a critical of the justice system

478
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,304
Even over the chief of police

479
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,144
It's kind of relevant that they had just had a brush with the law

480
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,960
I don't know

481
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,984
Is very serious

482
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,800
Like the really serious story in the way Alex

483
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:51,200
Discovering it does a real disservice to the reality within the audit and

484
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,248
You know baby since project

485
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,528
Cyborg

486
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,576
They were trying to make sure whatever

487
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:00,416
Information that could be gleaned from this could be used to Free People Who

488
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
I've been Rock Lee

489
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,584
Convicted whenever I mean I was John ra of True Crime is railroaded and put

490
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,608
Put in jail unjust

491
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:14,496
You know like it's not like we have a small number of those documentaries just floating around out there

492
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,520
That s*** is

493
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,080
Pumped out on the regular pernett play

494
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,104
Flexo

495
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:22,944
So Alex has a bit of a missed telling of this

496
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,968
Does Houston crime lab

497
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,760
And I think again

498
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:29,344
This is what I really want to make is like this is a serious story

499
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
And Alex

500
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,392
Turns it into a joke

501
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,928
By reporting it for later

502
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,984
Hair

503
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,776
And I

504
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:53,408
This is a disservice to actual reporting

505
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,432
Story like this

506
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,456
Requires actual

507
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
Cuz

508
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,272
It's a big big deal

509
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:03,136
Police chief here we've never convicted a guilty man not once

510
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:09,536
0 *

511
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:13,120
The Christmas party that's what it's all for

512
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:16,192
It's turning this into a cartoon story

513
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:22,336
Do anything about you that makes you mad make you mad

514
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:25,664
Didn't plan that you're fighting against at the half of ratman yeah okay

515
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,992
He's worried about crime

516
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:29,760
Naturally

517
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,320
Play there's no justice in Houston

518
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,344
Texas

519
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,112
Is great

520
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,392
Because they allow you to have.

521
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,208
I was just know how he would leave

522
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,488
Estate

523
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,512
Where you couldn't protect

524
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,560
Himself in his home from the roving gangs of

525
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:46,912
Do crackheads or breaking into everybody's house

526
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,472
50 guns

527
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,240
Come out

528
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,520
After that

529
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,288
Alex

530
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,616
Gets into talking about how in Texas

531
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,920
I don't know if you know that I don't know

532
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,712
When people

533
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,736
Break into car

534
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,040
In Texas specifically in Tech

535
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,064
Intex

536
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,600
What they do

537
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,672
He's the only break into cars that are parked on the street

538
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,464
Like outside your house that's on the street

539
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,488
He'll break into it

540
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,280
Driveway

541
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:19,936
Okay so we're operating on a safe Zone rules traditional tag rules you know like

542
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:27,872
With without

543
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,016
Running around

544
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,808
Busting down doors

545
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,856
Raping and killing

546
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,904
I don't do that

547
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,168
I want a car broken into

548
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,776
Car broken into

549
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:59,104
We've been robbed as well all of the neighbor

550
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,832
Because

551
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,464
Robbing our car

552
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,280
Strange sort of weird

553
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:54,144
Discussion that he's having with himself on a figure out the ethics

554
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,216
Of shooting someone for rifling through your car

555
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:03,616
Did have a little bit of a philosophy class kind of vibe to it where he's going like flipping Okay so

556
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,384
Alright

557
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,968
I do think it's right to protect myself however

558
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,320
Is the value of the objects in the car worth a human life

559
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,600
On the other hand

560
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,136
Does that mean that there are

561
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:18,208
Any valuable objects that are worth a human life

562
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,232
Should it be

563
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,280
$30,000 is that what I should

564
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:25,376
Kill a man for minor in college

565
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,656
Can tell you that

566
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,192
Do usually lyrics

567
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,216
Explore a little deeper

568
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:33,312
Send what I was doing this is not a good philosophy class

569
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,848
And you'll hear that

570
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,152
He got to the point where it's like I don't know if

571
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,992
It's worth killing someone if they're robbing my car the first thing he thought of was the hassle

572
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:47,136
Yeah yeah it is true that his biggest problem was I have to go to court and I have to be like

573
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,160
I'm do it on purpose

574
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,720
I was worth the trouble

575
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:53,280
That's the that's the real problem with killing people

576
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,584
Something afterward

577
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,168
I've killed a lot of people

578
00:29:59,424 --> 00:29:59,936
The killed nobody

579
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,984
Spelling of it

580
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,520
Lot of people

581
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:09,408
How much of a hassle it is slow

582
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:14,272
He's a sick motherfuker likes to kill really f***** up

583
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,600
He talks about some of his stories

584
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,880
Excited

585
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:21,440
During this next clip sure which is really weird

586
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:27,584
Really weird to hear him talk about stuff like this when we know that later he'll tell these stories about how he killed people

587
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:29,888
Through Queen

588
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,424
Back in 2003

589
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,416
And I was never a big deal

590
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,192
Almost

591
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:08,032
I was always involved in them but moaning in okay

592
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:29,024
Hornady I was constantly Jump by all the black people in town

593
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:33,632
Who gets into fights whatever stuff goes wrong in a baseball game

594
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:36,960
Play a little bit of a rough Sandlot

595
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:42,592
That was a sure you know what man when you getting

596
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,360
The fights

597
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,128
And the coaches

598
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,664
School would hear about it

599
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,944
They would punish you and just

600
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,224
The folksy a sway

601
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:53,856
Work it out

602
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,360
Around

603
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,160
Running around the track

604
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,280
I'm around at the Bannon

605
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,760
Bruise across your hind in

606
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,784
What is the murder

607
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,088
I was going to say it but what's

608
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:03,488
The time that this is 2320 years to go from

609
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,144
When I got into a fight my coach make me rant

610
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,472
6 people surrounded by the f******

611
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,264
Denver Broncos

612
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,592
And let me tell you I'm like

613
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:24,992
I liked it because I was so mad I get the time

614
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,040
To prove my Warriors

615
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,112
Strike this story really

616
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,136
6 Byron

617
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:37,024
It's like starting with a 1950

618
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,816
Is idyllic sweet place

619
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:43,936
Whenever

620
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,704
Stop

621
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,008
It's starting with like

622
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,824
If me and my friends with Jason hoop down the road

623
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,688
I meant like a couple years later the story is f****** sleep game

624
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:58,784
I was forced to kill my friend

625
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,576
Watch my friends die

626
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,136
Every year one person had died

627
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:03,904
Did die.

628
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,696
To keep the school open

629
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,768
Yes they were the exact official lamps

630
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,560
Of course

631
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:14,400
The 2003 version of these stories is a lot more

632
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,448
Believable very believable

633
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:21,312
Sounds like an actual story it's early relatable I remember when I play bass

634
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,104
Football in junior high

635
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,384
I

636
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,920
Drop to the coaches ring

637
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:29,248
He was a football player that you was in the NFL

638
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,040
Super Bowl rings

639
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,856
Accidentally

640
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:38,720
So just carpet nothing happened

641
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:39,744
Like you're running

642
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,328
You're running laps

643
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,864
Which do you prefer

644
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,936
You know what to do

645
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:54,336
There is a relationship between the

646
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,360
Looks at you and your ghost

647
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,408
Alright fine I don't start running away

648
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:03,552
You know what I know now that I actually articulate this and say this out loud

649
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,600
I wonder if that actually was

650
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,368
The Super Bowl ring

651
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,904
Because I bet it wasn't

652
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:12,768
Something else now looking back as a 37 year old person

653
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,352
Receivable that he brought a foot like a soup

654
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,120
Super Bowl ring

655
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:20,704
2A Junior High basketball practice

656
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,848
Would impress the hell out of everybody there hard not to say that to I do know that he did win a Superbowl

657
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:31,200
Okay yeah he absolutely did with who

658
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:31,968
The Giants

659
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,248
Jerome Sally

660
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,272
Coke salad

661
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,600
Yeah he

662
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,536
I also all right kids

663
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,304
I coach

664
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,376
Steve Young now let's go get 8 points today

665
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:54,240
I also had an issue with like he went to the same church that I went

666
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,264
He knew me but

667
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,544
Before he was my coach

668
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:59,104
And that also kind of lied to him by

669
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:05,504
Having a little bit of a damper on me a little bit

670
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,832
But yeah I look back on that

671
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,600
I had to have been

672
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,880
And some other sort of rain

673
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:14,720
I know that I dropped a ring that was a sentimental value and in my head

674
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:18,560
I thought it was a Super Bowl ring

675
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:24,960
Forever I didn't throw up though murdered a lot of people

676
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:31,360
Show me the story several years ago for the first time I remember we were hanging out at a bar after we recorded the show and you are

677
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,920
I can't believe I can't wait to tell you the story

678
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,200
Drop the Superbowl ring

679
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,224
Murdered six people

680
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,248
Now my coach

681
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:39,296
Was actually in the Super Bowl

682
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,392
So I told you at the beginning of this episode that

683
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,928
We have a new reason

684
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,464
To stay in the past

685
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,744
And that is

686
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,512
That

687
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,536
Are you forgotten

688
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,072
In the timeline

689
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:51,840
A 2000

690
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,608
3

691
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,376
Is when

692
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:56,960
Greg Davis the governor of California has a recall

693
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,728
Against

694
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:01,056
Okay it is just starting up here and doing

695
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,336
And that leads us

696
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,616
Something very important

697
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:25,632
You will all enjoy that

698
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,960
He also

699
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,128
Creature like Arnold

700
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,664
Alex

701
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,456
Hates Arnold Schwarzenegger

702
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,736
I believe

703
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:44,064
Believe that this. Where there is a runoff election

704
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,392
The recall will be

705
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,440
I think he's going to go nuts

706
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:53,024
I think I think it's going to be a really really interesting.

707
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,560
Iamsu

708
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,840
Christ he hates

709
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,864
Arnold Schwarzenegger

710
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:03,008
I am right or know why I feel like there's something about Arnold that he should enjoy

711
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:06,848
Like you should see something in Arnold that reminds him of

712
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,896
Masculinity of some sort writer

713
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:15,296
It seems like he would be attracted to that

714
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:18,112
I'm sure you wouldn't want to articulate to somebody Howard

715
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,928
Activity is too strong men but I think that would be odd

716
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:24,512
I don't know exactly what

717
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,792
The bone

718
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,072
He's picking

719
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:27,840
But

720
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:28,864
I know that

721
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,192
He had a website that he was running there was like Arnold exposed

722
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,752
Like he goes all out against Arnold Schwartz

723
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:40,384
And does Jesse hate this is Ventura hate hate Arnold

724
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:46,784
I actually haven't heard Alex bring up Jesse Ventura much at this in this 2003.

725
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,808
Probably

726
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:48,832
I don't know when.

727
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,856
Ventura run

728
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,392
Good question and I don't remember

729
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,488
It's hard to remember the crazy Governors from each state

730
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,304
Just like Howard Texas there's no such thing as

731
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,120
Is Justice because of all the DNA tampering

732
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,936
Spell every state is at a

733
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,240
Super insane Governor at one point or another

734
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,544
Just stop

735
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,872
Being governor

736
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,432
Rhizome

737
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,016
This would have been the rise of Michelle Baca

738
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:25,440
Reasonable

739
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,208
Communication

740
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,536
So I am now

741
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,560
Staying in the past

742
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:36,960
Under the guise of tracking Alex's coverage of the Arnold Schwarzenegger gubernatorial run

743
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:41,056
That's what I'm excited about now

744
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,360
I'll come up with a pun

745
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,384
The 6th day

746
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,456
Collateral damage

747
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:52,064
I also I'm still interested in seeing it when Alex gets

748
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,136
Accept the reality about the bass part

749
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:58,208
Oh yeah I would be interested something else that I'm still tracking

750
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,512
EXO 2003

751
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,792
Time frame

752
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,840
The next episode we do in the Press

753
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,608
And he's going to be like

754
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:07,424
And the bath party is still in power in Iraq

755
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,240
I'm taking over the global

756
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,288
So I Alex talk to you about

757
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,312
A cousin of his

758
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:14,848
Make a sparkly

759
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,872
Maybe it is

760
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,408
Yesterday I don't know probably

761
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,968
Respect family

762
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,248
If this is Berkeley

763
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,904
His resume is much larger than house DJ and former Infowars employee

764
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,928
Get some real serious business

765
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,584
Bergstrom Air Force Base

766
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,424
You familiar with that

767
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,408
I'm sorry what

768
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,016
Intelligent someone Illinois 911 I'm watching

769
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,296
TV on

770
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,344
This is absolutely a

771
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,672
Happen without them letting it happen

772
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,560
And I'll tell you what I can tell it just like it is

773
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,608
So I don't know if Buckley merge

774
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,400
The police or the military but

775
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,936
He might have been doing that at the airport

776
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,728
I mean if it was Buckley's

777
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:16,032
Job that would explain why it didn't

778
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,056
Happened

779
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:21,664
And when people say Alex is like CIA and s*** like that

780
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,968
This is the kind of the reason why

781
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,272
Some of those people get those theories of it if you'd like

782
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:29,856
My cousin is merging the police with the military

783
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,136
How can you

784
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,928
Maintain that level of

785
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:39,328
Like familiarity with your cousin if your cousin is literally implementing what you think is the f****** end of the world

786
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:45,728
Your cousin is killing Posse Comitatus

787
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,288
Agree to disagree

788
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,360
This color really touches on an important dynamic

789
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:57,247
In response to a national tragedy like 911 he convinces himself there's no way that something like that could

790
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,015
Did just happen

791
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,295
It had to be

792
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,319
Conspiracy decide

793
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:03,391
The reason that conclusion happens

794
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,695
Before he goes out looking for information

795
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,487
He's actually doing

796
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:11,071
He's less about seeking truth and more about finding someone who will help him feel sick

797
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:13,119
Cure in the conclusion that he's already come to

798
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,679
He wants to be the choir for someone else

799
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,447
Preach to

800
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,495
And now it's filled that role quite well

801
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,799
Almost no one gets convinced

802
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:25,151
To follow Alex or believe what he says because if they were using the Rational part of their brain

803
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,455
Or they're engaging with the information he puts out

804
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,503
Will be almost impossible to take him seriously

805
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:36,415
The path is often more like with his collars describing where there's actually no persuasion necessary Alex's

806
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,231
He's just saying the things that they

807
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,255
These folks are craving

808
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:43,583
Or someone say based on the feelings that they have

809
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,607
Surrounding

810
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,143
I don't know not

811
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,191
Not feeling comfortable with the Rand

812
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:50,495
That dynamic

813
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:55,103
Is also really really active in the present-day stuff about Kobe

814
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,151
It's something that

815
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,175
Is worth

816
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,967
Except

817
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:03,039
The chaotic universe is ultimately the fundamental

818
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,087
The problem with everything that we do right now

819
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:08,159
It does it does lead to a lot of like bad thoughts

820
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:08,927
Patterns

821
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:13,535
So the chaotic universe that we live in is

822
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,303
The therapist

823
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:15,839
What

824
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,119
One of the products of the

825
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,679
I like talking like that

826
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:26,335
Richard literal product another one is that there have been a hundred different versions of the Hulk

827
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,967
So many versions of the Hulk

828
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:36,319
Oh man that he hadn't even seen Avengers by this point I don't feel back on Edward Norton

829
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,343
He had

830
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,111
Been almost

831
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,159
Cast of the event

832
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:46,815
No that was Guardians of the Galaxy part of the Avengers universe

833
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:49,887
So Alex

834
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
Okay

835
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,319
Government

836
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,303
And

837
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,319
New World Order

838
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,855
New World Order

839
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:00,799
She certainly was bringing people together

840
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:03,615
Really bring the information to the table not just screaming

841
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:07,967
Unplugs her infowars.com

842
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:08,735
I think

843
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:15,135
There's just not been anyone so much like Fred Hampton in my life a lifetime you know somebody who can bring together all

844
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,695
All of the lower class doesn't matter what race

845
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,231
Doesn't matter what Creed

846
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,511
Bring them in

847
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,143
I think that I have some bad

848
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,167
For Alex

849
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:27,935
And like

850
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,215
The people who

851
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,495
Super racist

852
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,055
Also

853
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:35,871
The new world order plants

854
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:39,199
No they're just there's a lot of races tonight

855
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:45,855
Yeah I think Alex is real problem is more that they pick a racist without teeth

856
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:49,183
He would he would prefer that he were to go on these shows

857
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:52,511
So he could be the racists

858
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,047
I need a really nice teeth

859
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,583
Gotten braces away

860
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,375
These people are being

861
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,679
To Publix

862
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:01,215
Glee contemptible

863
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:06,847
If I were to go on there and look good

864
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:07,871
Yep yep

865
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,407
The Hulk apparently is mine

866
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:10,687
Punisher

867
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,247
What about the other one

868
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,527
What what what are they

869
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:22,207
Before this or after this I think he must be talking about the angry one cuz I think the angli one

870
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,999
Came before the Edward Norton 1

871
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:26,559
What's

872
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,327
His dumb face

873
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,375
Took over as the Hulk for The Avengers

874
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:35,775
You know the angry Hulk was the 2003 one

875
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,055
Okay so let's see

876
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,407
Norton would have been wet like 2000

877
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:46,527
Eight or nine or not far away the Incredible Hulk

878
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:48,575
Yeah right here at Redwood Norton 1

879
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:50,879
Damn wow

880
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:51,647
Crazy

881
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:56,255
Marvel has dominated by adult life kind of brutal fashion

882
00:46:56,511 --> 00:47:02,655
Shocking that you nailed but like a both of those and it makes me question

883
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,935
I know that I watch

884
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,263
I don't remember the

885
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:10,335
Here's the worst part was bored here's the worst part

886
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,615
Never saw both of

887
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,687
I've never seen one of the Hulk movie

888
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,735
That is weird

889
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:20,063
Phone calls as you heard the siren

890
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,111
In the back all those guy

891
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,391
I was on the phone

892
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,927
Amber

893
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:25,951
Skip a little bit upset at

894
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,487
At this next caller who brings up

895
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,535
Certain radio house

896
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,071
How about who is this

897
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,863
Give me very many Clues

898
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:36,703
Important

899
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:39,263
What is dwarfed by all these other issues

900
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:50,527
Bright

901
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,087
You're blind

902
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,111
Yeah yeah

903
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,927
Now you can't see that Harry Potter is demonic

904
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,695
Because

905
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,463
They released

906
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,255
One of the five books on

907
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,279
On the solstice

908
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,559
Your blinds

909
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,351
I mean it tracks

910
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:06,399
Apparently some host

911
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:09,983
It was on the radio does neocon was talking about

912
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,543
How Harry Potter isn't evil

913
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:15,103
Alex does not enjoy this

914
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:18,175
I believe this is Michael Savage

915
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:20,735
Find a bit more about Michael Savage

916
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,015
Throughout this

917
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:27,135
He gets another call from somebody who's like hey you know why I was trying to turn my friends on

918
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:29,951
I told this guy to listen

919
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,975
As I told him

920
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,511
And then he told me

921
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,839
And I called the FBI cuz that dude's crazy

922
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,167
He tells this story twice

923
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,191
Okay

924
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,983
Then Alex brings in his guests

925
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:43,007
For the show.

926
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:43,775
Is Ray McGovern

927
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,591
Been on quite a bit like an hour

928
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,871
Intelligence analyst

929
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,663
And

930
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,431
Alex wants

931
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,199
The caller to

932
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,735
To tell Ray this story

933
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:56,319
It's just it's heat I got so many times

934
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,879
It's not even a good snack terrible

935
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:13,983
No I am

936
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,007
Pray that you

937
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:17,055
I'm allergic to lipstick

938
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,639
Another word of it

939
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:25,503
Price told the story for the third time

940
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,575
And now I am

941
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,879
Cycling is the FBI called them. They want to put

942
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,439
Put me in jail for

943
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,719
Yeah

944
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:38,559
Exercise instantly it fascinating that

945
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,607
Michael Savage

946
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,655
Is so hated by Alex

947
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,423
At this point

948
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,447
And like

949
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,751
In the future I will be like

950
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:49,567
He's always been a great hero

951
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,615
Sounds like you would Survivor you know you

952
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:56,479
He's just been beaten down by so much Michael Savage over the years he's like

953
00:49:56,735 --> 00:50:00,319
The stuff I like to hear don't think that's analogous but that's fine

954
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:04,927
Interview with Ray McGovern for about the

955
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,207
Like rest of the show

956
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,999
And I find it very boring

957
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:10,559
It's basically just a Iraq sucks

958
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,351
They got her at the country the water

959
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:18,495
Why not

960
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:22,335
Feels bad for the people in Iraq

961
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,663
Totally the right tank

962
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:28,223
He says something that I would have thought

963
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:29,247
Freak out about

964
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,783
It's kind of disappointing but he does

965
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,319
I feel

966
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,623
Alex Meadow

967
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,903
What's going on

968
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:39,231
Being done not only to these children

969
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,863
We really can't blame

970
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:50,495
From the farm said they hoped

971
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:52,287
You want me to get my way into

972
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,375
Clearly

973
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:19,935
Nationalized

974
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:23,007
We can't pretend to have the answer to these things

975
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,287
Plan going in weho

976
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,359
What happened after the war

977
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:31,199
UN in there

978
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,479
Inspectors bag

979
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,527
Should be something

980
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:40,927
Leads to fireworks

981
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:44,511
Rosa bring them to devil

982
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,327
Amanda doesn't lead to a fight it's really

983
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:51,167
The frontman for evil to step in and fight

984
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:53,471
This battle for Anita internationalize

985
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:56,287
I can't believe that somebody would say that to Alex

986
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,311
Two-Face and Alex

987
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,335
It would not react like

988
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,615
Yep

989
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,663
Part of it is at this point Ray McGovern

990
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:04,991
He's kind of somebody who has some credibility

991
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,527
And I don't think Alex

992
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:09,855
Wants to lose that once again

993
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:10,623
Imbalance

994
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,647
That's leading to Alex

995
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:12,927
Text being a

996
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:13,695
Scaredy cat

997
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,487
Alex's

998
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,791
Incredibly low status comparative

999
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,327
And I think that's

1000
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,095
That's why he

1001
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:24,447
He does point he does speak up and as I got out of the un's actually bad

1002
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:25,727
Ray isn't having any of it

1003
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:29,567
It just it just leads to them talking

1004
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:32,895
Conversation

1005
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,175
Alex says one thing

1006
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,455
Breakout of ignores it and

1007
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,991
Says another

1008
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,527
I wanted to be a fight

1009
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:41,599
That's such a and that's also one of those things with Alex

1010
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:43,647
It's such a tale for me in is

1011
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:48,511
Is like regardless of all the other s*** like somebody who's so

1012
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,791
That aware of

1013
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:55,423
How status and balance should change the way that they to the point where it's so obvious he's just a bully

1014
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,215
Like that's what

1015
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:00,799
Though every interaction with a status and balance shows is Alex

1016
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:01,567
This is just a bully

1017
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:04,639
But it is also a bully with a bad radar

1018
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:07,711
Yeah that's true he could bully like Bill Ayers

1019
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:10,271
That is true that is true

1020
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:16,671
Hell yeah but that's because billares is socialist monster so it should be easy when you have the

1021
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,999
Power of the Lord behind you to say get

1022
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:23,583
Behind me Satan radar

1023
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,191
Yeah I also think there's something

1024
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,495
I just I just

1025
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:34,335
Feel like if you believe that the UN is an instrument of trying to

1026
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:35,871
Explicitly

1027
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:36,895
Brumby

1028
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:37,919
Beginning

1029
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:41,247
Has been about bringing the new world order a One World Government

1030
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:45,855
We're just going to be run by the Antichrist and Satan if somebody is

1031
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:46,879
They like woah

1032
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:49,183
I think we need to bring in the UN in order to

1033
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,463
This master.

1034
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,999
Is happening in Iraq

1035
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:54,815
International Solutions are necessary

1036
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:58,399
You should not be able to move on to any other subject

1037
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,167
Until this is

1038
00:53:59,423 --> 00:53:59,935
Cleared up

1039
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:02,751
And if you have a fundamental disagreement just feel like thank you very much

1040
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:05,311
I cannot talk to you cuz you believe in the devil

1041
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:08,127
Exactly

1042
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:14,783
What I do what I do when somebody says something like that is ice cream a barking like a dog

1043
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:17,599
Has like a political opposition

1044
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,391
To I

1045
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,439
International Solutions

1046
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,487
What's the problem

1047
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,535
Stat with its the devil

1048
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:27,327
Because it's more interesting

1049
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,375
Pokes his listeners emotional button

1050
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,399
Sproodle

1051
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,703
Anyway we move onto the 25th

1052
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:35,263
Because the interview is not really all that good

1053
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,823
It starts at the show saying something

1054
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:38,591
Anxieties

1055
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:39,615
Really fun

1056
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,639
Really silly

1057
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,671
Your

1058
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:55,487
No I'm sorry

1059
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:06,751
We are going to address

1060
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:19,039
World government

1061
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:26,719
Wait a couple years and see how much you talk about Hillary being

1062
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:33,119
Jesus man that is not relevant to his call Arizona family but this point becomes

1063
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,423
The only relevant issue

1064
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:41,823
The only thing that's ever been important she's been working with the devil since she was born outside in a dream prophetically in that

1065
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:42,847
That's why you can say

1066
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:45,407
F*** it you don't need to pay attention to Hillary Clin

1067
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:50,015
What was the first hour of this episode is Alex

1068
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:52,831
Yelling about how he's the one who really supports the troops

1069
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:54,111
And honestly

1070
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:55,391
I do

1071
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,951
Wanna split too many hairs about

1072
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:58,719
Because

1073
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,511
Most of the point that he's making

1074
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,279
Is

1075
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,839
And that is if you do support

1076
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:07,935
Troops you should not support sending them into an unjust War where people are going to

1077
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,215
To get killed

1078
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:11,775
To be in a situation where they could kill

1079
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:12,799
Civilians

1080
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:16,383
And have that on their conscience and that's not an arguable thing

1081
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,223
Support the troops

1082
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:23,295
Sport health care for veterans and

1083
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,343
You know like all the stuff yet

1084
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,879
Fine point

1085
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:28,159
Good job

1086
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:31,487
It's about the almost the whole first hour so here's a little tip

1087
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,263
America

1088
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:18,335
Holyshit man

1089
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:21,151
The left-right paradigm

1090
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:24,223
It really is a clear articulation of what

1091
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,503
He believes his politics

1092
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:29,599
To be in that is that the left is Super Evil Superbad

1093
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,647
And the conservatives are actually just

1094
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:33,439
The laughter pretending to be

1095
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,463
Exactly

1096
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,231
But they're the last

1097
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:39,071
Conceives of himself as just like being

1098
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:39,839
Conservative

1099
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,607
When he's

1100
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:42,399
Extremely far to the right

1101
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:45,215
Alright the problem with the neocon says that their

1102
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:47,007
Democrats are the problem

1103
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:49,311
So it doesn't matter what you call yourself

1104
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,847
Anybody I do like as a Democrat

1105
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:56,735
Yeah it's problem with the left and the right isn't that like they each have problems

1106
00:57:57,247 --> 00:58:01,087
Hey things that there are like okay this is where you're wrong here a little bit

1107
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,927
It's vert the same thing and they're all to the left of him

1108
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,463
Yeah that's what it is

1109
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:10,303
I'm so far right everything is to the left of me

1110
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:15,679
Able to trick people into thinking that he's Above This sort of thought of me

1111
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:20,799
He's able to trick people into thinking he's sensible because he has sensible positions like this

1112
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:21,823
Supporting the troops

1113
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,103
Doesn't mean

1114
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,151
Supporting them being used to

1115
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:26,431
I have this

1116
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,455
Nonsense War

1117
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:29,247
And also I think he's a

1118
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,527
Hipa blowhard

1119
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:33,087
I get a tear in my eye

1120
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,647
Play The Star-Spangled Banner and I cried

1121
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:37,183
F*** off

1122
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,207
Ridiculous

1123
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:39,487
Imagine

1124
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:40,511
Trying things up

1125
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,535
Pledge of Allegiance

1126
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,327
Hasn't it

1127
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:45,631
Dealt single-tier

1128
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:48,959
Let me pledge allegiance to this thing destroying me

1129
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:51,519
Christ I only think that that could happen

1130
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:52,799
If it was the

1131
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:54,847
Culmination of like a really

1132
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:55,871
Traumatic

1133
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:56,639
Experience

1134
00:58:56,895 --> 00:59:00,991
Movie kind of experience

1135
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:01,759
Independence Day

1136
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:06,111
The movie the movie independent at the end we say the Pledge of Allegiance

1137
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:12,511
Attack of the

1138
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:13,535
Coleman is just giving

1139
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:17,119
When is Big Air this is the Independence Day for the world speech

1140
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:23,519
Then we got a we got the dude flying up into the thing the whole thing explodes and then Bill Pullman leads you in the pledge of

1141
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,543
Allegiance tear

1142
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,567
Tear

1143
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:31,967
I get it in those circumstances that's open

1144
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:38,367
I got it did Jeff Goldblum survive

1145
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,903
Sequel

1146
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,695
Status imbalance

1147
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,463
Will Smith

1148
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,231
Did not

1149
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,791
What about

1150
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,327
The movie

1151
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,655
We get to mi amor Harry Potter

1152
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,471
A call from a guy is like a man

1153
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:55,519
What if

1154
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:56,799
The release

1155
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,335
Release of Harry Potter is Justin

1156
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,103
Distraction

1157
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:01,151
Alex says

1158
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,175
No okay

1159
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:03,711
John Deere on the air

1160
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:06,783
Yes is the Harry Potter rollout on

1161
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:07,551
Somerset

1162
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:08,831
The time to divide

1163
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,367
Confirm Bohemian Grove

1164
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:17,535
Don't know

1165
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:21,119
Fact

1166
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,983
Christianity

1167
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,775
Winter or summer

1168
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:32,639
Basically what this is all about

1169
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:38,527
Alright

1170
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,295
Okay

1171
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:43,135
So which is do the exact same thing this Christians do but which

1172
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:46,975
Is there a called Christians are in a call. Cuz we're right about things

1173
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:47,743
Because God is real

1174
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:48,767
He gives us

1175
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:49,535
The powers

1176
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:52,607
To banish demons control Magic

1177
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:02,847
What sort of Christian book are you talking about

1178
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:08,479
Later sold the Christian book stores that are like persuasive or like Bible study

1179
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,247
Kind of book

1180
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,783
There's a book in its

1181
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,319
Just about a character who happen

1182
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,599
Since to be Christian I don't

1183
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:14,367
Think it

1184
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,903
It wouldn't necessarily be a

1185
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,183
Persuasive book

1186
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:19,487
Towards like a vengeful eisinger

1187
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:23,327
In the same way that Harry Potter isn't trying to get you into witchcraft it's just

1188
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,607
A child

1189
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:27,423
Who goes to a school cuz he's a f****** wizard right

1190
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:30,239
But isn't he kind of implying that

1191
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,287
A book written by a Christian

1192
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,359
Similar to Harry Potter

1193
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:39,711
Would specifically have the unspoken

1194
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:46,367
You should join Christianity element to it a Harry Potter 2

1195
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:47,903
Because

1196
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,695
It only makes sense for him if

1197
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:50,975
That's the case for Christian

1198
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:54,303
I mean if possible but I think

1199
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,071
One of the other thing

1200
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,607
There's an undercurrent that a Galaxy

1201
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:57,375
Does lamenting

1202
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,935
And that is that if this book was

1203
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:01,471
Is about a child

1204
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:03,519
Like Harry Potter

1205
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:09,407
Who is destined to go to a monastery

1206
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,711
It wouldn't be as cool

1207
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:18,111
Is Harry Potter like freaking out about like oh my God

1208
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:22,463
God I love this book where the kid becomes a bucket

1209
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:26,559
What is Umberto Echo Road

1210
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:29,375
Christian iconography

1211
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,143
Interest

1212
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:37,311
I think it would think it would it would have a tougher time catching on not because of an aversion to Christianity in pop culture

1213
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,335
Just because

1214
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:43,967
That's not it being a monk isn't as cool to care Trail as being a wizard because there's

1215
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:44,735
True

1216
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:49,087
And semiotic professors don't necessarily relate to the the children

1217
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,111
Trends

1218
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:50,879
These days

1219
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:53,183
So are the same color

1220
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:54,207
In like a man

1221
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,487
Hey man

1222
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:58,559
Then we're going to the Grove this year he's going to go check out the Grove

1223
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,375
Alex's note

1224
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,959
Amen this color brick

1225
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:07,007
Break some important news.

1226
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,567
Am I going to go out there with video this year

1227
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:12,639
3 years ago

1228
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:17,503
I don't know

1229
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:22,111
I gave copies of that tape

1230
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:24,671
4911 type to Ralph Nader and

1231
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:25,951
Congressman John.

1232
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:27,231
Lincoln Republican

1233
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:30,047
Professor

1234
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:31,839
RFK

1235
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:32,607
Junior

1236
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:34,911
Sodus Point

1237
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:39,775
Wait you know Ralph Nader it does seem like he is like hey Ralph

1238
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:46,175
Send him a little text message I got this thing to get you

1239
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,039
Pretty impressed

1240
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:56,671
Wait wait till you heard back from telling me that Ralph Nader

1241
01:03:57,439 --> 01:04:00,255
Sent you a message saying like what

1242
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,791
Cat really did find something

1243
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,607
Yeah yeah they got together

1244
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:11,519
Videos pretty good

1245
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:13,055
Listcawler

1246
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,591
So this is a big deal

1247
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:15,359
Wait a second

1248
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:22,271
Is this where RFK Jr goes crazy

1249
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:26,111
You never know it could be a nuisance

1250
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,743
Yeah they sent after

1251
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,535
After they watch it

1252
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,303
They seem to try

1253
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,071
Answer

1254
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:37,631
Attitude on television at night

1255
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:39,423
Coincidence maybe they never watched

1256
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:42,751
From the

1257
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,055
Green Party

1258
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,591
Guardian is now currently running

1259
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,359
Republican

1260
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:49,663
Presidential nominee

1261
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:50,687
Converse on feet

1262
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:51,711
Man really hard

1263
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:52,991
That's disappointing

1264
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:59,391
He just like mailed them the videos I never heard back

1265
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:05,791
TV the next couple weeks ago and he's like well clearly Mater about me

1266
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,583
This is definitely not

1267
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,119
Talking to the TV

1268
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:10,911
No

1269
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,215
Hahaha

1270
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:15,263
I am Darrell Slater did not run

1271
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:18,335
Republic dependent for the

1272
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,615
2004 election

1273
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:25,503
Arabic part of that was sorta like they weren't far enough for Ralph Nader

1274
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,551
It was an electoral strategy

1275
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:32,927
Yeah I wasn't it wasn't so much that Alex Jones is

1276
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:35,231
His video blew his mind that he left the Green Party

1277
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,839
Oh man Ralph Nader

1278
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:42,655
Leaving the green party because of

1279
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:44,447
Fahrenheit 9/11

1280
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:47,775
I think it's really fun the way that

1281
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:52,383
Alex responded to that caller because there was a moment where he thought like

1282
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:56,223
Oh you know Ralph Nader I need a really did like my dad

1283
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:59,295
So disappointed

1284
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,575
Oh man

1285
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,111
Certain point

1286
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,391
He's got to learn not to get his hopes

1287
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:08,255
Yeah that's a terrible idea I don't take any of these colors seriously

1288
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:12,607
11 * 99% of callers to most shows

1289
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:15,935
Don't really have any information and 1%

1290
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:17,215
They really are on it

1291
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:20,031
800% of Infowars collars

1292
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:23,615
Are going to lie to you about knowing whether or not the TV is speaking to

1293
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:25,919
Interesting Lee 99% of Alex

1294
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:26,687
Scholars have

1295
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:32,063
Career in intelligence

1296
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:35,647
So we talked to unreason 2003 episode about Alex

1297
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:37,439
2 conspiracy about UNESCO wanted

1298
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:39,743
Destroy the family and how that's bulshit

1299
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:18,399
Doesn't work

1300
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:21,215
We are

1301
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:28,127
Yasso Alex's belief

1302
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:29,663
In families

1303
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,431
Systems

1304
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:31,711
Being

1305
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:34,783
Heteronormative and one man one woman

1306
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:36,063
Right is not it

1307
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,855
It's it it's not based on

1308
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:38,879
Something that

1309
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,647
Changeable

1310
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:43,743
It's based on his belief that God genetically engineered

1311
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,023
Humans to be that

1312
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:47,583
Yes only system that works

1313
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,911
And to do otherwise

1314
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,447
Is an affront to God

1315
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:55,519
Because God could not have thought ahead

1316
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:57,055
And saw people not acting

1317
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:58,335
The way you want

1318
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,359
Right

1319
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:03,199
Crazy so what you could do is you could I don't know

1320
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:05,503
Statistics about two-parent households

1321
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:08,575
Swear you know it's a woman in a woman or man in a man

1322
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:15,743
And they would show obviously that you're four to five times more likely to be

1323
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:17,535
You could find that that's not

1324
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:20,095
Uppercase relative

1325
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,399
Similarities

1326
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:25,471
And household

1327
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:29,055
And it wouldn't matter to Alex you could have any statistic you want because that's just

1328
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:30,079
Statistic has nothing

1329
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:31,103
Things to do with disproving

1330
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,151
The god genetically made us

1331
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:36,223
Statistic

1332
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,551
It's

1333
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:43,647
Can never really actually be had no but Alex will throw things in like

1334
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:46,463
Four to five times more likely to end up in prison

1335
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:49,535
If you don't have a man in the in the home

1336
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:50,815
What am I to Matt

1337
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:54,655
You know here's what's fun

1338
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:55,935
Here's what's fun about the

1339
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:04,383
Have you ever noticed how the answer ultimately will always be because God said

1340
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:09,247
And yet somehow there are so many things that they also want to

1341
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,271
To say on top of

1342
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:13,343
But you know if your ultimate answer is cuz God said so

1343
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:15,647
Why are you telling me that there are statistics

1344
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:18,975
6 to back it out cuz you don't want to start with that cuz if you sound like a

1345
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:21,023
Crazy religious zealot you got it right

1346
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,327
Washington Post

1347
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:26,655
Apparently has an article about how they're going to the Bible

1348
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:29,983
Okay did you hear about that the Washington Post

1349
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:34,079
Victor

1350
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:34,847
Sure

1351
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:02,239
Doing the Pharisees calling for the death of Christ

1352
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,063
Oh wow

1353
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:19,135
How to switch that around I assumed that the ban would be on the Ulta

1354
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:23,487
The Passion of the Christ wouldn't actually come out until then

1355
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:28,351
NextGear buttocks Point many advocacy groups like The able been given copies of the script

1356
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:29,631
They were little bit

1357
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,911
Concerned with the waves

1358
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:31,935
This story was being tall

1359
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:34,751
One thing Mel Gibson was taking a Greek

1360
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:36,287
Review of artistic license

1361
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:42,431
Seemingly I mostly anyways the painted Jews as being evil and bloodthirsty

1362
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:43,967
Given Gibbs

1363
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:45,247
Subscript Behavior I would

1364
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:46,271
Say it's probably

1365
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:47,807
Also I do

1366
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:52,415
Realize this until I was checking in on the passions release date but they're actually making a sequel

1367
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,207
That's due to be released next year

1368
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,743
Wait

1369
01:10:55,999 --> 01:11:01,375
Yes it's 2022

1370
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:05,215
Oh I was going to say I was like you can't breathe passion that Christ

1371
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:08,799
I don't know it's the next sort of story within that

1372
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:11,615
Millier

1373
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:16,735
This is going to be a huge mess I think I considering that Jim Caviezel is that the play Jesus

1374
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:19,039
In the years since the first one he's gone

1375
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:22,623
Wheatley and saying and is now a big qanon guy

1376
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:25,951
Risen beyond what even Jesus could have hoped

1377
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:32,351
He's particularly big on promoting adrenochrome related conspiracies which of course are really just a modern-day rehashing of the

1378
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,119
Blood libel

1379
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:34,399
I do not look

1380
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:40,287
Look forward to this movie coming out because whatever accusations that horrible

1381
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,567
You can't imagine how

1382
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:43,615
Amplified they're going to be

1383
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:44,383
F******

1384
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,151
While

1385
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:47,199
Yes we are going to make

1386
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:48,223
A movie

1387
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:49,247
About the most

1388
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:50,271
Famous Jew

1389
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,295
Of all time

1390
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,319
To make

1391
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:53,599
Sure everyone hates

1392
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:54,367
It's the Jews

1393
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:59,487
I think there's even just a fundamentally offense

1394
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:02,559
Something about like Jim Caviezel playing Jesus again

1395
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:10,239
The fact that

1396
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,775
But active promoter

1397
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:13,823
Avanti's American Spirit theories

1398
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,359
It seems

1399
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:17,151
Yeah

1400
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:20,991
I mean birthday but even then Mel Gibson was part of his

1401
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:24,831
I'm sure he was part of his dad's church at this point in time and they were

1402
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:25,855
Violently

1403
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:27,391
Anti-Semitic

1404
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:32,767
It's not like anti-Semitism has caused a problem in for his career

1405
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,303
Yep

1406
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:38,911
I'm not looking forward to the movie coming out

1407
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,447
No good time

1408
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:42,239
I also think that in 2000

1409
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:44,031
Forward that movie came out we weren't

1410
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:44,799
Nearly as

1411
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:48,639
Crazy as a society as we are now right right all right

1412
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:49,663
That could

1413
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:50,687
Really do some

1414
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:55,295
Public damage

1415
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:56,319
Really hope not

1416
01:12:56,575 --> 01:13:02,719
Yeah I hope so I hope not too but

1417
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:04,767
This is cool I mean we got to get

1418
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:07,071
Deceive it children's

1419
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:12,447
We need children killing the people who hate this movie

1420
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:14,495
As I recall

1421
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:16,031
I was in college at

1422
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:16,799
The time

1423
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:19,871
And my dad I was a religious studies professor

1424
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:22,431
A third of the letter to the editor

1425
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,455
To the local

1426
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:26,015
Wallpaper About the Passion of the Christ.

1427
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:30,623
I remember walking

1428
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:33,951
On-campus one day in The Preacher Brother Jed

1429
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:38,303
Who was like this campus preachers

1430
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,071
Yeah

1431
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,607
He I remember Waka

1432
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:43,423
Walking by and hearing him yelling about my dad

1433
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:49,823
That's hilarious that are really funny

1434
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:51,103
There's like whoa

1435
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:55,967
I think it's worthwhile getting angry over iMovie

1436
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:56,735
Yeah yeah

1437
01:13:57,247 --> 01:14:02,111
Especially especially a movie that by your own book should be considered insanely blasphemy

1438
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,135
I didn't

1439
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:04,927
I didn't have enough awareness of

1440
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:07,999
I'd like what campus preachers were kind of like at that point

1441
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:10,047
And so I waited until he stopped yelling

1442
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:12,607
And II went over like a you know that's my

1443
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:14,655
My dad and I please just

1444
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:19,007
Stop yelling. It about by my family and then

1445
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:20,543
Who did a little bit of a Beat

1446
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:22,847
And then he called me a seed of Satan

1447
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:24,383
And started screaming

1448
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:32,831
I want to love it

1449
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:33,855
That's good stuff

1450
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:36,927
Another call here

1451
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:37,951
On this episode

1452
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,743
First hour is just like hey

1453
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:40,511
Supporting the troops

1454
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:44,351
Me and got it

1455
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:46,655
And this one guy

1456
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:49,215
He is calling him to tell Alex

1457
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:52,799
That he has had been pulled over a couple times

1458
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,847
And this last time

1459
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:56,127
The police wanted to search his

1460
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:59,967
His car right and he said yeah sure go ahead

1461
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:01,247
Alex says that too

1462
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:03,295
But also turns out that they didn't

1463
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,063
End up searching

1464
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:07,135
Scar

1465
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,927
When telling it it's very boring story

1466
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:10,207
Don't know what

1467
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:13,791
As part of a conspiracy New York

1468
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,887
It's about squeezing us

1469
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:29,151
3 * 1

1470
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,527
I did and they said

1471
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:35,295
Alexa

1472
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:36,063
Coincidental

1473
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:43,999
Yeah it's

1474
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,815
Contract work

1475
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:58,079
Okay

1476
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:59,359
Good thinking

1477
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:04,735
How do you get to be that Psychopathic like confident you know just like

1478
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:09,087
Oh you know what that sounds to me like they're doing the regular old thing they do

1479
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:12,159
Somebody gave the call down to harass

1480
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:14,719
Sure

1481
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:15,487
Bye

1482
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,255
Natsu

1483
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,279
Searching your car

1484
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:19,839
I when they ask you to give them consent

1485
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:20,607
2

1486
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:21,887
Weird

1487
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:22,911
Yeah yep

1488
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:24,191
This is so stupid

1489
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:29,823
Wow so you're white without saying your way I gave them consent to search my car and they didn't

1490
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:33,407
I do I do think that there's something really toxic

1491
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:37,503
About this interactive kind of interaction with his listeners

1492
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,295
Use Alex as a credible

1493
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:41,087
Conservative person

1494
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:47,743
Story of Metallica's responsibility

1495
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:52,095
A call came down and probably just trying to harass you for the foia request

1496
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:56,191
I just think it's unhealthy people down a bad path

1497
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:58,495
Yeah yeah that's it is like

1498
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:01,055
You're calling in

1499
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,079
4

1500
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:03,103
You know

1501
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:04,383
You could get two things

1502
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,919
When you call in you know you

1503
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:07,199
You can get one or the other

1504
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,223
You can get

1505
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:09,247
Confirmation

1506
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,527
Or you can get

1507
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:12,575
And

1508
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:15,135
They're you know Alex is always for confirmation

1509
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:16,671
Just at like

1510
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:21,279
Hey I think they're I think the government out to get me and kill me and at the end my entire

1511
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:23,071
And Alex could just be like

1512
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:28,447
You know what I am going to conspiracy guy and guess what I can tell you this one time

1513
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:29,983
You're totally fine

1514
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,007
Totally safe

1515
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:35,615
Person in the history of the world has no idea who you are

1516
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,407
Play-Doh trailer

1517
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:38,431
You're totally right

1518
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:41,503
You're going to be murdered anytime go into the forest by myself

1519
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:44,831
And the evidence of this is something that could easily be a quince

1520
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:46,111
Absolutely

1521
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:51,999
It's a Hallmark of this. Of time

1522
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:54,047
For Alex on his show

1523
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,327
He's that he

1524
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:58,143
Is obsessed with the idea that nyoka

1525
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,167
Conservatism

1526
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:01,471
Has its roots in Strauss

1527
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,263
Straussian thought

1528
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:09,663
Right he talks about this article that headline is neoconservatives dance ostrowski in

1529
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:11,455
Right like you talked about this

1530
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:12,223
Is all the f***

1531
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:13,503
Right

1532
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:14,783
EXO discolor

1533
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:15,551
Call Zack

1534
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,599
Let's talk about Irving Chris

1535
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,391
Right Bill crystals dad

1536
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:22,463
One of the leading thinkers in the nyoka

1537
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:23,487
Conservatism

1538
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:24,511
World

1539
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:25,535
A.m.

1540
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:28,095
Listen carefully to this clip

1541
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:29,631
Because I think this is clip

1542
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:31,167
Clearly reveals

1543
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:36,799
To people who don't know anything about what they're talking about but don't want to let the other one know

1544
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:38,079
They do real

1545
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:41,151
.

1546
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:42,687
The most prolific

1547
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:44,735
Neoconservative

1548
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:45,759
Reserving

1549
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:50,367
And when you

1550
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:53,439
You are not alluding to Leo Strauss

1551
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:57,279
No

1552
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:58,047
Okay

1553
01:18:58,303 --> 01:18:59,839
You know anything about Leo Strauss

1554
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:03,423
Familiar

1555
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:08,287
If you want a really fun

1556
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:10,591
For the weekend

1557
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:15,455
Information

1558
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:17,759
Political Theory

1559
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:18,783
Because this

1560
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:21,343
You're talking about

1561
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:23,647
Trout

1562
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:26,463
University of Chicago

1563
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:35,935
That is a damning conversation

1564
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:40,799
Wow Irvin Crystal a father bill kristol is one of the big figures in the oak

1565
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:41,567
Conservatism

1566
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:44,895
He's also someone who had straussian leanings earlier in his life

1567
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:48,735
When people talk about Strauss their 100%

1568
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:51,295
Across-the-board talkin about Leo Strauss

1569
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:53,343
So Alex saying he's not

1570
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,367
Is ridiculous

1571
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:59,999
That is a clear indication that he knows the word straussian but he doesn't know what he's talking about

1572
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,023
I

1573
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,559
Assume

1574
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:04,607
I assume Alex think

1575
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:05,631
Neocon

1576
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,655
Play the violin

1577
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,703
Well I'm guessing that's it

1578
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:15,104
Also straps did teach at the University of Chicago and he's very much associated with that school so this caller is off base

1579
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,128
He's even talking

1580
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:20,224
The confusion I think is based on the fact that there's also an economic philosophy

1581
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,016
Be called The Chicago School of economic

1582
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:24,320
Backspace on the work of people like Milton Friedman

1583
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:26,368
This is a term that is used mostly

1584
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:27,392
Describe economics

1585
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:32,256
Professors at the University of Chicago which isn't necessarily related to the scholarship with Leo Strauss

1586
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,792
Who taught political science at

1587
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:34,560
The same universe

1588
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:41,472
Because this collar and Alex don't really know what they're talking about it's impossible for them to disambiguation these terms

1589
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:43,776
They're basically just talking at each other

1590
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,056
And it's really

1591
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:46,080
It's really strange

1592
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,872
Did they really telling

1593
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:48,896
Damning things

1594
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,432
Are the collar saying

1595
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:52,736
You're talking you're not talking about Leo Strauss

1596
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:54,016
And Alex says no

1597
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:55,040
He is

1598
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:57,344
The fact that he doesn't know that

1599
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:03,232
Write is a problem and then says do you know anything about Leo Strauss not enough

1600
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,256
That's right

1601
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:05,280
No no

1602
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:07,072
Absolutely not

1603
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:11,680
So much if he knows nothing about anything I comment on I know nothing about

1604
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:12,448
So

1605
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:15,776
It really is a fascinating glimpse

1606
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,824
M2 how

1607
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:19,104
Corley he grass

1608
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:21,152
The basis of this subject

1609
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:23,200
Jack's yeah he's big conspiracy

1610
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:24,736
About the nyoka

1611
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:26,784
Conservatives is that they're all secretly

1612
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:33,184
Democrats and liberals based on this straussian ideology

1613
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:36,256
Nope his basis for attacking nyoka

1614
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,024
Conservatives

1615
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:37,792
Is

1616
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,072
Nothing

1617
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:40,864
Here's a house built on sand

1618
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,424
Essentially Whitney he's trying to

1619
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,192
To talk about

1620
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:45,216
Always

1621
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:46,752
Interested when

1622
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:48,800
Alex instinctively knows

1623
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:51,104
He's in weird territory

1624
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,384
For him you know like

1625
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:54,432
More than willing to talk s***

1626
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:57,504
For forever but if he gets something where he's like

1627
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:58,784
I know

1628
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:00,576
I'm supposed to know this

1629
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,624
And I know I do

1630
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:05,440
So I'm going to try and let you I'm going to try

1631
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:09,024
Tease out what it is I'm supposed to know from you

1632
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:09,792
And then I can

1633
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:10,560
Compare it back

1634
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:13,376
Back to you so you think I know what I was talking about from the

1635
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,936
I can let you

1636
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:22,336
Or I talked for a while I'll find something and accurate that you say Alachua to that invalidate your point

1637
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:23,616
Family conversation

1638
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:27,968
Yeah yeah there is also a dynamic as it play here

1639
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:28,992
That is

1640
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:31,040
Unique to whenever he's on the phone with

1641
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:34,368
Somebody I think of the other pretty good

1642
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,392
Radar

1643
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:37,696
In terms of like if someone's going to be a problem

1644
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:41,536
Like if they have information that could be a problem

1645
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:46,912
And that is what you see there early

1646
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:51,008
Is it color talks more it'll reveal

1647
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:53,568
The depth to which I don't know any of this

1648
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,616
And yeah that's just

1649
01:22:55,872 --> 01:23:00,224
That's good it's good Instinct on his bar

1650
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:02,016
Quite well

1651
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:02,784
Oh man

1652
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:04,320
Alex just being like

1653
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:08,928
I know some things but not enough to talk

1654
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:09,696
Talk about it

1655
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:11,488
Could not be more of

1656
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:12,256
8 l

1657
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:14,048
It could not mean

1658
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,072
Anything

1659
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:16,096
More

1660
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:17,376
Yep then I have

1661
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:18,144
Have no fur

1662
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:26,080
So the Washington post about banning the Bible apparently that was really just an article

1663
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:27,616
About Mel Gibson

1664
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,408
The Christ being

1665
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:33,248
Daisy you are but they're going to be in the Bible next you don't like that movie

1666
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:34,528
You have to be in the Bible

1667
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:38,880
And Alex's defensive that is an article that he read in the BBC

1668
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,416
From a year before

1669
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:43,488
British broadcast

1670
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:56,544
Germany

1671
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:58,592
And other

1672
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:16,256
Anti-racism framework is being discussed by the EU in 2000

1673
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:19,840
Listen to one guy named Lord Scott a pint of that

1674
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:22,912
The framework would outlaw the Old Testament as well as the very

1675
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:25,216
What I'm going to call Ava

1676
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:25,984
Time

1677
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:31,104
Series of Adventure novels Bagels

1678
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:38,016
Somebody says there's something wrong with Tintin I have no idea what they're talking about

1679
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:42,368
It's fun to just say that he didn't like German

1680
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,136
Krowd

1681
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,928
Yeah that's

1682
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:47,488
The problem

1683
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:49,024
2021 end all this

1684
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:50,304
Still very much

1685
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:52,864
The stuff happened

1686
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:56,704
I mean it would be it would be interesting if

1687
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,984
If somebody was like hey

1688
01:24:58,496 --> 01:24:59,008
Alright

1689
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,544
We don't want any books

1690
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,312
In schools

1691
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:02,592
Or

1692
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:03,616
Is that that

1693
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,152
Promote genocide

1694
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,712
And then you're like okay well

1695
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:08,992
Canaan and they're like

1696
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:10,016
What I mean the Bible

1697
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,552
Of course

1698
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:15,136
Man fathered in

1699
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:16,672
So you eat you may notice

1700
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:19,488
Vapes like the ATL is complaining

1701
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:20,256
About

1702
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:22,816
Mel Gibson and Passion of the Christ

1703
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:23,584
And

1704
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:24,352
You know all this

1705
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:25,376
This is going to lead to

1706
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:26,656
Obviously the outlaw

1707
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:28,960
Christianity and so therefore

1708
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:33,056
The ADL is coming after the vet Bible slippery slope

1709
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,016
What is retinol

1710
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:45,344
Okay

1711
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,392
Gotham

1712
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:57,120
You heard from the EU government 39

1713
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:00,448
Women are manners

1714
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:14,528
Wow

1715
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:16,064
So yeah apparently

1716
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,112
Women can't wear dresses

1717
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:19,648
In TV shows

1718
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:20,416
Plays in

1719
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,440
And then stuff

1720
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:28,608
This. This is why they're so good at obstructing Prague

1721
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,680
It's because they don't even give a f*** if it's Act

1722
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:32,704
Actually progress

1723
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:33,984
If it's even like

1724
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:38,848
Imaginary thing that someone might do

1725
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:39,872
Cacophony of

1726
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,408
Howling screams

1727
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:43,968
Of whining is so loud

1728
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:45,760
That you can't even be like

1729
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:47,808
Gives a s*** about the

1730
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,368
Well it's like

1731
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:53,696
A lot of the petty Grievances and nonsense

1732
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:56,768
But Alex brings up it does remind me of

1733
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,840
Toll booth

1734
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:01,376
Yeah I'm terrible Trivium

1735
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:05,984
Milo move a pile of set a time

1736
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:08,288
Basically Alex's

1737
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:10,336
Does a lot of the time

1738
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:14,944
Each grain of sand do you have to move over as a distraction that's not really

1739
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,736
Based in any reality

1740
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:19,040
But somehow you are expected to clear it up

1741
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:24,160
Right and it's just a slow you down so you can't free rhyme and reason so if you want

1742
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:25,952
If you want gun control you're going to have to

1743
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:27,744
To start with proving to me that guns even

1744
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,024
Exist

1745
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:34,400
And that means that Steve pieczenik is the spelling bee

1746
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:39,008
Alright Infowars

1747
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:42,592
Okay Joel skousen

1748
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:43,872
The horrible din

1749
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:46,176
Okay okay was the conductor

1750
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,712
Who would like makeup

1751
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:54,112
The sunrise come up to my bracelet when you ask me for a name is the moment the name is gone forever

1752
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:56,672
You know like if I had if I could have

1753
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,744
Oh you know like the conductor 5-second

1754
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,328
Then you asked me the name and I'll never remember Alex's Milo

1755
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:08,704
Rodger stone is talk

1756
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:13,824
Alex Willow

1757
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,640
Cuz he's been on Infowars for so much longer

1758
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:17,664
Longer in

1759
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:18,432
Pass

1760
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:25,344
I think the Trump years was your day of the UB covid stuff is me at the doldrums

1761
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:28,416
No you are in the village

1762
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:33,536
Fantastic the Galaxy's board

1763
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:34,816
Probably true

1764
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:37,376
Who was

1765
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,680
This is going to bother me

1766
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:47,616
Regretting this strongly

1767
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:54,016
I short-circuited you was a cop who cares we got to go alright anyway there's no more clips

1768
01:28:57,344 --> 01:29:03,488
We've come to the end of this no wonder you were so willing to go on The Phantom Tollbooth Radford I don't like to talk about

1769
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:07,328
The rest of the episode is just Alex

1770
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:08,608
What's doing his news

1771
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:10,656
The end of the show which is Justin reading

1772
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:14,240
The same headlines he's already talked about

1773
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,520
It's quite boring

1774
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:17,568
So yeah I think

1775
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:20,384
I think that also lets not

1776
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,688
Levon sad that that

1777
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:23,968
Fitbit anti smell

1778
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,784
The idea that the ATL is going after the fire

1779
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:27,552
How could they

1780
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:30,880
How could the ATL go after a book that was written by

1781
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:34,208
The ATL I mean not all Jews are exactly the same

1782
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:36,256
Yeah and it's

1783
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:39,328
It's the it's the conception of this like their fur

1784
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:40,608
Pretending that there

1785
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:41,888
A adverb

1786
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:42,912
ABC organization

1787
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:45,216
5

1788
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:46,496
League

1789
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:48,544
But what they're really about is crushing

1790
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,104
In Christianity

1791
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,920
Some some narrative routes

1792
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:55,200
Tropes

1793
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:59,552
We get to the end of this and you know there's not there's not like a

1794
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:01,600
Kitano stuff that happens there's some interesting

1795
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:02,880
Sing things

1796
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:10,560
Trends that are important to point out things like the way Alex covers that Houston crime lab story is a disservice

1797
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:11,584
List of the reality of

1798
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,352
The story

1799
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:17,984
It's important to understand the ways that Alex is actually

1800
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:19,008
Actively

1801
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,032
Doing

1802
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:21,824
The opposite of help

1803
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:24,896
In cases like that in terms of the news

1804
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:29,248
He gives people a worse idea of what's going on then if they knew not

1805
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:30,016
Right

1806
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:31,552
And that sucks

1807
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:33,856
Leaving them in a more manipulator bulb

1808
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:43,072
Harry Potter is still going on Trevor still mad about that.

1809
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:45,120
To be tracing if you thousand three

1810
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:48,704
Is the Arnold Schwarzenegger gubernatorial run

1811
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,776
I promise you I'll come up with a pond with a really likes

1812
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:52,800
Specifics like

1813
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,384
If Harry Potter is leading you to become a witch

1814
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:59,712
What in Harry Potter is real and what's

1815
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:02,016
It's not like are giants real are centaurs

1816
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:08,416
Real like what what are we talking about believe the Giants are real because

1817
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,440
What is true

1818
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:12,768
Yeah he's written a couple of books

1819
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:15,072
What else

1820
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:17,376
I mean Nabi

1821
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:21,216
Pixies are Pixies real house-elves houses

1822
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:25,056
Will boy now we're getting into all the anti-semitic one

1823
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:27,872
Jordan

1824
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:35,808
But until then we are also on Twitter

1825
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:42,208
We're fighting that go to bed Jordan Becca on Monday set

1826
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:43,488
But until then

1827
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:46,560
Neo

1828
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:50,400
Holding

1829
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:56,032
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work
