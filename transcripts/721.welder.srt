1
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,340
Knowledge fight.

2
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,490
I am sweating knowledgebite.com.

3
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,514
It's time to pray.

4
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:23,566
I have great respect for knowledge.

5
00:00:23,638 --> 00:00:24,910
Bite Knowledge.

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,438
I'm sick of them posing as if there's the good guys.

7
00:00:27,524 --> 00:00:27,810
Chang.

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,240
We are the bad guys.

9
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,194
I love you.

10
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:00,202
Hey, everybody.

11
00:01:00,336 --> 00:01:00,838
Welcome back.

12
00:01:00,864 --> 00:01:01,754
Knowledge, right? I'm Dan.

13
00:01:01,802 --> 00:01:02,282
I'm Jordan.

14
00:01:02,306 --> 00:01:03,218
We're a couple of dudes.

15
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:07,586
I like to sit around worship with the altar of Celine and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

16
00:01:07,658 --> 00:01:09,530
Oh, indeed we are, Dan.

17
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,298
Jordan.

18
00:01:10,454 --> 00:01:12,394
Jordan, quick question for you.

19
00:01:12,432 --> 00:01:12,742
Yeah.

20
00:01:12,816 --> 00:01:19,834
What's your bright spot today, buddy? My bright spot today, Jordan, isn't actually a bright spot, but it's sort of a all right.

21
00:01:19,932 --> 00:01:20,580
Okay.

22
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,906
Boy, it's changing the rules of the game.

23
00:01:22,968 --> 00:01:25,862
It's right here it is fanta.

24
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:26,506
Oh, boy.

25
00:01:26,568 --> 00:01:27,082
I saw that.

26
00:01:27,096 --> 00:01:37,030
They have a flavor called hashtag what's the fanta? What the fanta? What the Fanta? You can't name a flavor with a hashtag.

27
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,062
I call foul.

28
00:01:39,146 --> 00:01:40,034
I just call foul.

29
00:01:40,082 --> 00:01:44,042
That might not actually be the name of it might be question mark, because it says find clues.

30
00:01:44,126 --> 00:01:44,690
Hashtag.

31
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,560
What the fantasy? Oh, my God.

32
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:54,530
I'm drawn to these curious flavors, as we talked about on the last episode, dreamland dream world Coke.

33
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,282
Yeah.

34
00:01:55,476 --> 00:02:06,338
Also got a number of messages for people who are like, hey, you got that space Coke? It's got to be at the store, right? I don't understand how you are dealer.

35
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:08,940
When did that happen? Not going to happen.

36
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,926
But, yeah, I'm drawn to these things.

37
00:02:11,988 --> 00:02:12,286
Sure.

38
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:17,930
And Fanta, you got, like, pineapple, orange, a lot of fruit flavors.

39
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:21,782
Only thing I know about Fanta is the commercial from the early winter.

40
00:02:21,926 --> 00:02:22,870
That's the only thing.

41
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,098
Yeah.

42
00:02:23,124 --> 00:02:27,334
I don't think I've ever had a Fanta despite the commercial asking me if I want one.

43
00:02:27,372 --> 00:02:27,938
Apparently.

44
00:02:28,034 --> 00:02:29,134
No, I do not.

45
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,350
It's fruit.

46
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:30,910
Yes.

47
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,390
Right.

48
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,234
All of them are fruit.

49
00:02:32,282 --> 00:02:32,566
Sure.

50
00:02:32,628 --> 00:02:36,074
So you're expecting fruit here? I think it's cotton candy.

51
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,942
You think it's cotton candy? I don't know.

52
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:41,554
You can't have that big of a heel turn.

53
00:02:41,652 --> 00:02:42,866
My fruit candy.

54
00:02:42,938 --> 00:02:46,500
That was not a fruit, I can tell you that for sure.

55
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,830
I think it's cotton candy.

56
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,234
What if it's cotton candy grapes? They taste like cotton candy and they're grapes.

57
00:02:53,282 --> 00:02:54,002
That's a fruit.

58
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:55,742
That would be an interesting technicality.

59
00:02:55,766 --> 00:02:57,650
That would be an interesting technicality.

60
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,102
All right.

61
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,470
I'll put that down just because that helps.

62
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:00,790
Okay.

63
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,070
That makes my guess a little bit more sensible.

64
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:04,606
Yeah.

65
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:05,774
I liked grapes.

66
00:03:05,882 --> 00:03:06,866
Candy grapes.

67
00:03:06,998 --> 00:03:07,726
Well done.

68
00:03:07,848 --> 00:03:09,240
Also, it's not good.

69
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,460
Well, poorly done job.

70
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,126
Get your shit together.

71
00:03:13,188 --> 00:03:21,650
What's your bright spot? I didn't even want to necessarily tell you, but it begins with the T and ends with Serena.

72
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,726
Well, I mean, that was a beautiful moment.

73
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:35,938
I was going to give you a pass because of a monumental it was emotionally effective for Serena Williams to retire such a good match.

74
00:03:36,024 --> 00:03:37,210
One of the greats.

75
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,074
Not one of the greats.

76
00:03:39,182 --> 00:03:40,270
The greatest.

77
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,014
I don't know enough about tenants to say, and I'm fully willing to agree with you.

78
00:03:47,052 --> 00:03:47,722
Yeah.

79
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,954
I just think it's as someone who knows nothing about the sport.

80
00:03:51,062 --> 00:03:54,634
Definitely saves one of the top players of all time.

81
00:03:54,672 --> 00:03:55,786
Yes, for sure.

82
00:03:55,968 --> 00:03:57,026
You are an expert.

83
00:03:57,098 --> 00:04:04,402
You do not need to wait into the end game argument of like, oh, is it Pippin? Or yes, I get you.

84
00:04:04,596 --> 00:04:09,310
I just have feelings about Pete Sappers from my youth.

85
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,134
What feelings? Memories.

86
00:04:12,242 --> 00:04:14,122
I have memories, actually.

87
00:04:14,316 --> 00:04:18,838
As a man with substantial arm hair, I imagine that you do have a lot to go on.

88
00:04:18,864 --> 00:04:19,440
Sure.

89
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,682
Robin Williams, one of the great tennis cherries.

90
00:04:22,826 --> 00:04:23,520
Absolutely.

91
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:28,934
Why didn't he make a biopic? All it takes to be good at tennis is arm hair.

92
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:29,830
Patley.

93
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:31,970
Robin Williams.

94
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,026
Sampras Adams.

95
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:36,482
I like that McEnroe.

96
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:39,070
Yeah, he's still around.

97
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,470
You know what he narrates a TV show.

98
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,062
Does he yell a bunch? No, it's just like a regular narration.

99
00:04:45,146 --> 00:04:50,174
That is John McEnroe with no, it's never even addressed.

100
00:04:50,222 --> 00:04:53,018
They're never like, hey, by the way, it's John McEnroe.

101
00:04:53,054 --> 00:04:53,870
That is narrating.

102
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,314
Supposed to be a guy who yells things that he's known for.

103
00:04:56,352 --> 00:04:56,770
Exactly.

104
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,718
That's his job.

105
00:04:57,804 --> 00:04:59,230
But whatever, you know, it's crazy.

106
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,300
What that House of Pain song? Jump around.

107
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,906
It references John McEnroe.

108
00:05:05,978 --> 00:05:06,286
Wow.

109
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,294
That's not crazy.

110
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:08,174
John Mcenrow.

111
00:05:08,222 --> 00:05:14,494
What's the biggest thing in the world for a very short period of time? I'm saying that time.

112
00:05:14,592 --> 00:05:15,226
Oh, yeah.

113
00:05:15,288 --> 00:05:16,450
That was a long time ago.

114
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,422
That was a long time ago.

115
00:05:17,436 --> 00:05:19,142
Anyway, I'm sorry, I've hijacked your bright spot.

116
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,758
No, my bright spot is the US Open.

117
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:21,262
It's great.

118
00:05:21,336 --> 00:05:21,982
Oh, yeah.

119
00:05:22,116 --> 00:05:22,598
Fantastic.

120
00:05:22,634 --> 00:05:26,830
How's it going? I really think this is one of the best ones I've seen in a long, long time.

121
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,970
Like top to bottom.

122
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,602
Everybody is good.

123
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:33,010
Is that young kid you like doing well? Caress? Yeah.

124
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,838
He's headed to the quarterfinals.

125
00:05:34,874 --> 00:05:35,686
My man.

126
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:36,814
He's crushing it.

127
00:05:36,852 --> 00:05:38,770
Rafa, of course, is crushing it.

128
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,886
Is the US Open taking place in San Francisco? Around the Bay.

129
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:44,614
It is not.

130
00:05:44,652 --> 00:05:46,514
Alcarez isn't going down the trail.

131
00:05:46,682 --> 00:05:48,002
No, he's not dead.

132
00:05:48,086 --> 00:05:51,046
I already saw that coming from a mile away.

133
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:51,598
Yeah.

134
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:55,260
Or if it's San Francisco from 1400 miles away.

135
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:03,780
Where are they at in terms of the no, I mean, like in terms of the final.

136
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:14,202
So before the fourth round is the quarter finals, and then so the fourth round is the round of 16.

137
00:06:14,346 --> 00:06:14,726
Okay.

138
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:22,430
The round right before the quarterfinal tonight is probably going to be the best match of the entire tournament.

139
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:29,130
Curiosity versus Med Vedev curios crushing it for the first time of Russia.

140
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,358
No, different Karaos, different med badevs.

141
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:32,980
Okay.

142
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,074
But yeah, it's going to be a great one.

143
00:06:36,112 --> 00:06:39,218
I would love it if just to fuck with you.

144
00:06:39,244 --> 00:06:43,960
The US Open was still at like three in the morning.

145
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,230
That would be great.

146
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:45,566
Awesome.

147
00:06:45,628 --> 00:06:46,286
That would be great.

148
00:06:46,348 --> 00:06:47,750
Same time as the French.

149
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,086
All tennis is set up at exactly the same time.

150
00:06:51,148 --> 00:06:52,250
They are the French open.

151
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:57,160
I just have a number of memories of you being like, I'm going to be up all night.

152
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,290
I woke up at 03:00 a.m.

153
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,354
So I could be up until 04:00 a.m.

154
00:07:02,392 --> 00:07:03,266
Tomorrow night.

155
00:07:03,328 --> 00:07:06,170
In order to watch this at a bar, I have to go to the airport.

156
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,066
That's true.

157
00:07:08,248 --> 00:07:11,178
I just assume that that's what it's like to be satisfied.

158
00:07:11,274 --> 00:07:12,700
You're always watching.

159
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,282
02:00 am.

160
00:07:14,356 --> 00:07:15,902
Illegal streams help.

161
00:07:16,096 --> 00:07:17,320
I could do that.

162
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:25,730
I feel like a number of wrestling fans have the same sort of thing with, like, Japanese promotions, pay per views and stuff.

163
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,190
You got to make sacrifices to love something, I guess.

164
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,682
I guess.

165
00:07:28,756 --> 00:07:29,246
Yeah.

166
00:07:29,368 --> 00:07:33,546
So, Jordan, today we're going to be talking about a present day episode.

167
00:07:33,618 --> 00:07:34,322
Okay.

168
00:07:34,516 --> 00:07:37,394
We're checking back in because the bat signal went up.

169
00:07:37,492 --> 00:07:40,710
Something very important happened that Biden gave that speech.

170
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,798
What speech? I heard people talking about a speech that Biden gave.

171
00:07:44,944 --> 00:07:46,302
I can't tell if you're joking.

172
00:07:46,386 --> 00:07:50,200
No, I mean, I know about the speech, but it's like I just don't understand.

173
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,142
Okay, never mind.

174
00:07:56,216 --> 00:07:57,306
Yeah, that was it.

175
00:07:57,368 --> 00:07:59,900
I really thought that there was a box.

176
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:20,810
It looks no, actually, we can get into a little bit now and we'll get into more during the episode and such, but I think that the speech is either going to be historically incredibly relevant or not, but an attempt to be very historically relevant, that's tough.

177
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:21,250
Yeah.

178
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:30,240
I'm not sure exactly how the ball is going to break at this point, but he gave a speech that was essentially like, hey, look, here's the situation.

179
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:36,900
Trump and the people who are following him, these MAGA folks are a mess.

180
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,882
They don't care about democracy.

181
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:39,250
Right.

182
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:47,280
And they're a very serious threat to democracy as we are experiencing it now, and the stability of the country.

183
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:54,794
US normal folk, Democrats, Independents, Republicans who aren't into that nonsense.

184
00:08:54,842 --> 00:08:55,162
Right.

185
00:08:55,236 --> 00:08:59,940
We have a responsibility to do what we can to protect democracy now.

186
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:06,060
The future generations will look back at us being in the fight.

187
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:11,374
If we do our job, they will look at this point as an inflection point in history.

188
00:09:11,472 --> 00:09:12,120
Yeah.

189
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:21,002
There were a number of things that are, I would say, a little bit overdue in terms of recognition of, hey, look, this shit is nonsense.

190
00:09:21,026 --> 00:09:22,246
Fascism is bad.

191
00:09:22,368 --> 00:09:23,040
Right.

192
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,214
Previously, he had called semi fascist.

193
00:09:28,262 --> 00:09:28,860
Yeah.

194
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:38,542
So there is like, a little bit of a finally, some of these words are being uttered, right? At least out in the air.

195
00:09:38,616 --> 00:09:39,240
Right.

196
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:46,150
There is an aspect of, like, this might be too little, too late that is definitely present.

197
00:09:46,260 --> 00:10:12,562
And there's also an element of, like, what does this even really mean? Is this going to push any needles in any direction, or is this going to be something that has just a severe backlash? Who knows? In my humble opinion, the only reason that a president should give a speech is as cover for somebody to arrest, like, a thousand people at the same time.

198
00:10:12,636 --> 00:10:14,158
Right? Yeah.

199
00:10:14,244 --> 00:10:17,978
The meters all paying attention and then all of a sudden, in the middle of the speech.

200
00:10:18,014 --> 00:10:22,894
You start cutting to people being arrested, doing perp walks, like all the bankers are going.

201
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:25,058
The whole thing needs to be that speed.

202
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:30,060
Does the hypothetical president in this circumstance know that they're just a distraction? Oh, absolutely.

203
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,580
That's the whole game, man.

204
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,106
He's given a speech to say that these people are coming for democracy.

205
00:10:37,238 --> 00:10:40,078
Surprise, they're all in jail right now.

206
00:10:40,164 --> 00:10:42,770
How about that? Well, as we are that's a speech.

207
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,820
As we are a few days after this.

208
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,518
That didn't happen.

209
00:10:47,664 --> 00:10:51,000
Unfortunately, your movie fantasy did not happen.

210
00:10:54,850 --> 00:11:07,850
There's a part of me that is quite conflicted about how exciting to think giving voice to a lot of this stuff is, or how meaningful it is.

211
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:14,930
I would like to believe that this is indicative of something broader.

212
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:25,434
But honestly, there's another part of me that is, like, this is probably impotent in its direction.

213
00:11:25,482 --> 00:11:26,318
Lists, even.

214
00:11:26,404 --> 00:11:45,386
Well, I mean, you have to ask yourself no, I think the entire country is asking itself right now, does anybody even listen to the president anymore? Like, all real talk? Does anybody care what he says? It might be one of the large effects of Trump, I think.

215
00:11:45,448 --> 00:11:52,830
So who fucking cares what the president has to say? For four years, we had a president who's like, oh, he's talking shit.

216
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,186
He's just talking shit.

217
00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:54,602
Yes.

218
00:11:54,676 --> 00:11:56,042
Oh, I'm going to do this thing.

219
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:56,810
No, you're not.

220
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,410
You're just talking shit on Twitter.

221
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:04,818
Right? And I think that even before Trump, you had presidents who would have sort of empty talk and promises.

222
00:12:04,914 --> 00:12:09,254
Sure, Syria, red lines, you get used to a bit of that.

223
00:12:09,352 --> 00:12:12,650
And then you have a president who's just talking just all the time.

224
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:17,202
It seems tough to come back from that, to be like, we'll take all this very seriously.

225
00:12:17,226 --> 00:12:19,202
Think about the gravitas of the office.

226
00:12:19,276 --> 00:12:33,198
How dare you look at me and say that I should give a shit about what the president says? I can if I so choose, but how dare you say I should? Yeah, it's a tough walk from the past of, like, my fellow Americans.

227
00:12:33,234 --> 00:12:38,330
I come to you today to Trump being like, they say I have a small dick.

228
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:47,486
Imagine FDR's fireside speeches if it was just like, oh, the only thing we have to fear is how tiny Hitler's balls are.

229
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:49,082
Am I right? Yeah.

230
00:12:49,216 --> 00:12:51,086
High fives from everybody.

231
00:12:51,268 --> 00:12:51,866
Yeah.

232
00:12:51,988 --> 00:13:06,182
Or just the notion of thinking about presidents in history caring about memes, the equivalent of memes at the time.

233
00:13:06,316 --> 00:13:08,930
Did he get mad about memes? Oh, totally.

234
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:14,334
If there was a nasty little comic strip in a paper, he went apeshit.

235
00:13:14,382 --> 00:13:15,614
Maybe that's why Alex likes him.

236
00:13:15,652 --> 00:13:16,262
I think so.

237
00:13:16,336 --> 00:13:21,626
Anyway, we got an episode to go over alex's response to this, September 2, 2022.

238
00:13:21,628 --> 00:13:26,294
And yes, his reactions about what you'd expect.

239
00:13:26,452 --> 00:13:27,474
It was a great speech.

240
00:13:27,522 --> 00:13:28,226
I loved it.

241
00:13:28,288 --> 00:13:30,494
I'm a huge fan of Biden from now on.

242
00:13:30,532 --> 00:13:39,700
Evocative in its imagery all those things I said about him having other diseases to see where this goes.

243
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,318
Alex loved it.

244
00:13:41,344 --> 00:13:43,454
Yeah, we'll get into all that.

245
00:13:43,492 --> 00:13:45,434
Before we do, Jordan, let's say hello to some new walk.

246
00:13:45,472 --> 00:13:46,286
Oh, that's a great idea.

247
00:13:46,348 --> 00:13:48,162
So first illegal Owen Wilson.

248
00:13:48,186 --> 00:13:48,846
Impersonator.

249
00:13:48,918 --> 00:13:49,538
Thank you so much.

250
00:13:49,564 --> 00:13:51,018
You're now policy wonk.

251
00:13:51,114 --> 00:13:52,122
I'm a policy wonk.

252
00:13:52,146 --> 00:13:52,850
Thank you very much.

253
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,294
Thank you.

254
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:53,606
Next.

255
00:13:53,668 --> 00:13:54,582
Oh, for fuck's sake.

256
00:13:54,606 --> 00:13:55,142
Thank you so much.

257
00:13:55,156 --> 00:13:56,346
You're now Policy wonk.

258
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,366
I'm a policy wonk.

259
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,070
Thank you very much.

260
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,870
That's my favorite one in a long time.

261
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,778
Concise gets to the point of it.

262
00:14:01,804 --> 00:14:02,030
Yeah.

263
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,366
Next.

264
00:14:02,428 --> 00:14:04,022
Classic charles, thank you so much.

265
00:14:04,036 --> 00:14:05,514
You're now policy wonk.

266
00:14:05,622 --> 00:14:06,606
I'm a policy wonk.

267
00:14:06,618 --> 00:14:07,274
Thank you very much.

268
00:14:07,312 --> 00:14:08,810
I will not do an impression.

269
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:09,626
Next.

270
00:14:09,688 --> 00:14:12,758
I've listened to every second of knowledge fight jacob, thank you so much.

271
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:14,046
You're now a policy wonk.

272
00:14:14,118 --> 00:14:15,162
I'm a policy wonk.

273
00:14:15,186 --> 00:14:16,034
Thank you very much.

274
00:14:16,132 --> 00:14:20,534
And as you all know, for security reasons, my name has changed monthly this month.

275
00:14:20,572 --> 00:14:23,222
You may call me Tickle Tickle Poppy Top.

276
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:24,098
Thank you so much.

277
00:14:24,184 --> 00:14:25,410
You're now Policy wonk.

278
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,442
I'm a policy wonk.

279
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:27,170
Thank you very much.

280
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:27,614
Thank you.

281
00:14:27,652 --> 00:14:29,382
And we got a couple of technocrats here in the mix.

282
00:14:29,406 --> 00:14:29,682
Jordan.

283
00:14:29,706 --> 00:14:33,546
So first my dog wants to know why I keep saying a little walkie.

284
00:14:33,618 --> 00:14:35,894
A little walkie for Tanny before we go outside.

285
00:14:35,992 --> 00:14:36,518
Thank you so much.

286
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:38,094
You are now a technocrat.

287
00:14:38,142 --> 00:14:39,854
And Cora, thank you so much.

288
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:41,226
You are now a technocrat.

289
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:43,300
I'm a policy wonk four star.

290
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,874
Someone sodomite sent me a bucket of poop.

291
00:14:47,922 --> 00:14:48,950
Daddy Sharp.

292
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:54,426
Jar Jar Binks has a Caribbean black accent.

293
00:14:54,558 --> 00:14:56,046
He's a loser.

294
00:14:56,238 --> 00:14:57,618
Little kitty baby.

295
00:14:57,714 --> 00:14:59,258
I don't want to hate black people.

296
00:14:59,344 --> 00:14:59,994
I renounce.

297
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:00,926
Jesus Christ.

298
00:15:01,048 --> 00:15:01,862
Thank you so much.

299
00:15:01,936 --> 00:15:03,220
Thank you very much.

300
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:11,354
So, yeah, the speech happened, and because of that, Alex decided, like, I'm not even going to wait for my intro to play.

301
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,594
I'm just getting in there, right? I'm diving in.

302
00:15:14,692 --> 00:15:18,654
The second the show starts, I'm going to sink my teeth into this speech.

303
00:15:18,702 --> 00:15:21,638
He is, like, just in it.

304
00:15:21,724 --> 00:15:22,360
Okay.

305
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:28,000
As you can now see, America is going under total new, older martial law.

306
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:34,922
Biden has literally given a speech declaring war on the people in a Hilarian set.

307
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:42,690
timing.

308
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,550
Nailed it.

309
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,040
Yeah, that's not bad.

310
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,082
That's professional.

311
00:15:47,226 --> 00:15:47,606
Sure.

312
00:15:47,668 --> 00:15:55,142
The Larian set really seems to be one of the primary things that Alex is focused on.

313
00:15:55,276 --> 00:16:01,610
The optics of it, the red light behind him, the fact that he gave a speech at night.

314
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,066
Sure.

315
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:06,220
These are things that Alex seems almost preoccupied by.

316
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:12,374
I assume that the content of the speech is not really something he's very interested in.

317
00:16:12,412 --> 00:16:13,394
Well, some of it.

318
00:16:13,492 --> 00:16:14,786
A little bit here and there.

319
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:15,506
Sure.

320
00:16:15,688 --> 00:16:17,870
Some of the stuff that really works well for him.

321
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,602
Sure.

322
00:16:18,796 --> 00:16:19,262
Yeah.

323
00:16:19,336 --> 00:16:41,750
But the optics are and I think one of the reasons that this is really sticking in his craw, as it were, is we heard for years during Trump's time, Alex being like, you have the bully pulpit, do an evening speech, get out there and address the population in prime time and get your message across.

324
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,442
Trump wouldn't do that.

325
00:16:43,516 --> 00:16:43,790
Right.

326
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,370
Or he didn't do the thing that Alex wants.

327
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:51,686
And now here you have Biden doing exactly what Alex was wishing Trump would do.

328
00:16:51,748 --> 00:16:58,562
And not just that, but giving a speech, the thing that they're famously furious that he cannot do.

329
00:16:58,756 --> 00:17:01,298
He can't speak clearly for a second.

330
00:17:01,384 --> 00:17:01,634
Right.

331
00:17:01,672 --> 00:17:02,534
Which is kind of thing.

332
00:17:02,632 --> 00:17:07,182
And you do note that Alex doesn't play, like the full speech.

333
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:08,402
Of course not.

334
00:17:08,596 --> 00:17:11,186
He plays some bit and we'll get to that here in a second.

335
00:17:11,248 --> 00:17:15,038
But yeah, because he makes gas all the time.

336
00:17:15,064 --> 00:17:16,000
There's no plan.

337
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,298
I think it's sour grapes somewhat for Alex.

338
00:17:27,334 --> 00:17:30,618
He wishes that Trump would have done something like this.

339
00:17:30,764 --> 00:17:41,538
He wishes that Trump would have declared war on the globalist I mean, yeah, I was going to say and he's mad that he's in a situation where, like, Biden is doing the thing I wanted Trump to do.

340
00:17:41,624 --> 00:17:52,290
I'm not saying that I have any kinship with Alex over this, but I do believe that his idea of what speeches would happen is very similar to mine.

341
00:17:53,870 --> 00:18:04,158
The speech happen while you're arresting everybody that you need arrested? Yes, I think he and I are very similarly aligned in that being the way that speeches should go.

342
00:18:04,244 --> 00:18:15,154
Well, there's a slight difference because you guys are both like experiencing reality as a movie, but no, I'm wishing reality was a movie.

343
00:18:15,202 --> 00:18:15,450
Right.

344
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,230
That's the difference.

345
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:27,058
That is the difference where Alex is portraying Biden giving the speech as cover for as what I think would be inevitable, locking up of all of his political enemies.

346
00:18:27,214 --> 00:18:27,534
Yeah.

347
00:18:27,572 --> 00:18:29,494
So I guess there is a similarity.

348
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,206
You should talk to somebody about that.

349
00:18:31,328 --> 00:18:33,094
Like see an expert.

350
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:34,820
About what? Nothing.

351
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:39,942
What am I supposed to say to that expert? I don't know.

352
00:18:39,956 --> 00:18:43,458
There's like 700 episodes of our shows they can check in on.

353
00:18:43,484 --> 00:18:50,910
What if it's a world historian expert? They'll be like, oh yeah, maybe they'll give you an honorary degree.

354
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:52,398
Yes.

355
00:18:52,484 --> 00:18:57,082
So Alex does start the show by playing some of Biden's speech.

356
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,850
And I noticed that there were some cuts.

357
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,098
Okay.

358
00:19:01,244 --> 00:19:04,170
Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology.

359
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:13,650
I know because I've been able to work with these mainstream Republicans and here, in my view, is what is true.

360
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,442
Oh, boy.

361
00:19:14,516 --> 00:19:16,580
So there's a pretty obvious cut there.

362
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:26,190
And one of the things that is very important to point out is that Biden does go out of his way to be very specific about what he's talking about.

363
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,386
Yeah, he's talking about folks who do not understand the transfer of power.

364
00:19:31,448 --> 00:19:32,060
Right.

365
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:40,566
The folks who don't have any interest in the governing rules and norms of government.

366
00:19:40,748 --> 00:19:42,190
Not just Republicans.

367
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:46,054
This is not just a partisan type speech.

368
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:50,118
So I assume he broke down at one point and just started screaming january 6.

369
00:19:50,264 --> 00:19:51,834
It wasn't that long ago.

370
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:53,370
January 6.

371
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,210
I mean, in a fashion.

372
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:55,880
Yeah.

373
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,750
You just bring it up.

374
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,400
Okay.

375
00:19:59,210 --> 00:19:59,994
So close.

376
00:20:00,092 --> 00:20:08,682
So it intrigued me that there was these cuts, because, as all the time in the world on his show, he can play whatever he wants.

377
00:20:08,756 --> 00:20:09,066
Sure.

378
00:20:09,128 --> 00:20:12,762
And you know what he wants to play.

379
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:13,146
Right.

380
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:17,226
So here's what was said in between the clips that was cut out.

381
00:20:17,348 --> 00:20:27,366
Quote but there's no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven, and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans, and that this is a threat to this country.

382
00:20:27,548 --> 00:20:28,914
These are hard things.

383
00:20:29,012 --> 00:20:30,558
But I'm an American president.

384
00:20:30,644 --> 00:20:34,534
Not the president of red America or blue America, but of all America.

385
00:20:34,642 --> 00:20:41,430
And I believe it is my duty, my duty to level with you, to tell you the truth, no matter how difficult, no matter how painful.

386
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:52,306
It may be a coincidence that this was cut out, but it also seems like a point Alex wouldn't be super comfortable with, particularly the part about the GOP being intimidated by Trump and his followers.

387
00:20:52,378 --> 00:21:03,598
Yeah, the impression about Trump and the MAGA folks is supposed to be that they're winning the battle of ideas and that they're just smarter and more patriotic than the rest of us, which is why they've taken over the GOP.

388
00:21:03,754 --> 00:21:15,510
It's not a great idea to plant seeds in the audience's mind that maybe they're a part of something hostile that has gained power not by being ideologically better, but by being more willing to threaten and employ violence.

389
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:25,890
Alex also cuts out the part at the beginning where Biden says, quote, we must never forget, we the people are the true heirs of the American experiment that began more than two centuries ago.

390
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:38,482
We the people have burning inside each of us the flame of liberty that was lit here at Independence Hall, a flame that lit our way through abolition, the Civil War, suffrage, the Great Depression, world wars, civil rights.

391
00:21:38,626 --> 00:21:49,690
That sacred flame still burns now in our time as we build an America that is more prosperous, free, and just, that is the work of my presidency, a mission I believe in with my whole soul.

392
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,006
That's just good business.

393
00:21:51,068 --> 00:21:52,866
On Alex's part, cutting that out? Yeah.

394
00:21:52,928 --> 00:21:57,918
He has a vested interest in pretending that his political enemies hate the country and what it stands for.

395
00:21:58,004 --> 00:22:01,830
So it's best not to allow someone like Biden to speak like this on Infowars.

396
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:09,342
As someone who has a passionate love for the country, it would be too confusing to me.

397
00:22:09,356 --> 00:22:12,706
It would be really terrifying if he quoted Thomas Jefferson.

398
00:22:12,778 --> 00:22:14,550
That would fuck them up.

399
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,278
That would be especially if he did it accurately.

400
00:22:17,434 --> 00:22:24,330
Now, if he inaccurately quoted Thomas Jefferson, they would go absolutely apeshit all day.

401
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:41,302
Right? All day would be a non stop barrage of, this guy doesn't know shit about Thomas Jefferson, despite what we all know to be the truth of their ability to remember or even fantasize thomas Jefferson's.

402
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:42,320
Quote yeah.

403
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:53,960
If any Biden speech writers are listening, slip in something about something, and then quote, Thomas Jefferson, call TJ all day.

404
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:55,594
That would be wonderful.

405
00:22:55,642 --> 00:22:56,586
That's the way you got to go.

406
00:22:56,648 --> 00:23:04,338
So he plays enough of the speech that you just play the full passage if you wanted to.

407
00:23:04,364 --> 00:23:04,518
Sure.

408
00:23:04,544 --> 00:23:06,634
But this is Frankenstein.

409
00:23:06,682 --> 00:23:09,178
Together, there are just cuts everywhere.

410
00:23:09,334 --> 00:23:23,900
They promote authoritarian leaders and they fan the flames of political violence that are a threat to our personal rights, to the pursuit of justice, to the rule of law, to the very soul of this country.

411
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:30,566
We hear you've heard it more and more talk about violence.

412
00:23:30,698 --> 00:23:32,230
So you could hear that cut there again.

413
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:32,818
Yeah.

414
00:23:32,964 --> 00:23:36,418
Here's what Biden said in the middle of that, right after where it cut.

415
00:23:36,564 --> 00:23:58,070
Quote, they look at the mob that stormed the United States Capitol on January 6, brutally attacking law enforcement not as insurrectionists who placed a dagger to the throat of our democracy, but they look at them as patriots, and they see their MAGA failure to stop a peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election as preparation for the 2022 and 2024 elections.

416
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:05,230
I think Alex knows well enough that most of his audience does see January 6 writers as patriots, which is uncomfortable.

417
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,320
Yeah.

418
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:12,874
It's hard to rationalize if you really have to get confronted on it.

419
00:24:12,912 --> 00:24:13,546
Yeah.

420
00:24:13,728 --> 00:24:21,086
This is holding up a mirror to his audience's beliefs in a way that could be threatening, whereas other parts of the speech that are left in, they really aren't.

421
00:24:21,218 --> 00:24:28,222
For instance, he leaves in Biden saying, quote, they promote authoritarian leaders because the audience doesn't think they do that.

422
00:24:28,356 --> 00:24:30,854
Trump DeSantis Bolsonaro and Orban.

423
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:34,234
They're the furthest things from authoritarian in the audience's eyes.

424
00:24:34,332 --> 00:24:37,894
So hearing Biden say that is just absurd to them.

425
00:24:38,052 --> 00:24:40,930
That's not something like, I'm taking aback by this.

426
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,518
Yeah.

427
00:24:41,664 --> 00:24:47,138
Another part that Alex leaves in is, quote, maja forces are determined to take this country backwards.

428
00:24:47,234 --> 00:24:55,860
Backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love, all that stuff.

429
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:59,698
That stuff that his audience believes in and is totally fine with.

430
00:24:59,724 --> 00:25:00,842
Yes, I was going to say that's.

431
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,906
Like, yeah, man, totally.

432
00:25:02,978 --> 00:25:04,030
That's what we are doing.

433
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,554
They're antiabortion, they lean strongly toward or outright in favor of banning contraception.

434
00:25:09,602 --> 00:25:11,510
They want to get rid of marriage equality.

435
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:21,026
And the idea of right to privacy is vague enough that they can just slip that in a list that I don't know, listen, we want the right to privacy, but we also want to break into your home if you're gay.

436
00:25:21,158 --> 00:25:23,734
Maybe it has to do with social media.

437
00:25:23,892 --> 00:25:24,538
Whatever.

438
00:25:24,684 --> 00:25:33,626
This is not threatening for Alex to show the audience because it gives the audience the feeling that Biden is declaring war on them for their political beliefs.

439
00:25:33,758 --> 00:25:40,210
They identify with the people that Biden is describing as a threat to democracy, which is what Alex wants them to feel.

440
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,414
In the case of the January 6 thing, that's a little bit different.

441
00:25:43,572 --> 00:25:47,866
That's a case where the audience will see their feelings mirrored by what Biden is saying.

442
00:25:47,928 --> 00:25:58,430
But it's not about political positions they can justify as rational opposition to abortion or believing that marriage is just between a man and a woman are things that are common in many religious communities.

443
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:02,126
So it wouldn't give you pause to look at yourself in the mirror.

444
00:26:02,258 --> 00:26:10,010
The riots of January 6 were actions and those actions are way harder for people who want to see themselves as respectable to justify.

445
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:15,298
That's a mere it's best not to look into partially because what Biden is saying makes sense.

446
00:26:15,384 --> 00:26:15,922
Yeah.

447
00:26:16,056 --> 00:26:22,490
The group that tried to overrun the capital in order to stop the last election from being certified poses a threat to our democratic processes.

448
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:23,386
That make sense.

449
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:23,782
Yeah.

450
00:26:23,856 --> 00:26:25,874
You don't want to look at that mirror.

451
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,958
Alex has also cut this part out.

452
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:35,570
Quote but while the threat to American democracy is real, I want to say as clearly as we can we are not powerless in the face of these threats.

453
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:39,254
We are not bystanders in this ongoing attack on democracy.

454
00:26:39,422 --> 00:26:49,066
There are far more Americans, far more Americans from every background and belief who reject the extreme manga ideology than those who accept it.

455
00:26:49,188 --> 00:26:51,494
After that line, there was a big cheer.

456
00:26:51,662 --> 00:26:58,814
This could be useful to instill fear in the audience, but that doesn't play as well with the infowars version of Biden and these ideas.

457
00:26:58,862 --> 00:26:59,254
Yeah.

458
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:04,394
A huge part of the election conspiracy is that Biden was so unpopular and then no one would come to his rally.

459
00:27:04,442 --> 00:27:17,810
So you don't really want these large applause break and the getting applause for the idea that there are more people who are sick of this stuff, sure, than Alex's goofy audience.

460
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:18,454
Not good.

461
00:27:18,552 --> 00:27:19,366
That's not good.

462
00:27:19,428 --> 00:27:26,486
Now there's a bunch more that's cut out and a lot of it is Biden saying things about uniting around, defending our political process and then getting applause.

463
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:26,974
Right.

464
00:27:27,072 --> 00:27:30,098
No need for stuff like that because it's bad optics.

465
00:27:30,194 --> 00:27:31,440
You don't want it.

466
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:36,214
Also, for him, it's not even a thing.

467
00:27:36,252 --> 00:27:43,378
It's just like, oh, yeah, we can't use that, so why leave it in? And nobody's going to question us for cutting it.

468
00:27:43,404 --> 00:27:48,418
It's obvious my audience is going to watch the whole, they don't give a shit, please.

469
00:27:48,504 --> 00:27:48,970
Yeah.

470
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,010
They're going to accept whatever interpretation I give and that's going to be reality.

471
00:27:54,570 --> 00:28:01,894
I was wondering part of why I think that calling the January 6 people patriots is weird to me.

472
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:04,980
It's because it was such a huge fuck up.

473
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:13,210
We all saw that it was just a bunch of fucking assholes just really being pieces of shit.

474
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:25,522
And it's like, you can't mythologize that the same way you can the Boston Tea Party, that was just a bunch of assholes going on a boat and like, fucking shit up.

475
00:28:25,656 --> 00:28:28,870
Counterpoint what? William travis.

476
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:30,350
Travis.

477
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:30,862
Fair enough.

478
00:28:30,936 --> 00:28:31,690
Yeah, fair enough.

479
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:42,170
You can build an entire American legend on a drunk asshole fucking murdering people at their house who was only there because he was running away from his ex wife.

480
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,866
Yeah, never mind.

481
00:28:44,988 --> 00:28:45,670
My bad.

482
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,890
I should have looked at Mormonism.

483
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:57,030
We're too close to it now that you still remember some of the details as opposed to the selling of the myth.

484
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:57,746
Exactly.

485
00:28:57,928 --> 00:29:01,394
So I think you're right for now, but give it a little track.

486
00:29:01,432 --> 00:29:01,814
Sure.

487
00:29:01,912 --> 00:29:05,294
No, they're the true American revolutionaries in ten years.

488
00:29:05,332 --> 00:29:06,220
I get it.

489
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:12,890
So there's one more bit that was, I noticed, just a massive cut here.

490
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:22,490
There are public figures today, yesterday, and the day before predicting and all but calling for mass violence and rioting in the streets.

491
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,890
This is inflammatory.

492
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,634
It's dangerous.

493
00:29:26,802 --> 00:29:34,660
It's against the rule of law, and we the people must say, this is not who we are.

494
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:44,602
And now America might jarring So here's what was missing, their quote.

495
00:29:44,686 --> 00:29:48,682
Look, I know politics can be fierce and mean and nasty in America.

496
00:29:48,766 --> 00:29:49,518
I get it.

497
00:29:49,604 --> 00:29:54,010
I believe in the give and take of politics and disagreement and debate and dissent.

498
00:29:54,130 --> 00:30:10,702
We're a big, complicated country, but democracy endures only if we the people respect the guardrails of the republic, only if we the people accept the results of free and fair elections, only if we the people see politics not as total war, but mediation of our differences.

499
00:30:10,846 --> 00:30:15,862
Democracy cannot survive when one side believes they are only two outcomes to an election.

500
00:30:15,946 --> 00:30:17,986
Either they win or they were cheated.

501
00:30:18,118 --> 00:30:20,660
That's where MAGA republicans are today.

502
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,038
Fair point.

503
00:30:22,124 --> 00:30:22,554
Yeah.

504
00:30:22,652 --> 00:30:23,694
Can't argue with that.

505
00:30:23,792 --> 00:30:28,590
Yeah, every single fucking election.

506
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:36,450
It's getting to the point where, obviously that should give some of the folks pause.

507
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:46,342
Maybe some of the more aware, self aware listeners to Alex Chit should be like, all right, Sarah Palin lost.

508
00:30:46,426 --> 00:30:47,218
That was cheating.

509
00:30:47,314 --> 00:30:48,570
Laura Loomer lost.

510
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,922
They can't all be cheating, man.

511
00:30:50,996 --> 00:30:59,370
But what if they can't? I mean, who has the time to cheat that many elections? Even the globalists are stretched thin, man.

512
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,770
They don't have time for Alaskan elections.

513
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,438
Sarah Palin can lose on her own baby.

514
00:31:04,534 --> 00:31:08,094
And with the case of Laura Loomer, you got to look at this.

515
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,800
Half glasses, half full.

516
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,560
A huge win.

517
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:13,902
Absolutely.

518
00:31:14,036 --> 00:31:18,166
You lost, but damn upsetting.

519
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:24,042
Yeah, you lost, but you were a w away from getting a w.

520
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:27,440
You know what I'm saying? That was a very short walk.

521
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:37,890
Also in this portion, Biden lists off a number of his accomplishments that he's helped make possible in the past two years, all of which are things that Alex is pretending aren't real.

522
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,182
So it's best not to confuse the audience with that.

523
00:31:40,196 --> 00:31:41,706
Yeah, definitely don't do that.

524
00:31:41,768 --> 00:31:54,658
This also cut out the part where there's a protester yelling stuff to disrupt the speech, and Biden says, quote, notwithstanding those folks you hear on the other side there, they're entitled to be outrageous.

525
00:31:54,754 --> 00:31:55,218
This is.

526
00:31:55,244 --> 00:32:00,510
A democracy, but history and common sense, good manners is nothing they've suffered from.

527
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:11,446
That's a pretty far cry from all those times Trump interrupted his own speeches to demand protesters be kicked out, or times he responded with gleed protesters being assaulted at his rallies.

528
00:32:11,518 --> 00:32:13,054
Yeah, that one was tough.

529
00:32:13,102 --> 00:32:20,998
It's kind of hard to paint the patience that Biden is exhibiting and tolerance of somebody who disagrees as tyrannical.

530
00:32:21,094 --> 00:32:21,570
Right.

531
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,002
Especially juxtaposed with kick that bum out.

532
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:25,542
I know.

533
00:32:25,616 --> 00:32:31,246
You really have to cut out a lot of Biden's speech in order to make him look like a tyrant.

534
00:32:31,318 --> 00:32:32,022
Yeah.

535
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:36,260
But there's red lights and he's doing this at night, so that's pretty good.

536
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:47,650
The funniest part about it is I suppose you could go with the bailout and like the ACA to portray Obama as a tyrant.

537
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,110
At least there's that.

538
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,110
But with Biden, it really does feel like he's half ass.

539
00:32:52,160 --> 00:33:04,218
And is he a tyrant if he's willing to be like a ten K in student loan forgiveness? I'm not going to go after these hard right people and say, we got to get 20.

540
00:33:04,304 --> 00:33:06,370
Come on then, jack, this is negotiation.

541
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:06,714
All right.

542
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:12,860
Jack, you can't you can't be a tyrant if you're literally low balling your own power.

543
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:21,434
Sure, I think it's tough, but it's a challenge that Alice wants to stepping up to the plate.

544
00:33:21,482 --> 00:33:22,498
Yeah, sure.

545
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:31,474
Another thing that's weird here is that the part where this picks up after the cut where Biden says, quote, and now America must choose.

546
00:33:31,632 --> 00:33:33,818
That's actually from earlier in the speech.

547
00:33:33,974 --> 00:33:38,210
This is edited out of order to create the impression that Alex is wanting to convey.

548
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:38,602
Right.

549
00:33:38,676 --> 00:33:45,082
I promise I could make Alex's show look so much worse if I just gave up on the idea of linear time.

550
00:33:45,276 --> 00:33:50,138
That's not fair because this is a very definition of taking things out of context.

551
00:33:50,234 --> 00:33:53,014
Out of context in temporal space.

552
00:33:53,112 --> 00:33:53,374
Yeah.

553
00:33:53,412 --> 00:34:05,114
No, if you take it out of one time and then put it into a different time and make it appear that thoughts are flowing into each other that aren't, you might as well edit in each individual word to make it say how much I rent.

554
00:34:05,222 --> 00:34:08,846
Might as well be a magazine cut out of a hostage letter.

555
00:34:08,978 --> 00:34:18,914
I understand that maybe for time reasons alex wouldn't want to play the whole speech, but the way this is being presented is irresponsible and it's intentionally deceptive.

556
00:34:18,962 --> 00:34:19,462
Yeah.

557
00:34:19,596 --> 00:34:21,670
You shouldn't expect anything otherwise.

558
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:33,166
So this clip comes to an end or the part of the speech and Alex has some words and this is it like this is the entire show.

559
00:34:33,348 --> 00:34:42,780
We can choose a better path forward to the future, a future of possibility, a future to build a dream and hope.

560
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:46,282
And we're on that path, moving ahead.

561
00:34:46,476 --> 00:34:49,202
Everything he said is an inversion of the truth.

562
00:34:49,346 --> 00:34:49,858
Here we go.

563
00:34:49,884 --> 00:34:52,370
For a few he'd give a speech to clearing war in America.

564
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,026
They are locked and loaded.

565
00:34:54,038 --> 00:34:55,814
The stage massive terror attacks.

566
00:34:55,922 --> 00:34:59,510
This country is on the footsteps of doom.

567
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:03,890
And everybody better get the word out that they're planning to stage violence.

568
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,402
They're the ones preparing violence.

569
00:35:05,426 --> 00:35:09,998
They have the history of provocateurring, and you heard it with no proof, say that Republicans are calling for violence.

570
00:35:10,034 --> 00:35:15,398
They had a bunch of national TV shows the last two days say I'm calling for violence when I'm calling for the opposite.

571
00:35:15,494 --> 00:35:18,574
These people are making their move on us.

572
00:35:18,732 --> 00:35:21,230
My God, with a fascist background.

573
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,110
All they missed was the torches.

574
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:30,022
Torches? Isn't that traditionally pitchforks and torches coming from the other direction? Yeah.

575
00:35:30,096 --> 00:35:37,658
And I think that the torches, certainly in present parlance, evokes ideas of the Unite the Right rally.

576
00:35:37,694 --> 00:35:38,280
Yes.

577
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:39,526
Right.

578
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:42,478
Which is his friend, which would be the buddies that he's around.

579
00:35:42,564 --> 00:35:43,200
Yeah.

580
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,178
I don't understand.

581
00:35:45,264 --> 00:35:45,900
Exactly.

582
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:49,630
I'm sure there's some images trying to evoke that's not bad.

583
00:35:49,680 --> 00:36:01,954
But I strongly suspect that Alex has the tone that he has there because he knows that his followers are primed to hear something like this as the go ahead to start shooting or carrying out violence against the government.

584
00:36:02,112 --> 00:36:09,314
He desperately needs to create the preemptive narrative that anything that may happen is not real and will be a false flag, completely fake.

585
00:36:09,422 --> 00:36:15,110
Incidentally, when Biden said the public figures were calling for violence and when people are talking about that, they weren't talking about Alex.

586
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:15,538
No.

587
00:36:15,624 --> 00:36:25,238
This was almost certainly in response to Senator Lindsey Graham going on Fox News and saying that if Trump was charged for having all that classified, shaded mara lago, then there would be riots in the streets.

588
00:36:25,394 --> 00:36:26,100
Nothing.

589
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,198
It's not always about Alex.

590
00:36:29,294 --> 00:36:32,482
Nothing is always except for him.

591
00:36:32,556 --> 00:36:35,630
You could argue that most things are not about Alex, typically.

592
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,174
Especially when Alex says they're about him.

593
00:36:37,212 --> 00:36:39,454
Yeah, that's a dead giveaway that they're probably not.

594
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:42,430
I do appreciate the discourse in America.

595
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:47,614
You think back to those conservative commentators like William F.

596
00:36:47,652 --> 00:36:48,698
Buckley Jr.

597
00:36:48,854 --> 00:37:00,358
And you think about him now saying what amounts to I'm rubber and your glue, or Nina, what bounces off me sticks to you, is essentially just, I think, a win.

598
00:37:00,504 --> 00:37:01,718
I think it's evolution.

599
00:37:01,814 --> 00:37:02,460
Sure.

600
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:06,778
Ask not what the government can do for you and what you can do for the government.

601
00:37:06,864 --> 00:37:08,530
No, this is an inversion.

602
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:15,898
That's not what the government can do for you because the government can do everything, but not for you.

603
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,962
For you they must do nothing.

604
00:37:18,096 --> 00:37:20,050
He's not even a Berliner.

605
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:30,926
Obviously he knows that they're about to go to break and so he has a limited amount of time.

606
00:37:30,988 --> 00:37:34,658
But the argument of the reverse of everything is true.

607
00:37:34,804 --> 00:37:36,050
What he said is not true.

608
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:36,974
What I say is true.

609
00:37:37,012 --> 00:37:38,030
It's a little lazy, obviously.

610
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:38,874
A little bit lazy.

611
00:37:38,922 --> 00:37:39,520
Yeah.

612
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:44,658
Look, I'm telling you, the entire show is just false.

613
00:37:44,694 --> 00:37:45,458
Flags are coming.

614
00:37:45,544 --> 00:37:46,180
Sure.

615
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,178
Because that's the only thing that's important.

616
00:37:49,264 --> 00:37:49,550
Yeah.

617
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,386
Alex knows well enough.

618
00:37:51,508 --> 00:38:00,618
He's plugged into friends with all kinds of Oath Keeper types who have been begging to fight a fucking war forever.

619
00:38:00,774 --> 00:38:12,100
Like he knows enough to see the optics of this, to see the way people are talking about it and know someone is probably making a bomb as we speak.

620
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:23,750
So when that happens, if that happens, I don't want to be blamed for it, and I don't want this to be a setback to my business and to my ideology.

621
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,142
So it has to be fake in advance.

622
00:38:26,226 --> 00:38:26,870
Yeah.

623
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:34,898
And when he was talking about false flags coming before this speech, it's the same thing.

624
00:38:34,984 --> 00:38:37,310
It's just much more important.

625
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:48,062
Now, when there was those we touched on this before, but the clips on social media going around with him saying false flags are coming before the midterms sure.

626
00:38:48,136 --> 00:38:53,450
That's just his normal, everyday type, right? Yeah.

627
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,182
This is far more pitched.

628
00:38:55,266 --> 00:39:03,782
And I know that the reason is because he knows there's a heightened chance that his friends are going to do some real fucked up stuff.

629
00:39:03,856 --> 00:39:05,380
Yeah, that's true.

630
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,686
I don't know.

631
00:39:06,808 --> 00:39:08,186
I think I would take that bet.

632
00:39:08,248 --> 00:39:22,240
I think I would take the bet, because the bet is if you arrest Trump and you do the law thing correctly, they attack or nothing happens and we get Trump.

633
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,026
I think I take the bet.

634
00:39:24,148 --> 00:39:30,220
I think if we get Trump and they don't attack, the wind drops out of their sales completely.

635
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:55,954
I don't even think it's healthy to look at it this way, because I think that the legal system or whatever should play out how it plays out, and if there is cause and it's appropriate to arrest them, fucking arrest them, there should not be a consideration of what the backlash will be, because that's terrorism.

636
00:39:56,002 --> 00:40:01,938
Right, I understand that, but you understand that is the consideration that is being taking place.

637
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:02,766
I understand.

638
00:40:02,888 --> 00:40:06,166
Well, at least certainly that's a big part of the conversation.

639
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:08,266
Hopefully not within law enforcement.

640
00:40:08,338 --> 00:40:09,620
Yeah, of course it is.

641
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:17,410
Why do you think Mueller didn't charge them in the first place at the DOJ? Maybe it's not appropriate for a sitting president to be charged.

642
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,078
I don't know.

643
00:40:18,164 --> 00:40:22,846
Look, fair enough, but there's also maybe other considerations.

644
00:40:22,918 --> 00:40:23,298
Sure.

645
00:40:23,384 --> 00:40:35,580
But yeah, I get where you're coming from, but also, I think that's naive because I think that to assume an immediate backlash is the backlash sure.

646
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,078
Might be short sighted.

647
00:40:38,174 --> 00:40:45,454
So, like, if Trump were arrested and nothing happens, that doesn't mean, like, six months of planning later, something wouldn't happen.

648
00:40:45,492 --> 00:40:48,242
Sure, that's possible in elaborate jailbreak.

649
00:40:48,326 --> 00:40:48,682
Right.

650
00:40:48,756 --> 00:40:53,878
But you do understand we're raising Trump out of his resort prison again.

651
00:40:53,964 --> 00:40:59,230
We're talking about an escape plan planned by the dumbest people on the fucking planet.

652
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,994
I'm not afraid of their plans.

653
00:41:02,102 --> 00:41:03,710
I'm afraid of a flash mob.

654
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,026
Do you know what I mean? Yeah.

655
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:08,174
I feel like their plans would be foiled very easily.

656
00:41:08,282 --> 00:41:08,662
Right.

657
00:41:08,736 --> 00:41:09,360
Yeah.

658
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:12,390
It's tough.

659
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,620
It's a tough thing to think about.

660
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:28,730
But I hope that decision making isn't being guided by the potential for people to cause rampant and random political damage because that again is terrorism.

661
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:32,426
It's not a great way to guide decision making.

662
00:41:32,488 --> 00:41:35,958
Right, but that's where we are and that's why Biden gave the fucking speech.

663
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:36,580
Exactly.

664
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:37,900
There you go.

665
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:45,106
So this got me really excited.

666
00:41:45,178 --> 00:41:46,870
But don't worry, it's a deflation.

667
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:50,338
This is an emergency broadcast, ladies and gentlemen.

668
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:58,350
And I'll be up here tomorrow taping another emergency three hour broadcast with some special guests who are going to be here today.

669
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,482
But with the storms across the country, their plane is delayed until this evening.

670
00:42:02,506 --> 00:42:05,530
I'll leave it at that special guest studio tomorrow.

671
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:08,120
We've got big guests as well in studio today.

672
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:15,740
A psychological warfare expert, one of the leading ones in the world at the bottom of the hour.

673
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:20,674
Now, you can't tell me that it's going to be a deflation.

674
00:42:20,782 --> 00:42:22,570
Well, I wanted you to feel how I felt.

675
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:24,066
I know, but come on.

676
00:42:24,128 --> 00:42:24,930
That's so good.

677
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,470
I thought it was going to be patchanic.

678
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,590
I thought he was going to be making his return.

679
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,860
Now is the time.

680
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:31,614
Yeah.

681
00:42:31,652 --> 00:42:38,754
So somebody's plane was not able to get to Texas for whatever reason.

682
00:42:38,792 --> 00:42:40,110
Look, I'll just leave it at that.

683
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,922
Alex didn't record 3 hours.

684
00:42:41,996 --> 00:42:44,178
No, this did not happen.

685
00:42:44,264 --> 00:42:50,734
Or at least it's not up on bandot video or anywhere I can find of the normal places things are posted.

686
00:42:50,782 --> 00:42:51,102
Right.

687
00:42:51,176 --> 00:42:56,470
So I don't think this happened, but I was thinking about it like it's probably just Roger, right? You lose in Florida.

688
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:58,818
Yeah, that would be the one.

689
00:42:58,844 --> 00:42:59,502
That makes sense.

690
00:42:59,576 --> 00:43:04,326
And if it is Roger, then of course you'd have to say something along the I'll just leave it at that.

691
00:43:04,388 --> 00:43:04,614
Right.

692
00:43:04,652 --> 00:43:07,590
You can't be like, oh, I mean there was a weather event.

693
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:20,550
Yeah, I didn't check the weather reports to see where there were delays, but yeah, I'm trying to think who could possibly even be in that rolodex.

694
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,626
Joel Scousen is not coming in.

695
00:43:22,688 --> 00:43:24,762
No, he'll Skype with you at best.

696
00:43:24,896 --> 00:43:25,880
Oh, man.

697
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,890
Barnes just I think is in Texas now.

698
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:33,810
What if he got Bannon? What if he got the bands? Bannon would come remote.

699
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:35,742
That is true.

700
00:43:35,816 --> 00:43:36,306
Yes.

701
00:43:36,428 --> 00:43:38,730
Maybe he's got a family vacation plan.

702
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,898
He's in the bunker.

703
00:43:39,934 --> 00:43:43,350
The war room bunker that Alex is not mad about now.

704
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:43,830
No.

705
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,894
Stealing the name of all look at it.

706
00:43:45,932 --> 00:43:47,060
It's no big deal.

707
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,062
Yeah, I don't know.

708
00:43:49,136 --> 00:43:50,742
Trail could be.

709
00:43:50,876 --> 00:43:53,550
Why not? He's got to get out of the state.

710
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:54,330
Yeah.

711
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,774
Extradition from Texas is tougher than you might think.

712
00:43:57,932 --> 00:44:03,310
So Alex has some analysis and it's really superficial.

713
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:04,786
Ladies and gentlemen.

714
00:44:04,978 --> 00:44:11,446
This is like if you go to the zoo and take your three year old, you go, that's an elephant, honey.

715
00:44:11,518 --> 00:44:11,934
Sure.

716
00:44:12,032 --> 00:44:13,078
And it's an elephant.

717
00:44:13,174 --> 00:44:13,894
There's no debating.

718
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:14,794
It's an elephant.

719
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,822
Or that's a tiger, or that's a giraffe.

720
00:44:16,846 --> 00:44:17,890
Or that's a grizzly bear.

721
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:18,802
Or that's a penguin.

722
00:44:18,826 --> 00:44:20,370
Or that's a boa constrictor.

723
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:28,882
When the leader of a country gets up and declares half the nation terrorist and says they're about to engage in terrorism.

724
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:35,622
And they do it with troops behind them with a red background with a dark cross above it.

725
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:40,398
There's a dark cross in every Hollywood movie and every Dystopian system.

726
00:44:40,484 --> 00:44:47,730
They show that exact iconography, all of it scripted by design in Vie for Vendetta.

727
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:50,742
It's the exact set.

728
00:44:50,876 --> 00:44:57,450
Also, incidentally, filming that three hour special, so, honey, I can't take you to the zoo.

729
00:44:58,490 --> 00:44:58,902
I know.

730
00:44:58,916 --> 00:45:00,862
I had plans to take my daughter to the zoo.

731
00:45:01,006 --> 00:45:05,146
Listen, we were going to go fishing, but that fell through, so we were like, let's go to the zoo.

732
00:45:05,218 --> 00:45:08,370
And now that's why I'm sorry.

733
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,042
Plane got delayed.

734
00:45:10,126 --> 00:45:11,914
Everything is movies.

735
00:45:12,022 --> 00:45:12,402
Yeah.

736
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:16,822
Everything is based on the surface level and appearances, and it's kind of troubling.

737
00:45:16,966 --> 00:45:23,410
So it really doesn't mean much more than him saying that he looked at the speech and it reminded him of movies.

738
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,090
Yeah.

739
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:25,882
Also, Biden didn't say that shit.

740
00:45:25,966 --> 00:45:28,734
No, that's just a mischaracterization of his work.

741
00:45:28,772 --> 00:45:31,434
It would be interesting if he threw that one out there, though.

742
00:45:31,532 --> 00:45:34,126
Hey, listen, assholes.

743
00:45:34,258 --> 00:45:36,642
50% of this country is coming to kill you.

744
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:40,026
If the President said that, that would be a statement of war.

745
00:45:40,088 --> 00:45:40,794
Listen up.

746
00:45:40,892 --> 00:45:42,330
Listen up, assholes.

747
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:44,146
Listen, Jack.

748
00:45:44,278 --> 00:45:47,562
50% of America straight talk express coming at you.

749
00:45:47,636 --> 00:45:50,840
50% of America has got a gun and it's coming for you.

750
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:57,090
50% of America are bad boys, and they run with a team of bad boys.

751
00:45:58,670 --> 00:45:59,790
All right? Okay.

752
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:00,560
Yeah.

753
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:05,970
I think our conversation about it would probably be different if that was what he said.

754
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,982
Yeah, it would be very interesting.

755
00:46:09,116 --> 00:46:19,410
That's an undiplomatic way to the last Jedi background, looking at looking at rave, fighting all those people.

756
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,502
Yeah, I get it.

757
00:46:20,636 --> 00:46:21,990
That would be evil.

758
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:26,780
I honestly would even have a pretty different take on it if it was what you fantasized about.

759
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:30,522
I think I would have a different take on it if they pulled that one off.

760
00:46:30,596 --> 00:46:32,122
Yeah, it's very queueish.

761
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:32,670
Yeah.

762
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:39,666
So Alex, he's talking about this and he's like, man, this seems like I can work with this.

763
00:46:39,728 --> 00:46:40,242
Okay.

764
00:46:40,376 --> 00:46:42,690
I'm going to create some branding.

765
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:55,498
Ladies and gentlemen, when they project big, blood red lights on a wall with flags and troops at the ready, they're saying, we're coming for you.

766
00:46:55,524 --> 00:46:56,520
And what it is.

767
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:59,880
I wouldn't be surprised if this doesn't have an operational name.

768
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:00,718
Oh, God.

769
00:47:00,744 --> 00:47:01,680
I have a name.

770
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:05,830
I bet it's called Operation Matador.

771
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:06,778
I bet.

772
00:47:06,864 --> 00:47:08,710
Operation Bullfight.

773
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:15,826
They see us as the bull, and they are shaking a red flag in our face.

774
00:47:15,948 --> 00:47:34,330
And the matador is the deep state with a long, skinny, razor sharp sword so that when the bull lunges forward, the mad door uses the force of its weight to drive it into the heart and step aside with his cape as the bull buries himself into the dust.

775
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:38,470
This is Operation Matador.

776
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:44,418
This is Operation Matador.

777
00:47:44,514 --> 00:47:46,000
T shirts coming soon.

778
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:47,200
Okay.

779
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:49,910
No, you don't get to do that.

780
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,790
All your operation names have been documents in the past.

781
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,854
You've been like we got Operation Lock step.

782
00:47:54,952 --> 00:47:58,262
And there was not really at least there was a thing, though.

783
00:47:58,396 --> 00:48:02,118
At least there was a word lockstep that could be found somewhere.

784
00:48:02,154 --> 00:48:02,814
Another document.

785
00:48:02,862 --> 00:48:03,542
Exactly.

786
00:48:03,736 --> 00:48:05,466
But matadors exist.

787
00:48:05,658 --> 00:48:06,938
I understand that.

788
00:48:06,964 --> 00:48:09,040
But you can't pitch your own name.

789
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:11,258
You workshopped it.

790
00:48:11,284 --> 00:48:17,798
You can't just be like, I bet it's called, and then just give it a name and then call it the name they gave it.

791
00:48:17,824 --> 00:48:20,142
But he had a second option, which is bullfight.

792
00:48:20,226 --> 00:48:22,480
And he came around like, matador is better.

793
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:25,394
He did work.

794
00:48:25,432 --> 00:48:26,282
Come on, man.

795
00:48:26,416 --> 00:48:27,530
Come on, Jack.

796
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:34,602
And then he has his own fucking analogy in order to explain the name that he bets.

797
00:48:34,686 --> 00:48:41,330
They made up for it thinking that they had the metaphorical wherewithal to make that up.

798
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,430
Yeah, it's a pained metaphor.

799
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:44,918
It's not good.

800
00:48:45,004 --> 00:48:46,598
Alex likes it, though, so he's going to keep going.

801
00:48:46,624 --> 00:48:48,534
So he's going to keep going with Operation Batador.

802
00:48:48,582 --> 00:48:48,722
Yeah.

803
00:48:48,736 --> 00:48:49,010
All right.

804
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,006
It's fun, though.

805
00:48:50,068 --> 00:48:55,890
The idea that he's just sitting there is like, I bet there's a fucking name for this and I'm going to spit ball.

806
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:57,170
I'm going to name it myself.

807
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,926
Operation Listen Up Jack.

808
00:48:58,998 --> 00:48:59,620
Yeah.

809
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:02,370
So he goes along with this bull analogy.

810
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:02,834
Sure.

811
00:49:02,932 --> 00:49:04,600
So that's all this is.

812
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:23,060
And the way you get a bull that outweighs the matador 15 times and has big giant razor sharp horns to finally run into the sword is they throw little spears are they sharp in his back? Sharp to piss him off and to anger him.

813
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:33,378
That's what they've been doing with the open borders and the drag queen story time, that he valued dollars and shutting off your power supplies and remote controlling all the devices in your house.

814
00:49:33,404 --> 00:49:35,910
We warned you 20 years ago they would do sure.

815
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:41,638
And running down America and running down our families and having the NFL take a knee and all the rest of this garbage.

816
00:49:41,734 --> 00:49:48,080
I'm sorry, what that was throwing the little spears, the barbs in our back.

817
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:59,542
But now the red cape is out with 67 days out from the midterms, where they know they're set to lose big despite all the dead people they've got on the rolls hoping they can steal it with mailing ballots.

818
00:49:59,686 --> 00:50:12,750
And so now the red tape is out being slapped in our face and right behind it is the FBI and the New World order getting ready to state terror attacks because they know we're not going to jump on the sword.

819
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:15,706
Populist Christians, conservatives are too smart.

820
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:17,098
Operation Matador.

821
00:50:17,194 --> 00:50:25,534
What is happening? So if you follow this and understand info's language, then you know that most of the stuff Alex talks about is bullshit.

822
00:50:25,582 --> 00:50:33,994
And a lot of these things he's listed as spears being poked to anger the audience are just buzzwords he throws around to prompt an emotional reaction from the audience.

823
00:50:34,162 --> 00:50:45,586
This list is an airing of grievances and the complaint is basically that Alex doesn't like technological advancement and abhors a society that embraces immigrants and LGBTQ community folks.

824
00:50:45,658 --> 00:50:46,002
Right.

825
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:54,730
He yells about free speech all day, but wants to live in a country where athletes aren't allowed to take a knee during the national anthem in protest of racial discrimination and policing.

826
00:50:54,910 --> 00:51:00,070
These are things that Alex conceptualizes as the spears being used to poke the metaphorical bull.

827
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:05,886
And it really just sounds to me like Alex is expressing a profoundly white identity view of the country.

828
00:51:06,068 --> 00:51:11,754
He doesn't believe that people who are not straight white Christians are entitled to right or power in this country.

829
00:51:11,852 --> 00:51:22,422
And on some level, any time he hears a conversation about people who fit this description acting in a way that he doesn't like, his reaction is basically like, you should be glad us white folks even let you be here.

830
00:51:22,616 --> 00:51:38,682
Yeah, I mean, it does seem like the more apt metaphorical stand in for Alex in this scenario is in fact, the bull itself, constantly being enraged by any number of different things.

831
00:51:38,816 --> 00:51:40,054
Alex is the spears.

832
00:51:40,102 --> 00:51:40,422
Yeah.

833
00:51:40,496 --> 00:51:43,302
He's angry people anyway.

834
00:51:43,376 --> 00:51:52,846
Each time he sees these things, these things like people living, he experiences it as a spear being poked into his white Christian tolerance.

835
00:51:52,978 --> 00:51:57,178
Colin Kaepernick taking a knee instead of just accepting police violence, that's a spear.

836
00:51:57,274 --> 00:52:02,494
Drag queens reading at a library instead of being shamed into never living in public, that's a spear.

837
00:52:02,602 --> 00:52:09,574
Immigrants being allowed into the country instead of having a hardened militarized border they're killed for crossing, that's a spear.

838
00:52:09,742 --> 00:52:10,710
Here's the thing.

839
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:15,394
When a bull charges after being poked by a bunch of spears, it's a natural reaction.

840
00:52:15,502 --> 00:52:19,714
The matador waving that flag is something that the bull can't really be faulted for charging.

841
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:22,078
It's the expected result of all the poking.

842
00:52:22,234 --> 00:52:33,618
If we understand Alex's metaphor, his patriot buddies are the bull, and they would be well within their right to charge the matador, in this case, bomb things because they've been poked so much.

843
00:52:33,704 --> 00:52:34,134
Right.

844
00:52:34,232 --> 00:52:38,322
The only problem is that the matador's cape has the FBI behind it.

845
00:52:38,456 --> 00:52:45,886
That doesn't really make sense because in the metaphorical matador situation, this whole thing, there's really no way to make it a false flag.

846
00:52:46,018 --> 00:52:48,358
You would need, like, a fake bull or some shit.

847
00:52:48,394 --> 00:52:51,466
And I have no idea how this works inside this conception.

848
00:52:51,538 --> 00:52:52,026
Yeah.

849
00:52:52,148 --> 00:52:54,418
This isn't Alex warning about a false flag.

850
00:52:54,514 --> 00:52:58,066
This is him warning his buddies about following their instincts.

851
00:52:58,198 --> 00:53:06,922
He's trying to tell the bull not to charge because it's a trap, because Alex understands that his buddies want to charge that matador really badly.

852
00:53:07,066 --> 00:53:08,338
They want to bomb shit.

853
00:53:08,374 --> 00:53:20,002
And Alex is smart enough to recognize that the way that people are talking about Biden's speech is exactly the kind of thing that will lead, that will be as much of a stimulus for that as a matador waving a cape.

854
00:53:20,086 --> 00:53:22,914
This isn't a false flag situation he's talking about.

855
00:53:23,012 --> 00:53:25,640
It's more of a honeypot kind of idea.

856
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:32,480
I was comparing them to the bull more in the sense that they lose at the end.

857
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:35,982
The bull doesn't win.

858
00:53:36,176 --> 00:53:36,920
True.

859
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:44,670
The bull can't overcome the whole thing and be like, hey, listen, I've chosen the way of peace.

860
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:51,260
The bull is going to do the thing because they have no ability to stop themselves.

861
00:53:52,430 --> 00:54:05,022
I think a better way to make this metaphor work, I guess, is the bull is the audience, alex is the spears, poking them and then getting arrested is the matter to us.

862
00:54:05,156 --> 00:54:06,560
Yeah, that works.

863
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:09,150
Yeah, that's something along the line.

864
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:14,202
And Alexander will deny that he was ever a spear or anything to do with this.

865
00:54:14,396 --> 00:54:22,278
There's the incitement that is being done by Alex, and then there's no false flag or trickery really well.

866
00:54:22,304 --> 00:54:31,206
And even then, Alex could be the matador trying to navigate the bull, but really not having any control over where the bull goes.

867
00:54:31,388 --> 00:54:39,598
And so the bull constantly comes at him and then runs forward, and there's all kinds of collateral damage.

868
00:54:39,694 --> 00:54:42,294
I think the point, though, is that this metaphor isn't good.

869
00:54:42,392 --> 00:54:43,566
No, that is the point.

870
00:54:43,628 --> 00:54:55,806
And Alex is talking about this being like, stage false flag terror attacks that the globalists are going to do and shit and just doesn't work within the framework that he's talking about.

871
00:54:55,928 --> 00:55:04,990
The only way for the bull metaphor to work is Alex understanding that his audience is going to carry out bombing.

872
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:10,782
It's just that they're being provoked into doing it because they think that it's the right thing to do.

873
00:55:10,976 --> 00:55:15,874
I would also accept that it might work if adding actual bull fights.

874
00:55:15,982 --> 00:55:20,130
When the matador pulled the cape aside, the FBI was there.

875
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,870
It's still not a false flag.

876
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:24,438
No, but it would make more sense.

877
00:55:24,524 --> 00:55:28,530
But I think that maybe Alex is thinking of the cape as a flag.

878
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:29,646
Right.

879
00:55:29,768 --> 00:55:30,222
I don't know.

880
00:55:30,236 --> 00:55:30,786
I don't know.

881
00:55:30,848 --> 00:55:32,046
Trying to come up with a way to work.

882
00:55:32,108 --> 00:55:33,234
We're working on it.

883
00:55:33,332 --> 00:55:34,890
We'll figure it out someday.

884
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:43,038
Look, I don't have that many clips from this whole episode, and one of the reasons is because it's incessant false flag talk.

885
00:55:43,124 --> 00:55:46,194
That's really 80% of the content.

886
00:55:46,292 --> 00:55:46,770
Okay.

887
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:57,620
Why do you make an announcement this bold and crazy? Because they're going to pull stuff so damn horrible and they're going to go ahead and make their move on everybody.

888
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:05,602
They'll assassinate Trump, they'll come kill me.

889
00:56:05,736 --> 00:56:07,226
Sure, naturally.

890
00:56:07,298 --> 00:56:08,760
And then they're going to come for you.

891
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:15,710
They're making their move, and they're insane.

892
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:17,650
I will be dead by the midterms.

893
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:23,350
But what are you talking about? Then say you call for violence.

894
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:31,402
He's saying that they're literally coming to kill you and there's no stopping it because he just announced it.

895
00:56:31,536 --> 00:56:36,660
So if he has announced that the war has started, then the war has started.

896
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:39,190
But the war is a trick.

897
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:40,980
What? I don't know.

898
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:45,358
You can't stage false flags if the war has already started.

899
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:49,178
Do you understand? There's no reason to have false flags.

900
00:56:49,274 --> 00:56:50,280
Yes, there is.

901
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:54,974
Because you want to look like you're only fighting defensively.

902
00:56:55,022 --> 00:56:56,350
It's the same thing that Alex wants.

903
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,790
I mean, no, Alex did the thing for Russia.

904
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:02,350
You can just do the thing and then you'll have people lie for you.

905
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,240
True.

906
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:05,710
I mean, that's an option.

907
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:06,480
Yeah.

908
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:09,490
Look, there's holes.

909
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:11,318
Yes, there's holes.

910
00:57:11,354 --> 00:57:11,806
You're right.

911
00:57:11,868 --> 00:57:12,646
My bad.

912
00:57:12,828 --> 00:57:13,522
I'm sorry.

913
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:20,342
I know that part of the fun banter here is missing your ideas.

914
00:57:20,366 --> 00:57:25,606
I'm putting this on you by adopting Alex's ability to patch over things.

915
00:57:25,728 --> 00:57:28,690
But there's too many holes here for me even to really do work on this.

916
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:29,494
That's too hard.

917
00:57:29,592 --> 00:57:40,666
But Alex's tummy hurts, so I told you the last month, my gut level also, intellectual analysis is ten times worse than it's ever been.

918
00:57:51,430 --> 00:58:06,878
that unless we see massive Justice Department whistleblowers now, and unless we see people even in corporate media that know their mercenaries and know what they're doing is wrong, and a lot of them do, unless we just see everybody start coming out and saying, I'm not with this, it's over and again.

919
00:58:07,024 --> 00:58:10,540
Well, we'll just have a war with these people, and we'll show them that's the plan.

920
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:13,950
We don't want to have a war with these psychos.

921
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:18,050
We'll beat them, but in the process, it'll be a Pyrrhic victory.

922
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:19,974
No, you'll lose.

923
00:58:20,082 --> 00:58:20,786
Yeah.

924
00:58:20,968 --> 00:58:23,390
That's why you don't want to really badly.

925
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:25,514
Yeah.

926
00:58:25,552 --> 00:58:28,010
Nobody's actually going to fight a civil war.

927
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,354
No, it would be absurd.

928
00:58:30,402 --> 00:58:32,982
No, I mean, frankly, it'd just be expensive.

929
00:58:33,126 --> 00:58:41,618
There will be more and greater right wing terrorism, and that will be what happens.

930
00:58:41,764 --> 00:58:48,930
You don't want that, really? Because some of that is galvanizing for his community.

931
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:54,546
Denying Oklahoma City bombing is certainly something that they've made a lot of mileage on.

932
00:58:54,608 --> 00:58:54,870
Sure.

933
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,238
It's also a lot of work.

934
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:57,202
It's a hassle.

935
00:58:57,286 --> 00:58:58,554
And you rather not do that.

936
00:58:58,592 --> 00:59:01,160
You rather play in this space.

937
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:08,586
This Schrodinger's bombing space that Alex is in now is much easier to live in.

938
00:59:08,648 --> 00:59:15,222
Well, and I mean, not just that, but if you're going to have a civil war, then you have to have a concept of your end game.

939
00:59:15,416 --> 00:59:23,938
And if you're the terrorist side, then ostensibly your endgame is defensive maintaining your territory.

940
00:59:24,094 --> 00:59:27,310
What is your territory? Occupied Texas.

941
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:28,470
I mean, that's what I'm saying.

942
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:38,900
So if you win the Civil War, do you get all of America, or do you get a certain subsection of America? And you don't want a subsection of America? That would be all right.

943
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:45,790
But how would you get all there's no infrastructure that they can handle.

944
00:59:45,970 --> 00:59:48,020
There's no way to get water.

945
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:52,810
If they win the Civil War, they're like, oh, it's all the Wild West.

946
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:54,114
They can't govern.

947
00:59:54,272 --> 00:59:54,980
True.

948
00:59:55,490 --> 01:00:00,462
You know how, like, Alex believes that Trump is the rightful president of the US.

949
01:00:00,536 --> 01:00:00,954
Sure.

950
01:00:01,052 --> 01:00:05,060
He thinks the Confederacy is the rightful there is that government.

951
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:08,598
The south didn't just not lose this.

952
01:00:08,624 --> 01:00:09,034
Of award.

953
01:00:09,082 --> 01:00:10,446
They won it all the way.

954
01:00:10,508 --> 01:00:10,878
Right.

955
01:00:10,964 --> 01:00:13,122
So he just wants to get back to that.

956
01:00:13,196 --> 01:00:13,902
Right.

957
01:00:14,096 --> 01:00:15,918
That's kind of how you should conceive of that.

958
01:00:15,944 --> 01:00:16,758
That's fair.

959
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:17,670
It's on me.

960
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:18,320
Yeah.

961
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:27,800
Look, I'll guarantee you they got trucks loaded with fuel oil bombs right now.

962
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:30,474
I guarantee you they're going to run the same place again.

963
01:00:30,572 --> 01:00:31,880
They did 95.

964
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:42,654
But if we put enough heat on them and if enough of their minions they're trying to set up as Apaches learn about this, it will neutralize them.

965
01:00:42,752 --> 01:00:43,122
Yeah.

966
01:00:43,196 --> 01:00:45,414
So we got bombs and trucks sure.

967
01:00:45,512 --> 01:00:46,398
Ready to go.

968
01:00:46,484 --> 01:00:46,878
Right.

969
01:00:46,964 --> 01:00:47,358
Today.

970
01:00:47,444 --> 01:00:48,526
This is extreme.

971
01:00:48,658 --> 01:00:49,340
Yeah.

972
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:51,754
If I believed any of this, I'd be pretty scared.

973
01:00:51,862 --> 01:00:52,520
Yeah.

974
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:55,854
This would be a real struggle to get around.

975
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:56,286
Sure.

976
01:00:56,348 --> 01:01:00,406
And I mean, if you believe all of this, like Oakc was a false flag.

977
01:01:00,478 --> 01:01:00,750
Sure.

978
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:08,998
They have fuel bomb trucks ready to go, you kind of have to think that the target would be a civilian target.

979
01:01:09,094 --> 01:01:09,534
Yeah.

980
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:22,566
If you're somebody who just lives and listens to Alex, believes this stuff goes about your day, I don't know how you could not think like, well, maybe the building that I work in could be a target or something.

981
01:01:22,748 --> 01:01:25,282
It's got to be cripplingly scary.

982
01:01:25,426 --> 01:01:32,062
Whether it's a conscious fear or not, there's got to be something that it's awful.

983
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:37,890
And if he's evoking OKC, it's not like it's not like, oh, this only happens in the major cities.

984
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:41,214
It's not a city.

985
01:01:41,252 --> 01:01:46,330
But that is more of the well, it could happen in my suburbs.

986
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:46,830
Yeah.

987
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:51,178
It's a mid range American city, not a metropolis.

988
01:01:51,214 --> 01:01:51,800
Right.

989
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:53,900
Yeah.

990
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:57,020
And I think that's the feeling that he wants the audience to have.

991
01:01:57,410 --> 01:02:00,680
So Alex has some experts that he's talked to.

992
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:04,842
He's not going to say who, but they fucking agree with him.

993
01:02:05,036 --> 01:02:19,830
In the last few days I've talked to high level current Pentagon and high level current CIA and high level Army Special Operations Command and they concur with my analysis 100% and say it's their analysis and then America has never been in more trouble.

994
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:22,400
But obviously those people can't come on the show.

995
01:02:22,850 --> 01:02:34,602
But I can tell you that people that have done this in third world countries and people that have run regime change agree there's an attempt by the leftist arm of the deep state to stage events and permanently bring America into martial law.

996
01:02:34,676 --> 01:02:35,782
That's fucking Steve.

997
01:02:35,866 --> 01:02:36,510
Yeah.

998
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:37,498
That is Steve.

999
01:02:37,534 --> 01:02:39,570
That is 100% of Steve.

1000
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:40,854
Oh, yeah.

1001
01:02:40,952 --> 01:02:48,370
Guys who have run regime change, these are epithets that Alex uses to describe Steve patchanic Patanic alone.

1002
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:49,990
I bet he's talking to Steve.

1003
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:51,594
He's not saying the words though.

1004
01:02:51,632 --> 01:02:55,340
He's back sliding into this past abusive relationship.

1005
01:02:56,090 --> 01:02:57,680
Only a matter of time.

1006
01:02:58,430 --> 01:02:59,370
It is.

1007
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:00,610
You just can't quit.

1008
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:02,862
Just rip the bandaid off and get him back already.

1009
01:03:02,936 --> 01:03:03,498
I know.

1010
01:03:03,584 --> 01:03:13,902
Now, I do think that it would make sense that these high level people agree with Alex because we heard not too long ago that Alex is the.

1011
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:16,566
Fucking leader of the government.

1012
01:03:16,688 --> 01:03:18,800
Yeah, but he doesn't even remember that.

1013
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:20,694
He does not remember that.

1014
01:03:20,732 --> 01:03:24,282
He is not calling people who are until I brought it up.

1015
01:03:24,296 --> 01:03:26,086
You forgot? I completely forgot.

1016
01:03:26,218 --> 01:03:27,462
It's a day to day.

1017
01:03:27,596 --> 01:03:28,974
It's a day to day show.

1018
01:03:29,012 --> 01:03:30,630
No continuity, anything.

1019
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:31,314
Not at all.

1020
01:03:31,352 --> 01:03:34,014
Alex is in charge of the Patriots and the government.

1021
01:03:34,112 --> 01:03:34,842
Yeah.

1022
01:03:35,036 --> 01:03:36,382
They look to him as leader.

1023
01:03:36,406 --> 01:03:40,282
Of course, their analysis intersects.

1024
01:03:40,366 --> 01:03:43,290
What are they doing with analysis? Shouldn't they? No shit.

1025
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:45,560
Yes, but that's what analysis is.

1026
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:50,122
The things they know from the things they know.

1027
01:03:50,196 --> 01:03:57,130
Yeah, but shouldn't he be calling them to confirm his analysis and not have them be like, we were thinking the same thing, bro.

1028
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:00,802
We don't have any explanation or why let me explain this.

1029
01:04:00,996 --> 01:04:03,946
He's just talking shit with people sure.

1030
01:04:04,068 --> 01:04:05,710
Who don't actually have any information.

1031
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:10,490
Well, there's that, and they're not, like, high level he's talking shit with Steve.

1032
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:11,194
Basically.

1033
01:04:11,292 --> 01:04:11,662
Fun.

1034
01:04:11,736 --> 01:04:12,538
It's more fun.

1035
01:04:12,624 --> 01:04:13,270
Yes.

1036
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:22,822
Speaking of not fun, this clip was really where if I were involved in towel throwing sure.

1037
01:04:22,896 --> 01:04:25,318
This is maybe where I would throw the towel on this.

1038
01:04:25,464 --> 01:04:27,590
It kind of brought me back to reality.

1039
01:04:27,770 --> 01:04:28,994
They know they've lost politically.

1040
01:04:29,042 --> 01:04:30,494
They know they're about to lose the election.

1041
01:04:30,602 --> 01:04:33,290
So they are getting ready to stage something huge, ladies and gentlemen.

1042
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:35,218
So the public will at least buy that.

1043
01:04:35,244 --> 01:04:42,778
Oh, because of the big terror attack or whatever or terror attacks or mass shootings or mass poisonings or power outages or whatever it is they're gearing up to do.

1044
01:04:42,864 --> 01:04:49,810
There's a plethora of things they can do within the ball flag realm.

1045
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:58,234
And so I'm just going to be every day on this until the election because they'll want a few weeks to maximize it.

1046
01:04:58,392 --> 01:05:03,540
I'd say we enter the prime zone October 1.

1047
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:08,930
In October after they may go ahead and just start stuff up now and then they may do a bunch of attacks.

1048
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:10,390
They may do one big, giant attack.

1049
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,146
They may do five, six big attacks.

1050
01:05:12,218 --> 01:05:26,834
Is that all part of Operation the truck bombs are loaded, okay? You better believe the mentally ill schizophrenic mass shooters are being programmed and drugged up and are in government CIA numerolder programming centers.

1051
01:05:26,882 --> 01:05:30,514
MKL for operations right now, the Manchurian candidates are ready.

1052
01:05:30,672 --> 01:05:33,194
They are rolling out, guaranteed.

1053
01:05:33,242 --> 01:05:34,682
You can bet your bottom dollar.

1054
01:05:34,826 --> 01:05:41,558
I've been kind of zoning out a little bit at this point because it's just repetitive yelling nonsense about false flags.

1055
01:05:41,654 --> 01:05:54,442
But I kind of got brought back down to the ground by this clip, and it was just like, what are we doing? Like, Alex's conspiracy and this grand false flag that's coming, and Biden's speech is the harbinger for it.

1056
01:05:54,516 --> 01:05:56,690
It all centers around the fucking midterm.

1057
01:05:56,750 --> 01:06:04,970
I mean, the plot for this giant false flag is about creating the public perception that it makes sense for Democrats to win midterm elections.

1058
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:13,680
What is going on? Is this what Alex has been brought to? And it's not just that, but he's listing everything is a sign.

1059
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:18,970
It's not just false flags where it's like, oh, there's an explosion or something.

1060
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:22,306
No, it's like, hey, the power went out for 8 hours.

1061
01:06:22,428 --> 01:06:23,782
They're coming for you.

1062
01:06:23,916 --> 01:06:25,846
Like, oh, shit, the WiFi down.

1063
01:06:25,908 --> 01:06:29,350
Anything could be explained as the jump off anything.

1064
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:29,770
Yeah.

1065
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:32,590
And he's listing random ass shit.

1066
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:40,278
Anybody? Anything rises and the rooster is silent.

1067
01:06:40,374 --> 01:06:41,642
The globalists are coming.

1068
01:06:41,716 --> 01:06:47,118
If someone looks shifty at you in the grocery store, that's the size right there's.

1069
01:06:47,154 --> 01:06:48,006
No escape.

1070
01:06:48,078 --> 01:06:48,350
Yes.

1071
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:53,330
If you see a rainbow and the colors are inverted tomorrow, it's going to be fine.

1072
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:55,420
I can't hang with that.

1073
01:06:57,310 --> 01:06:58,334
They've been beaten back.

1074
01:06:58,372 --> 01:07:00,474
We have neutralized the car bomb.

1075
01:07:00,582 --> 01:07:04,542
What are you doing to me? Yeah, it's insane.

1076
01:07:04,626 --> 01:07:08,034
And the notion that it's about the midterms is just pathetic.

1077
01:07:08,082 --> 01:07:31,650
I can't there was at least a self seriousness that Alex had in earlier times in his career where this would look embarrassing for him to be, like, going so far out of his way to create these elaborate conspiracy theories about something like a midterm election.

1078
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:47,974
How obsessed is he with treating politics like sports and like a pop culture kind of thing that he's doing this about a midterm? Yeah.

1079
01:07:48,072 --> 01:07:49,226
So sad.

1080
01:07:49,418 --> 01:07:50,446
Yes, man.

1081
01:07:50,628 --> 01:07:51,778
He's supposed to be above this.

1082
01:07:51,804 --> 01:07:54,998
He used to do 911, dude, and now you're at the midterm.

1083
01:07:55,034 --> 01:07:59,366
Well, he's trying to pretend that 911 is coming in order for Democrats to win a midterm.

1084
01:08:04,570 --> 01:08:06,498
It's the most important election of our lifetime.

1085
01:08:06,534 --> 01:08:07,190
Stan.

1086
01:08:07,630 --> 01:08:09,690
I think that a lot of people very rightly.

1087
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:12,650
Critique that kind of rhetoric all over the place.

1088
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,380
And I think that's fine.

1089
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:19,766
I think that Alex is doing a substantially worse version of it.

1090
01:08:19,888 --> 01:08:21,222
More extreme version.

1091
01:08:21,366 --> 01:08:22,206
What a bummer.

1092
01:08:22,278 --> 01:08:22,802
Yeah.

1093
01:08:22,936 --> 01:08:32,718
So Alex takes some calls and he wants to talk to people who are like, in the military, hey, are you going to bomb something? Because it should be a false flag.

1094
01:08:32,814 --> 01:08:33,566
Don't bomb something.

1095
01:08:33,628 --> 01:08:35,546
He doesn't grill up people about that.

1096
01:08:35,728 --> 01:08:39,026
I think I would if I took over Info Wars for a day.

1097
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:41,382
I would be like, okay, I'm taking calls.

1098
01:08:41,466 --> 01:08:50,402
My first question to everyone, have you or are you about to build a bomb? Well, I think that in the past I have heard people say, like, alex, I want to talk to you off air.

1099
01:08:50,476 --> 01:08:53,800
Yeah, I think some of those people might say that off air.

1100
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:55,910
Maybe not on the radio.

1101
01:08:56,350 --> 01:09:00,566
But he says he wants to take calls from military folk who know things.

1102
01:09:00,688 --> 01:09:01,406
Sure.

1103
01:09:01,588 --> 01:09:08,210
And I would suggest that this is a bad strategy because it incentivizes people to lie about being in the military.

1104
01:09:08,530 --> 01:09:12,882
If I'm only taking calls from military people like, oh, hey, guess what? Now I'm military.

1105
01:09:12,966 --> 01:09:24,810
Yeah, I don't know if you recall that story of the Bundys and all those dudes sitting around talking about their fucking military experience, all their wartime shit.

1106
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:27,002
None of them had ever been in the army at all.

1107
01:09:27,076 --> 01:09:38,830
Yeah, Dave Anthony brought that up on alex takes a call from somebody who is allegedly maybe national security or maybe Ice.

1108
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:40,470
Who knows? It could be anybody.

1109
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:44,818
His resume is dubious and he has some news about a bomb.

1110
01:09:44,974 --> 01:09:50,722
Tony is a 15 year Homeland Security and he wants to give us his view on this from Washington, DC.

1111
01:09:50,806 --> 01:09:51,930
Go ahead, Tony.

1112
01:09:52,610 --> 01:09:54,558
Hey, how are you doing, Alan? Hey, God bless you once again.

1113
01:09:54,584 --> 01:09:59,410
But, hey, I'm calling because I'm 15 year former federal employee for custom Border protection work for Ice.

1114
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:04,040
But I'm calling in regard to the whole entire thing about everything is coming about.

1115
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:07,278
As you know, six months ago, I walked away from the federal government.

1116
01:10:07,424 --> 01:10:09,394
They wanted us to do the vaccine mandates.

1117
01:10:09,442 --> 01:10:14,958
And I told my orchest email there's about nine to 12% of us to walk away.

1118
01:10:14,984 --> 01:10:20,550
But there will be something coming every couple of months, of which I got numerous members when I still work there.

1119
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:27,574
And more likely, it's going to be a nuclear bomb minus the plutonium or the uranium it's going to set off, and that's going to be one of the new set of lockdowns.

1120
01:10:27,622 --> 01:10:35,530
So not a nuclear bomb, suitcase nukes, power outages, but without the tax they blame on the Russians.

1121
01:10:35,650 --> 01:10:36,982
I believe all that's in the cards.

1122
01:10:37,006 --> 01:10:38,720
But that's what you guys are getting briefed on.

1123
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:40,542
It's one of the things we're getting briefed on.

1124
01:10:40,556 --> 01:10:43,938
But minus the radiation still, there won't be no radiation that's going to be set off.

1125
01:10:43,964 --> 01:10:53,650
It's all going to be and that's going to be one of the ways that they said with the vaccine, one of the way they feared people, some people are going to be also afraid of nuclear, but it's really classic explosive.

1126
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:59,574
Or are you saying it's going to be a neutron bomb? We got supplies for the last two years.

1127
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:01,542
They've been planning this stuff for the last two years.

1128
01:11:01,676 --> 01:11:07,654
As you know about the body bags, myself, my former office, we had over 200,000 body bags all over the entire spot.

1129
01:11:07,702 --> 01:11:08,646
Sure, you said something.

1130
01:11:08,768 --> 01:11:10,834
They're saying it's a nuclear bomb minus radiation.

1131
01:11:10,882 --> 01:11:15,442
That's a neutron bomb, which is kissinger and Brazevski are obsessed with neutron bombs.

1132
01:11:15,466 --> 01:11:17,026
And he populate America.

1133
01:11:17,218 --> 01:11:19,170
This guy sounds a little speedy.

1134
01:11:19,610 --> 01:11:25,414
I mean, he's more chatty than any CBP officer I've ever not anymore.

1135
01:11:25,582 --> 01:11:28,438
He's not part of it because he left over vaccine mandates.

1136
01:11:28,474 --> 01:11:30,054
Yeah, six months ago.

1137
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:30,522
Sure.

1138
01:11:30,596 --> 01:11:32,562
Vaccine mandates six months ago.

1139
01:11:32,576 --> 01:11:35,962
Also, a neutron bomb is not just a nuke minus the radiation.

1140
01:11:36,046 --> 01:11:42,954
There's still tons of radiation, but the concept is to minimize the longevity that the radiation is there.

1141
01:11:42,992 --> 01:11:49,878
So the affected areas have inhabited more quickly, and we get people back in.

1142
01:11:50,024 --> 01:12:00,034
But I guess that we should be on the lookout for nuclear bombs that have no radiation involved because this high level Ice insider has warned of it and Alex has agreed this is a serious concern.

1143
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:02,778
So we should probably be really worried about this.

1144
01:12:02,864 --> 01:12:05,322
This is definitely worth your mind space.

1145
01:12:05,516 --> 01:12:06,054
Yeah.

1146
01:12:06,152 --> 01:12:19,400
A guy dubiously associated with federal government programs, ostensibly not on speed right now, telling me that nuclear bombs without plutonium are going to hit people.

1147
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:21,942
I'm going to go with a pass on this one.

1148
01:12:22,016 --> 01:12:24,558
You pass? I pass because Alex said I agree.

1149
01:12:24,704 --> 01:12:25,746
I'm going to pass.

1150
01:12:25,868 --> 01:12:27,558
I'm going to go with a pass on this one.

1151
01:12:27,584 --> 01:12:30,358
So we finally serve the shark tank.

1152
01:12:30,514 --> 01:12:32,598
Alex is the one going with this business.

1153
01:12:32,684 --> 01:12:34,258
We found the difference between you and Alex.

1154
01:12:34,294 --> 01:12:34,880
Yeah.

1155
01:12:35,210 --> 01:12:36,202
So we get another caller.

1156
01:12:36,226 --> 01:12:37,362
He's got an idea.

1157
01:12:37,556 --> 01:12:39,080
Great to talk to you.

1158
01:12:39,410 --> 01:12:44,960
My personal opinion is that they're bringing the borders wide open.

1159
01:12:45,830 --> 01:12:49,798
If you notice, there's a lot of Ukrainians coming through there I haven't noticed.

1160
01:12:49,834 --> 01:12:54,522
And they're you going to use these Ukrainians because Biden has connections with those people.

1161
01:12:54,596 --> 01:12:55,738
The Russians in Florida.

1162
01:12:55,774 --> 01:12:58,558
Ukrainians may say false flags in Europe and America.

1163
01:12:58,594 --> 01:12:59,226
I agree.

1164
01:12:59,348 --> 01:13:01,520
That they would stand again from it.

1165
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:08,098
And they're going to dress them up in Trump gear and have them do some stuff and bam.

1166
01:13:08,194 --> 01:13:08,922
Martial law.

1167
01:13:08,996 --> 01:13:20,466
So look out for Ukrainians dressed up as Trump supporters carrying neutron bombs and also trucks with fuel bombs already gassed up and ready to go.

1168
01:13:20,648 --> 01:13:22,902
Boy, we got a lot of things to worry about.

1169
01:13:22,976 --> 01:13:24,450
This is a concern.

1170
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:25,894
Fuck.

1171
01:13:25,942 --> 01:13:27,450
Shot of concern.

1172
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:35,862
Did he say that he hasn't seen Ukrainians coming through the border? Seen so many of them.

1173
01:13:35,876 --> 01:13:36,198
He has.

1174
01:13:36,224 --> 01:13:37,254
Not so many.

1175
01:13:37,292 --> 01:13:39,150
Where? Mexico.

1176
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:42,526
Ukrainians are going through Mexico.

1177
01:13:42,598 --> 01:13:42,798
Yeah.

1178
01:13:42,824 --> 01:13:44,710
They fly to El Salvador.

1179
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:55,590
What are we doing if Ukrainians are coming through the border? Well, there's a tunnel from Ukraine to Brazil and then they these are the ballots from North Korea.

1180
01:13:56,030 --> 01:13:57,550
Ballots from North Korea.

1181
01:13:57,610 --> 01:14:00,990
You know the tunnel, how it connects France and UK.

1182
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:02,060
Okay.

1183
01:14:02,690 --> 01:14:03,942
They have that.

1184
01:14:04,136 --> 01:14:06,130
It's between Ukraine and Brazil.

1185
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:11,190
Ukrainians are in Odessa and they're like, Listen, we could go to the United States.

1186
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:13,566
But those motherfuckers, you can't trust them.

1187
01:14:13,688 --> 01:14:15,618
We're going to head to Mexico first.

1188
01:14:15,704 --> 01:14:21,198
We're going to take the land route to get through Arizona or whatever.

1189
01:14:21,284 --> 01:14:22,986
We might be thinking about this wrong.

1190
01:14:23,048 --> 01:14:23,454
Okay.

1191
01:14:23,552 --> 01:14:27,234
You know there's an Odessa in Texas? I did not know that.

1192
01:14:27,272 --> 01:14:28,810
There's an Odessa in Ukraine.

1193
01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:33,210
Is there a teleportation device between Odessa? Okay, now we're talking.

1194
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:34,018
I think there's a portal.

1195
01:14:34,054 --> 01:14:34,806
You might be right.

1196
01:14:34,868 --> 01:14:36,934
I think we're in portal territory.

1197
01:14:37,102 --> 01:14:41,226
That makes it all a lot easier to get a suitcase nuke through.

1198
01:14:41,288 --> 01:14:44,358
I would think so, anyway.

1199
01:14:44,444 --> 01:14:47,358
And Biden has connections with quote, those people.

1200
01:14:47,444 --> 01:14:48,186
The whole country.

1201
01:14:48,248 --> 01:14:49,182
The whole country.

1202
01:14:49,316 --> 01:14:53,194
So we have one caller who disagrees with Alex.

1203
01:14:53,242 --> 01:14:53,814
Interesting.

1204
01:14:53,972 --> 01:14:57,954
This is a good example of why it's pointless to disagree with Alex on his show.

1205
01:14:58,112 --> 01:14:59,946
Let's race through your calls right now.

1206
01:15:00,008 --> 01:15:02,554
Let's go to John in Vegas.

1207
01:15:02,602 --> 01:15:03,414
John, thanks for calling.

1208
01:15:03,452 --> 01:15:04,160
Go ahead.

1209
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:14,706
Yeah, I'm looking at the Biden transcript right now and I don't see a single thing that you're talking about in this? I tell you what.

1210
01:15:14,768 --> 01:15:20,370
What you're doing, edging your audience constantly is embarrassing and a shame.

1211
01:15:21,110 --> 01:15:22,594
You're a seminar caller.

1212
01:15:22,702 --> 01:15:25,834
You said you were calling on the Air Force about the Biden speech.

1213
01:15:25,942 --> 01:15:29,674
I can play the clips right now while you're gaslighting.

1214
01:15:29,842 --> 01:15:33,140
Even the Washington Post said it was basically a declaration of war.

1215
01:15:33,650 --> 01:15:36,450
They're saying Republicans are planning violence everywhere.

1216
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:41,062
Are you denying he's up there with troops behind him? That's unprecedented.

1217
01:15:41,086 --> 01:15:46,590
For a president to give a speech with troops at nighttime with red light behind him, unprecedented.

1218
01:15:47,450 --> 01:15:49,290
I'm denying that.

1219
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:51,498
I've had enough said.

1220
01:15:51,524 --> 01:15:52,914
You disagree and have legitimate points.

1221
01:15:52,952 --> 01:15:53,706
I talked to you.

1222
01:15:53,768 --> 01:15:55,258
I'm not going to play your games.

1223
01:15:55,414 --> 01:15:58,174
I got stacks of articles and controlling our thermostats.

1224
01:15:58,282 --> 01:15:58,890
Their child.

1225
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:02,374
I'm sorry, what the border they're saying Republicans are about at the Hill.

1226
01:16:02,482 --> 01:16:07,650
I'm not even going to humor you and play the Cliffs everybody obviously speech last night.

1227
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:13,926
So this caller is a good example of why you can't really inject disagreement on Alex's own show, even if you have a valid point.

1228
01:16:13,988 --> 01:16:16,894
Like how none of the things Alex is saying about buying and speech are accurate.

1229
01:16:16,942 --> 01:16:17,334
True.

1230
01:16:17,432 --> 01:16:24,462
Alex could just hang up on you, talk over you, call you a seminar caller and create fake reasons to not engage with any of your points.

1231
01:16:24,596 --> 01:16:28,774
He can list off weird, unrelated talking points to distract his listeners.

1232
01:16:28,822 --> 01:16:37,014
Like what exactly does your thermostat have to do with whether or not the way Alex is discussing Biden's speech is accurate? It has nothing to do with that.

1233
01:16:37,052 --> 01:16:46,966
I believe he was actually speaking literally in that because if you scan the sentence, then he's actually the stacks of articles themselves that are controlling our thermostats.

1234
01:16:47,098 --> 01:16:51,080
So that was just letting everybody know that the stacks of articles have taken over.

1235
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:59,730
The amount of printing and wasting of paper and non recycling that Alex does taking over added impact on climate change.

1236
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:02,818
You got it to the point where governments have had to control your thermostat.

1237
01:17:02,854 --> 01:17:06,118
Controlling our thermostats because we can't stop printing stacks.

1238
01:17:06,154 --> 01:17:10,410
History will reflect that our culture was brought down by stacky.

1239
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:13,594
That is a theory.

1240
01:17:13,642 --> 01:17:15,034
Automobiles and Stackis.

1241
01:17:15,142 --> 01:17:22,542
So Alex can also just move the goal posts and pretend that if only you'd been honest about why you called in, he would have engaged with your points.

1242
01:17:22,676 --> 01:17:24,118
No, you're just playing games.

1243
01:17:24,154 --> 01:17:32,374
He cannot play any of the clips and present his unwillingness to present his own evidence as an unwillingness to engage with your games that you're playing.

1244
01:17:32,542 --> 01:17:34,486
Calling and disagreeing with Alex is pointless.

1245
01:17:34,558 --> 01:17:48,262
And even though the prime directive of our show to not interfere with infowars is kind of destroyed because of our presence at the trial and my work with the plaintiffs, I still think that it's important to point out that this just isn't something that's going to go anywhere.

1246
01:17:48,346 --> 01:17:51,862
I would not incentivize that behavior.

1247
01:17:52,006 --> 01:17:57,982
Although I do kind of wrestle with this because I think that person probably is a listener of our show because he used the edging.

1248
01:17:58,066 --> 01:18:06,774
I mean, I'm not saying that we've popularized edging, but I don't think I've heard I feel like I haven't heard terrorist edging anywhere else.

1249
01:18:06,812 --> 01:18:09,646
Yeah, like Pez dispenser for protocols.

1250
01:18:09,718 --> 01:18:13,774
Yeah, I think those are things that might be specifically ours.

1251
01:18:13,822 --> 01:18:14,394
Yeah.

1252
01:18:14,552 --> 01:18:19,150
Or at least they give the suspicion strongly.

1253
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:25,230
And so I kind of considered not playing that clip even because I'm like, that might be someone who lives in the Star Show.

1254
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:27,034
But it wasn't fucking with Alex.

1255
01:18:27,082 --> 01:18:30,606
It wasn't trying to mess with him.

1256
01:18:30,728 --> 01:18:34,626
It was just giving a disagreement about the point that he was making.

1257
01:18:34,688 --> 01:18:39,150
And it doesn't necessarily using the edging doesn't necessarily mean he listens to the show.

1258
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:44,314
It could be one of those words that just starts to get popularized through the poster.

1259
01:18:44,362 --> 01:18:56,274
Yeah, but the only reason I'm even bringing it up is I've not played in the past times or I'm like that's someone who lives in store because I don't want to incentivize that.

1260
01:18:56,372 --> 01:19:19,194
I don't want people to think, like if they can't get on our show through, I don't want anyone to think of that as like something or that will be, hey, good job, fuck it with Alex, or a thing that people compete with each other on, like, oh, if it's funny enough, it'll get on the show.

1261
01:19:19,232 --> 01:19:20,250
That's not going to happen.

1262
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:34,638
Yeah, this is just a good teachable moment where this person had a point that Alex could not respond to and you see all of the methods that he deploys immediately in order to get out of this call.

1263
01:19:34,784 --> 01:19:43,810
Delegitimize the person as a seminar caller, accuse them of gaslighting, say, I would play the clips, but you don't deserve it because you lied.

1264
01:19:43,870 --> 01:19:49,698
I would engage with your points, but you lied and yell over them before they agree with this.

1265
01:19:49,844 --> 01:19:56,060
Well, I disagree and obviously the point is going to be I disagree with the way you're exactly just cut it off.

1266
01:19:56,810 --> 01:19:57,982
It's nonsense.

1267
01:19:58,126 --> 01:19:59,814
It's not somebody who you can engage with.

1268
01:19:59,852 --> 01:20:01,100
There's no win.

1269
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:04,978
So Alex is the psych warfare guest.

1270
01:20:05,074 --> 01:20:05,730
John.

1271
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:07,018
It's not Steve, Jetty.

1272
01:20:07,054 --> 01:20:08,386
No, unfortunately.

1273
01:20:08,578 --> 01:20:15,210
And we're not going to listen to much of it because I found it to be a little bit like, I don't know, boring.

1274
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:23,014
But we have one clip here and I don't think that this is exactly the beginning that Alex wanted to this interview.

1275
01:20:23,122 --> 01:20:26,310
Professor Matthias Desmond is in studio with us for the next hour.

1276
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:33,406
Plus, he is recognized as the world's leading expert on theory of mass formation psychology and psychosis.

1277
01:20:33,478 --> 01:20:45,934
Applies to Covenant Pandemic, professor of Clinical Psychology, Department of Psychology, Educational Sciences at Gint University, Belgium, and practicing psychologist.

1278
01:20:45,982 --> 01:20:49,422
He worked in discussing widely in the media and he's here with us.

1279
01:20:49,436 --> 01:20:53,106
Of course, he's well known for the Joe Rogan Show as well.

1280
01:20:53,228 --> 01:21:01,554
He wanted to get right into Biden's speech professor and just how art typical it is with at night time with troops behind him with red light.

1281
01:21:01,712 --> 01:21:12,822
It's right out of V for Vendetta, it's right out of Nazi Germany, it's right out of Stalin Russia, it's right out of North Korea and saying, our enemies are going to be bad and we've got to have a war with them.

1282
01:21:12,896 --> 01:21:16,290
What did you make of that? And it's great to have you here with us.

1283
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:16,866
Yes.

1284
01:21:16,928 --> 01:21:17,540
Well.

1285
01:21:19,670 --> 01:21:22,386
This speech definitely puts us at risk of something.

1286
01:21:22,568 --> 01:21:25,786
And it is that it entices the people who are targeted.

1287
01:21:25,858 --> 01:21:33,766
Namely those people who are referred to by President Biden as mega extremists.

1288
01:21:33,898 --> 01:21:37,450
That it entices these people to act upon their aggression.

1289
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:51,046
And that's what should be avoided at all times because it will be counterproductive and self destructive if people act upon the regression because the system can perfectly control aggression.

1290
01:21:51,178 --> 01:22:12,426
I believe that it is of crucial importance that we stick to the principles of nonviolent resistance and that we realize that the first and foremost enemy we have to watch is that part of the enemy that is in ourselves, namely this aggression that might entice us to act in a violent way.

1291
01:22:12,548 --> 01:22:14,514
This is not really what Alex wanted.

1292
01:22:14,612 --> 01:22:17,146
The professor isn't describing a false flag.

1293
01:22:17,218 --> 01:22:25,602
He's saying that Biden speech was possibly a bad idea because it'll be used as justification for people who want to do violent things when they do violent things.

1294
01:22:25,676 --> 01:22:26,166
Right.

1295
01:22:26,288 --> 01:22:33,814
This isn't good with Alex's concepts because it basically is admitting that Alex's community are largely inclined towards violence.

1296
01:22:33,922 --> 01:22:39,882
They don't have a good handle on that internal enemy that is aggression and are begging for someone to give them a reason to act on.

1297
01:22:39,896 --> 01:22:56,914
It pretty much understood appropriately, this episode has basically been Alex tripping over himself to frame Biden's speech in a way that inflames that aggression in his audience, but pays lip service to not wanting any violence so he can evade any accusations that he's causing and calling for terrorist acts.

1298
01:22:56,962 --> 01:22:57,282
Right.

1299
01:22:57,356 --> 01:23:09,090
Put simply, I don't respect anybody who accepts a booking on Infowars, but this guy is coming at the conversation of Biden speech from a completely different perspective than Alex, and I think that their views are actually at odds with each other.

1300
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:09,606
Oh, yeah.

1301
01:23:09,668 --> 01:23:21,034
I disagree with the professor's point mostly because if taken to its logical conclusion, you end up in a place where criticizing any potentially violent segment of the population is bad because it will trigger their aggression.

1302
01:23:21,142 --> 01:23:26,482
But I do accept that his point is at least connected to reality and it's something that can be debated.

1303
01:23:26,566 --> 01:23:26,886
Yeah.

1304
01:23:26,948 --> 01:23:32,886
Alex's position is more or less just rooted in his feelings, and it's not something you can refute at all.

1305
01:23:32,948 --> 01:23:36,142
It would be pointless to argue with him about the conversation.

1306
01:23:36,286 --> 01:23:53,720
Is Alex saying, when the people that I've riled up do violence a false flag? And his conversation is actually they shouldn't do violence because that is the thing.

1307
01:23:55,070 --> 01:24:03,714
But if you say that to Alex's listeners, then they won't do violence, and then there won't be a false flag because there won't actually be an actual attack.

1308
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:09,730
So those two conversations are in direct opposition in terms of goals.

1309
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:14,206
Well, Alex kind of winks at the like, don't do violence.

1310
01:24:14,398 --> 01:24:19,770
This is an attempt to his metaphor with the matador.

1311
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:26,720
If you just have the metaphor, it is what this doctor or the professor is saying.

1312
01:24:27,710 --> 01:24:34,410
This is an attempt to lure you into doing something as opposed to it being fake.

1313
01:24:34,730 --> 01:24:50,610
But that's not the larger way that unless, and I accept this as a possibility, if false flag as a term includes people doing things they shouldn't do because Biden made them angry right.

1314
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:53,790
Then false flag loses any meaning as a term.

1315
01:24:54,110 --> 01:24:58,602
So if Alex is describing that as something that qualifies as a false flag right.

1316
01:24:58,736 --> 01:25:06,978
Then I would say we have passed the point where any definition yeah.

1317
01:25:07,124 --> 01:25:18,246
Because the idea of false flag has to include I planned this to achieve the opposite of what theoretically, I want something on somebody else.

1318
01:25:18,308 --> 01:25:18,750
Exactly.

1319
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:25,738
I do an illegal thing to frame a person, which implies intent.

1320
01:25:25,894 --> 01:25:35,000
Whereas this is, if you include the quote unquote tricked me into doing a thing that I wanted to do already.

1321
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:37,186
That's just responsibility.

1322
01:25:37,318 --> 01:25:42,598
That's just called responsible for your entrapment because I didn't like Biden's speech.

1323
01:25:42,694 --> 01:25:43,386
Yeah.

1324
01:25:43,568 --> 01:25:44,166
I don't know.

1325
01:25:44,228 --> 01:25:49,678
It's not really like it is a little bit like, if you're like, okay, hey, here's a good speech.

1326
01:25:49,834 --> 01:26:02,420
People shouldn't steal from the grocery store because people need food, and they're like, oh, that makes me want to steal from grocery stores, but when I did, it was because he tricked me.

1327
01:26:04,050 --> 01:26:05,770
Yeah, that makes sense.

1328
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:06,410
It doesn't.

1329
01:26:06,470 --> 01:26:07,150
I like it.

1330
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:07,846
Yeah.

1331
01:26:08,028 --> 01:26:26,510
And I think that one of the things you should take away from this is that regardless of whether Alex is talking incoherently with this metaphor and stuff, or if he really does believe that if you bomb something because you're mad at Biden's speech, that's a false flag.

1332
01:26:26,630 --> 01:26:29,842
Whatever the case, the term false flag is meaningless to him.

1333
01:26:29,916 --> 01:26:35,750
It is a signifier of something that is just like, don't take this seriously.

1334
01:26:35,870 --> 01:26:50,354
For his audience to not accept any kind of idea that the information space that they live in and the stuff that Alex disseminates is part of the violence is part of inflaming that aggression.

1335
01:26:50,462 --> 01:26:51,514
Ignore that.

1336
01:26:51,612 --> 01:26:53,050
That's what false flag means.

1337
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:53,314
Yes.

1338
01:26:53,352 --> 01:27:00,046
It means don't include this in your balance of consequences of this world view.

1339
01:27:00,168 --> 01:27:15,334
Ironically, to return to an earlier metaphor that Alex himself made, if you are taking your three year old daughter to the zoo and you're looking at an elephant and you go, that's not a fucking elephant, that's some fake elephant, then that's more like what Alex is doing.

1340
01:27:15,372 --> 01:27:20,462
Again, the trip to the zoo has been canceled because Alex needs to record this three hour video that he ended up not recording.

1341
01:27:20,486 --> 01:27:21,614
It's a real bummer.

1342
01:27:21,782 --> 01:27:23,450
Maybe next time a little lucy.

1343
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:28,210
So this interview with this guy I found very boring.

1344
01:27:31,090 --> 01:27:44,598
He's talking about this idea of, like, mass formation, which is the idea that part of the population has been tricked into thinking COVID is real and that because of he's not saying Covet is fake.

1345
01:27:44,634 --> 01:27:45,302
Sure.

1346
01:27:45,496 --> 01:27:51,890
That we need to do all this stuff in order to battle Covet and they're in a hypnotic state, more or less.

1347
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,898
But if you listen to it, if you want to, go ahead.

1348
01:27:55,984 --> 01:28:12,002
But if you do, you'll notice that a lot of maybe all of the things that he is describing as being indicative of this sort of hypnotic state that people are in kind of describe people who support Trump.

1349
01:28:12,076 --> 01:28:12,700
Right.

1350
01:28:13,150 --> 01:28:20,430
And I found it to be an uncompelling interview and get his verbal patterns.

1351
01:28:20,490 --> 01:28:22,362
It's very boring.

1352
01:28:22,446 --> 01:28:23,486
I hate it.

1353
01:28:23,668 --> 01:28:29,380
I really don't like that he's using terms that I think Alex is kind of not understanding and dancing around.

1354
01:28:30,850 --> 01:28:31,550
I don't care.

1355
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:32,534
That makes sense.

1356
01:28:32,692 --> 01:28:37,362
It has very little to do with what I think is important, which is Alex's response to Biden's speech.

1357
01:28:37,446 --> 01:28:37,730
Right.

1358
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:40,540
And so we will leave it off there.

1359
01:28:41,830 --> 01:28:44,970
So be worried about Ukrainians dressed as Trump supporters.

1360
01:28:45,030 --> 01:28:46,526
Really forgot that already.

1361
01:28:46,648 --> 01:28:47,586
Suitcase nukes.

1362
01:28:47,658 --> 01:28:48,290
Yeah.

1363
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:53,526
Anytime you see portals are always be afraid of portals.

1364
01:28:53,598 --> 01:28:58,074
You should be worried about the possibility of fuel bombs and trucks.

1365
01:28:58,122 --> 01:28:58,720
Sure.

1366
01:28:59,830 --> 01:29:02,102
And also the midterms coming up.

1367
01:29:02,236 --> 01:29:04,000
Very important.

1368
01:29:04,630 --> 01:29:08,390
Also, you notice Alex is like, doing all this stuff, but he's not saying go vote.

1369
01:29:11,510 --> 01:29:17,802
He's spending hours talking about the dangers of these false flags, but not at all.

1370
01:29:17,996 --> 01:29:18,982
Get out and vote.

1371
01:29:19,066 --> 01:29:25,700
There's no real like, there isn't as much like, hey, inforge is going to sponsor registration, drive.

1372
01:29:26,510 --> 01:29:27,390
None of that stuff.

1373
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:30,510
More just be scared of even whenever.

1374
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:35,382
Listen, Laura Louver MTG, you need to be in the office.

1375
01:29:35,456 --> 01:29:36,198
You need to be there.

1376
01:29:36,224 --> 01:29:38,300
He's never like, I hope people vote for you.

1377
01:29:39,410 --> 01:29:40,882
I hope people strong arm.

1378
01:29:40,906 --> 01:29:48,934
You might say that occasionally people need to go out and support Laura Loomer, but I think more it's like donate to her campaign.

1379
01:29:48,982 --> 01:29:49,760
Yes, exactly.

1380
01:29:50,630 --> 01:29:52,962
It's all money anyway.

1381
01:29:53,036 --> 01:29:55,282
We'll be back, Jordan, with another episode.

1382
01:29:55,366 --> 01:29:56,206
Indeed.

1383
01:29:56,398 --> 01:29:59,910
But until then, we have a website.

1384
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:00,678
We sure do.

1385
01:30:00,704 --> 01:30:04,686
It's knowledgeright.com and the 2024 midterms.com.

1386
01:30:04,748 --> 01:30:05,358
God damn it.

1387
01:30:05,384 --> 01:30:08,070
Which is intentional because we have it with a z.

1388
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:13,158
No, but it's the 2022 midterms.com.

1389
01:30:13,244 --> 01:30:14,720
We don't actually have that website.

1390
01:30:15,050 --> 01:30:15,762
This is me.

1391
01:30:15,836 --> 01:30:17,060
We'll get it there.

1392
01:30:17,510 --> 01:30:18,574
Obviously, we're on Twitter.

1393
01:30:18,622 --> 01:30:19,102
We are on Twitter.

1394
01:30:19,126 --> 01:30:21,018
Is that now? We'll be back.

1395
01:30:21,044 --> 01:30:22,198
But until then, I'm neo.

1396
01:30:22,234 --> 01:30:22,846
I'm Leo.

1397
01:30:22,918 --> 01:30:24,130
I'm dzx Clark.

1398
01:30:24,190 --> 01:30:25,126
I'm Darrell.

1399
01:30:25,198 --> 01:30:26,662
Grabbed grabbel of the sniper.

1400
01:30:26,686 --> 01:30:27,022
Snapple.

1401
01:30:27,046 --> 01:30:28,042
It's another relative.

1402
01:30:28,126 --> 01:30:28,722
There we go.

1403
01:30:28,796 --> 01:30:30,874
And now here comes the sex robot.

1404
01:30:30,922 --> 01:30:32,298
Andy and Janzas, you're on the air.

1405
01:30:32,324 --> 01:30:35,554
Thanks for holding, Alex.

1406
01:30:35,602 --> 01:30:36,502
I'm a first time caller.

1407
01:30:36,526 --> 01:30:37,294
I'm a huge fan.

1408
01:30:37,342 --> 01:30:38,106
I love your work.

1409
01:30:38,168 --> 01:30:38,460
I love you.
