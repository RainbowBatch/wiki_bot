00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air, thanks for holding.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,280
Hello Alex, I'm a first time caller, I'm a huge fan, I love your work.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:07,920
I love you.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,120
Hey everybody, how's it going?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,040
Boy, welcome to Knowledge Fight.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,080
That is our official opening theme song.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,800
I love you.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,600
I love you.

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,640
I will marry you.

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,760
If you're joining us for the first time, which of course you are.

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,800
You have to be.

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,040
This is a show where I am going to have a little discussion with my friend Jordan here.

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,560
That's me, I'm Jordan Holmes.

14
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,200
Also I'm Dan.

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,160
We're off to a great start.

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,040
Clunky off the top.

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,120
Experienced podcaster Dan Friesen.

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,600
Totally.

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,080
Yes.

20
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,120
I've been doing this for years and yet out the gates.

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,360
Still can't introduce himself.

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,160
Clunk City.

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,960
That is also the name of this podcast.

24
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,560
Info Wars Wars Clunk City.

25
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,720
The clunked remix.

26
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,480
Chopped and clunked.

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,560
So I have for the last while been a bit obsessed with one Alex Jones of Info Wars fame.

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:16,080
And as the world has turned to quote a soap opera title, I have become more and more aware

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,600
that I want to do a better job of covering what he does.

30
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,240
Right.

31
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,640
It's kind of like a Chris Hardwick thing where it's like the talking dead.

32
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:24,960
Right.

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,840
I want to do that.

34
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,640
You want to do an Alex Jones after show.

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,200
Yeah exactly.

36
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,080
Where we all sit around wondering who's going to die next week.

37
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,480
Exactly.

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,680
Spoiler alert.

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,320
It's all of us.

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:34,480
Yeah.

41
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,640
We're all dead.

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,160
But I want to say this.

43
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,160
I want to be very clear about a couple things.

44
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,120
Because I think it would be so easy to get things misconstrued off the top and I don't

45
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,560
want those things to ever come up as a confusion.

46
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:50,960
Okay.

47
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,200
First thing, I in no way want Alex Jones to be taken off the air.

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,600
Right.

49
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,440
I think what he does is...

50
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,280
Well one, when this podcast blows up and we're the number one podcast next year, our careers

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,760
are entirely tied to his continued success.

52
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,560
So we need him.

53
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,360
Yeah we need him.

54
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,400
I think what he does borders on entertaining and on the other side of that border is irresponsible.

55
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,120
But at the same time, I am so opposed to censoring things.

56
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,840
I want people to view him in context.

57
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,000
But I would never want to shut him down or say like he can't do what he does.

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,720
Right.

59
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,960
Because that's an easy attack.

60
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,520
And it's a slippery slope.

61
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,080
It is.

62
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,320
Yeah.

63
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,720
It is.

64
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,000
If you can go after him, who's next you know?

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,760
Like as people who say like professionally say dumb shit.

66
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,260
Sure.

67
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,080
On stages.

68
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,400
Yeah exactly.

69
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,280
On microphones.

70
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,080
Exactly.

71
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,080
Recorded in some instances.

72
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,440
Yeah very foolishly on my part.

73
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,240
Yeah exactly.

74
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,280
If we start going after those guys, you know, somebody's next that we like.

75
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,000
Sure.

76
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,960
That said...

77
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,120
And even beyond that there's a principle of it.

78
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,440
Right.

79
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,440
Which we do subscribe to.

80
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:01,920
Right.

81
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,480
Absolutely.

82
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,600
Which is say whatever you want as long as it's not advocating violence against somebody,

83
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,160
a threat, or libel.

84
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,800
Which he's done.

85
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,640
Which he's also done.

86
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,800
But that gets me to my second point.

87
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,300
Okay.

88
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:19,620
So whatever I'm gonna say, and whatever you're gonna say, I want this to be super clear.

89
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,580
There's a big part of me that really admires Alex Jones.

90
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,220
Absolutely.

91
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,420
And here's why.

92
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:24,900
He is...

93
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,020
You're an insane person.

94
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,520
Yes.

95
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,700
I'm nuts.

96
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,180
Okay.

97
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,020
He is an amazing broadcaster.

98
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,420
Okay.

99
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:37,380
If you really take the tricks of broadcasting and apply him to them, he is insanely good.

100
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,020
Okay.

101
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:43,460
You could not say a lot of the stuff he does without being really good at your job.

102
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,980
I think that's something that will come out.

103
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,700
We'll see.

104
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,060
There are points where you'll be like, he's great.

105
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,540
Right.

106
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,220
I admire his skill.

107
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,820
I don't like what he does with it.

108
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,320
Right.

109
00:03:54,340 --> 00:04:00,820
Well, I think that's probably gonna be the central battle of this whole podcast is you

110
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,580
trying to prove to me that I should admire him in certain aspects.

111
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,380
I don't think so.

112
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:05,860
Okay.

113
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,260
All right.

114
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:06,820
Fair enough.

115
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:12,020
I just wanted to make that caveat off the top because it would be easy for anyone listening

116
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,340
to think that this is just going to turn into a beat up fest and be like, hey, Alex Jones

117
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:16,820
is stupid.

118
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,380
Right.

119
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,580
That's not at all.

120
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,100
And oh, another thing, I don't think people who listen to him are stupid.

121
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,620
I don't think his fans are stupid.

122
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,540
And that actually on the way here, that's something I was thinking about is where are

123
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,100
we on the axis of stupid slash evil?

124
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,540
Personally?

125
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,100
Yeah.

126
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,220
I'm not evil.

127
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,260
Not you and me.

128
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,100
Although we're probably more on the evil side.

129
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,780
I would say I'm more stupid.

130
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,060
Okay.

131
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,580
Most of the evil things I've done in my life have been accidents.

132
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:44,980
Okay.

133
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,940
Let's say you're not a premeditated murder guy.

134
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,340
You're like a second degree murder guy, like in the heat of the moment or manslaughter.

135
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:52,660
Yeah.

136
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:52,980
Yeah.

137
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,940
In the heat of the moment.

138
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,740
Oopsies.

139
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:54,980
Uh huh.

140
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,500
I accidentally trigger like a Rube Goldberg machine and a kill someone.

141
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,260
That's that's the kind of evil I'm at.

142
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,700
It's like, oh no, what happened there?

143
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,100
Gotcha.

144
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,420
Yeah.

145
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,940
All right, let's do this.

146
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,340
Okay.

147
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,700
We want to start with.

148
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,940
I want to start out with something a little bit fun.

149
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,420
And it kind of, I think is indicative of.

150
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,340
This is just one day in the life of Alex Jones.

151
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:14,740
Right.

152
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:20,100
All of these clips that we're going to play are from the January 2nd, 2017 episode.

153
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,600
Right.

154
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,180
Putting this out a couple days after, but we have to because of just like, we have jobs.

155
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:26,820
Right.

156
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,940
I wish that I could just.

157
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,580
Our jobs are not Alex Jones's job.

158
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,100
My job is not the brain battle.

159
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,420
Right.

160
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,180
As much as I wish it was.

161
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,740
I wish that I could just sit around and isolate these clips and ruminate on them.

162
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:44,660
But this podcast will also be us occasionally dropping out potential names for this podcast.

163
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,300
Yeah.

164
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,860
Every episode, we may change the name of this podcast.

165
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,740
Good luck finding us.

166
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:55,620
So for those of you who don't know who Alex Jones is, he is formerly a wild conspiracy

167
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:01,940
theory broadcaster who then turned, took a bit of a turn into a bit of a preacher.

168
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:08,900
Uh, and then now is basically just super into Trump because he believes that Trump is going

169
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,900
to destroy the globalists.

170
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,620
Okay.

171
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,620
Now who are the globalists?

172
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,580
It's a nebulous term.

173
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,140
I really don't want you to say a word that begins with J and ends with Juden.

174
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,660
What about the article?

175
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,620
Right, right, right.

176
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,340
DOS?

177
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,380
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

178
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,100
See, there we go.

179
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:26,900
MS-DOS.

180
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:33,540
Um, he, it's super vague who the globalists are, but they are the ones he's against.

181
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:33,860
Right.

182
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:38,980
And we know some of the characters that he'll throw out, these are the people who want,

183
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:44,660
uh, there to be more, uh, transatlantic partnerships.

184
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,020
I'm not, I'm not necessarily in favor of these things.

185
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:53,300
I'm not necessarily philosophically opposed to, in principle, some of the things he's

186
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,140
for, but.

187
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:01,700
If he didn't have at least some small aspect of like, God damn it, I might actually agree

188
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,940
with him, he would never be successful.

189
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,660
Undoubtedly.

190
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:11,060
If it was just pure on bile, all day, every day, for three hours a day.

191
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,780
Four, if you count commercials, which he does a lot of the commercials.

192
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,340
Oh, of course he does.

193
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,380
Which we'll get to in a minute.

194
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:15,940
All right.

195
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:22,420
But I wanted to start with one of the things that I think is spectacularly indicative of

196
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,420
his style of broadcast.

197
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,380
Okay.

198
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:34,260
Here are a couple of clips from this day's episode that highlight a tendency within him

199
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,340
to want to tell you things, but not want to tell you things.

200
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:38,740
Right.

201
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:45,780
There's this like, there's a give and take that he does, and this goes back to the expert

202
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,740
broadcasting thing.

203
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,220
Right.

204
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:52,740
There's an amazing ability to tell you things and not tell you things simultaneously.

205
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,180
Ooh, that's good.

206
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,460
He's working both angles.

207
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:01,460
Before we do that, though, let's talk about the central kind of idea of this podcast.

208
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:01,700
Yes.

209
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,020
You are an InfoWars obsessive.

210
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,620
But, but, but not obsessive.

211
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,220
And I don't know a goddamn thing about Alex Jones.

212
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:09,620
Yes.

213
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,020
You're all totally accurate by your description.

214
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:12,260
Right.

215
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,900
I'm not an obsessive, I'm fascinated.

216
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,380
Okay.

217
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:15,700
All right.

218
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,660
And I believe that there's a certain responsibility that people have to...

219
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,700
The same way I'm not obsessed with any of my ex-girlfriends, I'm just fascinated by...

220
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,820
Yes, there are recent actions that don't involve me.

221
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,180
Dude, I told you not to bring up me and Alex's past relationship.

222
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:30,580
Okay.

223
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,060
Sorry.

224
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,220
Sorry.

225
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,980
It was really fucking brutal.

226
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,340
I know, I know.

227
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,300
He broke your heart.

228
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:36,580
Listen.

229
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,300
And stole your bike.

230
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,900
Listen, you can read between the lines.

231
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,420
All my exes live in Texas.

232
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,660
Also, one of my favorite things is the opening of his show.

233
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,260
It talks about how he's deep within occupied Texas.

234
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:49,860
Occupied?

235
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,500
So what?

236
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:50,980
Austin?

237
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,940
Is that what he's talking about?

238
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,580
He's in Austin.

239
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:52,820
Okay.

240
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,620
He's in Austin.

241
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,580
He's in the only occupied Texas that there is.

242
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,620
It's occupied.

243
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,420
Right, right, right.

244
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:58,580
Okay.

245
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,940
So anyway, here's his first clip.

246
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:08,740
In this one, it also showcases what I would describe as a glaring false humility that

247
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,260
he has, and I think it's delicious.

248
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,340
Because honestly, I don't think many of us are going to be able to hear you here in the

249
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,220
very near future.

250
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,140
I honestly believe that they're either going to take you out or they're going to get murdered

251
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:19,940
in West Trump.

252
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,740
The reasoning that I'm calling is my personal view on what I think is going to be happening.

253
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,780
And like I said, they're either going to shut in followers down.

254
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,740
They're going to take you out.

255
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,820
They're going to either have Trump assassinated during the inauguration or right before or

256
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,620
right afterwards.

257
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,460
They're not going to let him be president very long.

258
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,860
And personally, as a long-haul truck driver, at this point, I'm considering putting my

259
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,900
job, going home, finding something to do locally because I don't think that, you know, even

260
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,020
something, what I'm doing, I don't think any of this is going to last very much longer

261
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,580
than that.

262
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:53,940
So while this caller is describing these paranoid fantasies about how someone's going to murder

263
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,700
Alex Jones, Alex is sitting there making a face.

264
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:06,580
Before we get into what crazy nonsense he's about to say, here's the thing I wonder about

265
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,740
right-wing people who are always assuming that crazy right-wing people are going to

266
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,540
be assassinated.

267
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,500
Right-wing people are never assassinated.

268
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,980
It's always Harvey Milk or Kathy Giffords.

269
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,860
MLK.

270
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:26,740
Yeah, it's always the people who are trying to do good because liberals and progressives

271
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,900
ultimately are pussies.

272
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,100
I think that's really what it is.

273
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,020
Well, now the narrative that he would spin, maybe, and I don't want to put words in his

274
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,340
mouth.

275
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,940
False flag operations.

276
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,060
Oh, so good.

277
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:37,540
Bingo.

278
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,740
You know, it's the globalists taking out the progressives in order to create social chaos.

279
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:47,380
It's this sort of logic that you can't really get out of because it just becomes circular

280
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,260
at a certain point.

281
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:52,900
So anyway, this caller has raised this concern about how Trump and him are going to be taken

282
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,500
out, and here's Alex's response.

283
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,820
I was about to say, I was going to be going on the road the next few days and going and

284
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,820
having some meetings and things, and I'm just going to leave it at that.

285
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,180
I'd imagine the media could put two and two together, and I'm tempted to not even leave

286
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:11,940
just because, but then I don't need to warn people in person.

287
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,660
Puts you that way.

288
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,540
Yeah, I mean, I'm at the point where I just know that this isn't about pomp and circumstance.

289
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:19,940
Exactly.

290
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,100
Like I've already, I'm not going to even get into it.

291
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,540
The point is, this is so serious.

292
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,300
I'm like, I can do more here.

293
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,260
I don't need to even go have somebody pat me on the head and say thank you.

294
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:28,980
I mean, you know what I mean?

295
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,660
I mean, I'm so in the bunker at this point that I don't even care about meeting with

296
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,380
the president.

297
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:33,860
I'm sorry.

298
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,340
Just go ahead.

299
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,940
Okay.

300
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,740
All right.

301
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,140
All right.

302
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,340
You're in that bunker, my man.

303
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,940
Uh, he's in, he's in the bunker.

304
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,900
In occupied Texas.

305
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,780
In occupied Texas.

306
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,260
Yes.

307
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,780
The Info Wars studio.

308
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,180
Right.

309
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:51,860
Full of the delightful people like Rob Do and Joanne McAdoo, Leanne McAdoo, not Joanne,

310
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,360
how dare I.

311
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,060
Leanne McAdoo sounds like a made up name.

312
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,420
Owen Schroyer.

313
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,380
These are people who I don't want to talk about because I'm focusing on Alex.

314
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,620
We're digging into Alex.

315
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,860
We will develop an entire podcast network into the Alex Jones network.

316
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,820
There will be spinoffs.

317
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,060
Yeah.

318
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:07,780
Oh, absolutely.

319
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,620
We just cover Owen Schroyer.

320
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,820
Right, right, right.

321
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,900
We're going to, we're going to be so busy.

322
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,300
We're going to hire different hosts to deal with.

323
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,860
I'm going to have a kid and at age three, it's going to start on the Alex Jones's kid

324
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,420
beat.

325
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,060
That's, that's a good, raise them, raise them up soldiers.

326
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,420
That's what, that's what I say.

327
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,380
My three year old son will start covering Alex Jones's 13 year old son who is a correspondent

328
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,100
for Info Wars.

329
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:30,500
Right.

330
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,380
Who is also equivalent in, uh, in intelligence to a three year old.

331
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:35,940
Possibly.

332
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,300
I don't want to beat up on him.

333
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,340
He seems like a good kid.

334
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:45,060
You are, that's, that's exactly what we're trying to avoid is us just talking shit.

335
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,420
Especially on people who don't deserve it.

336
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:46,660
Right.

337
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:51,860
Like we grew up in the church, uh, in various churches and we did things I would say in

338
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,860
the name of those churches that we don't really look back on fondly now.

339
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,420
That's true.

340
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:01,300
I remember there was a see you at the flag was like the celebration where before school

341
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,620
everyone would gather up and pray at the flag.

342
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,100
Uh, pray for our horrible culture.

343
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,100
Oh, I remember doing that.

344
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,580
Yeah.

345
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,140
I forgot cause I blocked it out of my memory.

346
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,420
I apologize for bringing it back.

347
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,060
Yeah, no, I'm going to have to deal with that now.

348
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,620
But, but I would go around and try and proselytize to my friends and I really regret that now.

349
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,740
And I feel similarly for this kid.

350
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,060
Right.

351
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,900
Like Rex Jones, I don't know.

352
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,780
Like if you believe the stuff that you're saying, God bless you.

353
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,620
You're 13.

354
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:34,420
Like no one, no one should believe what they will believe as an adult at 13.

355
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:34,820
Yeah.

356
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:41,380
And it's, it's sad for me, a 29 year old man to be like, Oh, it's about time somebody took

357
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,060
this 13 year old down a peg.

358
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,420
I also wonder if he's paying him.

359
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,060
Is he paying his son for these reports?

360
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,500
Absolutely not.

361
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,780
I feel, uh, anyway.

362
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,980
Absolutely not.

363
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,580
And if he is, he's keeping it.

364
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,820
So that clip, I think indicated this beautiful thing that Alex does, where he wants to tell

365
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,100
you badly that he was invited to have a meeting with Trump.

366
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,220
He's having some meetings.

367
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,980
He really wants to tell you that.

368
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,780
You need to know that.

369
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:08,980
And if you're in the media who doesn't cover him, you can put two and two together.

370
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,540
Right.

371
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,500
If you covered him.

372
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,940
But then that wasn't enough.

373
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,940
So at the end of the clip, he had to explain the, I don't need the president to pat me

374
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,500
on the head.

375
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,700
Oh, absolutely not.

376
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:22,740
So he does this another time that I think is, is pretty amazing.

377
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:29,540
But this, this clip is actually a little bit longer and starts with what I can only describe

378
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:34,100
as amazing fan fiction about political intrigue.

379
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,900
I was hoping for Twilight, but let's, let's move on.

380
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:41,460
Just change a couple of names and insert a personal email server.

381
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:45,700
And you basically have Bella and Edward for years.

382
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,500
She would put data on there at her Dropbox.

383
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,740
She didn't go to a local park and drop the stuff underneath a park bench.

384
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,420
Like other spies have done.

385
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,860
She would load it up for everybody in the world to see.

386
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,340
And she would say where she stood on China or where she stood on this country or that

387
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,540
and what she was going to do.

388
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:10,420
So they knew what she was about to do and had to give her more money or she would put

389
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,580
in policies that weren't one sided for them.

390
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,860
Now, as far as I can tell, there's no evidence of this.

391
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:21,460
I also feel like he doesn't know what Dropbox is or how spies work.

392
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,700
They go to the park.

393
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:28,820
I feel like they go to park in movies and then the re in real life, they just go through

394
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,300
garbage.

395
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,380
That's another late motif that will come up, not on this episode, but a lot of times he

396
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,500
does use movies to explain the real world.

397
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:41,620
Like recently he did a breakdown of the new alien movie that's coming out next year about

398
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,860
how it depicts what the Illuminati really believes about the world.

399
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:50,340
Well, if anybody already knows the plot to the new alien movie coming out next year,

400
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,140
it's got to be him.

401
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,020
He's got documents.

402
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,220
Yeah, absolutely.

403
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,660
It was in Hillary's Dropbox email account.

404
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,540
All right, back to the clip.

405
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,660
She also had one sided policies for the aliens.

406
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,540
Hillary created a digital drop box.

407
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,820
And by the way, that's been confirmed and that's the data that's going to come out if

408
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,940
the Democrats keep pushing.

409
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,100
But the Democrats are so crazy, they don't even care.

410
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,380
They're going to go for broke.

411
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:16,020
They made a deal with Trump on election night to admit he won and to back off.

412
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,900
Perfect sense.

413
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:22,580
And that then Trump would put out the word to the dogs in U.S. intelligence to stop releasing

414
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,140
info.

415
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:27,380
And they began double crossing Trump the next morning and the American people.

416
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,540
And I told Trump, they're never going to stop coming after you.

417
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,660
I told him three days after the election, I said, Mr.

418
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,380
President elect, they're never going to stop.

419
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,380
They're never going to follow the deal.

420
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,700
They're going to try to kill you politically or physically.

421
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,460
They're not going to stop.

422
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,340
They can't stay.

423
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,700
I'm not going to say everything I said.

424
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,820
And I've said, how could Trump said?

425
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,820
But let me explain something to everybody.

426
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,340
This is deadly serious.

427
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,860
All of this is deadly serious.

428
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:00,660
All right.

429
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,780
That's the end of that clip.

430
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,260
It is.

431
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:02,820
All right.

432
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,300
So let's let's tear this apart.

433
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:05,780
Sure.

434
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,420
Piece by piece.

435
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,540
Oh, and let me be clear.

436
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,620
Some of these clips may end up being a little bit long because before we started recording,

437
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:16,340
I wanted to explain to you that I don't want to play things wildly out of context.

438
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,420
I think that's an unfair game to play.

439
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:24,260
And as the best I can, as best I can, I'm going to keep as best I can.

440
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,740
I'm going to keep this is deadly serious.

441
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,220
Yeah.

442
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:32,020
So the point of that clip, I think, is that he talks to Trump, right?

443
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,300
I think that's kind of the point.

444
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:38,820
Well, I think there's a few things that we get into there at the beginning, which is

445
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,620
she's created a digital Dropbox, which is proven that is confirmed.

446
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,100
Yes.

447
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:49,460
Just like I feel like everybody has a digital Dropbox.

448
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,380
I have a Dropbox.

449
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:51,780
Sure.

450
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,260
Right.

451
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,580
Also, you shouldn't you shouldn't need to say digital in front of Dropbox.

452
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,420
Also, Dropbox is a brand name, right?

453
00:17:59,220 --> 00:17:59,700
It's an app.

454
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,820
It's Buzz marketing.

455
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,620
Oh, he works for Dropbox.

456
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,260
Holy shit.

457
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:04,980
New conspiracy.

458
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,820
New conspiracy theory right there.

459
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,740
This is deadly serious.

460
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,820
We should keep a running tally of new conspiracies.

461
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,340
Number one, Alex Jones works for Dropbox.

462
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:16,740
Right.

463
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:22,180
He is a secret agent for the Dropbox Corporation.

464
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:22,660
Yeah.

465
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,060
Okay.

466
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,820
So she created this Dropbox.

467
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,460
That's confirmed.

468
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,180
Where the Chinese could find out what she's going to do to them.

469
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:28,740
Right.

470
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,500
And then pay her to not do it.

471
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,860
I guess that I that's sort of the implication.

472
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,820
I feel like I can't argue with that.

473
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,940
Well, how could you?

474
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,020
Because that is so beyond the realm of possibility.

475
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,020
Now, why would you say that?

476
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,260
That's you seem like you're in denial.

477
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,140
So, okay.

478
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,420
First off, China is not a guy.

479
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,220
Yeah, it is.

480
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,500
It's not a guy.

481
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,540
He forms like Voltron.

482
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,180
Well, all of one billion parts.

483
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:04,580
Like I understand that he thinks of China as just like one dude.

484
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:04,980
Yeah.

485
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,380
Like if you asked him to name the Politburo in China, do you think he could?

486
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,940
I don't even know if that's a person or a building.

487
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,060
Well, it's a collective.

488
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,060
Like the Politburo, it's from Russia.

489
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,060
It's the governing body.

490
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,500
It's an oligarchy, basically.

491
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:20,820
Okay.

492
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,620
These are like, I don't know.

493
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,460
You could call them the Illuminati.

494
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,020
Okay.

495
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,820
Who sit around and talk about what it is they're going to do.

496
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:33,300
They are not one guy.

497
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,260
Like, and also...

498
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,460
But do they act as one?

499
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,940
Unified in attack and approach.

500
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,140
I assume that they get together and, you know, like...

501
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:42,660
Inspire?

502
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:43,460
That...

503
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,740
I hate to put words in your mouth.

504
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,460
I just lost to Alex Jones.

505
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,540
I don't think you did.

506
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,540
We are on one episode and it's Alex Jones one, me zero.

507
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,260
I don't think you did lose because the fundamental point

508
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,180
still remains that the idea that she created a digital

509
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,420
Dropbox where people could find out stuff.

510
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,300
See, that's how insidious he is.

511
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,380
We keep saying digital Dropbox.

512
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:09,620
Right.

513
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,180
It's smart.

514
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:10,740
It's the same.

515
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,660
It's essentially creating a verbal hashtag.

516
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:14,900
Right.

517
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,220
And again, this comes back to why he's a good broadcaster.

518
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,100
These are the elements that you have to take apart to see,

519
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,540
like, oh, this is what he's doing.

520
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,420
In the same way, and his cadence as well.

521
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,780
Everything, every single thing that he went through there

522
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:34,340
is easily capable of sticking in your mind.

523
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:34,740
Sure.

524
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,300
Like, I can't...

525
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,500
There's a hypnotic meter.

526
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,780
I know I can't get digital Dropbox out of my head now.

527
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,620
If somebody asked me to, hey, could you just put that

528
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,420
in my Dropbox?

529
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,420
I'd be like, wait, which Dropbox?

530
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,540
The digital one or the one that's underneath that park

531
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,260
bench over there?

532
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,700
Well, this is a bad example of it, but it is an old-fashioned

533
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,740
trick that oral tradition cultures would use.

534
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,700
In the same way that Alex, every time he talks about the

535
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,740
Chinese, he calls them the communist Chinese.

536
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,060
Right.

537
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,700
It's a trick called using an epithet.

538
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,700
And not necessarily like a negative epithet.

539
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,180
Right.

540
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,700
But it's just using something to characterize a noun

541
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,260
makes it stick in your memory more.

542
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,500
In the same way that they would always call Achilles

543
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,740
rage-filled Achilles or brave Odysseus in the Iliad

544
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,540
and the Odyssey, it's a really good trick when you don't

545
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,780
have paper to get people to remember things.

546
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,980
It's a mnemonic trick.

547
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,540
And he uses that so fucking well.

548
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:33,220
Digital Dropbox is probably not even intended to be like

549
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,660
that, but it still is.

550
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,700
To the point where you're distracted from the point that

551
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,140
there was a deal made.

552
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:39,700
Yeah.

553
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:44,340
No, all I can think about is where is this digital Dropbox?

554
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:44,980
Right.

555
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:50,980
The only way for this claim to be proven is for some

556
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,700
information.

557
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,780
Well, the digital Dropbox is confirmed.

558
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,700
Well, yes, but it's been confirmed through unconfirmed

559
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,780
channels or whatever, you know?

560
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,020
Yeah.

561
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,220
No, I feel like you can just find somebody who's like,

562
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,180
Oh yeah, I put something into that Dropbox.

563
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,060
No, no, no, no, no.

564
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,580
Only she put things in.

565
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,260
Everyone else put money in accounts.

566
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:11,940
Where?

567
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,740
You can't do it at a digital Dropbox.

568
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,540
Cayman Islands.

569
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:15,860
I don't know.

570
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,540
They don't know the foundation.

571
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,140
You make a donation to the foundation.

572
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,500
Ooh, that's some solid epithet right there.

573
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,540
The donation foundation.

574
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,580
That's just rhyming.

575
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,180
So, I mean, like the only way for it to be proven that

576
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:34,180
they like Hillary stepped down immediately because she was

577
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,980
afraid of this information of the digital Dropbox coming

578
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,900
out that Trump had over her.

579
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,260
And somehow Trump actually has all of the intelligence

580
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,420
agencies in his sway and all this.

581
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,700
The only way for that to ever come out is for the shit to

582
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,260
go down.

583
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,460
Yeah, well, it does.

584
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,860
If you know anything about the intelligence agencies and

585
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:57,220
the way they've been behaving, they kind of are on Trump's

586
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,260
side pretty solidly.

587
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:06,660
And then there's the thing that confused me is that he's

588
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:11,460
insisting that Hillary and the Democrats made a deal on

589
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,180
election night.

590
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,380
Uh huh.

591
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:18,740
He gives very few details by which I mean known about what

592
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,780
that deal entails.

593
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,020
So we know there's a deal.

594
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,380
We don't know what that deal is.

595
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,220
The next day they are betraying him, right?

596
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,100
We don't know how they're betraying him because we don't

597
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,060
know what their deal.

598
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,060
I think we can guess why, but why would they?

599
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:37,380
They're all globalists who are in the who are just hanging

600
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,260
out with China.

601
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,580
It makes no sense to make that deal to begin with.

602
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:44,340
If you're going to flip on it the next morning, I think it

603
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,540
makes perfect sense.

604
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:49,140
Oh, so he doesn't in his acceptance speech doesn't lay out

605
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,260
all this dirty laundry.

606
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,380
That would be wild at three in the morning.

607
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,820
That would be the greatest.

608
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:59,700
That would be crazy if he came out in his acceptance speech

609
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,860
with just and here's all the shit I have on Hillary now.

610
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:07,380
I was waiting to tell it to you guys until I got elected.

611
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,380
Yeah, if only they had made a deal with me two hours ago,

612
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,420
I wouldn't have said anything.

613
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,940
That fucking deal windows closed.

614
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,060
Hey, if they had betrayed me tomorrow, I would have been

615
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,140
fine as long as this deal happened tonight.

616
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:27,140
Okay, so they betrayed him and the Democrats, which again,

617
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,580
I feel like I feel like he's just using it as a guy.

618
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,700
Right, combo noun.

619
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,020
It is a guy in his mind.

620
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:34,500
It's a guy.

621
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,460
It's Schumer.

622
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,540
All Democrats are a guy.

623
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,500
They're all Chuck Schumer.

624
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,700
They're all Amy Schumer, actually.

625
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,580
Or Rahm.

626
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,140
But as we all know, let's be fucking honest.

627
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,340
It's George Soros.

628
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,860
That's who he thinks all Democrats are.

629
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,660
That is right.

630
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,260
That's who he thinks they all are.

631
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,340
In fact, that brings me to our next clip.

632
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,220
Excellent.

633
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,700
That was the greatest segue in the history of podcasts.

634
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,340
Thank you very much.

635
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,900
This clip is actually part of what I would claim to be a very

636
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:07,620
substantive, substantive narrative that has been going on forever on his show.

637
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,700
And it's something that I really take issue with because it's a good example

638
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:18,180
of a time where he uses something and references it and just lies about what it says.

639
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,180
So George Soros is essentially his big boogeyman.

640
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,820
He's his evil globalist madman.

641
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:30,420
So here's a little clip of Alex talking about George Soros on today's program.

642
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:34,740
The minute they take down Netanyahu, they're going after Trump.

643
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,340
So, hey, all of you that want to live under globalist Islamic rule,

644
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,580
all of you that hate Jews.

645
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:45,700
You're about to get a big, juicy taste of the globalist win of what it's going to be

646
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,220
like being under Saudi Arabia and communist China, politically calling the shots to the

647
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,700
Democrats who've openly made deals to sell us out to them.

648
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:57,060
Oh, and then have weirdo Nazi collaborators like George Soros, who's Jewish, sitting over it.

649
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,340
So, so, you know, get your anti-Semitism strike there.

650
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,420
You got this evil Dr. Evil over here running this whole takeover, who's Jewish,

651
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,940
and they're about to get rid of the Jewish state.

652
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,620
So just enjoy yourselves.

653
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,860
You got to taste rounding up Jews in World War Two, just so delicious.

654
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,780
Little Soros, he just can't stop.

655
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,820
And it's all the WikiLeaks.

656
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,580
And you know what?

657
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,100
The Jews haven't anything to stop him.

658
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,340
Hell, half the Jews are liberals love George Soros.

659
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,740
Hey, just have whatever you want, dumbasses.

660
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:29,300
So a couple of things that was a barrage of people all together on the same side.

661
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,700
So let's let's parse.

662
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,380
Wait, I want to say one thing before we parse.

663
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:33,860
OK.

664
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,180
I think that this this clip also contains one of my favorite fucking things in the world,

665
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,140
which is everyone is always surprised by commercial breaks.

666
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,740
They are never fucking ready for a commercial break,

667
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,780
but all of their commercials are just for their supplements.

668
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:51,860
It's all just for colloidal iodine, super male vitality.

669
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,860
It's all the in-house Infowars pills, but they never could plan it out.

670
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:00,180
I have no idea why those specific pills are the ones they're marketing.

671
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,340
Who could possibly be their target audience?

672
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,820
What's super awesome, too, is he often goes on jags about how, like, he turns down sponsors.

673
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,100
And it's like, you don't.

674
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:08,980
You fucking don't.

675
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:16,260
I guarantee that he only he only advertises products he uses.

676
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,820
Right.

677
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:23,780
Which he got he needs that and formal trouble through a male formerly gold.

678
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,780
Well, he used to he used to hock gold real hard,

679
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:29,940
but that was because he was on the GSN network, which is the Genesis

680
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:31,940
to communicate.

681
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,100
Oh, GCN, Genesis Communication Network.

682
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,620
Did he leave him because they became the genocide communication network?

683
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,180
I don't know.

684
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:42,820
I can't confirm or deny under the palm of George Soros.

685
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,260
Well, I just coming for Netanyahu, just to be clear.

686
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:51,380
The GCN was owned by by Gold Consortium.

687
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:54,900
So when he was I think he still is broadcast by them.

688
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,100
But now they've shifted over to this weird health food stuff.

689
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:58,420
OK.

690
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,180
So he used to be hawking gold.

691
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:06,100
And now they sell all this weird like, you know, all your body really needs is a couple

692
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,660
of these minerals, which totally is true, right?

693
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,580
It's all sold by this guy named Dr.

694
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:14,420
Wallach, who's actually if you actually look into Dr.

695
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:22,100
Wallach, he's a veterinarian who knows better what will affect the human body than somebody

696
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:22,980
who kills pets.

697
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,020
I'm a dog doctor.

698
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:27,780
Yeah, he's a he's a he's like a New Age doctor and veterinarian.

699
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,580
Never would have guessed.

700
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,860
Yeah, so never would have guessed.

701
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:37,540
If you look up the people who used to sell gold, their website now goes to his weird

702
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,580
health food stuff.

703
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:46,020
I've already that has Dr. Spiceman from 30 Rock written all over 100 percent.

704
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:46,420
Yeah.

705
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,820
So anyway, back to parsing.

706
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,300
Right.

707
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:49,780
All right.

708
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:57,060
So the my favorite my favorite thing that he said right there is George Soros got a

709
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:01,220
taste from World War Two Nazi Germany.

710
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:01,620
Yes.

711
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,220
He got a taste of genocide.

712
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,340
What camps?

713
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,380
Rounding up Jews.

714
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,660
Rounding up Jews.

715
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,780
And he's a Jew.

716
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,020
Are you aware of where that comes from?

717
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,300
Where that where what he's referencing?

718
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:13,940
No.

719
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,940
OK, so he references this all the time.

720
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:19,540
And in the same way when he talks about Nazi collaborator George Soros, it's the same

721
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:19,700
thing.

722
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,660
It's another epithet.

723
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:20,900
OK.

724
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,940
Sticks in your head easily.

725
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,500
Right.

726
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:29,300
So back back years ago, there was George Soros was interviewed on 60 Minutes and he was being

727
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,620
interviewed by what's this guy's name?

728
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,580
Croft.

729
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,940
Can't remember Croft's first name.

730
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,420
Who cares?

731
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:38,660
I remember him from the Croft Nixon interview.

732
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,380
Yes.

733
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,460
Steve Croft is interviewing him.

734
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,220
I will read you the transcript of that interview because I don't want to play the audio.

735
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:45,460
Right.

736
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,740
I just don't want to pull up more shit that I don't have ready.

737
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:55,380
You're a Hungarian Jew who escaped the Holocaust by posing as a Christian.

738
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:55,620
Right.

739
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,980
And you watch lots of people get shipped off to the death camps.

740
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,540
Right.

741
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:03,940
I was 14 years old and I would say that that's when my character was made.

742
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,660
In what way?

743
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,060
That one should think ahead.

744
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:10,340
One should understand and anticipate events.

745
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:13,620
And when one is threatened, it was a tremendous threat of evil.

746
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,940
I mean, it was a very personal threat of evil.

747
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:22,180
My understanding is that you went out in fact and helped in the confiscation of property

748
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:22,820
from the Jews.

749
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,180
Soros.

750
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,140
Yes, that's right.

751
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:25,460
Yes.

752
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:30,420
I mean, that sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to a psychiatric

753
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,940
couch for many, many years.

754
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,740
Was it difficult?

755
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:33,780
No.

756
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,740
Not at all.

757
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,620
Not at all.

758
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,580
Maybe as a child you don't see the connection.

759
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,460
But it created no problem at all.

760
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,060
No feeling of guilt?

761
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:43,860
No.

762
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,660
For example, that I'm Jewish and here I am watching these people go.

763
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,580
I could just as easily be these.

764
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,540
I should be here.

765
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,500
I should be there.

766
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,060
None of that?

767
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,420
And his response?

768
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,020
Well, of course.

769
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:00,740
I could be on the other side or I could be one from whom the thing is being taken away.

770
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,820
But there was no sense that I shouldn't be there because that was, well actually in a

771
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,980
funny way, it's just like in the markets.

772
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:12,500
That is, if I weren't there, of course I wasn't doing this, but somebody else would, would

773
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,260
be taking it away anyhow.

774
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:19,140
And it was the whatever, whether I was there or not, I was only a spectator.

775
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,740
The property was being taken away.

776
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,380
So I had no role in taking that property away.

777
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,500
So no sense of guilt.

778
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:32,100
Okay, so this, this interview.

779
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,340
Yes.

780
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:37,300
Alex Jones has taken a survival story.

781
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:37,940
Yes.

782
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,780
Where it seems like Soros clearly dissociated.

783
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:42,980
A bit.

784
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,980
From his own personal identity as a measure of survival.

785
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,540
Yes.

786
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,500
He survives.

787
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:57,300
Yes, his father hid him with a Christian gentleman who was responsible for when Jews

788
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,740
were taken away, they would catalog their belongings.

789
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:06,580
It was thieving or whatever, but you got to imagine if you're a 14 year old kid, your

790
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:10,740
primary concern is making sure no one finds out you're a Jew.

791
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,060
Right.

792
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,100
Because you will be murdered.

793
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,740
And also where do you masturbate?

794
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,140
Sure.

795
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:15,940
Or pee.

796
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,820
Yeah, right.

797
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,540
Beyond that.

798
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,860
Jewish pee is different and they could smell it out.

799
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,740
The dicks, they're different.

800
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:29,220
So circumcision is the main selling point for Jews.

801
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,060
I don't know if I'd call it selling point.

802
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,500
I shouldn't have said selling point.

803
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,420
I should have said catching point or something, something along those lines.

804
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,620
There was another quote that was about that time in his life.

805
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:43,780
It was actually probably the happiest year of my life, that year of German occupation.

806
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:46,180
For me, it was a very positive experience.

807
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,860
It's strange, I think it says sage, but I think you meant strange.

808
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:54,180
It's a strange thing because you see incredible suffering around you and the fact that you're

809
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:58,100
in considerable danger yourself, but you're 14 years old and you don't believe that it

810
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,300
can actually touch you.

811
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,980
You have a belief in yourself.

812
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,660
You have a belief in your father.

813
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,220
It's a very happy making, exhilarating experience.

814
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:12,180
So people, Alex Jones in particular, takes these quotes to twist it to be like the happiest

815
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:20,100
time in his life was when he was helping Hitler round up Jews, which is false on two counts.

816
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,500
And I don't believe that Alex doesn't know that.

817
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:25,700
Okay.

818
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,220
He's citing these things.

819
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:37,300
Yeah, my first reaction on hearing that is that's some crazy shit.

820
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,940
Mm hmm. And clearly he's rich enough to be honest,

821
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:50,500
which if he was not like, imagine him as an actor saying that nonsense, he would be pilloried

822
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,020
for weeks.

823
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:52,740
Undoubtedly.

824
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,380
Right.

825
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:58,340
So he's rich enough to be like, hey, this was a hugely formative experience in my life.

826
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,780
It is one of the most tragic things that's ever happened.

827
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:08,500
And somehow because of those strange circumstances that I was in, it wound up being a positive

828
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,380
experience for me.

829
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,100
Mm hmm.

830
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:10,420
Okay.

831
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:18,660
That clearly means that he was in cahoots with Hitler himself and is trying to destroy

832
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,380
the Jewish state.

833
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,260
And because he was so happy, then he wants to recreate it.

834
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:22,740
Yeah.

835
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,780
Well, a hundred percent.

836
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:30,660
I mean, I remember growing up whenever I was being beaten regularly.

837
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,340
It was an exhilarating experience.

838
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,060
Well, exhilarating is some weird definitions.

839
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:39,140
No, it's an exhilarating experience, and I constantly try and recreate it.

840
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,620
Psychologically, that's unimpeachable logic.

841
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:46,900
But the traumas that we have in our lives often, if you have undergone some analysis,

842
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,820
some therapy, you don't necessarily think of them as horrible times in your life.

843
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,060
Bumps and bruises make you stronger.

844
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,420
There are tons of people who talk...

845
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,700
As do Holocausts.

846
00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:00,180
Well, I mean, you're not responsible often for the cards you're dealt.

847
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,060
Whatever doesn't put you in an oven makes you stronger.

848
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:03,300
Sure.

849
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,700
Now, if someone does...

850
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,140
That is the end of this podcast.

851
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,820
We made it through one episode.

852
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:12,180
If someone does an after show of our after show, they're going to take that clip now.

853
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,060
Oh, yeah.

854
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:16,740
Well, I still think that is a piece of advice.

855
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,260
You can take it or leave it.

856
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,700
So this really bothers me quite a bit, because most of the...

857
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,540
Like, I'm not here to stand up for George Soros and say he's the best man in the world.

858
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,780
But this idea of painting him as a Nazi collaborator is incredibly irresponsible.

859
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:35,620
And the fact that I'm 100% sure that Alex Jones has watched the clips from that doc...

860
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,500
Or has watched that interview, has seen these things.

861
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,020
He knows what he was talking about.

862
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:44,660
The fact that he chooses to paint it as he was helping round up Jews

863
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:47,620
means that he's spinning a false narrative for a reason.

864
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,100
Right.

865
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,420
And that bothers me a lot.

866
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:58,500
Okay, so that puts us into lying territory versus deceiving territory.

867
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,100
Yes, propaganda territory.

868
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:00,660
Right.

869
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:05,860
Now, the other part of this that I love about him,

870
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,660
and you're absolutely right about him being a great broadcaster.

871
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,620
At no point in his entire show, I'm imagining,

872
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:17,220
does he ever actually get into why he would want this to happen?

873
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,100
Barely, if ever.

874
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:18,500
Right.

875
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,580
So he leaves it to your own imagination to make these connections of,

876
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:28,580
oh, well, clearly, if he survived the Holocaust, he also loved you and loved it.

877
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,980
Which is also a great movie title, Surviving the Holocaust and Loving It.

878
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,940
Dracula, Surviving the Holocaust and Loving It.

879
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:41,060
Leslie Nielsen as a slapstick young George Soros, but still that same age.

880
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,060
He went too young, that Leslie Nielsen.

881
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:43,620
Yeah, yeah.

882
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,900
He can't play it that young.

883
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,140
No.

884
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,900
He's a great actor, but...

885
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,940
I think he's dead.

886
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,500
He is dead.

887
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,000
Yeah.

888
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,680
So, you know, he'd be even better at it now.

889
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,180
Yeah.

890
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,160
Okay, so before we get...

891
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,240
Because we already got sidetracked.

892
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,120
He's a genius.

893
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,560
We already got sidetracked onto the nonsense he said.

894
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,040
But did you notice...

895
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,400
Instead of responding to the nonsense he said.

896
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:13,000
But you noticed that on the way to the stuff talking about George Soros, there was like...

897
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,400
Oh, there's 30 different mismatch.

898
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:15,880
Yeah, yeah.

899
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,400
He was throwing it at the wall.

900
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,560
He's throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks.

901
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,920
The stuff that he was talking about BB Netanyahu was...

902
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,440
Oh, he's the best.

903
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:32,280
Apparently the police questioned him over some corruption stuff that day on the second.

904
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:38,200
I'm having difficult times finding independent corroboration of that being anything serious.

905
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,240
It's difficult to say, but it does feed into the narrative that they already have built up with

906
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:48,680
the United States has turned their back on Israel with the sitting out of the UN vote.

907
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,680
Yeah, and the $35 billion.

908
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,720
$38 billion.

909
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,080
$38 billion.

910
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,200
In military aid.

911
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:54,440
Right.

912
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:54,920
It's a very...

913
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,480
My position on that is Israel is an incredibly complicated situation

914
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,560
that I don't understand all the ins and outs of.

915
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,040
Right.

916
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,840
I do believe the Palestinians have rights.

917
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,480
How about that?

918
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,440
How does that grab you?

919
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,240
I don't know.

920
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,200
George Soros agrees with that and I feel like you're wrong there.

921
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,080
Oh, yeah.

922
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,400
George Soros is against rounding up.

923
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,600
What the thing that...

924
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,600
Before now, now I'm pissed off.

925
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,080
Also...

926
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:23,400
I just got hit with him saying that China and Saudi Arabia are on the same team.

927
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,000
Well, beyond that, also globalists are Islamists.

928
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,480
Well, yeah.

929
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,040
No, that we can skip over, because that's obvious.

930
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,160
Okay, so China and Saudi...

931
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:35,320
As everybody knows, Islamists are all for global relations.

932
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,920
Well, part of this anti-globalist sort of narrative,

933
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:43,800
one of the necessary pieces of it is that they have to create their own axis of evil.

934
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,280
Right.

935
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,920
And for them, in order to make Russia okay...

936
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:51,560
And it's super weird that they are calling themselves the axis of evil.

937
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,880
That's a big tip-off if the globalists are like,

938
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,920
Oh, we're totally evil.

939
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,240
Oh, yeah.

940
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,440
We're super...

941
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,960
I'm an evil Dr. Evil.

942
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,520
Right, exactly.

943
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,000
I believe that's how...

944
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,960
Again, I feel like he doesn't know Dr. Evil is fictional.

945
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,520
He's given me the Dr. Evil doesn't know he's fictional vibe.

946
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,320
Um, so he...

947
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,760
The alliance there, in order to make Russia okay,

948
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:21,480
is China, Saudi Arabia, North Korea, and some other countries.

949
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:21,880
Right.

950
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:26,120
But those are the ones that are the big problems, especially Communist China.

951
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:30,360
Those are the people we have to be worried about, just so Russia is cool.

952
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,120
Because Putin just wants prosperity.

953
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,080
Well, absolutely.

954
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,480
Yeah.

955
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,840
And also Putin's country is turning into a shithole.

956
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,120
Uh, that he's...

957
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:47,080
He's rampantly doing everything he can to direct every possible attention away from the fact

958
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,480
that Russia's economy is garbage right now.

959
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,440
In the toilet.

960
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,400
Yeah, and it has been for like ten years.

961
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,920
Well, I mean, Alex Jones even brings that up,

962
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,640
but he uses it as a deflection away from Russian tampering and hacking and stuff like that.

963
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,080
He's like, how can they do anything?

964
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,840
They have the GDP of Italy.

965
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:01,960
All right.

966
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,520
Well, yeah, but...

967
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,600
That's a solid deflection.

968
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,760
Yeah, but also Putin probably has like $200 billion or something like that.

969
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:08,760
Personally.

970
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,160
There's a lot of people hiding a lot of money.

971
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:11,960
I can't imagine.

972
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,440
The fact that the GDP is that low doesn't mean that there aren't the resources.

973
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,120
Like, there's a lot of dark money.

974
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,720
Uh, like, I don't know, like some of that money that went to that

975
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,920
Olympic stadium and the roads that were never actually built.

976
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,480
Sure.

977
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,840
Somebody got all that money.

978
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,080
Yeah.

979
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,560
Um, Communist China got all that money.

980
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,200
Absolutely.

981
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,000
That's what we know.

982
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:39,960
When Communist China and Saudi Arabia conspired to steal Sochi Olympics?

983
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,280
I guess.

984
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,160
What are we going with?

985
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:41,800
I don't know.

986
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,120
All right.

987
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,120
This is a conspiracy we're not going to be able to flesh out.

988
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,000
All right.

989
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,160
Communist China and Saudi Arabia.

990
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:47,640
Yes.

991
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:47,960
That...

992
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,120
Okay.

993
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,880
Did he plan to say that?

994
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,440
Probably not.

995
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,800
Has he said that before?

996
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,960
Has he ever combined Communist China and Saudi Arabia?

997
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,560
Uh, only as people he doesn't like.

998
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,080
Uh, like, I don't, I think that he mad libs that one.

999
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:03,400
Yeah.

1000
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,280
He had to have just, I mean, even he, when he re-listened to that show, he was like,

1001
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:08,920
Holy shit.

1002
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,960
That's crazy.

1003
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,120
I think it was that the spirit got good to him and he was just like, it was like, all

1004
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,800
right, well, these words are coming out.

1005
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:15,960
Whatever.

1006
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,640
Lord, give me the Holy Spirit.

1007
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,840
Tell me who I'm against.

1008
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,920
Which is a perfect transition to this next clip.

1009
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,400
Excellent.

1010
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,320
So I think our segues are dominant.

1011
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,720
This might be one of my favorite clips.

1012
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,920
I don't want to do any set up.

1013
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,960
Uh, ladies and gentlemen, that's what I said last week.

1014
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,480
I said, if they kill Netanyahu or something, you know, world war three is about to happen.

1015
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,280
Well, here it is.

1016
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,840
And I told you, they're really thinking about arresting Trump.

1017
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,040
They're really thinking about fault.

1018
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,560
Remember all those rape charges and pedophile charges that were always fake names and were

1019
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,040
never true.

1020
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,960
And that's not entirely accurate.

1021
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,960
No, that got dropped as soon as he won.

1022
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,560
Claiming Jerry Epstein connections to him when it was really the Clinton and Hillary

1023
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,240
and to both of them, really everything they're doing, they say we're doing.

1024
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,560
So now this is zero hedge Israeli police internet.

1025
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,040
Yahoo's home for questioning over corruption allegation.

1026
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,880
Boy, you talk about canary in the coal line.

1027
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,360
The globalist wouldn't move against Netanyahu's.

1028
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:13,240
WikiLeaks shows they're planning to do via Soros if they weren't planning to have people

1029
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:17,880
ready to imprison him or kill him if he starts trying to spill the beans on stuff.

1030
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,040
Because Netanyahu has been involved in everything.

1031
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,120
Good, bad, ugly, you name it.

1032
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,320
And if they're if they move against Netanyahu, that means they're moving against Trump.

1033
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,040
Bet your bottom buck.

1034
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,560
Whoa.

1035
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,160
No, that's not it.

1036
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:33,960
We're readable.

1037
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,120
Just red alert, red alert, red alert.

1038
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,400
This is getting crazy.

1039
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,640
This is so frickin out of control.

1040
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,840
It's time to pray.

1041
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,400
Our Heavenly Father, please help.

1042
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1043
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,560
Please protect the children.

1044
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,320
Please protect the children.

1045
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,080
How dare you get in the way of his prayer?

1046
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1047
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,640
I have to go back now.

1048
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,680
I'm sorry.

1049
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,520
This is this is on air.

1050
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,120
Start start the prayer again.

1051
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,840
And he when he does that, it's time to pray.

1052
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,360
He immediately like like puts his hand over his face and makes it.

1053
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,720
He acts like he's going to cry.

1054
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,400
It's astounding.

1055
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,320
This is so frickin out of control.

1056
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,520
It's time to pray.

1057
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,280
Our Heavenly Father, please help us open our eyes.

1058
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,160
Please help us be good.

1059
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,800
We're so sorry for all the abortions and all the evil in our name.

1060
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,840
Please protect the children.

1061
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,760
Please reprieve us if it's in your will.

1062
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:39,160
Please somehow stop the evil forces that are trying to stop this miracle that you've given us.

1063
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,160
Please help there be peace in the Middle East.

1064
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,000
Please stop those who are trying to overthrow Israel and start World War Three and bring in Armageddon.

1065
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,560
Please give us a reprieve like Nineveh that we have time to wake people up and reach out to

1066
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,240
those that are still in darkness and deceive.

1067
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,920
Please in the name of your son.

1068
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,680
Jesus Christ, lead God and direct us on in.

1069
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,160
And I don't do that for show, folks.

1070
00:43:59,160 --> 00:43:59,960
I don't want to be here.

1071
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,400
I am so upset right now that my head is burning.

1072
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,160
I am sweating.

1073
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,600
Even though it's like 65 degrees in here, I am so pissed.

1074
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:13,240
Well, he might be sweating in 65 degree temperatures because he's taking too much goddamn super

1075
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,840
male vitality. It's entirely possible or that he's coked out.

1076
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:22,840
I have no idea, but first thing you say after publicly praying is I don't do that for show.

1077
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,080
Right on your literal show.

1078
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,640
You're doing that for show.

1079
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,000
You're 100% doing it for show.

1080
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:35,400
But I would listen to any techno remix of it's time to pray.

1081
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,200
It's time to pray.

1082
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,400
What a showman.

1083
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,840
God, that's so good.

1084
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,840
I want to be super clear about this, too.

1085
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,520
I don't mean to beat up on religion.

1086
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,000
I don't want to mock someone just for being religious.

1087
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,160
Religion is a great thing when used right.

1088
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,920
Like, it does bring a lot of meaning to a lot of people's lives, and hooray.

1089
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:59,400
But I do take great issue with the idea that it's being used to, basically, for show.

1090
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:05,400
Yeah, well, I mean, just the fact that you responded that way means it's time to pray.

1091
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,600
Dear God, I just want to...

1092
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,880
I'm so sorry about abortions.

1093
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,040
Why did he start with abortions?

1094
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,480
Where did that come from?

1095
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,760
This is a stream of consciousness rant.

1096
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,200
Okay, let's start at the beginning.

1097
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,480
Why is Netanyahu the canary in the coal mine?

1098
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,640
Because once they come for Israel, that means Trump's next.

1099
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,360
Yeah, but why would you go for Israel first?

1100
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,760
There's an internal logic to it that's never explained.

1101
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,680
But, okay, so you're coming for Netanyahu.

1102
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,520
Because he's got all the dirt.

1103
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,160
He knows the good and bad things that everyone's done.

1104
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,200
So you've got to take him out first so he can't spill the beans.

1105
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:48,520
So, again, the good, the bad, the ugly, he's got all of it.

1106
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,240
Yes.

1107
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,800
Where, why, and how did he get any of it?

1108
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,440
He's been around the game forever, so he has all of it.

1109
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,880
But that's not a thing that...

1110
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,200
You can't just say, I've been around the game,

1111
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,800
so I know the secrets of every nation on the planet.

1112
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,280
Yeah, but you can if no one calls you on it.

1113
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,240
That's a good point.

1114
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:10,040
That's a good... here is the fundamental disconnect,

1115
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,800
is that I feel like before I say something,

1116
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:19,640
I should have at least the barest understanding of why that thing is occurring.

1117
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,440
Uh-huh.

1118
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,360
So like when you make a public claim.

1119
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:22,760
Right.

1120
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,400
Yeah.

1121
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,000
And even if it's dumb and relatively uninformed,

1122
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I've got a reason for thinking it, you know?

1123
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,440
Even if you're saying it as a joke.

1124
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,320
Right, right.

1125
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:35,000
Yeah, even then, well, before we go any further,

1126
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:35,560
it's time to break.

1127
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,120
That's never...

1128
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,520
Already two awesome sound drops.

1129
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,800
...never not gonna be funny.

1130
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,680
I love you.

1131
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,480
I love you.

1132
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,080
It's time to break.

1133
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,720
Oh god, that song is amazing.

1134
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:53,160
When I was watching this, I lost my shit at work at that moment.

1135
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,040
Like I was just like...

1136
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,640
Like if I were writing a character,

1137
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,120
I couldn't come up with something funnier than

1138
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,360
yelling about how World War III is coming,

1139
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,640
taking a long pause.

1140
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,880
It's time to break.

1141
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,160
Okay, all right.

1142
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:11,160
Let me ask you, before we go any further...

1143
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,480
Ending it with defending praying.

1144
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:13,880
Right.

1145
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,440
Amazing.

1146
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:14,760
No, no, no.

1147
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,800
Not defending praying.

1148
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,200
Right.

1149
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,800
Saying that it is not for show.

1150
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:18,280
Oh, by the way...

1151
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:22,680
This is a 100% genuine need to pray moment.

1152
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,280
By the way, that's sincere, folks.

1153
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,000
Have you ever...

1154
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,160
Also, that's a super professional wrestling move.

1155
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:33,400
Like you can see somebody walking into the ring and being like,

1156
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,720
hey, before we wrestle, it's time to pray.

1157
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,600
No, no, no, no.

1158
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,920
It would have to be like, now.

1159
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,560
The Undertaker's been trying to get me for years now.

1160
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,760
There's a cabal.

1161
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,600
He's got an evil group.

1162
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,920
Maybe we call them the Ministry of Darkness.

1163
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,120
And they're gonna come get me.

1164
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,480
We're talking about Viscera.

1165
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,560
We're talking about the big boss man.

1166
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,840
Once you get Viscera out, that's the canary in the coal mine.

1167
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,360
And Undertaker's coming for me.

1168
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:57,400
It's time to pray.

1169
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,480
It's time to pray.

1170
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,960
Because you've got to say all the negative stuff first.

1171
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,720
I am going to hear that 10 million times before I go to sleep tonight.

1172
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:06,360
I'm just gonna...

1173
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,320
In my brain, it's now in a loop.

1174
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,160
I'll send you an isolated clip.

1175
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:09,800
Oh, God.

1176
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:16,120
Any time I am in a bad move, I will just pull that up on my phone and be like,

1177
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,960
oh, no, no, life is good.

1178
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:18,460
Yeah.

1179
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,840
Okay, so here we go.

1180
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:25,160
They're coming for Netanyahu first, and if they get to Netanyahu first,

1181
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,200
that's not gonna be enough to destabilize everything?

1182
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:28,760
No.

1183
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,520
You gotta then go after Trump.

1184
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,020
Right.

1185
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,080
Why are those two connected?

1186
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,920
Or how are those two connected?

1187
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,080
I feel like it's so implied.

1188
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,920
I don't know why you're such a libtard.

1189
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,000
Have they ever met?

1190
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:41,960
Yeah, of course.

1191
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,000
When?

1192
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:43,880
Of course.

1193
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,400
Okay, so they've never met.

1194
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:50,440
Has Trump ever stated before any positive feelings towards Israel?

1195
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,880
I think he's tweeted a bunch.

1196
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:57,160
And he spoke at APEC. Yeah, yeah, he's come out in favor of Israel.

1197
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,040
Well, but we're all in favor of Israel.

1198
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:05,880
He's also said some negative things about Obama's handling of, you know,

1199
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,360
like backing away from Israel in the UN vote.

1200
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:08,860
Right.

1201
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:10,360
Like, I believe, what was his tweet?

1202
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:16,280
Like, hey, hold tight, like everything's gonna be different after the 20th.

1203
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:16,780
Right.

1204
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:20,840
Which was both in reference to Russia and to...

1205
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:21,340
Right.

1206
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:22,720
... Israel.

1207
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:27,040
Which is, it is nice that they have the luxury of being like,

1208
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:33,600
hey, we can weather the next 20 days because eventually we've got Trump

1209
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:38,240
who's just gonna do whatever it is we say, basically.

1210
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:42,880
Sure, he's a weird, undefined variable that'll do whatever we want.

1211
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,320
Okay, so, but then let's, here's the thing that drives me insane.

1212
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,280
Your prediction was right.

1213
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,800
This show is gonna be two hours long.

1214
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,600
Yeah, does anybody ever war games this?

1215
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,320
What do you mean by that?

1216
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,760
I mean, okay, so they kill Netanyahu.

1217
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,320
So you're asking, do we ever AB this thing?

1218
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:58,820
Right.

1219
00:49:58,820 --> 00:49:59,680
What happens next?

1220
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,640
Kill Netanyahu, then what happens?

1221
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,000
No, no, no, not necessarily that.

1222
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,400
You could just Shanghai him somewhere.

1223
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:06,900
Right.

1224
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:07,440
You could just rendition his ass.

1225
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:12,640
Well, you could, I don't know, arrest him on corruption charges that you trumped up.

1226
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:17,200
Right, but then at the same time, if the whole thing is that he's got tons of dirt,

1227
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,480
you would have to kill him, right?

1228
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,960
I mean, based on what he's saying, in order for the narrative, Alex Jones is spinning.

1229
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,120
Unless he kept that dirt in a digital drop box.

1230
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:25,760
Could be.

1231
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,720
Then you can find it.

1232
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,480
Or take out his neck.

1233
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,360
Like, just don't kill him, but make it so he can't talk.

1234
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,560
Okay, I can see that.

1235
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,960
Like Roadhouse, they're gonna rip his throat out.

1236
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,600
And then that'll be a message to anyone else who wants to talk.

1237
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,400
You know what I'm saying?

1238
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,120
Right.

1239
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,520
I mean, unless he has access to a computer.

1240
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,480
Or paper.

1241
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,560
Or, yeah, or a typewriter.

1242
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,160
That's a good point, there's a lot of possibilities.

1243
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,520
So you gotta cut off his hands.

1244
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,120
You gotta cut off his hands and feet.

1245
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,280
Because you can learn how to write with your feet.

1246
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,480
And they're in league with the Saudi Arabians, who are notorious for cutting off hands.

1247
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:54,720
Right.

1248
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,880
Or at least they were in the movie Aladdin.

1249
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,440
Right.

1250
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:02,880
But you also then have to remove his eyes, because some people can text-a-type with their eyes.

1251
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,960
Oh, that guy wrote that whole book with his eyes.

1252
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:05,680
Right, exactly.

1253
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,040
So you gotta remove those.

1254
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,000
Yeah, shit.

1255
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,440
Now, unfortunately...

1256
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,160
What about toes?

1257
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:10,960
We're also...

1258
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,160
We've already removed his feet.

1259
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:12,480
Okay.

1260
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,480
I've already established that we're removing his feet.

1261
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,680
I missed that thinking about the man from Ali Babwa.

1262
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,180
Right.

1263
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,320
Aladdin.

1264
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,840
Prince Ali.

1265
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,520
Ali Ababwa.

1266
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,320
So, which...

1267
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,400
Why did they mispronounce...

1268
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,600
They blatantly...

1269
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,880
Okay, all right.

1270
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:35,040
Let's get rid of the whole Alex Jones angle and go directly into this podcast is about the movie Aladdin.

1271
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:35,540
Yeah.

1272
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,000
All right, all right.

1273
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:44,240
But then we also have the technology now where we can read brain scans and turn that into

1274
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:44,720
type.

1275
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,040
Right.

1276
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:45,360
It's still...

1277
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:49,920
It's in infancy stages, but I'm assuming, if you know everything about everybody...

1278
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:50,240
Right.

1279
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:50,800
You got an in there.

1280
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,080
We're coming full circle now to...

1281
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,240
He's been there for the good, the bad, and the ugly of...

1282
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:54,960
It's gotta be murder then.

1283
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,000
Yeah, it's gotta be murder.

1284
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,960
Okay, so then your War Games scenario, you've gotta murder Phoebe.

1285
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,560
So you murder Netanyahu.

1286
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:01,060
Yeah.

1287
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,640
And then Israel is...

1288
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,100
What?

1289
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,140
Yeah.

1290
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,080
And so, but even then, if they murder Netanyahu...

1291
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,320
Who's the next leader waiting in the wings?

1292
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,800
It's not someone who has any different philosophies.

1293
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,720
Right, and let me ask you a question.

1294
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:23,280
Is that our job or is it Alex Jones' job to know who the next person in line...

1295
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,400
It's certainly not mine.

1296
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,600
It's certainly not mine.

1297
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,120
I'm not making any claims.

1298
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,520
Frankly, I don't know many of my aldermen.

1299
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,480
Let's put it that way.

1300
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,680
I know almost none of them.

1301
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,760
I've recently found out who my representatives are because I've felt the need to call them.

1302
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,960
I think that's a good idea.

1303
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:37,460
Yeah.

1304
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:41,360
If there's one thing that we can learn, it's don't call Alex Jones.

1305
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:41,840
No.

1306
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:42,960
Call your state representative.

1307
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,280
But if you do call Alex Jones and you tell him you love him...

1308
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:45,920
I love you.

1309
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:46,420
I love you.

1310
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,480
I wish that the caller had been like, I know you do.

1311
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,440
That would have been gorgeous.

1312
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,680
He pulls the whole Empire Strikes Back move.

1313
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:02,400
Yeah, so there are, you know, there are people calling in, you mentioned that.

1314
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,960
So you might be asking yourself about this time.

1315
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,360
Who listens to the Alex Jones show?

1316
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,200
People who need virility pills.

1317
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,600
Certainly, if you want a discount on boner pills.

1318
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,800
I think it's boner pills, right?

1319
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,520
Yeah, it's boner.

1320
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,120
It's super male vitality.

1321
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,600
Virility or vitality is boner pills.

1322
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,640
He talks about how, like, you get your libido going.

1323
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,400
It's got to be, I don't know if it is, but I think it might be boner pills.

1324
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,040
It has to be.

1325
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,720
Or it might just be like a shit ton of testosterone.

1326
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,000
I've done some research on Quantcast and Alexa.

1327
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,720
Don't know what that is.

1328
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:38,000
There are two websites that are basically, they keep statistics on websites for advertising purposes.

1329
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:38,240
Okay.

1330
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:42,560
So if you want to sell ads, you can quote your Quantcast rating and stuff like that.

1331
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:42,960
Right.

1332
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,280
I've done some research on what kind of traffic his website actually gets.

1333
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:47,600
Okay.

1334
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,360
And it's substantially lower than he says.

1335
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,280
Can't imagine how that would occur.

1336
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,120
There are, like, he generally has...

1337
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:57,200
Are you saying he exaggerates or perhaps outright lies about something?

1338
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:03,440
Yeah, if you go, he has like 200 to 300,000 hits a day, unique hits on his website,

1339
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,400
which is still great.

1340
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,120
That is pretty good.

1341
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:05,760
That's a lot.

1342
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,260
Yeah.

1343
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:09,460
Uh, but then whenever, like, a cop is killed, it goes up to about a million.

1344
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:09,860
Of course.

1345
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:12,260
Because, you know, you're getting all that viral content out there,

1346
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:16,340
and you're reeling in the racists with the thug cop killer narratives,

1347
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:18,020
and that drives a lot of traffic.

1348
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:22,420
But you can see spikes in his traffic whenever, and like,

1349
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:24,260
oh, let's Google that date, see what happened.

1350
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,860
They're like, oh, boom, okay.

1351
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:28,820
That was when Dallas happened, you know, shit like that.

1352
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:29,380
But...

1353
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:33,540
Which was also a false flag operation initiated by Hillary Clinton and the Globalist.

1354
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:34,100
Absolutely.

1355
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,260
She put that into her digital dropbox.

1356
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:37,620
WikiLeaks found it.

1357
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:43,620
They all know that the plot to kill Netanyahu is orchestrated by Communist China

1358
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:48,660
and Islamist Saudi Arabia working in concert to put this all together.

1359
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,940
And who is behind both of those?

1360
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:52,500
Soros.

1361
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,460
Soros!

1362
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,300
The Nazi-loving Jew.

1363
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,980
Now, actually, I think this podcast just ended because I nailed it.

1364
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:01,700
I got it.

1365
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:04,500
Also, Soros is claimed to be fund...

1366
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,260
I mean, he does donate to Black Lives Matter.

1367
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:09,860
He does support that group, but they act like,

1368
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:12,660
because he gives money to help that cause,

1369
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,980
that they're his goon squad, kind of.

1370
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:16,980
It's insane and very racist.

1371
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:17,860
I buy it.

1372
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,420
You're asking yourself this question, who's listening?

1373
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:22,180
And Alex has a couple answers for you.

1374
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:22,660
Okay.

1375
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,820
For our next clip, who is listening?

1376
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:25,940
Who's listening to this show?

1377
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:28,100
Doesn't Hillary know when she attacks me?

1378
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,420
And when they say I'm all these bad things and lie about me

1379
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:36,100
and have all their paid shills put out all this info?

1380
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,340
Don't they know that only makes everybody two and more?

1381
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:43,380
He was so close to just making up any name for paid shills.

1382
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:47,380
He's like, they're paid shills and then pauses and be like,

1383
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,860
oh no, it left me, I can't see Saudi Arabia again.

1384
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:52,180
He could have just as easily said, correct the record.

1385
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:52,900
Like that Hillary...

1386
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:53,700
Oh, absolutely.

1387
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:56,980
I mean, that was something that was proven.

1388
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:57,700
Absolutely.

1389
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:59,620
But he could have thrown that out there.

1390
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:00,260
Would have been easy.

1391
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:02,340
Throw media matters under the bus if you want.

1392
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:05,860
Yeah, but you know, he's had a long day.

1393
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,100
I will give him that.

1394
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,980
I think those two things are also too related to Pizzagate now.

1395
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:12,660
And I don't think he wants to touch that one.

1396
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:16,900
Yeah, was that his fault indirectly?

1397
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,300
Did he start the whole Pizzagate thing?

1398
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:22,420
Or was it a random tweet that he turned into the echo chamber?

1399
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:27,060
I think that after that guy showed up at that pizza place with a gun,

1400
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:29,780
it was a hot potato and he had to drop it.

1401
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:33,300
They had to clean the website of all of the mentions of it.

1402
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,740
They got rid of all of it.

1403
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:37,700
Well, not all of it, but all of their like main reporting on it.

1404
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:41,620
All the stuff where he was talking about it being something that needs to be investigated

1405
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:44,020
and citizen investigators do something about it.

1406
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:45,780
Shit like that.

1407
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:52,340
So he said the things that happened and then he was like, ooh, I wish they hadn't happened.

1408
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:56,900
And the guy, Joe Biggs, was a guy who used to work for him

1409
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:00,980
and he got fired around the same time and he was on the Pizzagate beat.

1410
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:03,380
So there's a little bit of suspiciousness.

1411
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:05,620
They've both put out videos talking about how like,

1412
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:06,660
no, I didn't get fired.

1413
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:08,180
I'm going on to bigger and better things.

1414
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:09,620
I got movies I'm writing.

1415
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:10,260
We'll see.

1416
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,380
Maybe that's the case.

1417
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:13,540
That is classic.

1418
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:15,940
I got fired from the TV show.

1419
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:18,420
You know, it was time for me to move on.

1420
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:20,820
I feel like my future is in feature films.

1421
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:21,220
Yeah.

1422
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:22,980
I've already had a couple of meetings.

1423
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,100
I won't tell you who they're with.

1424
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:24,600
Nope.

1425
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,860
But, you know, and frankly, it's really just about me.

1426
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:29,300
I've made all of my money.

1427
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:32,180
It rhymes with Barney Bernstein.

1428
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:37,940
I don't even care if I meet with George Soros about producing these films.

1429
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:42,100
The thing that made it stink to high heaven was Alex put out a video where he was talking

1430
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:44,660
about how talented Joe Biggs was and stuff like that.

1431
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:48,900
I was like, dude, like you're just, you're the canary in the coal mine now.

1432
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:49,780
Now you're saying this.

1433
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:50,740
I know it's not true.

1434
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:51,060
Right.

1435
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,260
He has dirt on you.

1436
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:52,900
Right.

1437
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:53,460
I love you.

1438
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:55,620
It's time to pray.

1439
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:57,220
Let's watch the rest of this clip.

1440
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:58,900
Here we go.

1441
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,100
And I don't even mean the general public.

1442
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,100
The general public's important and there's someone awake now.

1443
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:08,100
But the people that do the hanging, the military, the police, the bureaucrats, the judges,

1444
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:11,460
the lawyers, the congresspeople, they all listen.

1445
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:12,900
The Russian government listens.

1446
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,340
The British government listens.

1447
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:16,180
The Israeli government listens.

1448
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:17,780
The Pakistani government listens.

1449
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:19,300
The Japanese government listens.

1450
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:25,540
The communist Chinese listen and hate my guts because they know, folks, this is the real

1451
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:25,860
place.

1452
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:29,860
I don't want to differentiate myself and say this is the only place you really get information

1453
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:31,140
of this magnitude.

1454
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:37,140
It's the only place you get it this strong, this focused, this dedicated, this continual.

1455
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,060
We don't take breaks around here.

1456
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:39,540
I don't.

1457
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:42,980
I would like to point out after him saying he doesn't take breaks, he had someone else

1458
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:44,340
host the fourth hour of the show.

1459
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:49,620
And he pretty routinely has people host the fourth hour.

1460
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:54,420
Well, and he also doesn't want to say that, you know, he's putting himself as the only

1461
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:56,020
voice, but, uh, you know.

1462
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:56,660
But I'm the only voice.

1463
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:57,300
He's the only voice.

1464
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,060
I don't want to say it.

1465
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:03,140
I'll let other people say it for me, specifically the Pakistani government.

1466
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,660
That's an amazing level of narcissism.

1467
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:05,220
Question.

1468
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:10,100
Does he know who anyone in the Pakistani government?

1469
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:11,780
Uh, maybe one guy.

1470
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:12,260
All right.

1471
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:14,740
Does he know the capital of Pakistan?

1472
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:16,740
Uh, Khartoum?

1473
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:17,540
I don't know.

1474
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:18,180
Is that right?

1475
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,060
I have no idea.

1476
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:20,260
I don't know the capital of Pakistan.

1477
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,620
That's a capital of something.

1478
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:25,940
I thought you said Khartoum and we're back on Aladdin, so there's that.

1479
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:26,740
Ali Ababwa.

1480
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:29,540
I'm pretty sure he's from Pakistan.

1481
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:31,060
That might be racist.

1482
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:31,780
It's not racist.

1483
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,300
It's getting there.

1484
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:41,540
I know I took a geography class in high school and I know, like, four country capitals still.

1485
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:42,740
And that's it.

1486
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:43,620
I don't know Pakistan's.

1487
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:44,340
I don't remember.

1488
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:45,540
Because it's not fun to say.

1489
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:46,500
No.

1490
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,340
Burkina Faso's capital?

1491
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:49,780
Ouagadougou.

1492
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:50,580
That's pretty fun to say.

1493
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:51,220
So fun.

1494
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:52,020
That is fun to say.

1495
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:52,740
Madagascar?

1496
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,140
Antananarivo.

1497
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:55,940
Oh, yeah.

1498
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:56,980
I know Antananarivo.

1499
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:57,620
So fun.

1500
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:59,860
It features heavily in the Civilization games.

1501
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:00,420
Honduras?

1502
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:02,500
Tugulgegalpa.

1503
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,700
Really?

1504
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:04,740
I might be out.

1505
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:05,620
That is good.

1506
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:06,420
That's my high school.

1507
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:07,620
So none of the big ones?

1508
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:08,100
None of...

1509
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:10,420
Like what?

1510
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:12,740
I know Brazil is Brasilia, right?

1511
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:14,260
Don't know.

1512
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:14,820
Okay.

1513
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:17,060
I mean, like, European nations...

1514
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:17,780
Like which ones?

1515
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:19,300
I mean, pick...

1516
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:19,780
Name one.

1517
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:21,460
France?

1518
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:22,340
That's Paris.

1519
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:24,740
You're rolling your eyes.

1520
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:24,740
Is that the capital?

1521
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:25,540
You have no idea.

1522
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:26,180
Is that the capital?

1523
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:27,060
Probably.

1524
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:29,700
I feel like it's the same way where people are like...

1525
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:30,820
What do you think the capital is?

1526
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:33,380
The capital of California is LA.

1527
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,340
No, it's Sacramento.

1528
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:34,820
We all know that.

1529
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:35,460
Exactly.

1530
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:36,580
Well, we don't all know that.

1531
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:37,300
Some of us do.

1532
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,180
Some of us do.

1533
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:39,380
You know who doesn't want to know that?

1534
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:40,260
The globalists.

1535
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:40,820
That's true.

1536
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:41,700
So actually, Alex has...

1537
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:44,180
Or Saudi Arabia or the Pakistani government.

1538
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:45,620
Definitely not the Communist Chinese.

1539
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:49,380
Before we do anything, can we go back to the list?

1540
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:50,740
Just isolate the list.

1541
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:54,500
Because the next time we record, I'm gonna have to take notes.

1542
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:55,460
Doesn't Hillary know she attacks me?

1543
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:57,140
Oh, do you want me to play it or are you...

1544
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:59,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Isolate just the clip of him listing...

1545
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:02,260
The police, the bureaucrats, the judges...

1546
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:02,900
No, hold up.

1547
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:03,540
Before that.

1548
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:04,420
Go back one second.

1549
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:05,540
They all listen.

1550
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:06,340
The people who do the hanging.

1551
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:08,100
The people who do the hanging.

1552
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:08,500
Yeah.

1553
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:09,460
What is that?

1554
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:10,180
What does that mean?

1555
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:12,100
I think it means people who are hanging out.

1556
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:12,580
I hope.

1557
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,020
I fucking hope.

1558
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:17,060
That can't mean the people who do the hanging.

1559
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:19,220
Like, I think he's talking about stringing people up.

1560
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:21,780
Yeah, he very nearly said lynching.

1561
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:22,260
Yeah.

1562
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:23,220
No, no, no, no.

1563
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:23,540
Let's not...

1564
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:26,100
Well, that would be racially charged.

1565
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:30,740
And I want to defend Alex when it's appropriate, and that's not fair of you.

1566
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:32,340
He wasn't going to say lynching.

1567
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:33,220
No, you're right.

1568
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:35,380
He wasn't going to it, but yeah.

1569
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:35,860
Because...

1570
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:37,380
I was pulling that...

1571
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:40,820
That would be ascribing racism in a situation where he's just being wacky.

1572
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:41,780
You're absolutely right.

1573
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:43,140
And he is wrong.

1574
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:43,700
Yes.

1575
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,100
But also, the people who do the hanging still makes no sense.

1576
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:49,540
The people who do the hanging are the military, the police.

1577
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:52,980
So he starts with those as the people who do the hanging.

1578
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:54,820
The judges, the bureaucrats.

1579
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:56,260
The lawyers.

1580
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:57,380
But I think he has to mean that...

1581
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:01,540
The government, the Pakistani government, the communist Chinese who hate him.

1582
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:01,780
Right.

1583
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:03,780
I like how he singled them out for hating him.

1584
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:04,500
But they listen.

1585
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:06,580
Like, the Pakistani government is like,

1586
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:07,700
eh, we like that guy.

1587
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:11,460
Also, the implication seems to me to be that, like,

1588
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:15,780
all 10,000 people who work in government listen to him.

1589
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:16,500
Yeah.

1590
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:20,900
No fucking way they get any work done if they're listening four hours a day to his pill ads.

1591
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:21,620
They have to.

1592
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:23,460
They have to listen to him.

1593
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:23,940
Because it's his only place.

1594
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,460
Because he's the only place.

1595
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:26,660
He doesn't want to say it.

1596
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:27,160
Yeah.

1597
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:31,140
But he is the only place that gives it to you this focused.

1598
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:32,020
Well, I think...

1599
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:33,620
Which is my favorite thing he said.

1600
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:34,660
This focused.

1601
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:36,180
Yeah, he's not focused at all.

1602
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:38,980
As he's just rambling on about different...

1603
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:41,620
All the governments that he knows were in that list.

1604
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:45,220
If we keep doing this, I will make a supercut of all the times he says,

1605
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:46,740
I've got to get to this story.

1606
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:48,660
And then not get to it.

1607
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:51,460
Because it happens 10 times a day, at least.

1608
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:56,340
But see, again, that's another brilliant move, because it builds you up.

1609
01:02:56,340 --> 01:03:00,020
It does the same thing that local news always does, where it's like,

1610
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:01,380
this story is about kittens.

1611
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:02,020
Stay tuned.

1612
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:02,980
Are your children dying?

1613
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:04,340
You know, like that kind of a thing.

1614
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:09,060
Yeah, there's a comedian named Ron Raimi who would do a similar trick rhetorically on stage.

1615
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:09,460
Yeah.

1616
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,540
He would do like a, I gotta go.

1617
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:14,500
Like this sort of thing that teased like, he's gonna be leaving any minute now.

1618
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:14,900
Right.

1619
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:17,140
So we gotta pay attention to this guy before he goes.

1620
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:18,020
It's the same thing.

1621
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:20,260
In the first five minutes of a 45 minutes.

1622
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:23,940
Yeah, and then by the time you caught on to it, you liked the trick.

1623
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:24,180
Right.

1624
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:26,980
So it becomes like, he's not gonna leave, but we like this.

1625
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:27,860
It's the same thing.

1626
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:28,980
It's a call and response.

1627
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:30,420
I've got so much to get to.

1628
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:30,820
Right.

1629
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:32,500
It's got this big story here.

1630
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:32,900
Right.

1631
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:34,020
And you never get to it.

1632
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:35,700
You just have more fucking pill ads.

1633
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:40,980
But listen, Jordan, I feel like you don't believe that these people listen to his show.

1634
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:44,260
And for your bitch ass, Alex has some more words.

1635
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:47,620
I am suspicious, but let's see where we go.

1636
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:52,100
Well said, there's a new Washington Post article by their editors saying Trump reading info

1637
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:55,380
wars can tank markets, start wars, basically.

1638
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:56,660
And we put that headline back up.

1639
01:03:58,180 --> 01:03:59,700
They're getting ready to tank the markets.

1640
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,700
They're raising interest rates to tank the markets.

1641
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:04,500
They're getting ready to knock out the power grid.

1642
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:05,300
They're going to blame Trump.

1643
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,660
They're going to blame the Russians.

1644
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:11,780
Everything they do, everything they blame us of is what they're really planning.

1645
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:14,180
And Washington Post editor, Trump reading info wars.

1646
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:18,020
I want to take a break really quick to point this out that he says that all the fucking

1647
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,820
time, which leads me to believe that the inverse is true.

1648
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:21,860
Well, yeah.

1649
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:25,460
Whatever they say we're doing is what they're doing.

1650
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:25,780
Right.

1651
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:29,060
When it's like, it kind of feels like that applies to you.

1652
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:31,700
I'm rubber, you're glue.

1653
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:32,420
Yeah.

1654
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:37,700
It reminds me of when my brother would do something when we were kids and then accuse

1655
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,060
me of doing it to our parents.

1656
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:39,460
Right.

1657
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:43,140
Like it reminds me of very adolescent bullying techniques.

1658
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:46,740
Then he he brings this up over and over and over and over again.

1659
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:50,820
This like idea that the globalists accuse him of the things they're doing.

1660
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,500
It's insane or whatever.

1661
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:53,000
Anyway.

1662
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:54,660
So Trump reads info wars.

1663
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:58,580
Trump reads info wars to tank the markets, invite incursions.

1664
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:00,580
Why do you think Trump reads info wars?

1665
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,700
Let me just go ahead and tell the mainstream media because they don't seem to figure it

1666
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:04,200
out.

1667
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:07,700
It's not just Flynn that listens and reads info wars.

1668
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:10,100
It's all of them dummies.

1669
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:11,940
I'm not bragging.

1670
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:14,980
And by the way, the generals don't learn anything from me.

1671
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:22,100
There's only a couple websites like WorldNetDaily, drugsreport.com, Breitbart, info wars that

1672
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:24,180
they can go read that they know are real.

1673
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:26,820
You understand that dumb ass?

1674
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:27,460
Excuse me.

1675
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:28,020
I'm sorry.

1676
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:28,660
God, I apologize.

1677
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:29,620
I'm not trying to be like that.

1678
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:31,460
I'm so angry for my normal filters.

1679
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:32,180
Okay.

1680
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:33,540
And I started thinking about the new world order.

1681
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:34,420
I get really angry.

1682
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:39,060
The generals all listen stupid.

1683
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:45,540
The foreign governments listen stupid because they know we know what we're talking about.

1684
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:46,740
We're dead on.

1685
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:50,820
I don't say that from some ego perspective.

1686
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:52,020
I wish I was wrong.

1687
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:54,100
He also says that a lot.

1688
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:55,140
I wish I was wrong.

1689
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:57,220
He would never say it from an ego perspective.

1690
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:58,980
No, he's not doing this for show.

1691
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:00,100
No, no, no.

1692
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:00,600
Yeah.

1693
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:06,100
I wish I was wrong is almost like a hook on his rap song.

1694
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,300
I wish I was wrong.

1695
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,380
And then, I mean, if you want to guys, if you're listening.

1696
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:12,340
Nick Dogg came to life to sing the hook on that.

1697
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:13,620
I wish I was wrong.

1698
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:19,060
Go to YouTube and just search Alex Jones failed predictions.

1699
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:22,180
And there's wonderful compilations of like a hundred times.

1700
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:24,980
He's been so fucking wrong about everything.

1701
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:25,300
The idea of-

1702
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:27,940
Then his wish come true.

1703
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:29,300
We should all be so lucky.

1704
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:30,020
Right?

1705
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:31,620
His wishes are, he's-

1706
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:35,220
Also everyone, if you hear my voice, I don't want to play it on the show.

1707
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:37,620
Although maybe one time we should do it for a special episode.

1708
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:38,120
Okay.

1709
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:44,100
Do yourselves a favor and go fucking listen to the Y2K episode of Alex Jones' show.

1710
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:44,660
It's on YouTube.

1711
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:45,780
There was a Y2-

1712
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:47,540
He's been doing this for how long?

1713
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:48,820
Like 25 years.

1714
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:50,580
Holy goddamn shit.

1715
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:53,700
Yeah, so on December 31st, 1999,

1716
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:59,780
he was creating a panic and trying to get people to riot, essentially.

1717
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:00,500
Wow.

1718
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:04,980
Yeah, he was feeding into a lot of like real horrible paranoia.

1719
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:10,180
And what's interesting now, he talks about how like Russia is, you know, sort of good guys.

1720
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:10,420
Right.

1721
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:12,260
He's on board with Russia.

1722
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:13,380
As we all know they are.

1723
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:18,820
In his Y2K broadcast, he's talking about how Putin, this guy Putin the ruthless is evil.

1724
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:22,420
He's talking all this shit on this guy who flash forward 17 years.

1725
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,860
17 years is a long time, number one.

1726
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:33,140
Now, number two, here is my favorite thing about the Russian paranoia right now.

1727
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:38,100
Because that is like the flip on that was so fast.

1728
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:39,220
What do you mean by that?

1729
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:43,060
Well, I mean, the right wing was crazy.

1730
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:47,300
Like the moment the Cold War ended, they wanted to start a new Cold War.

1731
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:54,020
So now because of the whole Trump thing, now Democrats are all on this,

1732
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:55,940
oh, Russia tampered with the election.

1733
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:58,580
And they probably did in some fashion.

1734
01:07:58,580 --> 01:07:59,220
Sure.

1735
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:03,620
Whether or not it was like a direct thing or an indirect thing.

1736
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:10,820
The one problem I have with it all is that just like he says,

1737
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:14,580
we've done all the same shit, man.

1738
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:16,580
America's done all of that.

1739
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:18,020
We've done worse, probably.

1740
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:21,220
Well, I mean, we've deposed many governments.

1741
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:22,820
Unjustified wars, but we...

1742
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:30,100
Yeah, there's a reason the term Banana Republic was not invented by the wonderful clothing store.

1743
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:30,500
Yeah.

1744
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:31,140
Sponsor us.

1745
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:36,740
It is because we overthrew a few governments for, you know,

1746
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:39,220
our corporations to sell bananas.

1747
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:40,100
For Chiquita.

1748
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:41,060
Yeah, exactly.

1749
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:41,780
Or Dole.

1750
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:46,820
So I get where they're coming from, and it's always worse when it happens to you,

1751
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:50,740
but it's such a hugely hypocritical concept.

1752
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:53,540
Well, the difference is, I think you and I would be fair about that,

1753
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:57,140
is that we recognize that the government has done very horrible things.

1754
01:08:57,140 --> 01:09:02,020
But I also, I would take the side that it is worse that it's happening to us.

1755
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:08,500
Because if we're gone, or if we're in some weird flux state,

1756
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,900
it does destabilize things a great deal.

1757
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:11,860
Right, absolutely.

1758
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:13,620
Now, I don't think that it, you know,

1759
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:20,500
given the entire stretch of history and how long the world is, essentially,

1760
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,700
the time of the world is.

1761
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,220
Well, 6,000 years.

1762
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:25,220
And if you don't believe that, it's time to pray.

1763
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:27,220
It's time to pray.

1764
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:29,860
We will have to go down at some point, right?

1765
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:31,460
I mean, it's just, it's natural.

1766
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:34,180
You know, kingdoms come and go, as it were.

1767
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:37,860
Well, and we're clearly tearing ourselves down as we speak.

1768
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:38,260
Sure.

1769
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:42,820
I mean, what is it, the average lifespan of every sort of kingdom,

1770
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:48,020
or big colonial power is about 200 years, and then it starts to fall apart, basically?

1771
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:50,020
Isn't that the sort of guideline?

1772
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:54,100
You know, I couldn't say, because, you know,

1773
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:57,460
the big histories are written about people who lasted, you know,

1774
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:58,820
a thousand years or whatever it is.

1775
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:01,220
But even those ones have discrete periods within them.

1776
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:01,940
Oh, absolutely.

1777
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:03,140
So they're, but all I mean.

1778
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:06,340
Like, if you want to go through the history of Chinese government,

1779
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:09,140
that is one of the most fascinating, you know.

1780
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:10,580
The Three Kingdoms period.

1781
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:15,380
Yeah, the different dynasties, the Zhou, the Qin, like, that's all good stuff.

1782
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:18,980
Which we don't respect at all as history, because it's so weird and different to us.

1783
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:20,340
No, I don't like it.

1784
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:24,100
Because it's interesting, but it's not about us.

1785
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:24,420
Right.

1786
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:24,980
You know?

1787
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:25,220
Right.

1788
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:27,620
But because they're the communist Chinese.

1789
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:33,060
Also, if you were to learn anything about history, you would then have to apply it to now,

1790
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:36,500
and that would mean changing a lot of the ways you think about stuff.

1791
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:40,020
It also requires you to load in a bit of empathy.

1792
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:42,180
Yeah, I'm way against that.

1793
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:43,140
That's troubling to some.

1794
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:45,620
Well, see, because if you're empathetic, you know,

1795
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:49,460
then what they're doing is everything that you're doing.

1796
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:50,260
Yeah.

1797
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:55,940
I would say that no matter what, I still don't want us to go down right now,

1798
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:58,420
because it would be very unpleasant for me.

1799
01:10:58,420 --> 01:10:59,620
Yeah, I mean, that is...

1800
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:02,900
If it has to happen, let it happen after I'm dead.

1801
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:03,860
I'm not gonna have any kids.

1802
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:08,340
I do think there is a part of mortality where it is like,

1803
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:13,620
you know, if I have to die, I feel like everybody should go with me, right?

1804
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:16,180
Well, sure, I remember when I used to smoke a lot of weed,

1805
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:17,940
me and a couple friends would sit around,

1806
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:21,620
and one of the things we always were like super fascinated by

1807
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:24,580
is the idea of being able to see the end.

1808
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:29,700
Like, what a privilege that would be to be one of the humans who gets to see it all end.

1809
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:31,220
Yeah, yeah, that would be cool.

1810
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:33,460
There's something to be said for that, but I still don't want it.

1811
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:33,780
No.

1812
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:37,940
I'd rather live, or I'd rather it happen when I'm like 90.

1813
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:38,820
Right, right, right.

1814
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:43,060
It would be good to already be dying, and then everything else starts dying, too.

1815
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:43,860
That would be pretty fun.

1816
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:44,820
Yeah, that'd be boss.

1817
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:45,460
Yeah.

1818
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:48,900
Um, okay, so here's another narrative piece,

1819
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:52,020
back to in the same vein as the George Soros thing.

1820
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:53,540
Now, hold up one second.

1821
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:53,860
Sorry.

1822
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:55,300
Before we go any further.

1823
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:55,540
Yeah.

1824
01:11:57,380 --> 01:12:03,300
Here is why Trump reads Infowars was never answered.

1825
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:03,940
Nope.

1826
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:06,260
He brought up, here's why Trump did this,

1827
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:09,460
then immediately switched over to Flynn.

1828
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:09,780
Yeah.

1829
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:14,260
I am so mad, and he was supposed to answer why, and I want to know.

1830
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:14,660
You know why?

1831
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:16,900
Because, again, the spirit got too good to him.

1832
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:17,220
Yeah.

1833
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:18,740
It's this thing that gets in him.

1834
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:21,780
The boogie woogie bandit comes in and takes over.

1835
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:25,700
But I would have accepted literally any explanation.

1836
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:27,620
He can't fucking explain why Trump listens,

1837
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:31,220
because it's too important to let you know that everyone listens, dummy.

1838
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:31,780
Okay, that's true.

1839
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:33,940
Dummy, you dumb, dumb person.

1840
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:37,460
But he could have made up anything, and because it's Trump,

1841
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:41,700
I probably would have been, at the very least, entertained that notion.

1842
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:42,100
Sure.

1843
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:43,860
Should be like, hey, you know why he listens?

1844
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,460
We gave him a free password.

1845
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:48,740
Yeah, or not even that, just like, do you know why he listens?

1846
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:52,020
Because everybody's got to read something on the toilet every day.

1847
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:52,980
Like, I don't know.

1848
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:55,540
That would be a real disappointing reveal.

1849
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:56,580
Yeah, that's true.

1850
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:57,780
He would never reveal that.

1851
01:12:57,780 --> 01:13:00,260
He did say, you know, I'm going to tell you why he listens,

1852
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:02,420
and the mainstream media can't figure this out,

1853
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:04,420
so you do expect it's going to be something big.

1854
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:04,820
Right.

1855
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:09,060
I guess the answer is that he listens because everyone important listens.

1856
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:10,260
Everyone important listens.

1857
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:10,500
Yeah.

1858
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:11,700
But that's not a why.

1859
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:12,740
Dummy, dummy.

1860
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:15,540
Unless you're saying it's like a peer pressure thing.

1861
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:18,420
Well, no, no, no, no, I think you're being unfair.

1862
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:21,220
Even then, Trump doesn't even go to intelligence briefings.

1863
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:22,580
Nope, because he gets all he needs.

1864
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:26,260
And since they obviously listen to InfoWars.

1865
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:26,900
Everyone does.

1866
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:29,860
Wouldn't they be briefing him on InfoWars every day?

1867
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:34,020
So far, the only person I have evidence doesn't listen to InfoWars?

1868
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:36,420
You.

1869
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:40,660
From a very forensic standpoint, I guess you're correct there.

1870
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:41,620
And my cat.

1871
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:42,740
I guess you're correct.

1872
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:43,940
I try and keep it away from her.

1873
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:44,580
She doesn't need this.

1874
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:45,060
That's good.

1875
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:46,740
It's really stressful.

1876
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:48,340
I think you're being slightly unfair.

1877
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:49,300
Just a tiny bit.

1878
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:51,540
Not very unfair, but I think you're being a tiny bit unfair

1879
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:55,140
because there is an implied answer in there.

1880
01:13:55,140 --> 01:14:02,980
And that is that Zero Hedge, Bright Bart, Drudge, and Alex Jones

1881
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:05,860
are the only people who give actual news.

1882
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:09,540
OK, so that's why Trump listens to InfoWars.

1883
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:10,020
Yes.

1884
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:12,020
Because he needs the actual news.

1885
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:14,020
That's the implied answer to that question,

1886
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:16,820
which he doesn't really spell out, but he kind of does.

1887
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:19,220
That's another narrative that's going on.

1888
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:20,900
I was going to go to this other one about,

1889
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:24,260
I'm just going to cut this from what we need to cover,

1890
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:26,020
because I don't even need to play the audio.

1891
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:29,460
He just basically says that recess appointment,

1892
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:31,860
it's about Merrick Garland being put into the Supreme Court

1893
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:32,900
as a recess appointment.

1894
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:34,900
Rich, we can only goddamn hope.

1895
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:36,740
I mean, I think so.

1896
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:39,300
It is the, or at least have a fair shot.

1897
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:43,220
I would rather it go and be debated and what have you,

1898
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:45,940
but Alex's point is that it's,

1899
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:46,980
now we're fucking talking about it,

1900
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:48,100
so I might as well play the clip.

1901
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:48,420
Right.

1902
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:48,920
All right.

1903
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:51,620
Because I don't want to act like I'm putting words in his mouth.

1904
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:51,940
Right.

1905
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:52,820
Gotcha.

1906
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:54,100
Now this just broke.

1907
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:56,100
It's up on InfoWars.com.

1908
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:58,260
It's up on DrudgeReport.com.

1909
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:03,380
Obama still could force Merrick Garland onto the court

1910
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:06,100
during intercession recess.

1911
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:11,140
So no president's ever done stuff like this,

1912
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:13,540
but they're talking about with 17 days left,

1913
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:18,340
trying to force a new individual onto the Supreme Court.

1914
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:19,140
So the part that-

1915
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:19,940
Definitely not true.

1916
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:21,300
A hundred percent.

1917
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:23,460
George Washington made a recess appointment.

1918
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:24,980
I don't remember that.

1919
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:27,380
That was clearly before the constitution was written.

1920
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:29,940
President, since George Washington have made recess appointments,

1921
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:32,740
Washington appointed South Carolina Judge John Rutledge

1922
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:34,260
as Chief Justice of the United States

1923
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:36,740
during the congressional recess in 1795.

1924
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:37,060
Hmm.

1925
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:38,820
Uh, because of-

1926
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:42,660
Yeah, but that was, that was, he was, he was, uh, you know,

1927
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:43,940
still in the infancy.

1928
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:45,860
He was, he was making some mistakes.

1929
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:48,740
Because of Rutledge's political views and occasional mental illness,

1930
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:50,740
however, the Senate rejected his nomination

1931
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:53,060
and Rutledge attempted suicide and resigned.

1932
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:58,260
Oh, I love American history so much.

1933
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:01,060
Beyond that, New Jersey Judge William J. Brennan

1934
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:03,860
was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Dwight D. Eisenhower

1935
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:06,100
in 1956 by a recess appointment.

1936
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:06,980
Never heard of him.

1937
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:08,180
Uh, buh buh buh buh.

1938
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:09,140
I mean, Eisenhower.

1939
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:11,780
George H.W. Bush appointed Lawrence Eagleberger

1940
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:14,580
as Secretary of State during recess in 1992.

1941
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:17,300
That was clearly too far back for Alex Jones to have read.

1942
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:20,420
President Ronald Reagan made 240 recess appointments,

1943
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:22,180
an average of 30 per year.

1944
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:25,300
President H.W. Bush made 77 recess appointments,

1945
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:25,380
an average of-

1946
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:26,500
Do you mean George W.?

1947
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:26,980
H.W.

1948
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:27,540
Oh, H.W.

1949
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:30,260
Made 19 per year, basically 77 total.

1950
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:33,860
Bill Clinton made 109, or 139 recess appointments,

1951
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:35,780
an average of 17 per year.

1952
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:39,300
President George W. Bush made 171 recess appointments,

1953
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:41,060
an average of 21 per year.

1954
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:44,740
And as of January 5th, 2012, President Barack Obama

1955
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:48,420
had made 32, the least of anyone on this list,

1956
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:50,500
an average of 4.5 per year.

1957
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:51,860
But that does not matter.

1958
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:55,700
But all of the Obama information always

1959
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:59,620
winds up to being, Obama's a dictator, and he's doing this,

1960
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:01,380
but it's always the least of anybody else.

1961
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:02,180
That doesn't matter.

1962
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:02,820
It doesn't matter.

1963
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:06,740
The least recess appointments, the least vacation days,

1964
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:07,860
all these things he's a tech for.

1965
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:10,420
No, he played golf one time, so he's the worst.

1966
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:12,580
The statistics don't match up, but the reason

1967
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:14,260
that I have included this in terms

1968
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:17,940
of this list of false narratives is it's-

1969
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:18,420
One quick question.

1970
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:20,340
He can't not know the facts.

1971
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:21,540
He can't not know that.

1972
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:22,820
I absolutely disagree.

1973
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:24,020
No.

1974
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:27,620
He absolutely does not know about recess appointments.

1975
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:30,180
I would guarantee that.

1976
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:32,420
You think it's like you're telling a Supreme Court

1977
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:33,940
justice to go play foursquare?

1978
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:34,980
You think that's what he thinks?

1979
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:36,580
I, well-

1980
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:37,300
Tether ball?

1981
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:41,060
Did you say any, like it was George Washington

1982
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:42,660
who did the Supreme Court.

1983
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:44,020
The first one, yeah.

1984
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:47,460
Were there any other Supreme Court other than Eisenhower?

1985
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:48,580
I don't know.

1986
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:50,660
I didn't do a full investigation.

1987
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:53,940
Because he's clearly not going to pay attention

1988
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:56,660
to any recess appointment that's not the Supreme Court.

1989
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:59,460
But you could do any cursory amount of research

1990
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:00,900
and find these facts.

1991
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:03,300
Yeah, but he's not going to-

1992
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:04,100
He has a team.

1993
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:06,580
Recess appointments are not going to be something

1994
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:07,380
that he researched.

1995
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:08,900
He has a fucking team.

1996
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:14,420
But they're not there to learn things or to learn.

1997
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:17,060
They're not there to develop a-

1998
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:18,760
Truth?

1999
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,600
No, no, no, not even that.

2000
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,520
They're there to develop a narrative.

2001
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:25,880
So their entire job is to filter out information

2002
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:29,240
that supports them from information that doesn't.

2003
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:29,720
Right.

2004
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:30,280
I get you.

2005
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:35,240
What gets to Alex Jones is probably more the former

2006
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:36,120
than the latter.

2007
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:38,040
Yeah, but you undercut-

2008
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:43,080
So you're telling me that Alex Jones is doing

2009
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:44,440
any of his own research.

2010
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:45,320
I hope so.

2011
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,200
I hope some.

2012
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:47,240
Do you believe that?

2013
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:48,200
Yeah.

2014
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,600
Genuinely, you've listened to his show.

2015
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,600
This is the hardest question I've ever been asked.

2016
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:55,960
Do you truly believe that Alex Jones does his own research?

2017
01:18:55,960 --> 01:19:01,480
Maybe he did way back when he didn't have the All-Star team.

2018
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:02,040
Yeah.

2019
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:05,320
But now, has he done any research for the past 10 years?

2020
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,480
It's tough to say.

2021
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:11,240
In my heart of hearts, I have to believe he's done some,

2022
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:12,040
but not much.

2023
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:16,680
When was the last full book that he finished?

2024
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:20,280
And I'm not saying that as like a dig for,

2025
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:22,040
oh, I read and other people don't.

2026
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:24,920
I'm just saying that he does a four hour show.

2027
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:25,400
I would guess.

2028
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,400
He has an all day thing.

2029
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:30,440
I very much doubt he has time to really go through

2030
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:31,080
all of this stuff.

2031
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:34,200
Well, I would guess that it's probably none dare call it

2032
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,080
a conspiracy.

2033
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:37,880
The book that radicalized him in junior college.

2034
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:38,200
That's true.

2035
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,440
He's probably read that 100 times since then.

2036
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:41,160
That's possible.

2037
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,440
I bet that's the case.

2038
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:45,640
But even then, and his team's research,

2039
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:49,080
is that are they researching historians

2040
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:52,040
or are they aggregating information

2041
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:53,080
that is on the internet?

2042
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:54,760
And they're going to get yelled at if they come up

2043
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:56,360
with something that doesn't fit.

2044
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:57,400
Oh, absolutely.

2045
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,320
If they say one part of the narrative,

2046
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:03,560
if they say one thing that doesn't fit the narrative,

2047
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:06,200
because then they get fucking Joe Biggs out of there.

2048
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:06,760
Right.

2049
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,280
Well, that's the thing.

2050
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:11,640
That is the situation with belief.

2051
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:14,680
If you, once you get to a certain point,

2052
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:17,000
you're building a house of cards.

2053
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,200
So everything has to support that foundation.

2054
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:24,120
Otherwise, the whole thing, if just one piece of information

2055
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,800
that doesn't support the narrative,

2056
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,560
and the whole thing goes down.

2057
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:28,040
Right.

2058
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:33,160
So even if, and again, even if he did discover that

2059
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:37,560
in his research, there is almost always going to be

2060
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:40,680
a part in his mind that turns that into something

2061
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:42,360
that actually supports his narrative.

2062
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:45,960
I don't like that you're saying, because to mine ears,

2063
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:49,640
I hear this as a very positive statement about him.

2064
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:50,440
How so?

2065
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:52,440
Because what you're saying is he doesn't know

2066
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:55,880
that he's willfully deceiving about recess appointments.

2067
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:59,720
I would argue that ignorance is far worse

2068
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:03,640
in a broadcast situation than direct lying.

2069
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:05,160
No, I think direct lying is worse,

2070
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,680
because that means you're doing it for a reason.

2071
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:08,200
Do you agree with me?

2072
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,120
But he is doing it for a reason.

2073
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:11,160
But do you agree with me?

2074
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:12,360
And he's getting paid well for it.

2075
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:13,240
It's a good gig.

2076
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:13,560
Yeah.

2077
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:15,080
I mean, who knows how much he's making

2078
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,360
for those fucking weirdo pills.

2079
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:22,120
The truth of broadcasters, and this is the way it is on TV,

2080
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:25,560
and any kind of broadcaster, is if you listen to any

2081
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:30,120
of their personal interviews, most of them imply,

2082
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:33,240
and some of them have said, on a good day,

2083
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,000
I believe 40% of what I say.

2084
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:38,600
That's the job.

2085
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:39,880
Maybe podcasting is different.

2086
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:41,720
I believe pretty much everything I say.

2087
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:44,840
Well, yeah, but we're not being paid a lot of money.

2088
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:45,400
Nope, certainly not.

2089
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,640
To say whatever it is we're told to say.

2090
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:49,800
I wanted to make the premise of this show

2091
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,800
that we pretend that George Soros is paying us,

2092
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:53,000
but it's too late now.

2093
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:53,480
Ooh, yeah, no.

2094
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:54,440
We've already-

2095
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:55,400
Next episode, we'll-

2096
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:57,080
I've actually already kind of implied

2097
01:21:57,080 --> 01:22:01,080
that George Soros did commit the entire Holocaust.

2098
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:05,640
Um, OK, so it's time for a couple of grab bag clips.

2099
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:08,280
Oh, god, we're going to need some music for that.

2100
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:09,320
Bam, bam, bam, bam, we're staying.

2101
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:11,400
We're going to need some morning zoo crew,

2102
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,880
like, bam, bam, bam, boom, boom, boom.

2103
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:15,320
One of these days I'll buy a soundboard

2104
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:16,040
and we'll just have all that.

2105
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:19,000
Oh, the moment you do that, that's the end of this podcast.

2106
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,440
We're just going to play with the soundboard

2107
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:21,240
for the entire time.

2108
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:23,720
So one of this, I don't remember exactly what

2109
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:26,120
these two clips are, but I know that the first one

2110
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:27,240
is offensive, so-

2111
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,800
Oh, god damn you, I love you.

2112
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:30,520
Would you rather go-

2113
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:31,000
I love you.

2114
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:31,640
I love you.

2115
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:34,120
Would you rather go mystery first or offensive first?

2116
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:35,800
Um, you know what?

2117
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,640
I feel like we have to go offensive

2118
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:40,280
because we got to leave people with the mystery, right?

2119
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:40,840
Oh, no.

2120
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:41,960
Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2121
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:42,520
All right, all right, all right.

2122
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:43,080
See what I'm saying?

2123
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:43,720
Yeah, yeah, I got you.

2124
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:44,200
Here you go.

2125
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:44,840
This is offensive.

2126
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:47,560
Obama's refusal to veto anti-Israel UN vote

2127
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:50,200
ranked most anti-Semitic incident in 2016.

2128
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:53,000
You know, I don't want to say it's anti-Semitic,

2129
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,800
but funding jihadis all over the Middle East

2130
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:57,640
to kill every Christian they get a hold of

2131
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:58,920
is truly anti-Christian.

2132
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:00,920
And where are the Christians complaining about that?

2133
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:04,840
But I know this, it is anti-Israel to say,

2134
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:05,880
turn it over to the Palestinians,

2135
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:08,840
who if they took it over would never stop killing each other.

2136
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:12,280
They can't stop killing each other

2137
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:13,160
all over the Middle East.

2138
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:14,120
It's a joke.

2139
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:17,080
Clean up your own house before you run around

2140
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:19,800
lecturing the rest of the world, Muslims.

2141
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:21,800
Wow.

2142
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:24,200
All right, now, here is the...

2143
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,160
In context.

2144
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:28,920
Here is the absolute problem with that is,

2145
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:33,960
yes, he characterized them as Muslims altogether.

2146
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:36,360
No, no, no. Aggressively.

2147
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:38,360
Right, right.

2148
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:40,840
But the way he said that, Muslims.

2149
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:41,560
But the problem...

2150
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:43,320
Yeah, no, that's horrific.

2151
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,720
Get your own house and order, Muslims.

2152
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:46,920
Yeah, no, that's...

2153
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:49,240
And the Texas accent does not help his...

2154
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:50,440
No, sir, no, sir.

2155
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:53,640
Even if you're doing your best to not view him as racist,

2156
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:55,640
the Texas accent really makes it hard.

2157
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:58,440
But here is the problem with that,

2158
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,880
which there is a...

2159
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:04,920
If you learn the history of Islam, the Sunni-Shia divide

2160
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,960
has been the source of so much violence.

2161
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:13,320
Now, whether or not that is any different from any number...

2162
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:18,120
Like, hey, let's maybe talk about Ireland for one little second.

2163
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:21,000
And where are the Christians decrying that?

2164
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:24,680
But when did he...

2165
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:28,360
The twist, the twist that he had was so genius,

2166
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:29,560
and then he hid it.

2167
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:30,520
What are you talking about?

2168
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:33,640
Immediately following the Muslims killing each other,

2169
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:35,880
or right before the Muslims killing each other,

2170
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:40,280
he had the perfect twist, which was implying that Obama

2171
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:45,880
was funding Islamists murdering Christians all throughout, right?

2172
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:47,800
Oh, well, that's a big narrative of his.

2173
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,240
He said that...

2174
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:55,720
So he's saying that the no vote on the UN was not necessarily anti-Semitic.

2175
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:56,220
Right.

2176
01:24:56,220 --> 01:25:01,900
But the funding of Islamists murdering Christians all across the world

2177
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:06,220
is definitely anti-Christian, which is unrelated to the previous statement.

2178
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:08,220
Right, but if true, I agree.

2179
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:08,620
Exactly.

2180
01:25:08,620 --> 01:25:10,940
Well, it doesn't get more anti-Christian

2181
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:13,660
than funding the murdering of Christians.

2182
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:16,220
Yeah, I'll put that on the shelf.

2183
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:21,020
If we establish that as true, then yes, that is very anti-Christian.

2184
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:23,500
Once you prove that to me, you got a point.

2185
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:24,620
You are correct.

2186
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:25,260
You got a point.

2187
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:25,760
Right.

2188
01:25:26,540 --> 01:25:28,220
So we've got that, right?

2189
01:25:28,220 --> 01:25:34,700
Then we switch immediately back to the no vote is certainly anti-Israel,

2190
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:38,860
which, as we all can guess, is anti-Semitic, right?

2191
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:41,660
Or, I mean, I guess not...

2192
01:25:41,660 --> 01:25:42,540
No, no, it's hard to say.

2193
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:44,460
That is a very complicated...

2194
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:47,580
Like I said up top, Israel's very confusing to me.

2195
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:50,860
I think the no vote is absolutely the correct vote.

2196
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:51,360
100%.

2197
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:52,780
Or not maybe the abstaining.

2198
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:53,280
Yes.

2199
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:57,680
I believe a lot of the settlement stuff is very exploitative,

2200
01:25:57,680 --> 01:25:59,280
and a lot of people are dying.

2201
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,920
They're killing as many Palestinians as they can,

2202
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:10,880
which is so much of the deep-seated psychological issues there of Israel

2203
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:16,960
essentially trying to root out Palestinians is so fascinating to me.

2204
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:22,720
Yeah, but because the pure, I hate to say irony,

2205
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:26,160
but just like that idea of like,

2206
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:29,040
oh, now it's time to get them out of our country.

2207
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:30,800
The idea of Jews cleansing.

2208
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,760
Yeah, that's really hard to justify there.

2209
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:41,360
It's tough, but if you look at the narrative from the Alex Jones wing of it,

2210
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,120
they aren't Palestinians.

2211
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:43,620
Right.

2212
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:44,640
None of them are Palestinians.

2213
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:46,160
They're globalist Islamists.

2214
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:46,660
Right.

2215
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:48,120
Who have been brought in to destabilize.

2216
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:48,680
Right, right.

2217
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:53,320
Who are probably funded by the Open Society, George Soros, all this stuff.

2218
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:56,600
The one parallel I have to that,

2219
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:03,080
which I think is uninformed and at most an overgeneralization,

2220
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:05,080
or at least an overgeneralization,

2221
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:12,760
but the only thing I can think of to explain the Israeli takeover of Palestine

2222
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:18,200
and the settlements and the absolute unwillingness to even consider a compromise

2223
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:27,560
is like, you know how sexual abusers a lot of the times wind up having been sexually abused?

2224
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:28,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2225
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:34,360
That's the one thing that I can think of that is a parallel that makes sense in that narrative.

2226
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:37,320
Or like children of alcoholics often end up dating alcoholics.

2227
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:37,960
Exactly.

2228
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:41,160
Because you're trying to recreate the situation to make it right.

2229
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:41,800
Right.

2230
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:44,280
Well, but that's how it works on an interpersonal level,

2231
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:46,920
but I don't know how that works as a society.

2232
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:53,000
Well, I mean, if you want to call any unwieldy nation

2233
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:59,320
as a collection of children acting half as smart as the smartest of them,

2234
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:05,560
I mean, I can see it being at least a national identity.

2235
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:11,480
Like America, regardless of what side you are on in the two-party system,

2236
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:13,880
there is definitely a national identity, right?

2237
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:17,880
That's different from most other European countries.

2238
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:19,320
It's Americana.

2239
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:22,600
It's such a ridiculous country that we have

2240
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:28,120
that's filled with so many different regions that have zero to do with the others.

2241
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:30,440
And that's one of the things that make us so great.

2242
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:35,320
One consistent national identity, which is fuck the government.

2243
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:36,680
That's it.

2244
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:38,760
That's really our national identity.

2245
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:39,880
All right, let's go to this next clip.

2246
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:41,160
I have no idea what this is.

2247
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:43,720
All right, wait, we're going random grab bag?

2248
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:45,320
I really don't remember what this is.

2249
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,280
All right, let's do this.

2250
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:51,480
Let's say a nuclear war was breaking out with Russia and they just fired ICBMs in 1967.

2251
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:54,840
I would expect Walter Cronkite to be desperate and say,

2252
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:56,040
everybody get to your bunkers.

2253
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:57,960
The missiles will be here in five minutes.

2254
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:58,280
Yes.

2255
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:00,760
I mean, it's almost to that level now.

2256
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:06,440
The urgency of repudiating Obama, repudiating the globalists, repudiating George Soros,

2257
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:13,000
repudiating Henry Kissinger and all of these insane out of control anti-American people

2258
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,280
who just want to destroy prosperity to consolidate control

2259
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:19,480
and are willing to push us into World War Three to maintain their control.

2260
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:20,680
Wait, press pause real quick.

2261
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:23,000
Do you see Kissinger?

2262
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:23,640
He did.

2263
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:25,400
Who recently met with Mike Pence?

2264
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:28,280
I feel like he does not know anything about Kissinger.

2265
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:30,360
I don't know why you're saying that.

2266
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:32,840
That's another grab bag poll there.

2267
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:36,360
That's a Saudi Arabia in communist China.

2268
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:37,240
That's a mad lib.

2269
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:41,080
Kissinger could not be further on the side of Trump.

2270
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:42,840
Apparently.

2271
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:46,680
I mean, because you remember how Kissinger orchestrated the side?

2272
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:50,120
Anyways, Kissinger is an evil motherfucker.

2273
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:51,080
It does seem that way.

2274
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:51,800
Yeah.

2275
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:54,280
At a certain point, you want to arrest the independent press?

2276
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:55,640
You want people to come after me?

2277
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,360
You want to go after all of our freedoms?

2278
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:00,760
You want to be able to do all these horrible things?

2279
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:05,240
See, this is another reason why up top I wanted to make clear I don't want to go after him.

2280
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:05,640
No.

2281
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:07,240
I just want to have fun.

2282
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:08,280
I want to find out.

2283
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:10,040
I want to understand.

2284
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:13,000
Because he's so paranoid about people wanting to kick him off the air.

2285
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,080
I want to be clear that that's not what I want to do.

2286
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:15,560
No.

2287
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:15,960
No.

2288
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:21,080
Well, I mean, our entire livelihood, if you're listening to this a year from now,

2289
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:23,560
when we are the number one podcast on the planet.

2290
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:23,880
Hold on.

2291
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:25,160
We got to get to the end of it.

2292
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:27,000
I'm really curious where this is going to go.

2293
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:27,960
I'm excited.

2294
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:33,080
And then you just think we're going to sit here and take it and take it and take it and

2295
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:40,600
take it and take it and take it and take it and take it and take it and take it and take it.

2296
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:42,600
We're not going to take it and take it.

2297
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:43,160
You dumbass.

2298
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:44,600
You keep escalating.

2299
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:45,400
You're going to get hurt.

2300
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:49,160
I swear to you, I didn't loop that.

2301
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:50,440
That was the perfect.

2302
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:54,920
I deserve a podcast award for perfect timing on that.

2303
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:56,440
Also, this is only halfway through the clip.

2304
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:58,920
Believe me, you don't mean anything to me.

2305
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:00,280
So I don't even want to see you hurt.

2306
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:03,800
But not a dead rotting horse or something in the road.

2307
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:04,760
I'm going to look at you.

2308
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:07,240
That'll all brighten all you people.

2309
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:08,200
The hell is your problem?

2310
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:10,520
Bunch of sick freaks.

2311
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:11,560
Bunch of neurotics.

2312
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:12,600
Want to run everything.

2313
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:13,800
Want to control everybody.

2314
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:16,040
You can't stand people that are better looking than you.

2315
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:17,960
You can't stand people that are stronger than you.

2316
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:20,520
You've got some weird twisted competitiveness in you.

2317
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:24,840
It's like they say in the great book, they turn into a film that will be bloody.

2318
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:26,840
Goes, I have a competitiveness about me.

2319
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:28,600
I don't want anybody else to succeed.

2320
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:29,640
Okay.

2321
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:31,160
I remember why I pulled this clip now.

2322
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:33,640
This is one of these great.

2323
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:34,520
We're not going to take it.

2324
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:35,400
We're not going to take it.

2325
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:36,360
We're not going to take it.

2326
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:37,400
We're not going to take it.

2327
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:37,900
We're going to.

2328
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:43,000
This is such a great example of Alex Jones losing the thread halfway through a sentence.

2329
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:43,640
Oh, absolutely.

2330
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:47,560
It's just this perfect like, hey, they're trying to destroy the, uh, you know, they're

2331
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:48,600
trying to take me off the air.

2332
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,840
The independent media trying to get rid of it.

2333
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:53,240
Also, uh, Madeline Albright's mad at people.

2334
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:55,560
Where did Madeline Albright come from?

2335
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:57,640
She's mad at people who are more attractive than her.

2336
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:00,440
Why is he mad at Madeline Albright?

2337
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:01,660
Now.

2338
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:06,840
Well, it's, it's time to really take down Madeline Albright.

2339
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:12,120
So he's now, this is where the thread, like he loses it entirely.

2340
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:15,240
And the end of this sentence is bananas.

2341
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:20,840
Oh, well it's, it's exactly like when you're, I know, I know, but before we go any further,

2342
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:27,800
it's exactly like you've been on this situation in on stage where you're too drunk.

2343
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:28,440
Oh yeah.

2344
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:31,400
And you're talking and you're getting to the bit.

2345
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:36,600
And then halfway through all of a sudden your brain goes, nope, don't know the bit anymore.

2346
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:39,080
So you just start saying stuff because you know,

2347
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:41,720
eventually your brain's just going to at least pick something up.

2348
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:42,280
Yeah.

2349
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:44,200
That is exactly what we're not going to take it.

2350
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:45,000
We're not going to take it.

2351
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,040
We're not going to take it was.

2352
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:48,120
Now what's great about this is he does find a thread.

2353
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:48,840
It's the wrong thread.

2354
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:49,960
It's completely different.

2355
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:54,200
So he starts going down that path and he thinks he's going to find it again and he doesn't.

2356
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:56,600
And it just goes to commercial, which is great.

2357
01:32:56,600 --> 01:33:01,000
But how this fucking commercial break ends is amazing.

2358
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,160
So he's just talked about how like, and there will be blood.

2359
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:04,840
It's about competition, right?

2360
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:09,640
I don't want anybody to succeed at my expense walking on me.

2361
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:14,600
But if you innovate, I'm only going to try to model myself after you.

2362
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:15,720
And I'm going to admire you.

2363
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:22,120
I mean, I've literally pulled up by somebody's sports car before.

2364
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:23,000
That's super awesome.

2365
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:27,960
And my car is parked next to him and that is an incredible car.

2366
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:29,080
They're like, Oh man, sorry.

2367
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:29,320
Sorry.

2368
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:30,040
It's better than yours.

2369
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:31,320
No way.

2370
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:34,600
Is the commercial is the commercial music starting?

2371
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:35,560
Okay.

2372
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:37,000
It's like the Oscars playing.

2373
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,800
Yeah, they're playing them off because they realize he's lost it.

2374
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:40,040
Yeah.

2375
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:43,880
Like this guy in a nice car pulls up and he's like, Hey, that's a nice car.

2376
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:46,600
And the guy in the car is like, Hey, sorry, it's better than yours.

2377
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:49,240
But like not being a dick, he's being actually like, Hey man, look,

2378
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:49,640
I'm sorry.

2379
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:50,920
My car is better than yours.

2380
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:55,800
That has never fucking happened a thousand times in the negative.

2381
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:56,360
Never happened.

2382
01:33:57,320 --> 01:33:57,880
You know what?

2383
01:33:57,880 --> 01:33:59,160
Let's see where he goes.

2384
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:00,600
That's like, no, no, no.

2385
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:03,160
Literally, I don't care that your car is so cool.

2386
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:04,200
It looks like a spaceship.

2387
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,680
You know, personally, I wouldn't drive a car like that.

2388
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:09,560
It's brought too much tension, but man, that's really a piece of art.

2389
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:10,280
You know, incredible.

2390
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:12,520
You know, it's like people don't get it.

2391
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:14,280
You know, they don't.

2392
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:16,760
Competitiveness means you like the competition.

2393
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:19,400
It's not that you don't like people that are successful, but that's who the

2394
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:20,040
global star.

2395
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:20,840
Okay.

2396
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:24,440
And off to commercial and okay.

2397
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,400
So the globalists are people.

2398
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:31,720
If you recall where that sentence started, it had to do with people trying

2399
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:33,000
to kick him off the air.

2400
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:34,440
Right.

2401
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:37,560
Which I guess if you want to be very generous, you could say that the idea

2402
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:39,640
of competition he's competition to them.

2403
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:43,640
Um, I guess now they want to kill him though.

2404
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:44,520
Yeah.

2405
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:45,880
I don't understand.

2406
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:46,600
They want to.

2407
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:48,280
They don't want to drive him off the air.

2408
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:51,880
Metaphor with the car is amazing because it's not a metaphor.

2409
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:55,240
That's supposed to be a literal story.

2410
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:57,160
It's a story that has never happened to him.

2411
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:58,600
It's never happened to anybody.

2412
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:00,120
What car looks like a spaceship?

2413
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,560
Also, why does he envy this car?

2414
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:06,520
Then say, I would never get one of those cars, but it's a piece of art.

2415
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:07,560
It's a piece of art.

2416
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:08,680
Draws too much attention to you.

2417
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:13,000
I want, look, I want to get that car, but I would never get one of those cars.

2418
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,640
I have one more clip that I don't remember what it is.

2419
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:16,440
He is.

2420
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:20,680
So he's, is he referencing that, uh, Kurt Vonnegut short story?

2421
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:21,960
Which one?

2422
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:23,400
Oh shit.

2423
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:29,400
Do you remember the one where it's the, the world is, uh, changed to be equal.

2424
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:34,040
So there's this dude and he's the name, the short story is named after him.

2425
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:36,920
And so he's this perfect Ubermensch guy.

2426
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:40,600
And because of that, they have to make him equal to everybody else.

2427
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:43,400
So they put these earmuffs on him to make him half deaf.

2428
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:44,600
They put these giant bottle.

2429
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:46,840
That's how he sees himself.

2430
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:47,800
Yeah, absolutely.

2431
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:53,480
He sees himself as somebody who's being, who people are trying to tear down.

2432
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:53,720
Yeah.

2433
01:35:53,720 --> 01:36:01,720
I apologize for not being specific, uh, about communist China, having a digital drop box

2434
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,640
with all the things necessary.

2435
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:06,600
Well, that's the other thing that I think is really fascinating is that he always

2436
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:11,720
complains about how there's a learned helplessness and victim mentality in liberals.

2437
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:12,120
Right.

2438
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:16,120
And then he goes on to say that the globalists are responsible for all his problems.

2439
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:16,520
Right.

2440
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:21,960
So it's like this weird, I don't understand what the line is between like one version

2441
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:23,880
of paranoia and the other.

2442
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:27,320
I'm not entirely sure, but one's about prosperity, I guess.

2443
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:27,720
I don't know.

2444
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:36,600
I think, man, here's, here's the thing that while we're talking, the only thing that

2445
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:43,240
I can conceive of is I want to eventually try and understand how his brain works.

2446
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:44,680
Well, that's why we got to keep doing this show.

2447
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:46,360
We have to keep doing this show.

2448
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:49,720
Here's one more clip for you that I don't remember what it is, but it has to do with

2449
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:50,200
demons.

2450
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:58,280
They're going to start over, it's time to break.

2451
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:00,600
George in Texas, you're on the air.

2452
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:00,840
Go ahead.

2453
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:01,400
Thanks for holding.

2454
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:03,800
Yes, Alex.

2455
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:07,000
I just, uh, this is where they want to be.

2456
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,600
They're going to start world war three.

2457
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:09,880
This has always been the plan.

2458
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:12,440
You know, they always have sure.

2459
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:14,200
Having Hillary be elected would have been great.

2460
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:16,040
You know, they can do whatever they want.

2461
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:16,120
Yeah.

2462
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:17,560
They were still going to start a war when she got in.

2463
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:19,000
They were going to shut the press down when she got in.

2464
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,360
It's in all the WikiLeaks.

2465
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:22,440
They're just going ahead.

2466
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:23,800
Like Trump wasn't even elected.

2467
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:24,600
What does that tell you?

2468
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:27,320
They don't care because they're crazy.

2469
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:29,480
And I think they're possessed personally.

2470
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:30,200
They definitely are.

2471
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:31,000
They're damn demons.

2472
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:32,780
Yep.

2473
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:34,920
They're damn demons.

2474
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:36,680
They're literal demons.

2475
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:37,960
They're possessed.

2476
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:38,680
Yep.

2477
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:42,760
He often makes the claims that the people who are against him are literal demons or

2478
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:44,120
being paid by Soros.

2479
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:46,520
Those are the two groups of people who are against him.

2480
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:49,080
And we can say 100% neither.

2481
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:52,760
Yes, I would agree with neither.

2482
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:53,320
Yeah.

2483
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:54,440
I would say neither.

2484
01:37:54,440 --> 01:38:00,120
Now, but that's a brilliant move there is because you're never pinned down.

2485
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:05,880
Like, yes, there is the narrative of being possessed, but it could also be like, no,

2486
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:08,600
that was a metaphor for George Soros.

2487
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:13,480
But also George Soros could be possessed if that's what you want to believe.

2488
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:17,960
But that's a metaphor for the globalists who are also, you know.

2489
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:19,000
He sells a shirt too.

2490
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,880
That's like a George Soros as a goblin kind of thing.

2491
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:25,800
It's like, I don't know if that's antisemitic, but it doesn't feel good.

2492
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:27,720
It's like, I don't know.

2493
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:28,600
Well, you know what?

2494
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:30,120
That's the next question.

2495
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:30,620
Right.

2496
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:33,960
Is Harry Potter antisemitic?

2497
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:35,000
A hundred percent.

2498
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:35,320
Right?

2499
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:36,520
That's an antisemitic.

2500
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:37,640
Dobby is a Jew.

2501
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:39,160
Oh, no, no.

2502
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:42,920
I was talking about the goblins at the Gringotts Bank.

2503
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:43,480
I gotta be honest.

2504
01:38:43,480 --> 01:38:44,600
That was antisemitic.

2505
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:45,960
I don't know anything about Harry Potter.

2506
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:47,800
I'm telling you, I'm telling you right now.

2507
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:49,400
I saw one of the movies and I remembered Dobby.

2508
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:54,200
I'm telling you right now, Harry Potter, you heard it here first, ladies and gentlemen.

2509
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:57,480
J.K. Rowling is possessed and an antisemite.

2510
01:38:57,480 --> 01:38:58,360
Just kidding, Rowling.

2511
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:01,720
It's time to pray.

2512
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:06,920
Well, anyway, those are the things that I wanted to tell you about InfoWars today.

2513
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:07,560
All right.

2514
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:10,200
Let's close it with a clip.

2515
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:14,520
This makes me laugh so hard.

2516
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:15,240
Oh, I can't wait.

2517
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:16,120
And I hope you enjoy it.

2518
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:19,080
And if you've enjoyed this show, thank you for listening.

2519
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:21,480
Hopefully, we'll do more of these in the near future.

2520
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:23,000
And we'll come up with a better name.

2521
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,840
And tighten it up a little bit.

2522
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:27,800
This over two hours thing is probably not going to work in our favor.

2523
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:28,300
Nope.

2524
01:39:28,840 --> 01:39:30,200
But anyway, here we go.

2525
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:36,040
And so we are in the real world in this epic time and everything you do is having a giant effect.

2526
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:39,000
Pray for this country.

2527
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,280
Pray for awakening.

2528
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:41,240
Pray for providence.

2529
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:46,920
Pray for spiritual defense and support and provision for Trump and for InfoWars and for

2530
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:51,320
Matt Drudge and for people like Stephen Bannon and others that are at the tip of the spear

2531
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:53,080
of this fight because of duty.

2532
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:56,120
But understand, this is real.

2533
01:39:56,120 --> 01:39:57,000
You can see it.

2534
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:57,960
It's not our opinion.

2535
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:00,360
We are the people resisting this.

2536
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:01,640
You are the folks resisting it.

2537
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:03,080
We're all in this together.

2538
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:05,480
And none of us are perfect, but we've got God on our side.

2539
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:10,440
Also, we're running, extending the Christmas special just even more until Wednesday.

2540
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:12,360
And then it's over because people like it so much.

2541
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:18,520
Free shipping store wide, 50 to 30% off everything while supplies last.

2542
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:24,360
The problem is we've sold out of, I don't know, eight different things at InfoWarsLife.com

2543
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:25,320
and for store.com.

2544
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:30,440
So a lot of stuff has sold out.

2545
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:34,920
But we still have brain force now with 20% more in each bottle, 30% off.

2546
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:36,840
You cannot beat that deal and free shipping.

2547
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:40,040
Time for auto-ship and an additional 10% off.

2548
01:40:40,040 --> 01:40:40,840
Wow.

2549
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:43,480
Supermell Vitality and Human Vitality are about to sell out.

2550
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:46,600
We've got 30% off on those.

2551
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:47,960
X2 is about to sell out.

2552
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:51,880
We've got, I mean, it's $20 right now.

2553
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:54,120
That is unprecedented and free shipping.

2554
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:59,800
We have the liver cleanse, liver shield with oxy powder for the gallbladder and liver cleanse.

2555
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:03,160
That's discounted, 30% off when you get them together.

2556
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:09,400
Again, we're talking 4.8 star reviews here by third-party review sites and so much more.

2557
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:12,760
BioPCA for your hair, skin and nails, everything else as well.

2558
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:29,240
Uh, we've got biome defense in the 25 billion.
