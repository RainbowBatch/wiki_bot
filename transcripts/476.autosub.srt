00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:29,344
Italian dressing from Olive Garden

8
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:45,216

9
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,288
There's just something about that

10
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:56,480

Music

15
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,656
I was listening to music

16
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,704
Once more I was listening to the cigarettes

17
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,848
I remember when I was 18

18
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:59,712

19
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:04,832

20
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,136
It's my brakes right because as you know

21
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:13,536
I don't like to deal with my memories too much I like to keep a nice memory

22
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:17,888
My memory

23
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,432

Interesting situation going on here

26
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,856
So I went to project

27
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:41,952
Because I'm constantly

28
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:52,192
I think it might not be working

29
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,384
That word on a tree

30
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:07,040

31
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:13,440

41
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,455

Like what I wrote wrote something

195
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:43,071
Someone

196
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,375
President

197
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,751
Grammar on Project

198
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:57,407
A blue block by Stripes breaking up in

199
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:03,807
That this guy is the best everything that he's ever said even though

200
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:09,951
British man

201
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:17,119
Apparently at this point

202
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,679
Doesn't seem to be pushing

203
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:23,007
Yeah for this person to be credible or correct

204
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:29,407
Totally free uncommon press

205
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:35,807
This is the first episode

206
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:46,047
Have like 400 episodes

207
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,863
Story

208
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,423
Call Randy

209
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,471
Brandy's just fine

210
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,263
Very much for coming on

211
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,223
Wow well I guess

212
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,015
My military back

213
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
Literally

214
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,111
Play born out of a

215
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:10,879
Projects

216
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,159
Was

217
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,951
Drum

218
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,231
The mid-60s

219
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
Tuaca

220
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,535
Augment and work

221
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,071
Create from scratch

222
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,351
Genetically augmented

223
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:25,471
So he was in the military before he was even born

224
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,943
I think this is cuz we're America

225
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:39,295
But when he said can I call you Captain Randy or just random

226
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:45,439
I want to say that was a really deep insult right there

227
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:50,815
Can I call you Captain Randy cuz it's not can I call you, captain

228
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:57,215
It can I call you Captain Randy such as to say that I'm kind of treating you as a as a

229
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:01,311
Can I call you cuz no one else will

230
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:06,431
It's a

231
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:20,256
Two military people realize

232
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,280
Desert iguana

233
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:25,888
Alien technology right

234
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,592
You've got to do it with babies or something

235
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,664
Soldier

236
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,992
Cracking

237
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,016
A number of

238
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,296
Roxanne

239
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,600
Tables

240
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,624
Information for Mexico

241
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,672
Suppress

242
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,952
That was giving us

243
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,976
Jumps ahead of

244
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:51,744
Civilian Tech

245
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,280
Acknowledging civilian research and develop

246
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,048
EXO

247
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,584
The ability for the military to stay

248
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
Start doing genetic

249
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,400
Experiment two-headed what anything in the civilian were

250
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,424
YouTube

251
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,960
Advance

252
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,240
Technology infused

253
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,288
Programs that gave us to LEAP ahead

254
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,824
Alright

255
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,104
Technology p

256
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,384
People wanted to figure out how to use it

257
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,176
So the first thing to do was

258
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,456
Find figure out how to

259
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,992
Who you already got

260
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,088
You realize that it was minimally

261
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,392
That you really just

262
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,672
Do what some of the

263
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
Did you do or working

264
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,536
Coming down work

265
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,304
King in our labs

266
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,584
Ground on Trussville

267
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,400
To advise us now you really want

268
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,680
To do this right you got to start

269
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
From the ground

270
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,728
We got a bill.

271
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,288
Start from the beginning

272
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,312
And don't

273
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,640
So you can hear

274
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,440
Couldn't use it with existing soldiers

275
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:58,048
Sort of genetically alter and create people who could use this text

276
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,072
Or whatever

277
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,544
At least make sense

278
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,128
Your stomach

279
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,688
We had this alien technology so they were like

280
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,736
Let's just use it on the guys we have

281
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,320
That was their first stop

282
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:26,720
Duplicate

283
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,656
Geneva Convention

284
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:37,216
So if we've got this program

285
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,288
These these these

286
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,848
User being created before birth

287
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,896
To be able to use this tack

288
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:49,248
Sure hey you know it raises the question

289
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:53,344
Where did you come up with who

290
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,880
Well none of that is the answer

291
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,416
I come in all days Iowa

292
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,696
One of the first genetic

293
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,000
I created soldiers from

294
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,024
That project I was

295
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,048
Built-in app

296
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,584
3 days from the ground up

297
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,352
Late night

298
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
19 midnight

299
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,168
1869 and I was born in nineteen

300
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,448
70

301
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:18,688
I hear what you say when you talk to me

302
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:22,528
How can we be sure that

303
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:26,880
Show you

304
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,416
2 radio channel

305
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,512
Already out of the gate

306
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:36,864
Mildly

307
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:41,728
Described by surprise

308
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:51,456
Bees bees

309
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:57,600
Are you talking about

310
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,648
2:30 proof

311
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:04,768
Radio

312
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,680
This is what Randy comes up with veggies best

313
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:16,288
Proof that he actually is a super soldier

314
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
Proof that

315
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,872
I have to throw out to people

316
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,640
Is that

317
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,688
I live

318
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,248
Envy most militarized Nation

319
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,016
In the world

320
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,808
We have had no sense

321
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,576
Humor

322
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,624
People who impersonate

323
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,392
Officers

324
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,672
Interesting

325
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,208
Ever not true

326
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:34,976
Impersonating a

327
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:35,744
An officer next

328
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,560
They're absolutely steps

329
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,096
To be taken by the FBI

330
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,632
Marine Corps to discuss with

331
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:48,288
About my fraudulent doing so and how I needed to cease and desist and do that

332
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,568
Randy

333
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,872
The space called they would Closing Time fun

334
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,152
I'm saying is

335
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,688
But if I were doing that fragile

336
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
The process that

337
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,992
They would follow

338
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,064
Decision decision

339
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,344
Show proof

340
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,112
And I would say great

341
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,136
I love hearing into Jago

342
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,160
Officer in my lawyer

343
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,696
Assured me that

344
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,976
Probably never going to hear

345
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,768
Because they never want

346
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,792
Me a hearing

347
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:19,008
I have my first problem

348
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,568
His best evidence

349
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:34,368
You thought you had you thought you could catch let me tell you something

350
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,160
One hand not slapping me

351
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,696
While silence

352
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,720
So

353
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,512
Gibson

354
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,400
Because

355
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:52,544
Do you see saying that like I've talked to my lawyer about what would happen if I was

356
00:26:56,128 --> 00:27:01,760
And why would you ask his lawyer any of these questions

357
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,112
Beatrice

358
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
Like this one

359
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,416
Because you're telling the truth

360
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,744
But if you were telling the truth wouldn't that be a reason to close you down

361
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,024
Call ghost

362
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:14,816

365
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,888
Decide

366
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,192
Person to act

367
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,728
Just a public relations officer

368
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,264
And apparently there was a short

369
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,544
List of which my name was

370
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,824
Put on and then when they

371
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,104
Through that

372
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,128
That list eventually a

373
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,176
My Brigadier General

374
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,200
Me very politely

375
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,480
If I wanted to be the public

376
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,504
Expressing guy

377
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
Not really

378
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,576
But he convinced me

379
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,856
And I said hi

380
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,904
And so yeah

381
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,184
At my commanders have

382
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,744
Absolutely authorized Mutua number of

00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:50,656
Go beyond

387
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:51,936
Giving me

00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:54,400
Is that it is largely might be

402
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:01,824

407
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,880
Serious red flags

408
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,560
Coming to understand

Night sometimes

433
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:20,672
And at the same time he's saying he was created as a superset

434
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:23,232
This is kind of getting

435
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,120
Theological Paris

436
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,912

How involved were they in this they must have been totally involved

439
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:47,808
This is a real sticking point

440
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:56,256
Artificial insemination

441
00:30:56,512 --> 00:31:01,632
Secret

442
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:09,056

447
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:36,960
Wake up

With

449
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,056
You just wait

450
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,592
Disassociate

451
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,384
I'm thinking well that was the strangest

452
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,920
Longest dream ever

453
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,688
Even though

454
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,456
I know you had a

455
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,248
Dream that seemed to last days or we

456
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,016
Weeks at a time

457
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,040
Stream to be buried

458
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,064
Consistent

459
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,832
And not have

460
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:53,856
Weird dreams

461
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,880

463
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,208
Linear timeline to it other than that

464
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,488
You know you wake up

465
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,256
And they're sort of this

466
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,816
Are you talking about

467
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,352
Brainwave app

468
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,912
Conscious brain wave Activity Works when you move from

469
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,960

470
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,240
Delta Theta

471
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:11,776
Asleep

Optimist Club your Alpha

473
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,360
A bridge into your beta state

474
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,384
You often

475
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,176
And disassociate

476
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:18,944
What's happening in

477
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,016
Because primarily what

478
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,296
You're being trained in

479
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,832
Is in a lower

480
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,368
Brainwave Consciousness state

481
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,136
Which is actually

482
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,416
Better for

483
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:29,952
Hi babe estate

484
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,720
Falcor

485
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,512
Sort of

486
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
Consciousness

487
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
Kind of shaking

488
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,072
Why that was

489
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,120
Weird long dream even though

490
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,144
Nothing

491
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,192
You were to sit down

492
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,472
3 man was dead

493
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,240
That agent talked

494
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,520
Would really into

495
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,800
Having a dream

496
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:45,824
Go wild

497
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,848
Is the weirdest experience

498
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,616
I never heard that you do

499
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,408
Don't trust your emails

500
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,432
You just ate

501
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,504
And I learned

502
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,040
A few conversation

503
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,064
My parents like

504
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,832
Right now waking up

505
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,624
Sitting at The Breakfast Table insane

506
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,416
Why I had this weird dream last night

507
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,184
Let me tell you about

508
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,464
And getting those

509
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,488
Disconcerted

510
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,280
Good looks from your parents to know I should

511
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,072
That makes them work

512
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,984
Okay there's a lot going on here sounds like

513
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,264
Super-Soldiers.

514
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:21,664
It's a lot of what I think is true is real bummer sounds like

515
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:29,856
And maybe some kind of an inability to connect

516
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:32,416
Leads to creating

517
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:36,000
Alternative explanations for why they're having

518
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,304
What I

519
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,912
Experience as a child

520
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,704
You know I got an A+

521
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,776
I got an A+ I need to see the counselor

522
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,104
Like that's what I'm here

523
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,688
Concrete

524
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,456
Issues

525
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,480
Like

526
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,760
Question

527
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:58,528
If

528
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,296
Your

529
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,904
F****** Mars super soldier

530
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,928
Face person

531
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:11,328
How's your parents not notice really important

532
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:14,400
So when did the Foster created you to search

533
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:20,032
Intervene and stop getting involved in your life as a kid when did they start training you

534
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,872
Earliest

535
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,152
Memories of training or

536
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,432
Probably really somewhere

537
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,712
3 1/2 in

538
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,272
4 years old

539
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,600
Okay and you will be

540
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,648
Taken away from your parents

541
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
Portraying

542
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,976
And they didn't know anything about

543
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:45,120
Has anybody taking me away from my mom and dad they be hearing from my dad pretty damn quick

544
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,400
Right

545
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,168
Bright

546
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,312
I don't know if it's

547
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,384
They must have been

548
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:01,504
If you were disappearing four. Going to get rain

549
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,552
And you want with the

550
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,576
Presumably

551
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,440
Some of this doesn't I have to say some of this is difficult to take in

552
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,376
Which is that

553
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,912
We're talking about

554
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,192
Programs that are using

555
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,472
Reversed

556
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:22,752
And or handed down

557
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,776
Technology from extra

558
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,568
Variability

559
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,848
To do things like

560
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,128
Hover over your house

561
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:28,896
For the spaceship

562
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,944
You are and

563
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,992
Projector wormhole

564
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,528
Into your bedroom and pick you up

565
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,832
And or take you to a location

566
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,600
For training

567
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,368
And

568
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,392
Used

569
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,672
Time travel

570
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,464

Ono Ono

573
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:06,016
Oh okay this is how this fits into the narrative

574
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:11,648
It's hard because I don't know anything about I might be

575
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:18,048
He's a really funny response

576
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,192
Like I couldn't get over the the like

577
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:31,360
Some of this is really hard to swallow

578
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:39,040
Deadpan face while he isn't even like the hint of a smile

579
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,600
Music

580
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:51,328
Mystery

581
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,704
Unravel

582
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:02,080
Earth-based solution

583
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,248
I want that one thing

584
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,272
It's really important

585
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,040
My mother is

586
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,064
A very

587
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,856
Metaphysically psionic

588
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,648
Sensitive person

589
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,184
She is

590
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,464
As always had in some

591
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,512
And is one of those p

592
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,792
People that I think she was

593
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,584
What's going on

594
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,632
And it was one of the reasons why she was always

595
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:28,192
I had horrible insomnia and was always terrified

596
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,520
Anchor children

597
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,824
New about this on some level

598
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,360
On an intuitive level

599
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,896
Did Anna created a lot of

600
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,432
The panic and anxiety she had her

601
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,712
Run sleep issues and around

602
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,016
Broken into it

603
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,296
There was no

604
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,832
That was happening but

605
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,600
I think she was

606
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,648
Barry panic

607
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:54,560
So I would say there are super soldier

608
00:37:54,816 --> 00:38:00,704
Warriors

609
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,104
Way of being

610
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:13,504
These paranoia

611
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:18,368
Sort of projected onto her child

612
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:24,768
Has this preoccupation way to explain

613
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:31,168
Susan anxiety not

614
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:39,616
Kind of makes sense I'm not saying that is the case I know psychiatrist or psychologist

615
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,040
Any Dream analyst wood

616
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:53,440
Completely disagree with you I feel like I have all the information that I

617
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,232
To say

618
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:59,072
I don't think you were on Mars

619
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,544
Just keep you this with all of his guests as he kind of like snow I don't like it

620
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,360
I feel like he's loading him into the sense of like

621
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:15,456
Accidentally sent her of all the problem

622
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:21,856
And Howard is just going to like allowed to exist in the space

623
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:32,864
Style

624
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,912
What is 2/2

625
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,616
For no reason if you ask

626
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:47,968
Questions and make a responsible choice

627
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:51,552
About what's being said

628
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:54,624
All right this doesn't make sense

629
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:01,024
Where is the bike project

630
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,168
Is in such an unquestioning is questioning its quest to take

631
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:13,568
And that is irresponsible cuz you just you give your audience a full sense of credibility about everything

632
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,760
I see that

633
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:25,856
Very cautiously like I said I haven't listened to any other episodes

634
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,928
You guys look

635
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,280

Gears of War

638
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:46,592
He's approaching this audience to make a decision about

639
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,152
I think that you can tell that some of them

640
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:57,088
You got from you alright texts and tweets not all of you buying into this necessarily Randy you must get a lot of office

641
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,880
Position from people who simply dumb

642
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,648
Believe it

643
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,256

And you are more of a joke than the joke

681
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,943
You understand that

682
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:33,599
How old is another interesting question

683
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,367
Kid

684
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:40,767

685
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:44,863
What how was that experience

686
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:47,167

Against

691
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,383
Unify

692
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:58,431
If I didn't realize why was old being dumb

693
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,991
I would say please don't take me away

694
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,039
Sure

695
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,111
As a kid

696
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,391
You're certainly given

697
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,415
Childlike

698
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,439

699
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,231
For what you're doing and where you're going

700
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:12,255
What trainings for

701
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,023
And so

702
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:13,791
Basically

703
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,071
You know

704
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,607

Don't you and you're like yeah

710
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,335
It's an easy motivation

711
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:46,047
Aliens

712
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:55,775
As a child

713
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,543
Correct

714
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,391
Broad

715
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:16,767
I just

716
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,095
I don't know

717
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:24,191
I can't imagine the government

718
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:25,727
Secrets

719
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:32,127
Super soldier program successfully kidnapped

720
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,175
Extreme

721
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,991
Slightly

722
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,927
0 government watchdog

723
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:45,951
Who are like

724
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:53,119
Hey guys at least cut it off

725
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:59,263
Accuracy

726
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:04,383
Best child kidnapper we have it though

727
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,575
Lazerism

728
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:15,391
Doesn't matter

729
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,975
Say yes

730
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:22,047
Enter this by saying hey little man

731
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:25,119
You want to play with a ray gun like you seen in the movies on the TV

732
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:27,679
But genetically

733
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,471
Engineered and

734
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:31,519
Engineered

735
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,287
Built to fit

736
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,567
That this is a

737
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,359
So it wasn't something

738
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,127
Thing that I would have

739
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,151
Resisted anyway

740
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,175
Because I was Jeanette

741
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:38,943
Ethically engineered

742
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:41,759
So

743
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,879
You said all this

744
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:58,399
We are talking about kidnapping children

745
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,263
That's a good point

746
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:11,455
Remember how we told you

747
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:17,855
You tell the Brigham's and that's what we do

748
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:28,351
But you genetically engineered to say that is a great idea

749
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:34,751
Superpowers

750
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:41,663
Describe two superpowers

751
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:44,735
It's so perfect as to never be provable

752
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:50,111
Capabilities that maybe I and my colleagues season like that have

753
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,183
Be a little smarter

754
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,207
Little faster little stronger

755
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,231
More than everybody else

756
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:58,815
When you say you were little stronger what can you do that we come

757
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,607
It really

758
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,447
My physical strain

759
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,471
Physical fight

760
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,239
And the best way to

761
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,519
Plane that is if

762
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,799
I get jump

763
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:09,823
3 Guys

764
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:10,591
My physical body

765
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,871
He will respond as if I'm

766
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,639
I'm getting jumped

767
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:14,943
20 guys

768
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,223
My body will respond

769
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:17,759
Funny guy so

770
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,319
Output

771
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,855
On the input attack

772
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:22,623
So

773
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,903
The more people who attacked me

774
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,671
The stronger and

775
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,583
Leather

776
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:44,639
Earlier

777
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:47,711
He's in complete control

778
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,247
It is a skill that is completely

779
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:50,527
Controlling in

780
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,807
Completely in my grasp

781
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,087
Has its own safety

782
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,111
Call Austin

783
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,927
You know keep me from you know killing innocent people and Sophie

Sorry to

I like that

790
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:20,223
Very easy

791
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:23,039
It keeps me from hurting anyone

792
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:29,439
Suddenly show

Most highly trained martial arts Professionals in the world

Don't kill them but if you can beat up

00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:48,383
Call come on

799
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:07,071
I mean the smarter perfectly quantify that

800
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:13,471
Race

801
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:19,359
Cursive anymore

802
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:25,759
Versus

803
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:39,583
Spotify

804
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:44,191
Is first

805
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:51,871
Dawn from Spotify

806
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:58,783
Literally on Spotify

807
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,343
Have a freak out about that

808
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:05,439
Superpowers

809
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,487
It turns out you can also run

810
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,511
Really fast

811
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:14,143
Tall buildings in a single bound book

812
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:15,935
But yeah like I

813
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,215
Situation

814
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:17,983
Responsive

815
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:18,751
The faster I need

816
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,543
The faster or run the higher end

817
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,567
Need to jump

818
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,383
The actual limitation

819
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:25,663
As far as like

820
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,455
Inches in feet or classify

821
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,015
Play Space 50

822
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,551
So we're not really sure what

823
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,831
What the top of the scales are some

824
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,623
Because we haven't necessarily seen pops

825
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:36,927
Perfect

826
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,975
Way to test this

827
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,767
We have to create

828
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:47,167
A scenario where there's a park or contact

829
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:52,031
High-level professional parkour version

830
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:56,383
Whoever loses will be executed

831
00:50:56,895 --> 00:51:03,039
Now that you have to make up for it against the law for the government

832
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:09,695
This is an asset

833
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:18,655
No

834
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:23,519
Furthermore what this implies is that the government has done a lot of testing

835
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:29,407
Regularly increasing threats

836
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,175
You find a lion

837
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:36,575
And then tomorrow they like

838
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:50,143
Perceived by the body as an adrenaline response

839
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:56,799
Causing him to respond to

840
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:15,487
We know from listening to Randy on Project

841
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,791
Regressed

842
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,655
Perfect clone

843
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:25,727
The age

844
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:28,287
Consciousness was transferred into

845
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:31,615
Because I formation

846
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:38,527
You spent all those long periods but

847
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:39,551
Because

848
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,343
Variable vaco

849
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:45,695
Back engineered technology presumably that allows them to compress time

850
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,231
You are not

851
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:49,791
Like sixty or seventy years of age and I wish you would have to

852
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:50,815
Wfu cycling

853
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,863
Here's

854
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:53,631
Funny part

855
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:54,655
Right is

856
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,423
Because

857
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,751
Acholic age-reversing

858
00:52:59,263 --> 00:52:59,775
But it's not real

859
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,055
Age reversal

860
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,079
At the end of

861
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,359
Your 20-year tour they take

862
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:04,639
LLC which

863
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,919
Operations Command

864
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:08,479
And they say okay we're going to do you know

865
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,503
Wipe out your memory

866
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:13,087
Secure things that you don't want to remember anyway

867
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,111
And

868
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:14,879
And we're going to

869
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:15,903
Send you back

870
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,183
Can a young do

871
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,207
Musically

872
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:19,231
Hatch you out a new

873
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:19,999
Clone body

874
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,023
That's the same age

875
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,559
You away and they

876
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,095
And I know this is going to sound

877
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:24,863
Sound weird

878
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,631
People again

879
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:26,911
Hide

880
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,703
Advanced alien technology

881
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:29,983
As ensign

882
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,519
To understand

883
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:34,335
That the human soul

884
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,615
Is a quantum

885
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,383
Fluid

886
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:42,015
The body put into another

887
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,575
Handheld Andor

888
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,111
Another vessel

889
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:46,879
Another body

890
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:48,671
Through a mechanism

891
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:49,951
I was not conscious

892
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:52,767
You know now how it works

893
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:53,535
Other than

894
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,071
Are able to remove the soul from

895
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:55,839
That body

896
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:56,863
Put it into this

897
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,911
Younger clone body the same age

898
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:00,959
Cresol

899
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:01,983
Memories

900
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:02,751
And then put

901
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:03,775
To backhand you ascent

902
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:04,799
Wake up

903
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:05,567
You know

904
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,383
You left from a 20-year tour

905
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,943
Juice

906
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,111
Sing on stage

907
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,415
And he just said that and then just

908
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,207
Deposit I would have stood up

909
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:27,583
And slow Clapton

910
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:33,471
If I were the interviewer that exact same situation I would stand up and walk away

911
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:38,847
Deserves

912
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:50,111
1

913
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:59,583
Due south may use it to power spacecraft who knows

914
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,543
Are you not curious

915
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:11,103
You can't tell me anything about the process

916
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:18,015
Say that about it

917
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,487
Do the words

918
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:31,071
Quantum and fluid mean anything when they are putting a

919
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:34,911
Next to each other

920
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:43,359
You might be on the half of the audience

921
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:46,687
Some of them

922
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,455
Love it

923
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,991
And some of them say

924
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:51,807
He was not sure about this

925
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:54,111
I was polite

926
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:59,999
Into this hour and you missed the first half hour if you see what I'm saying

927
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:03,327
Captain Randy Koehler is a man it was bread

928
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,607
Commissions tomorrow

929
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:09,215
Amazing members the constant

930
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:13,311
3

931
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,103
Trash garbage

932
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:18,175
Responsible

933
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:24,575
Clearly a bunch of people saying he's full of s***

934
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:30,975
Question

935
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:32,511
Exact same stories

936
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:39,167
Very important points on people will get on my bike if I didn't put this point to you

937
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:41,983
People on board then which she will have

938
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:45,567
We're all of those people and why are they speaking to

939
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:47,359
Well some of the

940
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,175
Do that

941
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,455
How sure some of

942
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,039
Their memories

943
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:58,111
Protocol either badly

944
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:58,879
Clearwell

945
00:56:59,135 --> 00:56:59,903
And so sometimes there

946
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,671
Brains in Dubai

947
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,695
More Swiss cheese

948
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:02,463
Oatmeal

949
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,743
And it's hard

950
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:04,511
Werdum

951
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,303
Bring memories to

952
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,327
Cohesive state

953
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,607
I talk to people all the time

954
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,399
Gordon the process of

955
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,679
Unfold

956
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,727
Memory experiences

957
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:16,287
Enter constantly asking me for advice on

958
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,823
How to remember things

959
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,639
Get their Memories Back In how to

960
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,663
You know deal with

961
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:23,455
Tom and so forth until

962
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:25,247
I will just be honest and

963
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:26,783
Most of them

964
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,599
Have no desire

965
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:30,879
Trivia

966
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,415
McPherson they don't

Targeted they do not

968
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,463
I want to be

976
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,575
That if we take

977
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:06,719
There's a government program

978
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:09,791
Make super soldiers current

979
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:16,191
Anyone can sign

980
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:22,591
For twenty years or whatever takes the soul juice

981
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:35,391
Remember

982
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:40,511
For them

983
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:54,079
Because he hired you as RPI

984
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,639
Gave us PRL

985
00:58:56,895 --> 00:59:03,039
Scrambling people's brains baby on purpose

986
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:05,855
Well

987
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:11,999
Scrambled brains

988
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:18,655
You are describing something really really horrifying

989
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,191
What why

990
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:29,663
Weird

991
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:30,687
Explanation for that

992
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,711
Yeah they're too

993
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,479
People actually

994
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,247
Well let me let me

995
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,271
Put it in

996
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:35,807
Answer that in the air

997
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:36,575
Anna Moore

998
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,343
Broadway

999
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,367
Be more specific

1000
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,391
To get where you're going out with that

1001
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:41,439
Have you ever seen me with a mustache

1002
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:42,975
Naval space command

1003
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:44,767
Once

1004
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,047
For the planet

1005
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,327
Divided into

1006
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,863
Two fleets in the same

1007
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,911
That here in America we have opposite

1008
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:52,959
Separate

1009
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:53,727
In our ships

1010
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:54,751
Vanguard fortitude if

1011
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,031
Coastal ports

1012
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:58,335
Until we got up space and down space

1013
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,383
Policing

1014
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,151
The solar

1015
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,175
Easier to started

1016
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:03,711
Divided in imaginary line

1017
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:04,735
Down the middle of it and have

1018
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,783
Of course it is on the one side

1019
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:08,063
Starfleet on the other side

1020
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:11,647
Solar Warden

1021
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,671
And radio

1022
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,439
Gardy

1023
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:14,975
Now each Fleet

1024
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:16,767
Decided

1025
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:17,791
I need to have a stroke

1026
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,863
And that they would pick us up

1027
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:28,799
Guardian Brothers

1028
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:30,591
Spokesperson for solar Warden is a gentleman

1029
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,223
He is

1030
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:43,903
The both American guys space

1031
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:53,119
Need smokes

1032
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:05,151
Is good a better spokesman lately

1033
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:16,415
What's interesting to me is bit like this look at this from an Institutional perspective

1034
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:18,463
Solar Warden

1035
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:25,887
Okay this guide

1036
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,935
Or west

1037
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:36,127
So your garden does things differently from solar

1038
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:36,895
Wow

1039
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:47,647
Like what is achieved

1040
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,183
Questions

1041
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:55,583
Sure there is nothing to answer questions there's a recorded story

1042
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:06,847
So this is this is

1043
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:13,247
If people are Fielding questions in order to make the company

1044
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:25,279
Spokesman in Blackson

1045
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:37,567
If this is some like crazy elaborate secret program

1046
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:50,367
Bears

1047
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:57,535
They want you to think they're so stupid

1048
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:00,351
Finally, Brillion

1049
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:12,383
Kramer

1050
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:15,711
How does this work

1051
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,759
Policing the solar system

1052
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:20,319
Who is policing the solar system

1053
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:22,623
Well

1054
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:23,391
Earth Defense

1055
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,415
Forest Naval space

1056
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:26,207
Command in this other sort of

1057
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,231
Loose

1058
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:28,255
International Group

1059
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:30,815
Military person

1060
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,119
Chart of conglomerate

1061
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,399
Either to make up the fleet

1062
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,727
Countries have officers

1063
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:38,751
Pilots and so forth

1064
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,543
Contribute to the larger

1065
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,359
People are distributed

1066
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,383
Throughout the fleet

1067
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,663
Various

1068
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:48,223
Missions a

1069
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,367
If you want to get real

1070
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:55,391
Mummy get on nerdy

1071
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,159
Be about it starts

1072
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,439
The federation's mission

1073
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,719
Was very diplomatic

1074
01:03:59,231 --> 01:03:59,999
And peaceful

1075
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:01,535
Was non-military

1076
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,583
We definitely have a military Mission Beach

1077
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,887
Because we consider the military

1078
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,167
Protection of the solar system

1079
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:07,935
Come to be

1080
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:10,239
Absolutely necessary given the Tangie

1081
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,031
Do we have to deal with what you again

1082
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,055
So horrible

1083
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,847
Deal with them but there is a list

1084
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:15,615
Intangible

1085
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:23,039
And yet

1086
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:26,111
Brain fried after work

1087
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:29,183
Well I don't support

1088
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:40,191
Listen as your PR guy I want to just let everybody know

1089
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:45,567
This would be way better if it was Star Trek

1090
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:51,967
In actuality this is the worst

1091
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:57,599
Star Trek

1092
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,607
Who is a scientist

1093
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,911
And is a regular contributor to the show says

1094
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:16,543
Prolonged exposure to 17 years of whatever of Martian gravity would cause massive bone

1095
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,567
Deterioration

1096
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:18,847
How did you avoid that

1097
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,383
Well

1098
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:26,015
Was used on a

1099
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:26,783
All the time

1100
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:27,551
Because

1101
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:28,575
We were in the field

1102
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,599
Engagement

1103
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:30,623
Combat

1104
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:31,391
And I've had my

1105
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,159
Arms in my leg

1106
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:33,439
Blown off so many times

1107
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,207
I can't even count

1108
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,999
And

1109
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,047
Holographic

1110
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:38,815
Regenerating

1111
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,119
Knology

1112
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:41,887
Projected Hollow

1113
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,167
Cellular level

1114
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,191
2

1115
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:45,727
Convince your body

1116
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:46,751
We grow

1117
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:47,775
And damn

1118
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:49,055
And ripped off

1119
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:59,807
Traffic degenerative it doesn't sound like he believes him

1120
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:03,391
Sounds incredibly polite

1121
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:25,407
If he's had his arms and legs off

1122
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:27,711
Lakes

1123
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,783
Does he lose any Soul juice

1124
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,831
Soldiers in the army

1125
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:38,207
There is even a little bit of soldiers

1126
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:43,583
Are you your arm is the philosophical question

1127
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:50,495
If you replace every part of your body are your clone with your soldiers

1128
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:55,103
I'm sorry

1129
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:58,687
Hologram

1130
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:00,991
It has a resolution at the cellular level

1131
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,015
Projective

1132
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:03,039
Perfect Image

1133
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,063
Your body

1134
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:05,343
Bad

1135
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,367
Restores damaged

1136
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,135
Tissue and

1137
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,159
Endure at the end of

1138
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,695
Of a severed limb

1139
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:11,743
Will fool

1140
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:12,767
Bat cellular tissue

1141
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:13,535
Keep going

1142
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:14,303
Cuz the only thing

1143
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,583
Doctor tissue from growing when

1144
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,607
Reborn off of limousine

1145
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,631
It reaches out there's

1146
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:18,655
How to keep going to

1147
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:19,679
Buttafuco

1148
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,447
Convince it

1149
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,215
By having a holler

1150
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:22,495
Cellular level

1151
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,263
But it goes all I can

1152
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,031
Just keep going

1153
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:24,799
You essentially

1154
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:26,847
Full your body that I can just keep growing and you

1155
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:27,871
You can regrow an entire limb

1156
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,943
The template of you

1157
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,479
Somewhere

1158
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,271
So you said you're

1159
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:35,295
Genetics

1160
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,319
Basically it's just

1161
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,343
DNA map

1162
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:38,623
Projectile

1163
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:53,471
I have nothing further to say than that

1164
01:07:56,543 --> 01:08:02,431
Biology classes in college

1165
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:22,143
Maybe

1166
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:22,911
Baby works

1167
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:23,935
Anyway

1168
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,519
That I think is very important

1169
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:31,615

Children but they don't even

1237
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:09,727
Slave investigator that's what he said

1238
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:10,495
Quit

1239
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:15,359
You didn't say that for sure

1240
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:23,295
Situation

1241
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:26,623
Where is a soldier

1242
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:30,207
The payment

1243
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:36,351
Payment for his shity life

1244
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:43,007
He has a job in an office

1245
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:49,407
Really great Trucking

1246
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:51,711
Really make it look beautiful

1247
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:59,903
I know it's not cold out the stock quote

1248
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:02,719
That is actually

1249
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,487
More complicated

1250
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:05,791
Been activated

1251
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:06,559
Independence

1252
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:07,839
Closet

1253
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:08,863
I actually have a

1254
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:11,167
Greater legal authority to do the things that I need

1255
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:12,191
I need to do as an independent

1256
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,215
Commander not

1257
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:15,007
Need a paycheck then I would get in a page

1258
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,287
Which would actually the limit

1259
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:19,871
Legal discussion of

1260
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:21,407
It emits a very

1261
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:22,431
Specific

1262
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:23,711
Legal parameters

1263
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,735
On being independent

1264
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:25,759
Being

1265
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:26,783
Give you the pain.

1266
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:28,575
Do you want them

1267
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:30,111
Ask the question I just asked

1268
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,647
Ask you about the how do you pay for

1269
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:33,695
I am not a ton

1270
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,463
I mean everyone

1271
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:39,071
He doesn't seem to be getting gas be regular question very often

1272
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:45,471
I guess what he's trying to hearken to

1273
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:47,263
Farm

1274
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:53,663
Like outside

1275
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:03,903
An organization that has no problem genetically creating children

1276
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:07,487
Secretly implanting them into host

1277
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:11,071
Then stealing them when they are for

1278
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:14,911
I don't understand why there are real hung up on the payment part

1279
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:27,711
Play variety

1280
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:31,295
Any radio station that explanation for why you shouldn't be

1281
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,087
Because they're all going to be using

1282
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,863
Silver Lords would love

1283
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:47,423
To treat me like that

1284
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:54,079
You're doing PR work

1285
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:59,455
You're a detective for paranormal s*** I'm a good one

1286
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:01,759
Do you have a contract questions

1287
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:04,319
You can read like a piece of paper

1288
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:06,111
Release

1289
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:06,879
Show yummy

1290
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:09,951
Somewhere in a

1291
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:10,719
Fault

1292
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,743
My records

1293
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:13,535
Exist and then there is a

1294
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:16,607
Going through a process to try and

1295
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:17,887
But I don't expect

1296
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:20,703
That happened soon either

1297
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:28,127
I'm trying to get my legal documents

1298
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:34,527
Cinebox

1299
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:46,303
To talk about

1300
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:49,119
What's it like to be on the surface of Mars

1301
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,959
Well the gravity is

1302
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,239
Less than half

1303
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:55,263
It's a

1304
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:56,287
About 20

1305
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,055
4

1306
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:58,079
So

1307
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,103
You know it

1308
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:00,127
It's much lighter

1309
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:02,175
That's for sure

1310
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,199
Presumably

1311
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,527
I mean

1312
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,807
Where

1313
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:08,831
Therein

1314
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:09,599
A

1315
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:11,903
A notch

1316
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,183
Power

1317
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,207
Body armor

1318
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,743
Environment suit so

1319
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:16,767
Not only

1320
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:19,071
Do you have the ability to sort of jump

1321
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:20,863
Empire and throw things further

1322
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:21,887
You're in a power

1323
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:22,911
Body armor

1324
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:23,935
So you can even

1325
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:24,959
Jump higher in

1326
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:26,239
Farther and throw things

1327
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,519
So it's a little

1328
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:29,055
A little crazy

1329
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:40,575
Also throwing things

1330
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:46,207
I think I think this is indicative of

1331
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:50,303
Everyone who's in the space weirdo like interviewing

1332
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:51,583
Community

1333
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:54,399
Whether consciously or instinctively

1334
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:56,447
Knows what questions not to ask

1335
01:16:57,215 --> 01:17:02,591
Because he's really thrown off by a lot of these very very simple question

1336
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:04,127
You can hear him when he's like

1337
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:21,023
If I had been on Mars USB what's it like on Mars such an open question

1338
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:25,887
Gravity

1339
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:28,191

Satisfy

1342
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:58,143
Undoubtedly

1343
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:00,447
My favorite question power Dax

1344
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:01,983
While I was on the Nautilus I was

1345
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,007
Very very very

1346
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,031
Kerry Ford

1347

01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:07,615

1355

1358
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:20,415
Really fascinating

1359
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:21,183

1360
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:22,975
Mostly diplomatic arrangement

1361
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:23,999
Contract negotiation

1362
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:26,303
Treaty negotiated

1363
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:28,095
And on a number of occasions

1364
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:29,119
I was

1365
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,399
Tagalog

1366
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,959
As one of the only officers fight off

1367
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:34,495
A hand-to-hand

1368
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:36,031
Combat experience I was a jest

1369
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:37,567
Even though there was never a Justin

1370
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:40,383
But they wanted one guy

1371
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:41,663
Stab somebody that way

1372
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,479
So I got the

1373
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:47,551
Many different tables

1374
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,575
Across from many different

1375
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:49,599
Species Wild

1376
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:51,135
Senior officers were having

1377
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:52,159
Many different

1378
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:52,927
Discussions

1379
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:54,463
Initial negotiations

1380
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:55,487
Contract negotiator

1381
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:56,767
Appreciation

1382
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:57,791
First Contact meeting

1383
01:18:58,303 --> 01:18:59,071
It was one of the most

1384
01:18:59,327 --> 01:18:59,839
Amazing

1385
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:01,375
And isn't that

1386
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,655
Who your favorites

1387
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:04,959
Yeah that's a great question

1388
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:12,639
I haven't listened to enough episodes

1389
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:19,295
You're not taking this very seriously anymore

1390
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:29,279
Yeah I went to I went to this Intergalactic Space Station

1391
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:35,679
Seriously

1392
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:42,079
Really worried about contract lawyer

1393
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:48,479
Is there must be must be

1394
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:56,415
Universal government

1395
01:19:56,671 --> 01:20:00,511
Correct must already be

1396
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:09,471
Okay

1397
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:10,239
Contract

1398
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,519
Do we get blown up

1399
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:17,920
I mean

1400
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:18,944
Overseas contract

1401
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:33,280
We have a question

1402
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,032
He doesn't realize that's an actual question

1403
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:46,080
But it is

1404
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,360
Your favorite

1405
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:56,320
You know who are the most interesting

1406
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:58,880
Would you like

1407
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:02,720
As a person

1408
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:04,256
Who has always

1409
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:05,536
Been very sore

1410
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:06,816
Like science motivate

1411
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:07,584
I mean I wasn't

1412
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,352
Nerdy science

1413
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,632
You know from the ghetto

1414
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:10,400
Do info

1415
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:11,936
I was

1416
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:13,472
Always fascinated in

1417
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:15,264
Interested no matter what no matter what

1418
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,312
What they look like no matter where they were from no matter

1419
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:21,664
What their behavior was I was always fascinated and interested to understand

1420
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:23,456
What no

1421
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:24,224
World

1422
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:24,992
It was like

1423
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:43,168
There's another issue that comes up here and I think this is another really important point that

1424
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:47,520
Call Lisa decent interviewer a task that never comes up

1425
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:51,872
In other places

1426
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:53,408
You're doing all this s*** on Mars

1427
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:54,688
We just had a

1428
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:55,456
Virgos are

1429
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:59,552
Pictures of Mars

1430
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:00,576
That's problem

1431
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:04,160
Pictures back from Mars from NASA

1432
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:09,280
Federal orange-tinted and it looks like Rebel up there

1433

Play Trouble

1435
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:12,608
Mostly

1436
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,144
Nothing

1437
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:14,912
In particular

1438
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:17,984
Really great picture that

1439
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,264
It came off the JPL

1440
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:20,544
Rodent

1441
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,568
Tucked between

1442
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:24,896
2 Rockwell

1443
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:30,016
Supposedly

1444
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:32,576
The rodent on the

1445
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:33,344
Ground I mean it look

1446
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:34,368
A giant rat

1447
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:35,136
Squirrel their necks

1448
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:36,160
Store Rocketman

1449
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:37,440
Wayless

1450
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:38,464
Buzzing Wireless question

1451
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:39,488
Alright

1452
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:42,560
Yeah alright there was okay

1453
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:46,400
Then why don't you ever talk about how big the road

1454
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:48,960
Narrative

1455
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:53,056
Chile

1456
01:22:57,664 --> 01:23:02,272
Don't worry about all the technology that I said was there

1457
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:04,576
That's true very excited

1458
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:06,368
So

1459
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:13,024
Captain Randy Cramer I have a million more questions are no time to ask you thank you very much and please text me

1460
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:25,568
I think this is real

1461
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,616
As we come to the end

1462
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:34,784
Don't think this is a good option for Wacky Wednesday at the future

1463
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:43,232
He does

1464
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:46,048
Talk to

1465
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:50,144
Right

1466
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:56,544
He's making fun of

1467
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,824
Me too

1468
01:23:58,336 --> 01:24:02,176
I don't think this is necessarily a good option for us

1469
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:06,528
He asked

1470
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,856
This guy

1471
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,720
The audience can make up their mind

1472
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:21,120
That is all I ask

1473
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:25,728
That's how you like this response

1474
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:30,592
If someone's being too offensive you probably at the interview

1475
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:33,920
Just like you can talk to people

1476
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:42,624
Irresponsible

1477
01:24:58,752 --> 01:24:59,776
It was polite

1478
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:06,176
And that you're kidding it does seem like his questions become less serious because I think

1479
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:11,296
I don't want to be

1480
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:15,904
That's not the brand

1481
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:22,304
Even greater question just because if you

1482
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:26,656
Taking that into just terrestrial at can you imagine a journalist

1483
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:30,752
Talking to somebody at a diplomat that f****** you and being like

1484
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:32,288

You like that you like Germany would who's your favorite just give me a just give me some of your face

1486
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:46,368
Cuz he doesn't get that no

1487
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:57,120
I think it's fun to listen to

1488
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:00,960
We will have to probably keep looking

1489
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:02,496
For a new

1490
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:05,056

1491
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:10,176

1498
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,048

01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,592
I feel like that's question for you

1509
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:44,736
It's more of your vein

1510
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,528
Portrait

1511
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:51,136
I just think the representation of a face is so

1512
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:54,208
Iffy unless the face itself is December

1513
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:58,048
But I mean even then

1514
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:04,704
Spaces are tough to tattoo

1515
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,544

01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:51,968
Whatever you

1556
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,320
Y'all have a good one

1557
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:57,856
Stay safe

1558
01:28:58,368 --> 01:29:04,512
Much

1559
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:07,072
Alexandra Bronson

1560
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:10,400
Vici

1561
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:12,960
That would be redundant to the Wacky Wednesday

1562
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:17,312
Do like the suggestion on the last and thank you for

1563
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,104
Damn Jordan

1564
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:20,640
Coalinga California

1565
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:26,272
Jordan keeps saying he has an Andrew Jack

1566
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,040
Drew

1567
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:29,856
I was just wondering

1568
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:33,184
Super curious now to know what it is

1569
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:35,488
I'm sure it was a few other people who are equally

1570
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:40,096
Chicago

1571
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:43,168
You know I always I'm not sure if Jordan will be performing at night

1572
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:45,472
To Wong

1573
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:46,496
Or if I

1574
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:47,776
Jordan is not

1575
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:49,312
Opposed to it

1576
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:50,336
Could we hear that pic

1577
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:57,504
You do the BET

1578
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:06,976
Stand up

1579
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:08,768
Pretty sure it's on one of them

1580
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:12,608
No I won't do that

1581
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:16,192
Indiana Jordans

1582
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:17,472
I'm really glad that you

1583
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,800
Because I didn't

1584
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:21,824
Sweet as hell

1585
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:29,760
Like

1586
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:31,296
A water

1587
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,064
4

1588
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,840
Fixated on it

1589
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:48,960
Sign up for him

1590
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:55,616
Globalist

1591
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:57,664
All the time

1592
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:05,600
I'm convinced

1593
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:16,352
First of all

1594
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:17,632
Exactly

1595
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:28,384
Scatological returned to repeatedly

1596
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:34,784
Yeah it's hard to say

1597
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:40,416
Form of like

1598
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:41,952
Female politicians

1599
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:46,304
Correct

1600
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:51,680
A lot

1601
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:56,544
Listen to

1602
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:59,104
Frequent personal brings up people

1603
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:04,224
There's a family show

1604
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:06,528
Some sort of dominance thing

1605
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,064
So

1606
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,088
I don't know

1607
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:15,488
Escalated to actual water sports

1608
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:17,024
Going on there I Can Only Imagine

1609
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:18,304
I don't know

1610
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,072
Betty White

1611
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:21,888
Long time

1612
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:27,008
I'm really only doing this

1613
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:28,544
My friend

1614
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:31,616
And I don't like you guys appreciate

1615
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,408
Set alarm

1616
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:36,224
How many podcast now

1617
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:39,040
Great work

1618
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:45,440
Encourage

1619
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:51,840
We don't negotiate with terrorists

1620
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:57,728
Frustrated by a message

1621
01:32:57,984 --> 01:32:58,752
Hey Danny Jordan

1622
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:01,056
I was wondering

1623
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:02,848
He's with a plan

1624
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:06,432
If I've ever heard of the game stardew Valley

1625
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:07,968
If not it isn't

1626
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:11,808
Compusport

1627
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:23,584
First games

1628
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:40,736
Posting screenshot of the game because I named all my animals

1629
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:45,088
There's a screenshot

1630
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:55,584
It is very relaxing

1631
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:57,632
It's just interesting enough

1632
01:33:57,888 --> 01:34:00,448
Cuz there isn't a good story

1633
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:02,240
So

1634
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:05,312
You should give her a shot

1635
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:08,896
Consider consider

1636
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:09,664
Coordinate

1637
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:20,416
Chicago

1638
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:24,000
Lee

1639
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:30,144
Go

1640
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:33,984
You have

1641
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:36,544
Narrative

1642
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:43,968
That didn't happen

1643
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:51,136
Run the show

1644
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:54,720
I'm going to

1645
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:57,536
Honor your request for an apology

1646
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:59,072
I'm sorry about that

1647
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:05,472
Situation where Alex

1648
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:08,032
Very consistent and very repetitively

1649
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:12,640
You're being very blunt and direct

1650
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:19,296
As the person listening to

1651
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:20,576
Recreate that

1652
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:22,368
On the show

1653
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:35,936
For sure I appreciate call out on this

1654
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:37,216
Except that criticism

1655
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:42,336
Ourself to buy into that a little more than we should do

1656
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:46,176
But there is also a decent chance that he wasn't terrible Financial Straits

1657
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:48,480
Something

1658
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:49,504
To fix that

1659
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:53,856
Assistant about

1660
01:35:54,112 --> 01:36:00,256
Predictions are almost always predicts

1661
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:01,024
Something

1662
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:09,216
Mnnr faces I don't know how much

1663
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:15,616
I certainly wasn't guaranteeing this

1664
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:16,896
That possibility

1665
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:20,224
Like

1666
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:28,160
Like look like behind the scenes

1667
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:32,768
Prediction would have come true situation

1668
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:33,792
Granted

1669
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:35,072
Did not end up

1670
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:44,288
They ended up costing him like four quarters of a million dollars

1671
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:48,384
Happening

1672
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:50,944
Kind of around the same time and

1673
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:51,712
You know

1674
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:54,016
I think that I've learned

1675
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:02,720
And do a better job

1676
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:09,120
Like not letting myself get caught up in what if this happen

1677
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:11,424
This isn't to say that like I probably did

1678
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:17,824
Get a little bit more into like

1679
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:20,128
But at the same time

1680
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,480
Recognizing that excitement

1681
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:35,488
Hangouts is bankruptcy

1682
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:38,048
Appreciate appreciate that

1683
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:38,816
We are called out

1684
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:55,968
Find a local area and the best I can

01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:08,000

1686
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:09,024
Same color

1687
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:10,816
I love your work
