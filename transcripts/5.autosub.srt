And I sit down and have a little chat about what I've learned with my friend

5
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,528

00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,064

9
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:30,208
Over a glass of wine

10
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,744

Insane book club

00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:25,920

00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,368
We all expected Alex will be back in studio

00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:39,488
He was not you still on his work

00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,656
I'm working on the road

54
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
Work case

55
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:52,288
Studio

56
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,568
Cousins

57
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,128

58
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,432
So David nights like hey guess what Alex

59
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,712
Who's going to be in later

60
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:04,320
With some breaking news of lethal consequences

61
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,088
Dammit

62
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,928
I love that show

63
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:13,280
I am a second put Alex's back

64
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,096
He hosted the last hour of the show

65
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:20,192
Well Rodger Stone came in and did a bit of it was talk about the second pick

66
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,264
But then Wednesday I'm like f****** Alex's back baby

67
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,288
I turn it on

68
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,824
It's night again

69
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,872
I guess what you like hey it's Thursday

70
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,064
Ethan

71
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,344
Literally

72
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,928
All right but still not enough to make David

73
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,976
Interesting I'm not listening.

74
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,816
Play turn it off on Wednesday

75
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,376
Next time travel boring

76
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,912
That is a good point

77
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,472
So Wednesday I checked out I didn't listen to

78
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:58,336
You can't pay me enough to listen to two hours of David Knight and his smug bulshit

79
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,872
I just can't do it

80
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,432
That is

81
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,736
Send an email

82
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,016

With your offer to pay for

85
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,928
Enough money to do

86
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,768
Donate to my patreon

87
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,655
Freezing point if you want to donate to make me listen to David Knight

88
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,727
Lizabeth.

89
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,751
It's basically torture

90
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:31,103
If you are you like don't know I'll listen to it and I'll do on solo

91
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,151
With just talking about David Knight

92
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,247
That would be your drunken Alex Jones

93
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,271
From the road Motor Inn

94
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,063

95
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
Thursday

96
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,671
When recording

97
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,951
Alex Jones

98
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:49,023
Broadcasting live from

99
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,839
In anticipation of the inauguration

100
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,887
When you're listening to this on Friday

101
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,447
They're starting a 14-hour live broadcast

102
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,495

105
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
Back tattoos

106
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,199
Excellent Tuesday so Tuesday

107
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:07,967
Happened

108
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
Unfortunately

109
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,807
And what ended up happening was most

110
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,927
Camping

111
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
Some of these

112
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,231
He's been doing this

113
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,047
Just getting on his phone and recording

114
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:26,399
Special Report I have some special reports

115
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,215
Air before Alex makes it to the studio

116
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,287

117
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
See how many time

00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,871
I'm keep try to record it and I made it

119
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:41,247
Can I make a prediction

120
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
Note 8

121
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,415
As you can hear I think you can hear from these clips

122
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,487
He's recording these on a plane

123
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,095
I think I cut it out but it won't point he's in the middle of a sentence like

124
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,887
How you doing man

125
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
Goddamn

126
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,799
In Trump's America

127
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,567
The babies won't be

128
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,359
Indeed

129
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,967
Studio

130
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,015
I don't have clips of this cuz I don't give a fuk

131
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,319
His big news

132
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:21,183
Was it Rodger Stone has been poisoned with polonium

133
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:29,887
Rodger Stone be consummate Trump Insider he works for a number to Missouri

134
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:33,727
Believe you worked like a Nixon Administration

135
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:40,383
Yeah he's been hosting the Alex Jones Show June 4th hour

136
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,783
Almost entirely the time that he claimed he was deadly sick pictures

137
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,575
Poisonous polonium I have not

138
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,111
Peony and Radioactive

139
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,903
Massively

140
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,183
You pick it up at

141
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,975
You can't get out of bed

142
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,279
That's working

143
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,559
Supposed to

144
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:10,079
Am I sick false flag

145
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,639
He wants to make Russia seem okay

146
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,431
I guess haha

147
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,967
If you just make sure it up you can

148
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,271
That's such a great move

149
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,319
Yeah

150
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,647
Outfit different wait no we have all this

151
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,207
No you don't fake nose ring

152
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,535
If you

153
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,863
Any doctor would be able to do

154
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,143
Test blood test

155
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,215
The half-life is not such that it would be out of your blood

156
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,239
Be traceable

157
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,311
Is about the size of a grain of salt

158
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,895
I did some research on this

159
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,943
How long before it kills you

160
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,735
It is kind of a gradual thing

161
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,015
Okay Goodberry's

162
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
Possible

163
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,439
Rodger Stone

164
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:06,143
It's entirely possible before have you ever seen him and radiation

165
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
Sabra

166
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,983
I think you nailed this one

167
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:15,103
So here's the best thing about lying about doctors

168
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,151
They can't

169
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,175
Say that you're lying

170
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,711
Cuz there's laws

171
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,991
About confidentiality

172
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,295
Yes if you lie

173
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,599
And say hey my doctors think it's at

174
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:30,207
They can't come out and say we never said that they can

175
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,279
It's perfect

176
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
You don't even have to

177
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:38,655
What about now probably have a stomach bug

178
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,215
Is dr. Wallach

179
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,519
Veterinary

180
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,335
As well I think there was a class at Mizzou about

181
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,431
Boner pills

182
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
Surprise

183
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,503
Cure radiation

184
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,575
Dogs Red Rock

185
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,903
F*** the radiation rated

186
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,183
I can't

187
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,951
Stand

188
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:06,047
Talking about that stuff so I don't

189
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,655
Valic that I think are worth covering

190
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,471
This is about this is

191
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,799
This is actually

192
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:26,527
For the deplorable with you're going to be speaking it

193
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:39,327
Will be the end of the world

194
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,351
No big deal

195
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:45,727
Because the cops aren't bad but the political

196
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:52,895
Nothing more

197
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,735
Call Jerry

198
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
Calling for gas

199
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,367
Yeah exactly

200
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:09,279
Project Veritas

201
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,351
They had one of their guys on in on the inside

202
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,983
Okay so they talked about

203
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,287
James O'Keefe

204
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,079
On from Project Veritas

205
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,615
Real quick

206
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,943
When he says they were plotting to guess us

207
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,759
Does he mean

208
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,039
People

209
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,879
People write so their story and these videos all going to be

210
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,903
Easily gases

211
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,671
Google place

212
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,231
The outdoor inauguration

213
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
Okay

214
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,351
Powerball is what they're talking about

215
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
Blossom

216
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,655
That's a solid

217
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,823
I like the repurposing negative things

218
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,663
As positively

219
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
Yeah

220
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,135
A video

221
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,927
Where they purported

222
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,695
Project

223
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,303
You that is

224
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,863
Cosplaying Lord of the Rings

225
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,887
While they're doing that

226
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,447
If you want me to call no

227
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727
What they have done

228
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:25,567
Right I mean they did that bogus video about Acorn

229
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:30,687
Ended up having to issue a public apology and pay $100,000

230
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,967
And of course.

231
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
Because

232
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,319
He was shown to have manipulated videos to show people saying things they didn't

233
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:40,671
He reported to have worn a pimp costume into the acorn

234
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,951
Play

235
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
That would be

236
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:50,143
F****** Grace Slick couldn't commit

237
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,447
Okay

238
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,055
Is the selling fee.

239
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,847
Someone else

240
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,687
Really did the same thing

241
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
Yeah

242
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,247
Because they don't they're not journalists

243
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,319
Will ya

244
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Also

245
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
In August

246
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,439
2010 James

247
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:17,279
Keep playing to staged encounter with CNN correspondent Abby Boudreau

248
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,583
Who is doing a documentary on the young conservatives

249
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,399
He set up an appointment at his office in Maryland

250
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,679
Video shoot

251
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,215
Easy Santa

252
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
Which is a crazy name

253
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,567
I could have swore that what you meant

254
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,335
Was like

255
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,151
Is James O'Keefe

256
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:42,367
The evidence isn't in yet they weren't in the same room if he has a hastily edited video

257
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,135
Is there an a

258
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,511
Executive director of project veritas

259
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,071
Warren Boudreaux that O'Keefe was planning to

260
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,351
Bunker on the boat

261
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,631
By trying to seduce her

262
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,423
Wychwood filmon hidden cameras

263
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,215
Buddha Board the boat

264
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,751
Soon left the area

265
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:03,615
CNN later published a 13-page plan written by O'Keefe Mentor Ben Wetmore

266
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,639
Hit List prop

267
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
Apps for the boats

268
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,711
Including pornography sexual AIDS

269
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:12,575
Condoms a blindfold and fuzzy handcuffs maybe the locker Apple

270
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:19,999
When questioned by CNN O'Keefe denied that he was going to follow the Wetmore plan has he found parts of it inappropriate

271
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,047
Boudreaux,

272
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,351
Heart

273
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
Pageland

274
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,423
Wetmore

275
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:34,847
So everyone's name is ridiculous, that does not appear to be true according to the series

276
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:38,431
Email to be obtained from Izzy Santa who says the emails revealed

277
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,455
James is true intent

278
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,807
Following the Boudreaux incident project Veritas pay 250 Santa Fe

279
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,575
Figure settlement

280
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,111
Which included a non-disclosure

281
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,415
So

282
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,463
You know we can we can

283
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:54,815
Baby is he was telling the truth on that one always have to have

284
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,583
The sign the

285
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
Disclosure agree

286
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
Cuz everybody's got

287
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
F****** high

288
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,727
Can't we just put somebody in jail

289
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,007
Can we put him in jail

290
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,031
Just like that

291
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,055
The crime

292
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,383
Let's just do that constantly also been caught trying

293
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,015
To get people to commit voter fraud and then they're on tape big like we're not going to do that illegal

294
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,039
Yeah that's

295
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:18,879
Bad in this case the most recent one

296
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,439
The devil

297
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,719
In the book of Joe

298
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
Make a Deal

299
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,375
Yeah but he's a really cheap

300
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,423
Yeah

301
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,215
I'll give you like 50 bucks

302
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
Your soul

303
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,799
There's not enough

304
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,847
Yeah I know but you can't commit in trap

305
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,127
Even if you're not part of the

306
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,527
Tape some people

307
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:51,391
Deplorable

308
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,207
Would you call the Stampede

309
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,279
His cohorts were all like

310
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,583
Becca Bernstein

311
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,119
How to make a

312
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
It's all this b*******

313
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,471
Gladware

314
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,751
Things of that with their usual

315
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
Clear-headed

316
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
Rational

317
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,591
Absolutely

318
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,735
It is it's a stink bomb but it's acid

319
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,039
So there's a group called undercurrent

320
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,599
Has other video

321
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,623
About this

322
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,207
And I think they might be a little more telling

323
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,863
We're more important than the truth

324
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:36,959
Project gravy mashed potatoes

325
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:41,311
Is it so they have video of one of James O'Keefe

326
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
Sort of Associates

327
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,175
One of his coordinators a project

328
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,199
Offering

329
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,247
Huge amounts of money

330
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,063
For these people to cause chaos

331
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,343
At the Trump inauguration

332
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,903
So basically they have

333
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,927
Part a

334
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,255
Where they follow through with

335
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:04,095
The plan that they established with one

336
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,423
I don't understand why I don't understand

337
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:14,079
Like do you not see how brilliant this plan is if you no one can trace it back to him

338
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,383
He didn't make the offer

339
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,407
It's it's it's

340
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,967
It's super crazy but it's

341
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,247
But run by idiots

342
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,295
Is it

343
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,063
Side of honey

344
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
Yeah

345
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,111
So stupid

346
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,903
So they're really up on this gas

347
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,695
Narrative

348
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,231
Except they do for a little bit

349
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,255
But here's one of Alex's

350
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,279
Special Report

351
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
That

352
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
Is weird

353
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:42,239
We are now about 3 days now from its historical then take

354
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,031
I should clear I should just save it

355
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:44,799
Look for contacts

356
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,079
He's going

357
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,383
To talk about the alleged

358
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,175
From the print

359
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,479
That are said to exist

360
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,087
Dad said to exist

361
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,367
And be horrible

362
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,951
Okay they allegedly exist of trump saying the n word

363
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,791
Arnold

364
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:12,191
Arbiter of our democracy

365
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:17,311
Play I always knew it would come down to that truly stupid

366
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,663
This is what I think

367
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
Is

368
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,783
Supposed to be pre-emptive damage control

369
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,879
But it spins out of control so f****** fat and it's hilarious

370
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,415
Play

371
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,487
Call Watson Auto big score yesterday

372

00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,143
The source

374
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,151
Tape compilation

375
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:56,735
Whatever

376
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,063
With him sitting in the chair

377
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,391
Things like your son's retarded and

378
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,927
Dirty Jobs

379
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,231
And supposedly the n-word

380
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,095
Long time

Basically tell dirty jokes getting tingly comedian would do

383
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,031
Boston

384
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,127
Way to break the ice

385
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:33,343
Retarded

386
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:39,231
I never want the alarm on high powered people all the time

387
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,839
So

388
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,375
Absolutely not true

389
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:49,727
Well I mean we all do know how power people hookup you have to let us

390
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,775
But the part about Trump

391
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,567
Being self-deprecating

392
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,175
Air control

393
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:03,807
This is no longer really about the damage control

394
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,343
Okay

395
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,391
Play do it

396
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,655
It was a real

397
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,191
Previously

398
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,407
The word is he's so heavily edited with jump cuts

399
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:34,271
Contest

400
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,551
Like we doing

401
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,343
Ford

402
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,927
Even in any context it's not right because

403
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,095
If uses a proper word

404
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,935
Throwing up prior to use with Vine wax close

405
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,239
I was always offended by personally

406
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:57,567
Oh no

407
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,431
Call Alex I'm so sorry for you

408
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,295
So you eat that mean

409
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:12,927
You caught that right or reason you shouldn't say the n-word is because people can twist

410
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,743
I would hate for somebody to take the N word out of

411
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,375
So here's what our word

412
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,031
Also I like that he doesn't do it

413
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,407
You know he's a monster on weekend

414
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:39,039
Did the other part that I made that elicited a huge laugh

415
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,063
Is this like

416
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:43,391
When I heard that we're growing up is

417
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,207
Down

418
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:50,047
From black people so one that means it's okay for me to say it now forever

419
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:54,143
I'm also offended because I'm a way better person

420
00:20:54,399 --> 00:21:00,031
Because I'm just like

421
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,103
I just like black people I'm offended by the use of that word

422
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,639
So

423
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,943
I'm going to say the N word a lot is really what he's trying

424
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,503
Laid out

425
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,295
Like all of that stuff

426
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,855
To me was exactly like the OJ book

427
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:20,256
Like if I'm done

428
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:24,608
Now that is all okay but my favorite my favorite

429
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,888
He opens it with

430
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,936
His famous we have a sword

431
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,984
Whip

432
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,032
We have lots of you would believe I'm not

433
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,080
But

434
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,640
The devaraj is a

435
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,176
It's credible source

436
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,248
No. We don't know the reports credible yet

437
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,808
You should probably know that

438
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:50,464
Exactly other contacts

439
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:57,632
The credible source

440
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,912
Maybe

441
00:21:59,424 --> 00:21:59,936
Somebody

442
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,776
Yep may have something

443
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,824
That might be trustworthy

444
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,592
Benefits

445
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,616
If it is

446
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,640
If

447
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,736
It's not that true anyways

448
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,296
So that is that is like a

449
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,088
Spiraling out of control

450
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,136
Control like trying to hide everything

451
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,464
Amazing rationalization

452
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,024
Free excuses for things

453
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,632
It's it's

454
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:38,592
Have a scotch man like other rich people do

455
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,456
Assuming

456
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,272
Alex have a weird

457
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:51,136
Plan for what Trump should do

458
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,416
You know what I do

459
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:57,280
I wish

460
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:03,680
I wish you was in Barfly mode

461
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:09,568
Sauce

462
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,128
Right at my butthole

463
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,944
I shouldn't be getting into it I have sources

464
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,064
Are you sounding

465
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,096
Who's playing

466
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:32,864
I'm sorry for swearing

467
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,400
But I would never say

468
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,448
There's is playing for what Trump

469
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,008
If the tape is real

470
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,336
This

471
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,616
Open up this is

472
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
Is the craziest thing

473
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,944
This is the first time he's WarGames

474
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:49,504
Where are the ones always doing this

475
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,272
The first time

476
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,320
He's trying to think 10 moves ahead

477
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,368
And I'm going to go

478
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,392
He's not good at

479
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,952
He's not but he is way better than us

480
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:04,096
And you'll see by the time it gets to the end of it might be a little bit long but it is worth every penny

481
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,144
I just move on from

482
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,192
Trump

483
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,800
Is this compound and they Twisted order

484
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,848
Lisa

485
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,664
People sit around a joke around

486
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,944
Shocking

487
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,296
But he was already making up

488
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,600
What things like that and

489
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,232
Closest

490
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:34,048
Trulia Powerball this business country

491
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,864
Then he should come out

492
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,424
Talk about the fact that 51% of black

493
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:45,568
On average never get out of the woman's country and that we should work to make sure that genocide

494
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,384
Created by Margaret Sanger and push for the leftist

495
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,408
It stopped

496
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,688

503
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:13,728
So I wanted I wanted to stop here at this clip at all

504
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,264
For us to talk about

505
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,664
There we all know how well it went the last time Trump went to a black church when they told him to stop talk

506
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,456
Talking about Hillary from the pulpit

507
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,320
Almost at the light at a church

508
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,880
But I wanted to I wanted to cut in there

509
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,928
Compress cuz that's good advice

510
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:37,024
I have to assure you I did not do

511
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,328
Anything dishonest with this editing

512
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,632
This is exactly where the clip goes

513
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,936
So cute

514
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,288
Ladies and gentlemen

Charles and other large mammals there Artisan Rewards

517
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:04,672
Horrible experimentation

00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:13,120
Public hunting 100,000 people of the Middle East and Africa

519
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144

Yeah I would say probably a lot

547
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:33,248
I think he's probably including like

548
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,272
Contraception

549
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,088
For something like that

550
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:40,928
Morning-after pills or something like that

551
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,696

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,472

00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,240
And how dare you

574
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,032
I would argue this

575
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:05,152
Him saying that he was offended by black people saying the n word is

576
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:11,040
Probably the definition of but I don't think

577
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,320
People saying a word

578
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:20,000
I think though that his definition of consciously racist would be horribly Limited

579
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,352
Cuz he's black

580
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:40,480
Playdium

581
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,272
I don't know anyway

582
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,832
I took from Tuesday show

583
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,880
He also ships on

584
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,904
Why are we talkin

585
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,280
Turn up

586
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,328
Cancer because of

587
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,608
Glyphosate

588
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:01,984
But again that's probably part of his like enabling himself to make a sales pitch

589
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,288
Spinner

590
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,312
GMOs

591
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:14,016
The other stuff that he ranted on that I didn't take clips of his John Lewis is an a******

592
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,600
Never done a consciously race

593
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:25,280
Racist basically his point is like why can't Trump

594
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,328
John Lewis

595
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,096
Super

596
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,120
He's so race

597
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,680
Black chef

598
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,496
Racism turns you dark from within

599
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,616
So his argument

600
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,896
Alex is arguing that he makes

601
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:44,992
Is like Trump is an illegitimate president

602
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:49,856
And then Trump

603
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:55,744
His argument is that his

604
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,584
His tweets were really nice and trying to get John Lewis to work with him

605
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,984
Not true you were insulting as f***

606
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,752
Bass

607
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,520
Physically

608
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,312
Condescend upon him to an extent

609
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,080
Not seems

610
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,104
Since the early days

611
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:11,872
Did Alex

612
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:14,944
Yeah it's it was all like you're a man of

613
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
All talk

614
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,040
You would never

615
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:19,808
Mark Smith

616
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
King jr. like

617
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:26,208
But then late but the response to that by Alex and David night are like yeah

618
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,744
What has he done lately

619
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,560
Every becoming walk off

620
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,352
Becoming a congressman

621
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:38,752
Helps dangerous it into trying to get gun rights or get gun control test

622
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,288
Which they hate everything

623
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,360
Can possibly do being effective

624
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,408
At the vet you don't like

625
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,200
Just because

626
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:48,736
Just like

627
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,784
Wave his hand and gun control happen

628
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,808
Doesn't mean that

629
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,624
Being a giant pain in the ass for the

630
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,392
People who are fighting

631
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:58,720
Negative

632
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,744
No I know that

633
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,792
Cuz that's part takeaway Uganda

634
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:03,584
I mean

635
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,864
Regardless of what

636
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,680
But regardless of what side he's on you

637
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,960
Play he's all talk

638
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,240
Nope

639
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,056
Disagree with you

640
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,336
But you are acting

641
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:20,224
And you know what I didn't even think about that that's a really good point cuz she doesn't

642
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:23,296
Do you know a degree of respect for your position but

643
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,576
That you are doing

644
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:29,952
You're a man of action figure action

645
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,976
Your

646
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,512
Weak plaything

647
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:41,472
We have a lot of business

648
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,496
Yes

649
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,616
Thursday's show that

650
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:51,200
The rest of the clips today or going to be from January

651
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,248
19

652
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,064
2017 Alex broadcasting live

653
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,088
From Washington DC

654
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,880
I don't want to see this up top

655
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,440
This is one of the more unpleasant episodes

656
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,488
I've had to listen to to break down

657
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,280
Cuz it's one of the most

658
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,560
Full of beer

659
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:09,632
Episodes of the time that we've been covering

660
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,912
Really yeah

661
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,472
Yeah we're fine

662
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,008
Before

663
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,032
What will

664
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:16,800
Call trumpmas

665
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,104
I got to be honest I didn't catch it first

666
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,688
But you were being sarcastic

667
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,552
Surprise

668
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:32,928
He doesn't know how to

669
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,720
He doesn't know how to deal with being the winner

670
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:39,072
In response to that he's just going even more batch it out there

671
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:44,960
Rodger Stone has been poisoned with polonium

672
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:48,288
That's why you're going to hear what his new narrative is

673
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,568
Is here that

674
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:50,848
Wacky

675
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:53,408
I'm going to play as how he opened the show this

676
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,944
The beginning of the show

677
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,968
I am

678
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:59,040
It sort of is his prediction of what's going to happen

679
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,832
In the next 24 hours

680
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,136
From broadcast time

681
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,160
My phone

682
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,184
Will load

683
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,232
I bet

684
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,400
He believes

685
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,216
There will be an assassination

686
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,496
Not on

687
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,032
Interesting

688
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,312
But on pants

689
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,616
On no I mean you can kill pen today

690
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,640
Better

691
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,712
Brinkley that's what Pence

692
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,016
I was just like you

693
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,088
Let's go with

694
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:33,856
Hey

695
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,648
Democrat

696
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,464
So he predicts that there's an assassin

697
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,232
Destination

698
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,256
If not and it's Ash

699
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:45,888
But an attempt

700
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:52,288
Indigo

701
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,568
Exactly

702
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,592
That's not a prediction

703
00:34:55,104 --> 00:35:01,248
I don't want to sit here on the show every segment Stacy i-told-you-so over and over again

704
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,832
GOG

705
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,392
And when we come back from break

706
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,696
Of course

707
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:15,328
Even though he doesn't really actually ever explain what that means but it means continuity-of-government

708
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:19,680
Okay so what's the plan in place

709
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,960
In case anything

710
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:24,800
Because in the past there have been issues

711
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,128
It's unclear so they had to put down

712
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:32,480
Debra Wilson was president

713
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,272
For two years because nobody else is allowed to

714
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:38,624
I didn't know that

715
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,184
We have had a woman president

716
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,464
But not elected

717
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,232
Not elected

718
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,280
The craziest thing about that story is

719
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,072
Is that Woodrow was sick

720
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,608
And so no one was allowed to

721
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,376
To visit him

722
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,448
For about a year-and-a-half while he was present

723
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,008
All of Congress just talked to Eve

724
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,152
This is a conspiracy theory

725
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:03,712
But if you look back at that time

726
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,016
Crazily enough a lot of

727
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,552
Pro-woman things got.

728
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,576
Interesting

729
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:12,416
Very strange to notes be out of place in time

730
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:18,816
Woodrow Wilson misogynist

731
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:22,656
Marriage human being that he was

732
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,960
You got Charlie Greenwoods earlier

733
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:29,824
No I did not I saw some pictures of the 3 Doors Down concert

734
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:33,408
Sparsely attended

735
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,944
3 Doors Down

736
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,480
They're my kryptonite

737
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,016
I just can't help my

738
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,320
If I could come up with another one of those

739
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:46,720
He never really explained

740
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,768
Cuz they're krog's

741
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:52,864
Listener Lyft promo

742
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,912
Assassinated

743
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,728
Because he's a ruski agent

744
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,056
Will appoint the new president

745
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,616
Selling that idea right now

746
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:10,016
Never heard that before mother tonight

747
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,040
Not show up

748
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:18,720
Show called improvised

749
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,768
Give a nuke goes off

750
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,048
You can't one

751
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,328
Hundred percent

752
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,704
100%

753
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,264
100 bucking percent

754
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:35,872
Be very well be an accurate statement

755
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:43,040
That's not a thing as possible it is like a hypothetical

756
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:49,696
If you make up something then you can say with 100% certainty

757
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:53,280
Impossible

758
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:58,144
CNN clip video eventually end up laying like an hour later

759
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,288
It's going to

760
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,872
Constitutional matters

761
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,760
That usually if

762
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,528
The president

763
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,552
Goes down

764
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,880
Takes over as president

765
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,416
The Secretary of State

766
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,184
Takes over

767
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,512
Succession for the president

768
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,840
Is that right well maybe the speaker goes down to

769
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:31,680
Well that's why whenever they do those

770
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,960
They always have some ran

771
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:33,984
Adam Congressman in like a

772
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,008
Anchor somewhere

773
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,056
Just in case so that

774
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,104
And they all take turns doing

775
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,712
A joke okay cuz your turn

776
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:46,016
What weird

777
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,040
Secretary of

778
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,320
Altra running the entire cut

779
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,136
The point of the Siena

780
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,952
Was that because we're in a weird place where

781
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:57,280
John Kerry will be gone as Secretary of State

782
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,304
Tillerson won't be

783
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,864
He confirmed that the time we don't have a secretary of state

784
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,680
I'm so it could go down all the way to the

785
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,496
Highest non political appointee

786
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,408
Down it right

787
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,712
Which is the

788
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,416
Purses

789
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,184
Presidency

790
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,024
To think it's basically a story about how weird it could be

791
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,584
American government has a weird system

792
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:36,192
Obama

793
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,472
That's not a thing

794
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,288
Nobody's ever said that was a thing

795
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,568
He's twisting words cuz

796
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:44,128
It's the idea that this guy was appointed by Obama

797
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,504
But in the story they make it very clear is the highest-ranking non political appointee

798
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,528
Rec Department

799
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,832
Obama

800
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,464
Just line

801
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,488
Politically app

802
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,024
But what if

803
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,304
As

804
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,328
Yep

805
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:07,424
Pitiful non-political where you appointed

806
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,960
Oh

807
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:13,824
Political appointee some thoughts about the shadow government

808
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:14,848
Keeps talking about

809
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,920
We set up a shadow government

810
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:22,016
Under mutually assured destruction

811
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,672
That is all Sarah's day

812
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,976
Distraction is

813
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:34,048
The term Mexican standoff I think

814
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,864
Cornwall

815
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,168
On one of the recent episodes

816
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,216
He did like a 3-minute breakdown of what am I

817
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,752
Standoff in

818
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:48,896
It's like when you're going to do and there's like a third-person view and like

819
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,176
Whatever

820
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,224
It's not even accurate

821
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,760
Throwing up

822
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:00,160
There would be an emergency

823
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:04,256
The problem is

824
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,680
4C OG they try to use

825
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,080
Interpret

826
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,152
He's not saying Hitler's good yet

827
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:24,736
We all need to clarify

828
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:29,856
I do like that we're at the place where if you doesn't clarify that plenty

829
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,392
About time somebody said hello

830
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,184
Yeah yeah

831
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,256
I love Alex Jones and I love Hitler

832
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:39,584
No it said do not want things I love about Alex

833
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,656
Those Shadow government baby

834
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,680
But what channel

835
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,704
Shadow Bank

836
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,496
But what's shadow

837
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,776
Isn't that just

838
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:50,592
The government played Sonic the Hedgehog

839
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,919
Some of the newer games that are dark

840
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:56,735
Character remember that was Shadow the Hedgehog

841
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:00,831
Okay well that's exactly like this

842
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:04,159
Metaphor

843
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:08,767
Shadow government

844
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,535
Succession

845
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:13,887
It's like the Deep State basically it's code it's like CIA

846
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:14,911
It's

847
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:18,239
Set it up

848
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,543
The moments that we got the nuclear bomb

849
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:21,823
Alright

850
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,735
Okay

851
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,039
I do believe

852
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:37,439
Hello

853
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:40,255
Get the utility of it in terms of people working behind the

854
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:46,143
I get that there are some people who do things

855
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,959
That is real

856
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:55,615
I think the idea that there is a functioning

857
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,151
Shadow government

858
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:01,503
I mean in the UK they just called the other side The Shadow

859
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:08,159
Yeah so whatever

860
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:14,559
F****** everybody over with their b*******

861
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:20,959
Please don't take offense but I might do an episode of someone else I hate for you to miss out on any of this

862
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:28,895
Can I send you a drunk missive from the road

863
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,943
But know this

864
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,247
No matter where you go no matter what country you're in

865
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,271
Alex Jones

866
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,039
Is never wrong

867
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:44,511
Here it is the day before

868
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,303
The inauguration

869
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,583
They're floating

870
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,911
Furr's Buffet directions

871
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:53,215
Then they'll say that we got to have a civil emergency

872
00:43:56,031 --> 00:44:00,127
I want to point out that already happened also I want to point out that

873
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,647
Boom boom

874
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,255
What

875
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,095
What are you confused about

876
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,679
Yeah

877
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:25,727
Maybe

878
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:26,751
Okay

879
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:36,479
He's claiming that they tried all these things

880
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:40,063
That they know that the crg is the best way to overthrow

881
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,831
A president

882
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,367
How do we know this

883
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:47,231
Who knows this sources that may work

884
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,535
Everybody ever

885
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,583
But no that's not

886
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,351
No

887
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,887
He gets fed

888
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:59,263
Crazy wrong information by fake sources that are just his collars and he thinks

889
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,823
Like if I called him and I

890
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:02,847
I work for the FBI

891
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:03,871
I have some information

892
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:08,223
I almost guarantee

893
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:11,039
I feel like he would actually lead you on to be like

894
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,599
James O'Keefe

895
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,391
Basically if I called in

896
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,415
Just to be like

897
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:19,231
Now listen I got a source

898
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,799
My pillow just remind

899
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,567
Okay

900
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,383
No it has to do with dirty though

901
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:40,223
You know how we talk about these like a digital dropbox

902
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:42,783
At least they use

903
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:49,183
Every single time he talks about that BuzzFeed article and the thing that came from Russia

904
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:52,255
The dirty.

905
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:55,327
And I like that a lot

906
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:04,543
Ol Dirty Bastard

907
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,079
Would be the dirty.

908
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:10,687
The greatest thing you've ever read in your entire life

909
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:20,671
Together. I love that stuff

910
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,439
Childish

911
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:31,679
So Alex has more thoughts about how he's always right

912
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:38,591
Because most intelligent

913
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,223
Weather

914
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,527
Okay

915
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,855
The song about like if the globalist

916
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,391
Do Tryon.

917
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:54,719
Covid-19

918
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,255
Counter thought to Alex Jones

919
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,535
Oh boy

920
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,375
Is something that he truly believes

921
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:04,191
Right yeah

922
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,215
To really want this

923
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,239
Biscuit to go down

924
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,263
Just so a

925
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,311
He can see all the globalist

926
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
Junk

927
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:17,759
Yeah

928
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:22,879
All the crazy bullshittin he's been spouting for his entire 22 years

929
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,927
Is 100% accurate

930
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:27,743
The confirmation that he's right

931
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,535
No no no

932
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,303
He wouldn't

933
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,095
But you would think he would

934
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:38,495
Cuz it's someone I mean the greatest Coincidence of all time if all of this stuff

935
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:45,663
Completely different reason

936
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,735
I think it's more likely than his version

937
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,503
Quite frankly

938
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:54,111
Everything is more likely than his I look be clear

939
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:58,463
We have different political ideas we agree on a lot of stuff

940
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,231
Totally aligned

941
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,839
Neither of us want

942
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:04,863
Ill to happen to

943
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,935
We don't want him dead

944
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:11,775
Under

945
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:12,543
Law

946
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:15,359
What are I would be fine with that I don't want him

947
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:18,175
To be hurt by like assassinated

948
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:21,759
I want that would be a counterproductive

949
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:28,415
A caveat needs to be an actual

950
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,951
Full-on Revolution

951
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:37,119
Entire government of top-rated I want the entire country

952
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:43,519
The new Civil War well it may happen one way or another anyway

953
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,567
We reserve the right to strike

954
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,847
Vegeta

955
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,943
I'm going to walk myself back to my foot

956
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:54,527
What I mean is we don't support the things Alex thinks

957
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:57,087
We support no absolutely not

958
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,623
And almost everything else

959
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,183
Here's a little bit

960
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:01,951
Where

961
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:04,767
You know how I was

962
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:13,727
It's very worrisome

963
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,223
Tomorrow

964
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,719
People approved yet

965
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,631
People Obama appoint

966
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,935
Obama

967
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:58,783
Colorado

968
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,063
Space command

969
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,599
Space command

970
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:04,671
NORAD

971
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:07,487
Long time

972
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,351
And the people are in the bunkers

973
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:14,399
I'm just a little bit suspicious

974
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:32,319
Gog is the weather tomorrow

975
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:35,391
Annie's got f****** Wagner in the back

976
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:38,207
Are you like that like

977
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:42,303
At the end he's like I'm not going to think about it

978
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,887
Also they're openly talking about

979
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:52,543
Everybody's always openly talking about vet

980
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,359
To hear it man

981
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,639
Is it

982
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:59,711
Does he think it's cold or does he actually have Mike's everywhere

983
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,503
Is he always watching

984
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,039
I think he thinks

985
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,879
Is it

986
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:13,535
WWE Fastlane

987
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,583
Fiction is great cuz it's like

988
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,399
Obama has people at space command

989
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:23,775
Play Ora's outside of Washington DC apparently I do

990
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:27,359
Event

991
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,639
It has to be

992
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:31,967
What's 17

993
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:37,855
F****** amazing if you remember say too bad for that

994
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,135
God

995
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,463
So

996
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,487
He's in d.c.

997
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:48,607
He's hanging out waiting for the inauguration on the streets

998
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:51,423
You think that's everybody comes up to him and they were like

999
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:55,007
We're just really we're just really grateful for the job that you're done

1000
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:58,079
You you are the only one telling the truth

1001
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:00,895
We just really love you and we're grateful that you helped

1002
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:02,687
Lorden

1003
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,711
Savior hero

1004
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:10,879
That might be the case some of the time but he has some other responses

1005
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,119
Debating whether I should

1006
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:22,655
I bet he does

1007
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:33,151
Literally

1008
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:37,247
Arrogant evil position

1009
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,063
Evil people

1010
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:48,511
Sit back

1011
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:05,919
Car

1012
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:16,415
They run this world

1013
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:18,207
They are so mad

1014
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,959
So this is this is great cuz I like people helping people I think that's great

1015
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:30,495
I don't think we should bring back history

1016
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,543
Accurately

1017
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:33,311
Describes

1018
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:34,847
Evil people

1019
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,895
With all the words

1020
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:39,711
He would use if he looked into

1021
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:44,575
If you if you did mushrooms if you gave him an entire list of the things that he

1022
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:46,111
He's done but put Obama's

1023
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,647
Name on top of it

1024
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:50,463
Those are all the things that evil people would do it

1025
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:52,767
Slytherin

1026
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:55,839
What's his name

1027
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,935
Some sort of like a Christmas carol situation

1028
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,727
Can you show up to show him the error of his

1029
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,775
Breezeways that's what I'm saying

1030
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,823
That's what I'm saying

1031
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:06,847
Former White

1032
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:11,967
No longer with us

1033
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:14,271
When we needed him to do mushroom

1034
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,575
Just do some mushrooms and like

1035
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:20,415
Introspective and realize

1036
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,439
Then being neck

1037
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,207
Text to Alex

1038
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,279
Yeah yeah

1039
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:29,375
Cthulhu blade nightmare

1040
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:33,727
I would sign up for it

1041
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:38,079
The other day episode about whether or not we'd like to drink with Alex Jones

1042
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:41,663
I realize that I got to I got to go full circle on myself

1043
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:46,271
I'm in the unpleasant but

1044
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,599
Could be fun

1045
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:50,879
Such amazing things

1046
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,671
Because

1047
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:58,303
Because we wouldn't give it we don't give the reaction that he's looking for is either adoration or

1048
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,327
We think it's

1049
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,095
Hilarious

1050
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:06,495
Still mad

1051
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:11,871
Richard Edward territory in first four minutes and then we're off to the race

1052
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,639
From there

1053
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:15,199
Do you know where it is we would go after

1054
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:21,599
I'll tell you this I bet we would be called

1055
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,879
Aliens

1056
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:25,695
Dallas

1057
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:29,279
Tell me about these beings of light in about those beans

1058
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:31,071
Play Aliens

1059
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:37,727
Dirty Pleiadians

1060
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:46,175
This clip is super f****** fun

1061
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:52,831
It's awesome it shows a little bit

1062
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:57,439
You're going to need

1063
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,463
Microphone down

1064
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,487
But

1065
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:01,279
I want to set this up a little bit

1066
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:04,351
He was ranting about how I

1067
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:07,935
Putin gives him and Trump all of their marching orders

1068
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:12,031
Like facetiously ranting about that

1069
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:15,103
Depression and this is sort of the aftermath

1070
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,295
They're so delusional

1071
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,087
And so disconnected

1072
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:29,951
Uninstalling

1073
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,559
Other really good acting

1074
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:37,119
Cookie Monster

1075
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,343
Isn't that amazing

1076
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:03,743
That might be one of my favorite moments ever he does this dumbass Cookie Monster B

1077
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:04,511
But then he's like

1078
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:07,583
My eight-year-old daughter loves when I do Cookie Monster

1079
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:12,447
That's kind of beautiful

1080
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:15,775
The real person now then not 20 seconds later

1081
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:20,639
The nuclear weapons are all going to die

1082
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,407
When I tell her about the

1083
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,711
My daughter's age

1084
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:27,295
She's two years away from being a correspondent on my traffic andesite

1085
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,831
Oh my God

1086
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:29,855
Cookie Monster

1087
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,391
That's amazing

1088
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:35,999
Cookie Monster

1089
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:38,559
Drift

1090
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:40,095
And that is

1091
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:42,399
Ironic way

1092
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,679
I thought that was pretty funny

1093
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:46,495
I thought that was pretty funny

1094
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:51,615
Baby in terms of the context of every other horrifying thing that he

1095
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:54,175
Eric Roberson on a sliding

1096
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:00,319
Closest we're going to get to funny without like

1097
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:06,975
Oh no a little bit of

1098
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:09,791
Frank Caliendo

1099
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:12,863
How is the egotistical also about impression

1100
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:15,423
Can't do a Russian

1101
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:17,727
That's kind of wanted

1102
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:19,007
That is pretty easy

1103
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:21,311
So this is

1104
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:22,079
Less

1105
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,615
Humane and

1106
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:24,639
Alright

1107
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:28,479
About 24 hours

1108
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,015
This is a direct message

1109
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,319
The globalist

1110
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:39,743
Who do you think provide you your security

1111
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,583
1

1112
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:48,959
Quantifiable fact

1113
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:52,799
That within 24 hours

1114
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:58,175
Goodbye

1115
00:58:59,199 --> 00:58:59,967
Bluebird

1116
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:02,783
Bye-bye

1117
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:08,927
You think you're going to run a poison to Apollonia

1118
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:13,023
Against a bunch of Americans that just want prosperity

1119
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:16,351
I just want

1120
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,423
Cocovan

1121
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,215
Alicia

1122
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:23,263
Rift

1123
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,823
Trump

1124
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:26,591
Perfect

1125
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:28,639
But he's not out to get us

1126
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:29,919
Is it good guy

1127
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,711
The ones prosperity

1128
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,855
4 supposed to be

1129
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,535
Over

1130
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:48,095
Because even if you kill me or Trump

1131
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:01,663
What why do why would you go to the Liberty move my

1132
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:03,967
Yeah but I mean you could let him go

1133
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:08,831
Nature's going to get him

1134
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:11,647
Some great ideas

1135
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:16,767
He's crazy about some stuff but I do

1136
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,119
Me too

1137
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:25,983
I love it when Alex gets like

1138
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:28,799
In this headspace where he's talking to Rick

1139
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:30,591

Do you know what you're going to try this and we're going to f****** get you

1145
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,375
And he's just about to brush his teeth

1146
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,143
Before that

1147
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:56,191
He wipes the steam off of

1148
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:56,959
His mirror

1149
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:57,983
Looks directly into

1157
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,631
Wait no

1158
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:32,031

1159
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,823
Multinational corporation

1160
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:34,847
But dude

1161
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:39,711
Security we got a we got to Outsource

1162
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:44,575
All the people who have guns

1163
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,855

01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,895
My tire light

1171
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:21,695

You like advertising

1176
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,311
On YouTube play what's going on

1177
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:39,359
I think I actually found some new insight

1178
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:42,431
One of the things is that the reason

1179
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:43,455
B Alex

1180
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,295

Big shout-out.

1183
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:52,927
Kyoto

1184
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:55,999
I realize that the reason that they can give away all the

1185
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:56,767
The app time

1186
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,559
Is it because they just do ads

1187
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,839
On the Regular Show

1188
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:06,751
They don't do and I also realize

1189
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:11,103
I also realized that I've never played like one of their

1190
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,127
Because

1191
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,663
They're just doing their ad

1192
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:17,503
So this is in the middle of the show not during commercial

1193
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:20,575
This is a little bit long but I think it's worth it for a

1194
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:21,343
A couple of

1195
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:24,927
But this is just a commercial that's part of the show

1196
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,743
This clip here and

1197
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:36,703

A hundred percent

1205
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:04,095
Because they're selling bacteria out there

1206
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:04,863
Active resistance

1215
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:48,639

1216
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:51,711

Sends a big message

1219
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:12,191
They are selling

01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:13,727

01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:34,463
Done already

1228
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:45,983
Any revolutionary thoughts I had before God

1229
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,775
The people who take him seriously

1230
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:55,199
It's not fair they don't deserve to die but no I don't mean that

1231
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:57,247
They have body armor now

1232
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:00,319
Which look anytime you are in people

1233
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,855
Who are afraid

1234
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,135
That really just me

1235
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,415
They're looking for a reason

1236
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,439
Going to use that arm

1237
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:09,791
Undoubtedly so if you give them only do they have

1238
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:11,839
But now that

1239
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:13,119
Feel like they don't have to

1240
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,911
You fear retaliation either

1241
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:17,727
Whether or not that's actually how that works with

1242
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:23,103
Here's the best news they don't make bulletproof vest in

01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:35,135
A hurtful day on my part

1246
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:38,719
And it means that we can

1247
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:04,319

Haven't you seen how low babies fertility's are these days

1267
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:58,239
Every time I check a baby's fertility I'm like Jesus this fertility is everytime I try and get a baby to get me

He said that like he's bragging

1317
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:23,647

What is 20

1391
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:20,351
He embarks Upon a

1392
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:21,375
50

1393
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:24,703
Sleeper Cell

1394
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:25,727
See

1395
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:29,311

1396
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:32,127
With no help from anybody else

1397
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:37,503
And now

1398
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:41,855
I love you struggling to come up with a thought

1399
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,135
Why

1400
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:49,791
That is actually the most insulting thing I think anybody's ever said about Trump

1401
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:52,095
What did he was asleep herself

1402
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:54,655
To me that is an insult to him because

1403
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,447
Basically

1404
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,471
Negate

1405
01:16:57,727 --> 01:17:00,031
All of the things that he really is good at

1406
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:02,079
And says that he's good at something else

1407
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:07,967
Interesting I think it's rather you'd rather someone celebrate his

1408
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:10,527
Is bullying manipulative Market Act

1409
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:17,695
Sure he is that is a more complimentary thing that saying you're a great spy

1410
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:19,231
Going intertek

1411
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:22,047

1412
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,327
Get me on something that

1413
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:33,055
What point is it like at Alki

1414
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,711
Right and then I come up to you

1415
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:42,527
I really love

1416
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:43,295
The ghost riders

1417
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:44,319
Who wrote all of your

1418
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:46,367
Okay

1419
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,391
Great job

1420
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:48,671
Performing every

1421
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:53,791
So he's taking

1422
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:55,583
All of the stuff that you're good at

1423
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:57,375
And complimenting somebody else

1424
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:00,703
Person to

1425
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:02,751
But

1426
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,543
That's it that's offended

1427
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:08,895
I wouldn't put it outside the round-the-clock

1428
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:09,663
Says the n word

1429
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:12,735
Hours in the back

1430
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:16,831
I wouldn't be too surprised

1431
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:17,855
If Trump

1432
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:18,879
Cold out

1433
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:21,951
Cuz the two of them

1434
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:24,255
And Trump is a known liar

1435
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:27,071
Kind of a social

1436
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:27,839
PupilPath

1437
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:29,119
Kind of is a very

1438
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:33,983
He very easily could have told Alex these sorts of things

1439
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,519
And Alex believes him

1440
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:36,287
When I say

1441
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:37,055
Full on

1442
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,591
F****** rewriting

1443
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:39,871
That

1444
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:40,895
Would be

1445
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:42,175
Funniest joke

1446
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:42,943
You could play on Al

1447
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,223
Alex Jones

1448
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:48,319
Other than calling

1449
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:53,695
50 years Sleeper Cell agent

1450
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:56,255
To pull off one bit on ethics

1451
01:18:57,023 --> 01:19:02,143
I mean to be a rough 27 years before Alex got on the air

1452
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:08,799
But if we're giving him that much forethought of knowing when the time would come

1453
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:09,567
Strike

1454
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,615
Why not why not

1455
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:12,895
Knowing that Alex

1456
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,431
Hilo and Alex

1457
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,711
Would arise from the

1458
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:21,343
If you are asleep or sell one of the things that you desperately need to do also is make yourself a laughing

Ghibli for sale

1463
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:35,935
He is the single greatest Sleeper Cell agent there is ever been in

In the history of the world and you know what is good at 3%

1465
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:43,615
I mean

1466
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:46,175
The day may not come that he has to go Ghost Protocol

1467
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:52,575
16 oz

1468
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:54,623
His daughter

1469
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:55,903
My daughter

1470
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:58,463
So Alex announces

1471
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,231
Is big news

1472
01:19:59,487 --> 01:19:59,999
The Trump is a

1473
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,791
Americana Sleeper Cell

1474
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,095
That's some solid bulshit

1475
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:06,143
He can't keep the thread

1476
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:08,959
So how is that

1477
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:14,080
How could you not keep please listen to what ends up coming out of his mouth

1478

1479
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:16,128
Let's do this

1480
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:21,504
But

1481
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:24,064
Record numbers of minorities and women

1482
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:37,376

Casino Rose

1486
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:09,888

1487
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:17,056
Oldies bobmovies all the owners are stereotypically gay

Train stereotype to makeup

1491
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:29,856
That's what they do

1492
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:32,928
Oh man

1493
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:37,024
I don't like

1494
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:42,656
Have you in your life of Tolerance in

1495
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,704
An acceptance ever felt you were Pandora

1496
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:47,520
To gaze or minorities or anything

1497
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:51,360
I would even know what is

1498
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,896
What does pandering look

1499
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:53,920
To you

1500
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:56,736
To me in this

1501
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:58,528
Catering really just means a lot

1502
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,600
Because

1503
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:03,136
Hindering

1504
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,440
What he thinks that

1505
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:06,464
Is him saying

1506
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:08,512
I think

1507
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,352
Instead of

1508
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:13,120
You know

1509
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:14,400
Say what he really feels

1510
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:15,424
Which is that you should

1511
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:19,520
Yeah I think I was just lying right I think in this case

1512
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:21,824
His version of pandering would be active Lisa

1513
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:22,592
Supporting

1514
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:23,616
Oh

1515
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,152
You know like

1516
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:27,712
I think that's what he means by that

1517
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:30,784
Odyssey here and actively support your day fine

1518
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:35,904
Overtime

1519
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,952
I super panda

1520
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,232
All the time

1521
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:44,608
I was more of like a

1522
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,376
A silent partner

1523
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:51,008
Just gave you the wink

1524
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:51,776
Hey

1525
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:53,568
Try saying the n word last but I like it

1526
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:55,872
Edward

1527
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:07,904
I don't have to sit here and explain

1528
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,352
Everyone that wants low taxes really hate black people

1529
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:23,008
I'm so sick of my whole life

1530
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:27,104
I'm bad as I got the code

1531
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:27,872
Okay

1532
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:31,456
Me up

1533
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:42,464
Because they were told I was my ancestors I did something to them

1534
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:48,864
Post wife

1535
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:04,736
Do you think of the lady doth protest too much

1536
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:09,088
Okay

1537
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:10,880
He did

1538
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,160
Everything possible

1539
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:13,184
How to say

1540
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:15,744
He fought

1541
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,816
Tooth and nail to keep that word from coming out of his mouth

1542
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:22,400
They might have done something

1543
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,424
Which is like

1544
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:31,360
Know my ancestors were good Christian people trying to atone for it

1545
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:32,896
Maybe they aren't

1546
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:39,296
No big deal if they did on slaves even while they were owning slaves they were good Christians

1547
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:45,952
Take a step back and I want to say one thing very clearly I don't think that it's a moral failure

1548
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:48,000
On your part if your ancestors owned

1549
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:54,144
But I think it's a moral failure on your part if you were aware of the history of slavery

1550
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,704
And you think that is meaningless to our modern world

1551
01:24:57,472 --> 01:25:00,800
Well knock knock knock looks like to do that that's why I didn't go that far

1552
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:02,592
Okay you think that's too far

1553
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:03,616
Dude I mean

1554
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:05,920
Okay how old is Alex Jones

1555
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:07,200
He's probably pushing

1556
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,016
Mid-to-late forties

1557
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,808
So he was born in the late sixties

1558
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,088
Now

1559
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:14,368
Let me

1560
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:15,136
Let me just

1561
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:16,416
Bluesky think

1562
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:19,744
He was born in Texas

1563
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,280
I don't know if that's true

1564
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:22,816
Well from his voice

1565
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:23,840
Born somewhere around there

1566
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:26,144
He's been there a long time

1567
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,520
Sixties era he was born in Dallas

1568
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:33,312
He's going doubts right

1569
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:34,848
To Texas parrots

1570
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:36,128
Beauty Tsum

1571
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:36,896
During

1572
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:38,432
The Civil Rights era

1573
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,272
If I'm just going to

1574
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:45,344
Go buy all of the history there is

1575
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:48,416
You don't even have to go back to his grave

1576
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:50,720
His parents were probably horrible races

1577
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:56,864
Most likely means

1578
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:57,888
Own up

1579
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,936
You use that waterfowl

1580
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:01,984
The worst thing you can do

1581
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:05,312
Actually growing up everyday with black

1582
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,080
Kids feeling like

1583
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:08,896
Oh something is wrong because of the color of my skin

1584
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:10,688
He just described

1585
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:18,368
I think I just short skirt.

1586
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:21,440
What was the I had a vein in my head but

1587
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:26,304
People running around saying white people are bad

1588
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,608
Is kind of newer than that era of

1589
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,912
Maybe a little bit

1590
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:36,800
They're bad

1591
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:39,616
Northlake

1592
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:43,712
RiverWatch

1593
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:49,600
Fake idea that black people beat him up cuz they've been lied to that white people are bad

1594
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:51,392
That's never happened

1595
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:56,512
Maybe when you were a kid or something like that probably had nothing to do with your skin

1596
01:26:56,768 --> 01:27:02,912
0 chances that

1597
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:03,936
Alex Jones

1598
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:04,704
Does a speeding

1599
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:06,240
Has ever been

1600
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:07,520
Deserved

1601
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:11,872
Weird

1602
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:12,896
The

1603
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:13,920
Wow

1604
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:15,712
Here's the worst part about that

1605
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:17,760
Is

1606
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:20,832
Outside of that like the least conspiracy theories

1607
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,392
Because I would guarantee that if

1608
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:24,160
You really got

1609
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:24,928
Most

1610
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:26,464
White people

1611
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:27,488
Like

1612
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:30,816
Like most wifey

1613
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:33,632
Explain to them

1614
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:34,400
How whitefoord

1615
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:35,680
Really happen

1616
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:39,008
Their starting point is going to be

1617
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:39,776
You know like

1618
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:40,800
Well I mean

1619
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:43,360
Sure

1620
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:46,688
You know you know the idea of like

1621
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:47,968
Moral development

1622
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:48,736
Mint how it works

1623
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:52,064
Do you start with the kernel of like Golden Rule

1624
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,856
You work up to

1625
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:54,624
New Concept

1626
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:56,416
Principles

1627
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:59,232
Is that Lawrence Kohlberg's theory of

1628
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:00,256
Who cares

1629
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:06,656
Good point basically you evolve to understand things

1630
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:11,008
You end up at a place where you're at you thinking is much more evolved

1631
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:13,568
If this is basically the low rung on

1632
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:15,360
Of racial think

1633
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:17,408
Cuz like I didn't do anything wrong

1634
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:20,480
Great there's more that there's more work for you to do

1635
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:23,808
Replace rear to get to in terms of understanding

1636
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:27,392
It's not even that high

1637
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:29,696
No it's not even that high it's just like

1638
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:30,976
It's literally

1639
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:33,280
Have you walked a mile in another man's shoes

1640
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:36,352
Literally

1641
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:41,728
Stephen Curry

1642
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:42,752
Universal

1643
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:44,288
Here's my answer

1644
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:45,056
To Alex

1645
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:47,872
Me with a weird thought about race

1646
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:48,640
And I say

1647
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:50,432
Can you do more for me out

1648
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:51,456
He's like

1649
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:55,296
Yeah

1650
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:02,464
You are probably going to put my cardi b yellow

1651
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:06,048
You're going to see Infowars

1652
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:10,912
So this is Rob dude who's co-hosting for a little bit

1653
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:13,728
Arab do

1654
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:16,032
Where do all these names f******

1655
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:16,800
Come from

1656
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:18,080
Used to have a guy named

1657
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:19,104
Jakari Jackson

1658
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,176
Great Dane

1659
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:23,712
Already left I wonder why

1660
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:24,480
I don't know

1661
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:29,344
Usually behind the camera

1662
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,368
Sing a little bit

1663
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:31,904
He's trying to explain

1664
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:34,208
Stuff but

1665
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:38,304
Can handle that he hijack

1666
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:47,264
But

1667
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:59,040
Cheetah

1668
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:17,472
Your right finger know that's call what mammals do

1669
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:20,288
Elizabeth Warren

1670
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:33,088
What's great is it gets so much worse

1671
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:34,368
Han

1672
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,416
It's not possible

1673
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:37,184
You could

1674
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,208
Rob

1675
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:45,632
If you which is better

1676
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:48,448
If a woman is all over you and you kiss her

1677
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:54,848
Well if that was just me too I was trying to hold in all the other stuff

1678
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:58,944
Right you might think that's like he just said that

1679
01:30:59,456 --> 01:30:59,968
Nope

1680
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:03,296
Purity goes developing that theme for about a minute

1681
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:39,648
Is okay

1682
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:43,232
If you want outside your parents

1683
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:49,632
For the government

1684
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:57,568
After that

1685
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:04,224
But they were so happy that the war was over they both came

1686
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:30,336
Corrupt

1687
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:35,456
So funny that's so cute

1688
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:38,272
It's a little child

1689
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,808
It's so funny

1690
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:42,112
Ranting about something that's not real

1691
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:42,880
Amen

1692
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:46,208
Actual sexual assault

1693
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:50,304
Real is this b******* idea that anybody think

1694
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,888
B kissing someone who is clearly into you

1695
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:57,472
Helicopter

1696
01:32:58,752 --> 01:32:59,776
So

1697
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:01,824
This is all about Trump

1698
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:02,848
Sexual assault

1699
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,640
This is like

1700
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:05,920
Music waiting

1701
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:07,712
His wife wanting a kiss

1702
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:08,992
And Trump

1703
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:11,552
Moving in on someone like a b****

1704
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:15,136
Trying to finger bang them without permission

1705
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:17,952
That's not equivalent that is not okay

1706
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:19,232
No he's based

1707
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:23,072
Sickly just described all of the things that are sexual assault and rape

1708
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:25,376
And then said that because

1709
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,192
No he just said it was okay to rape you

1710
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:36,384
Most convoluted way when you unpack all of that

1711
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:37,920
Is b*******

1712
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:43,808
Basically

1713
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:44,576
Do witches like

1714
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:46,368
They want

1715
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,160
Yeah they want it

1716
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:49,952
They can signal it to you

1717
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:53,280
Because then they are signaling

1718
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:57,632
That's classic

1719
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,936
Victim-blaming like

1720
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:00,960
F*** you

1721
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:04,288
If you believe any one of those words that he f****

1722
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:05,312
Can said go f*** yourself

1723
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:10,688
Yeah absolutely don't mean as an insult if you believe all that stuff in our lives

1724
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:11,968
Sing this podcast please

1725
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:12,736

1726
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:13,760
Keep berating you

1727

You dumb horrible person

1728
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:22,976
We're winding down here in terms of

1729
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:24,512
Dark lips

1730
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:25,536
K2

1731
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,352
But

1732
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:31,424
We have a couple more of those I want

1733
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:32,448
How to play

1734
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:33,984
Where Alex

1735
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:36,032

1736
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:42,176
To Trump's hotel

1737
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:42,944
Post office

1738
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:56,512
Yeah it's like

1739
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:57,792
Claim that your journalist

1740
01:34:58,048 --> 01:35:00,352
Wow how can you f****** claim

1741
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:01,632

1742
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:02,400
2

1743
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:09,312
Any sort of journalistic Integrity when you're just like

1744
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:11,616

Free in the lobby

1748
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:34,144
I can't even get myself to say

1749
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:38,240
George Soros

1750
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:42,848
Oh good I was I was worried we wouldn't hear about him nope those enough

1751
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:43,616
Continuing X

1752
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:49,504
There's a little narrative going on throughout the show about protesters being bussed in

1753
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:52,832
Got it

1754
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:54,624
Done

1755
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,440
Addicott Universe Calvin

1756
01:35:57,696 --> 01:35:58,464
And Hobbes Calvin

1757
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:01,024
Has anybody done a d

1758
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:01,792
Decal with

1759
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:02,560
Trump's face

1760
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:03,328
1004

1761
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:09,216
Okay I haven't seen it but someone has

1762
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:10,752
Right there

1763
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:13,824
It's in the dirty.

1764
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,384
That's all they needed

1765
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:21,504
They just said Trump a picture of that

1766
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,808
In the heavily classified

1767
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:28,160
Procrastinate go to the inauguration

1768
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:33,024
Saw the Calvin

1769
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,328
Jesus hears about buses

1770
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:41,216
Owen Shroyer

1771
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:46,848
Soros group

1772
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:52,224
Open Bing

1773
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:55,552
He caught himself there with the

1774
01:36:56,064 --> 01:37:00,672
Owen Shroyer put out

1775
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:03,232
They did catch people getting on buses

1776
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:04,768
That's about it

1777
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,048
I mean well

1778
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,608
What about the Arkansas Department of Transportation

1779
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:11,680
Are they still on the road

1780
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:16,544
Also signal Alder videos literally proved is that people use buses

1781
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,848
That's all

1782
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:21,408
Conservative.

1783
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:23,712
Any kind of responsibility for being called

1784
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:25,504
Does George Soros and others

1785
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:29,088
Could be anybody could be Greyhound

1786
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:33,952
All the videos are are people being real

1787
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:36,000
George Soros

1788
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:42,656
This Global Hound of Owen Shroyer

1789
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:46,752
Like watching people get on like in a line onto a bus

1790
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:47,776
Advance

1791
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:49,056
Them speculating

1792
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:51,616
Reminder going to go get them

1793
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:52,384
Some housing

1794
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:56,736
Beat them up and then they'll be taking around to the protest

1795
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:57,504
That's just

1796
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,272
Racist

1797
01:37:58,528 --> 01:38:00,832
B******* right there I really the racist cuz it's

1798
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:03,392
It's like all different races

1799
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:06,464
Millennial

1800
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:08,512
And we all know that

1801
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:10,048
Yeah we are

1802
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,328
But that's just what

1803
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:12,096
F****** mean

1804
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:13,888
M MS

1805
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:17,472
You know what every morning I wake up and I'm like am I bad

1806
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:19,008
Because I'm a millennial this really makes me

1807
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:20,288
We feel bad and then

1808
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:21,056
An old app

1809
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:22,080
A baby boomer

1810
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:22,848
Beat me up

1811
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:25,664
You know I'm just trying to be a page

1812
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:32,320
Crazy so that Owen Shroyer filed another report where he proved the protesters are idiots

1813
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:33,600
If I going around during a

1814
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:34,368
An active

1815
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:35,904
That's where people are changing

1816
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:37,440
I'm trying to ask them questions

1817
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:41,280
Excellence

1818
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:42,560
And no one's answering him

1819
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:48,960
Because they're in the middle of a protest

1820
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:52,800
You stop doing anything

1821
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:58,944
So basically what he's doing is he's driving up in a motorcycle right now

1822
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:00,224
Next to a moving car and knock

1823
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,504
King on the window

1824
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:05,856
Can you answer a three-point complicated math question for me real quick

1825
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:09,696
Absolutely

1826
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:11,744
How do you derivate calculus

1827
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:16,608
Is motorist there also f******

1828
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:18,912
Stupid

1829
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:21,984
It seems it was invented in the 50s

1830
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:25,824
Thinks he's being like Mike Wallace

1831
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,104
But he's just like

1832
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:31,968
All the footage they have the performance

1833
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:32,736
To show anything

1834
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:33,504
Doesn't

1835
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,040
Say it does

1836
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:37,344
Insinuates as long as

1837
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,136
You put scary music

1838
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:43,744
Around equation is about

1839
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:47,584
I debated whether I would play this

1840
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:48,352
Cuz it's

1841
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:50,400
Disgusting

1842
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:53,728
You just pulled the you just pulled the Alex Jones movie

1843
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:56,288
I am going to play or not

1844
01:39:57,568 --> 01:40:02,688
No I I am I'm saying I'm Dubai debated whether to play it because it's actually

1845
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,808
I mean are we going to be okay with us

1846
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:12,928
I will find out answer

1847
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:19,072
Horribly childish understanding of race and

1848
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:20,864
Consent

1849
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:25,216
But this is kind of on another level of like

1850
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:27,264
Him a relishing

1851
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,568
Things that are really uncomfortable

1852
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:34,176
Anyway if you have any sort of sensitivity towards stuff about child abuse

1853
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:35,456
Ferrari human being

1854
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:39,296
If you want to turn it off go ahead but if not

1855
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:49,536
Adjust email address

1856
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:54,656
Overly dramatic but I just wanted to give people a little bit of a heads up at the

1857
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:56,448
Gross it's a literal trigger

1858
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:57,472
Yeah

1859
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:01,056
Cam right now

1860
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:06,432
Aristocratic

1861
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:08,992
Boys and girls tortured killed

1862
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:11,040
And forced to eat feces

1863
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:33,824
Megan Baird

1864
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:42,272
Softer soul

1865
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:57,120
Meryl Streep

1866
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:06,336
They want

1867
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:11,200
This is on record

1868
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:15,040
Drink supplies

1869
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:17,856
Now I don't know

1870
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:18,880
Entirely

1871
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:20,416
Is Belgium story he's talkin

1872
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:21,184
About is

1873
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:23,232
But I do know that it's

1874
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:24,768
Irresponsible

1875
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:27,328
To claim that your political enemies

1876
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:28,608
Are aligned with

1877
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:32,960
Example of it possibly what he's talking about

1878
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:33,728
Someone did

1879
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:36,800
Like there's no.

1880
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:42,176
Astros top of the world horrible

1881
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:43,968
We have serial killers

1882
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:47,552
They do a lot of weird

1883
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:50,880
To take any likes to take things and be like

1884
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:55,744
And that's who we're up against it's not fair

1885
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:56,768
Like you didn't even

1886
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:57,792
Couch at this time

1887
01:42:58,048 --> 01:43:00,864
In like some sort of plausible deniability

1888
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:02,400
The globalist

1889
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:04,448
Want to grab your kids

1890
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:06,240
Rape them

1891
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:08,032
Feed them crap

1892
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,056
Damn

1893
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:14,176
Probably not somebody that you can have an open and honest

1894
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:15,712
Honest dialogue about afraid to mock

1895
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:18,784
Not here a couple points that I want to make

1896
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:19,552
As it relates

1897
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:22,112
If you believe

1898
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,160
That that's who you're up against

1899
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:26,464
You obviously wouldn't listen to reason

1900
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:30,048
If you truly believe that those are your enemies

1901
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:32,864
It makes sense why you be passionately against

1902
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,912
Yeah and you would be a hero

1903
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:38,240
Yeah like if if you saw the if that was really true

1904
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:40,032
And what he believed were

1905
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:40,800
Was real

1906
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:42,080
Then

1907
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:44,640
I mean yeah all of us who are not fighting

1908
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:46,432
Weird

1909
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:48,992
The worst people alive in many ways complicit

1910
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:49,760
Right

1911
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:53,088
Because one thing

1912
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:54,624
The same way that you know

1913
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,160
However many years the Holocaust

1914
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:56,928
What's going on

1915
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:57,952
There's so many people

1916
01:43:58,464 --> 01:44:03,328
And let me take let me take a step back I do feel a certain amount of guilt

1917
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:05,888
About the fact that sex trafficking

1918
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:10,752
Best in the world

1919
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,336
I could donate to organizations

1920
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:17,920
But I'm living paycheck-to-paycheck

1921
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:22,272
But this is so here's that here's the

1922
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:25,856
I can't remember

1923
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:29,184
But it is something along the lines of

1924
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:30,720
The biggest difference

1925
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:31,744
Liberals income

1926
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:33,536
Always wins

1927
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:35,584
Who wants to

1928
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:37,376
But how they want to

1929
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:39,680
On an individual level

1930
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:42,752
You know you can go to a even the most conservative house Bowl

1931
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:43,520
Household

1932
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:45,312
And my parents live in one of those

1933
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:46,848
Doesn't matter

1934
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:48,384
Gender

1935
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,920
Transvestite whatever

1936
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:51,200
Thought you'll come in Delphia

1937
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:51,968
Pjw

1938
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:54,272
In terms of your overall rights

1939
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:55,552
Not a chance

1940
01:44:56,576 --> 01:44:59,904
Now the argument then is that liberals you know like you and I

1941
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:01,440
We're not going out and

1942
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:03,488
Personally helping any sex traffic

1943
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:06,304
We're not doing that

1944
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,096
We're we're not

1945
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:10,400
We're saying that it's a compliment

1946
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:11,936
Complicated Global problem

1947
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:12,960
That needs to be addressed

1948
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:14,240
Buy an entire Federal

1949
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:16,288
Right and that's where the disconnect

1950
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:17,824
And that's why a lot of

1951
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:18,592
PeopleNet

1952
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:24,224
In order to make it through a dinner delivery

1953
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:27,808
Will likely try and enact legislation

1954
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:31,648
Enforcing plate

1955
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:35,488
It's sincere

1956
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:37,024
It's sincere

1957
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:39,584
Some people f****** monster

1958
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:41,376
There's no way in there

1959
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:42,912
Sorkin

1960
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:48,032
What

1961
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:51,872
Globalist are all pedophiles

1962
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:54,432
And that's who we're fighting again

1963
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:59,552
And it's because not only pedophiles I hate prosperity and

1964
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:02,368
Which is a remarkable 121

1965
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:03,136
Comparison apparel

1966
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:07,232
DIA

1967
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:09,024
This on the bomber note

1968
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:10,560
The other thing that I think

1969
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:11,328
It is important

1970
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:12,864
To remember

1971
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,424
Along those lines

1972
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:17,984
If you believe we are up against

1973
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:19,776
You would be passionate

1974
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:20,544
Italy

1975
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:21,568
On that side

1976
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:26,688
Consider that the person who's telling you that that's who you're up against

1977
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,736
Also believes that they're making

1978
01:46:28,992 --> 01:46:29,760
Chimeras and

1979
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:32,064
Cowbelly

1980
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,904
Also consider all of his other b*******

1981
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:39,744
Consider that he believed that not Y2K

1982
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:40,512
Was going to be

1983
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:41,280
B concentration

1984
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:42,048
Hampton off

1985
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:44,096
Yeah like it's so

1986
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:45,120
Like

1987
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:47,168
I'm at the I'm at the Pointe at

1988
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:50,240
At the end of this episode where I this is about where I had

1989
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:53,056
Turn off the episode today cuz I was like

1990
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:56,384
No no more no more

1991
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:57,664
Because it

1992
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:58,688
It is

1993
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:00,224
We can laugh

1994
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:00,992
And we do

1995
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:07,136
Clip there's parts that are pretty fairly laugh

1996
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:08,928
But the reality is

1997
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:10,208
Either using these tricks

1998
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:12,512
22 full people into passion

1999
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:13,792
Let me get him on his side

2000
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:15,072
And that is

2001
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:16,096
I believe in Act

2002
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:16,864
After propaganda

2003
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,960
What he just did is

2004
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:24,288
Evil so we loop back to your

2005
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:33,760
Yeah but if we come back to the beginning of the episode episode from that moment on

2006
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:35,808
It's just a five-minute clip of Nubian

2007
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:40,160
Check this clip app

2008
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:42,976
January

2009

19

2010
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:46,560
2017 the wife of Alex Jones

Like I said you're listening to this on Friday is doing

2012
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:51,936
In our live broadcast

2013
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:52,960
I can't imagine

2014
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:55,008
Repetitive

2015
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:56,288
Spirit in the Sky

2016
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:57,056
Darkest

2017
01:47:57,568 --> 01:48:00,384
I will be listening to that at work

2018
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:07,040
Maybe we'll have an episode of early next week where I try and talk a little bit about

2019
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:13,440
England by we should have at least one episode next week

2020
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:16,768
Okay and then maybe some more

2021
01:48:17,024 --> 01:48:18,048
With filling gas

2022
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:19,072
But it won't be

2023
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,400
