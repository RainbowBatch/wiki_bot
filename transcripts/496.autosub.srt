1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damned important swetik

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect but knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:33,536
We are the bad guys

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:04,768
Acknowledge

00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,560

00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,352
Jordan

9
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,632
What's up

10
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:15,264
My bright spot

11
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,080
Maybe a little meta

12
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,896
Struggling myself

13
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:26,528
I mean maybe we felt there was some inevitability to its butt

14
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:29,344
At least Spring Court confirmation of Barrett

15
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,368
Not good

16
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,904
Supreme Court

17
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,208
Decision Visa vie

18
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,232
Voting

19
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,512
Not good

20
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:41,120
No no no not not not not good

21
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,936
A lot of dark

22
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:47,520
Dark storm clouds hang hang overhead

23
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:53,408
I'd stuff I think sometimes you think about the these these bright spots

24
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,944
Send coming into an episode

25
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,504
You kind of think it was like well I'd like it

26
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,528
Get to be proportional to

27
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,552
To the dark spot

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,904
I sometimes have to recognize that

29
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,952
If this is about celebrating Little Things

30
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,488
But maybe you're not good enough

31
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:11,072
To make you feel good but

32
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:11,840
Celebrating

33
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,400
Little things in the face of

34
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:20,800
Escape and its back

35
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,080
In my

36
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:22,848
In my gardening

37
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,408
No experience with it at all

38
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
But

39
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,712
I just put some

40
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,760
Cloves of garlic Underground

41
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,344
Under some dirt going to work

42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,184
But yesterday my bag of garlic in there

43
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,536
Yeah there's two little buds growing out of the soil

44
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,840
I really given up on it I thought I'd kiss him

45
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,144
I'm going to workout at night

46
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,240
But then little little protruding that stems

47
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
Was coming out of the ground

48
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,104
So I've got two garlic cloves growing the metaphor for hope

49
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,128
That's what that is

50
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,664
It gave me a little bit of Hope

51
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,968
My next crop of

52
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,504
Pease is coming along well

53
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:05,600
So I can take solace in some of that and I like

54
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,624
Some hope

55
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,952
Spots coming out of the other routine

56
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,256
That's all I got

57
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:18,656
How about you in that same boat

58
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,424
Proportional

59
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,704
The darkness

60
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,288
We've got really good at cooking one rep

61
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
Let me guess

62
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,128
What is it something to do with potatoes

63
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,920
Oh well

64
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,688
Yes I I make the

65
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,272
Different applications

66
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:40,672
I like embroiled samash

67
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,952
You do it all you do do well

68
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,256
We've got these

69
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,792
Okay baby Brock

70
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,608
So we can cook everything like

71
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:53,216
Have you ever successfully cooked everything so that it ended exactly the same time

72
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
No

73
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,752
Right

74
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,032
Like

75
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:00,896
It takes 40 minutes and it takes 20 minutes ago

76
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:05,760
The same time

77
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:09,088
Hot so that this meal that when we started cooking used

78
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:13,696
To take like 3 hours to like crap and all that stuff get it all done in one hour

79
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:17,280
Eat it's fantastic it's great it's a good accomplishment

80
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,191
Team up with

81
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,263

82
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,895
Every time every time

83
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,919

To get that out for a Wednesday and then

92
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,967

Did that

134
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:23,391

142
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,871
Depends on two things W's are vowels no

143
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
That's not

144
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,431
It's not even that sometimes

145
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,711
I think it is

146
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,735

147
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,783

W's are sometimes about

There's no reason for it

172
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:42,143
If you was available then double that is two vowels that it's the only thing that makes sense

173
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,423
Done

She's been gracing us with her benevolence but she belongs

192
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:35,135
With you I don't know her name but perhaps she will tell you so we've got to figure out a name for this Raptor

193
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,159
Princess

194
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,439
And then

195
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,743
Also Miriam sent and also

196
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:44,863
C'ville Charlottesville sticker

197
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,911
Sticker for the Blue Ridge abortion fund

198
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,983
And I wanted to take this opportunity to

199
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,799
I just

200
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,335
Reproductive health

201
00:10:54,591 --> 00:11:00,735
Organizations 100% made a donation in the Raptor princesses name to the Blue Ridge

202
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,295
But in this in this trying time

203
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,599
I particularly uncertain

204
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,623
About where

205
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,415
Things are going

206
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,719
Those are organizations that are definitely going to

207
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,999
To need all of us

208
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,279
What's the Step Up

209
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,071
Support as best we can

210
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,095
I'm so

211
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,911
Thank you Miriam for the Raptor princess

212
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,447
It is on the Shelf

213
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:27,103
That's not going to be its permanent home we'll find a better place to put a

214
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,383
Put on one of the plants

215
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,663
To put it on one of the plants

216
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,687
Yeah

217
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,967
Two princesses don't ride play

218
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,759
Do not

219
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,319
Arabic lime quinoa

220
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,135
We start here on the 20

221
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,671
Second episode

222
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,255
Doctor / 22nd

223
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,071
Alex is swimming a good amount of time

224
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,631
On this episode

225
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,679
He's doing quite a bit of it but

226
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,495
Unfortunately none of it is to You Belong To The City

227
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,127
But he starts off the show with American band

228
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:07,039
Because we are an American band we are America

229
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:13,439
I should say that this ism

230
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,231
Minute into the rant

231
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,279
The first minute was not worth it

232
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,839
This just know that this is

233
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,655
If we're starting

234
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:29,055
Remind we're coming to your town or country

235
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:35,455
1776 worldwide

236
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:41,855
We want to see little stars with us

237
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:48,255
America Detroit

238
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:53,887
America

239
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,447
Really

240
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:02,591
God's plan America isn't in Revelations America's Adventure

241
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:06,431
Paralyzed

242
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,711
Oh boy okay

243
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,527
That took a turn

244
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,319
Seventh seal

245
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,391
Bald Eagle Road from the

246
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,719
Depths to bring Hell Fire upon the wicked

247
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,023
Interesting

248
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
Twist

249
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,095
Like just sort of

250
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,399
Yeah formulaic

251
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:31,519
Not saying anything meaningless Ranch over a dumb rock song

252
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:36,895
Into hey America is actually really in the Bible

253
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,479
Alright why don't you do an episode about that

254
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,759
Anyway Alex

255
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,039
Skip the talking about how like

256
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
Masks

257
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,367
Right

258
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,135
Sure

259
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
Bad

260
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,951
Of course

261
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,255
Alex knows this

262
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
Casinos the masks

263
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,839
Right and he knows that everyone else

264
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:02,239
Kind of knows that tooth they just need permission from someone else to be like and that someone is Alex of course it is

265
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,799
He convinces people

266
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,335
And gives them this permission

267
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,359
Should take off their masks

268
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,151
It seems from his neck

269
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,943
Text clip that mostly it's women

270
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:15,039
And mostly the technique that uses might be called sexual harassment

271
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,599
I'll be sitting there in a legal meaning

272
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
I'll be sitting there

273
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,903
Are at a store

274
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,511
And I'm like you don't need that mask

275
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,815
I know it's a fraud

276
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
The time

277
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,959
Particularly young attractive women

278
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,591
You

279
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,639
You

280
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,735
You mask

281
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,039
I get some form and I just so you know where those bad

282
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,599
Well they kind of make it still doesn't want you take them off

283
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,903
You know what's a frog you know what's a lie

284
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
We just have to do that

285
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,095
That didn't happen

286
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,935
Is imagining sexually harassed

287
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,751
Why is it

288
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:10,079
For somebody who won't shut up about God whenever he talks

289
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,663
Do other human beings in his own stories he sounds exactly like the devil

290
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:22,111
That mask you are very beautiful

291
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:26,719
He might as well be a serpent in his stories

292
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,023
It's strange it's strange

293
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,119
I take some solace in knowing that this didn't happen

294
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,911
Feels like a very weird

295
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
Gross

296
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:42,079
Yeah I'm still hurting for the fake women

297
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,199
Alex's on this tip talk about this a bit in the past

298
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
Confusing

299
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,599
He seems to be putting forth the idea that you can't get sick

300
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,135
Unless you have

301
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,463
Vitamin and mineral deficiencies which is not true

302
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,791
Fine with it is just

303
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,119
Science and medical advice

304
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,959
If it weren't for the fact that he specifically cells supplements

305
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,519
There is

306
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,567
Vitamin D zinc

307
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,615
And end as much

308
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,663
As he does sell those things

309
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,455
When part of his narrative is that

310
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
You can't get

311
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,271
Sick if you have these things

312
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:26,111
Yeah you should draw from those two

313
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:31,487
Ideas that he presents his products will keep you from getting sick

314
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:37,887
You can't go sick if you take the supplements that I have therefore it is a prevention for all sickness

315
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,423
Yeah basically

316
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,703
That's bad

317
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,031
Articles

318
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,567
I just want to say again

319
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,919
People don't get malnutrition

320
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
You're going to die of a cold

321
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,479
Pneumonia

322
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,063
Cheilosis

323
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,671
Homeless have Hollows door closest just cuz they

324
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,231
Almost

325
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,023
Drugs

326
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,071
Gas station food

327
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,119
I can draw that are sleeping outside

328
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,655
And their bodies are

329
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:16,799
Malnutrition can definitely be an aspect of what makes people experiencing homelessness more susceptible to catching TBH

330
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:22,687
But it's far from what experts believe is the largest factor that makes incidence of the condition much higher in that community

331
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,247
According to the World Health Organization quote

332
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:31,135
The majority of TB cases in urban homeless populations are attributable to ongoing Transmission in shelter

333
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:38,047
Do the factors that affect the community more than the house population is that they generally have less access to healthcare

334
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:41,631
Haley find themselves sheltered in Far More densely populated units

335
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:45,983
Beyond that because they have no permanent address and often no reliable way to

336
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,519
To find or contact them

337
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,079
When someone does test positive for TB it's

338
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,127
Incredibly challenging for healthcare workers

339
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,407
The trace their contacts

340
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,431
And get a jump on

341
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,199
Containment

342
00:17:55,455 --> 00:18:00,831
Alex wants this to be a simple issue of the higher rate of TV being a result of simple choices these people make

343
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:05,183
Biggity B because they eat gas station food and do drugs that's kind of their fault

344
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,463
But that's nonsense

345
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:10,303
Through much of my early twenties I ate gas station Food and Drug

346
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:17,215
There are realities to the lives of people experiencing homelessness deal with are the result of our society choosing not to invest in making sure

347
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,263
I'm sure their lives are healthier or easier

348
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,591
The resource allocation issue that our leaders don't seem to want to fix

349
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,175
A people like Alex it's easier to blame the people who are struggling

350
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,223
Because to do anything else would require him

351
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,527
To give up on his childish opposition to anything

352
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,831
It sounds kind of like collectivism

353
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,135
That's just sad

354
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,487
I find it very interesting that you can have a state

355
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
Then

356
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,535
Like followed up

357
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,351
The results of that statement not like

358
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,655
What you think it's just because they're homeless

359
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:53,311
It's because they're eating gas station food it's because they're in the middle of the street is cuz they're doing drugs is cuz of all the

360
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,127
Things that you do as a result of being homeless

361
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,919
It's not like it's a

362
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,711
It's

363
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:04,063
Single has no effect on you just don't have a homie are you

364
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,855
Can still go to a restaurant right

365
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,671
That's no problem shirt and then I mean if

366
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:14,047
You think about it like what would his solution to tuberculosis among the people experiencing homelessness

367
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:17,119
Like what would what would the solution be get rid of gas

368
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,447
The only way to keep gas station food

369
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,263
Precinct Precinct 4 off

370
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
Right

371
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,591
So Alex has a big news

372
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,663
And as we know sometimes when he has big news

373
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,247
So he can't get on his show and do his show

374
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,063
He decided to do is show this

375
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,623
But he also has big nose that almost

376
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,391
Made it to eco.

377
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,159
Michelle

378
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,695
This is so big

379
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
Okay

380
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,815
Because of this

381
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,911
Looking fish

382
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,191
And I'm just like

383
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,031
Real journalists are like

384
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,823
Real journalist

385
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,687
Call Udo Udo I can replace you get the proof

386
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,735
You show it to people you document

387
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,783
I don't have the money

388
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,951
Something somebody said

389
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,975
Anime

390
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,743
They just ripped

391
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:26,495
Wow mascot to Alex complaining about Keith Olbermann

392
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,775
YouTube channel

393
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:34,175
To Alex saying something Bill Maher joke about 3 years ago

394
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,223
Goal of all left-wing people

395
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:42,879
I've got someone whose proof is always a lieutenant colonel

396
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:47,999
Or heard something that you literally what you just said

397
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,047
They hear something and then they repeat it

398
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,327
That's all you do

399
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,631
That's a slap

400
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,911
100 Verde

401
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,471
It's a little rude

402
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,495
It's a little road

403
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,031
Now if that was

404
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,079
Sort of Alex misrepresenting

405
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,383
Reality this next clip

406
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,407
Way worse

407
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,455
My biggest frustration

408
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:12,575
We have a small media organization

409
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,952
And as soon as I hire somebody in Training Day

410
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,488
No work somewhere else

411
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,512
Which is fine

412
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,536
Happens all the time

413
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,328
I mean this sincerely I can

414
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,912
Can't think of a single Infowars employee who's gone on to bigger and better things

415
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:31,264
Most of them just disappear into private life like Lee Ann McAdoo or

416
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,080
Jakari Jackson but the ones who try to keep going

417
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,360
Typically follow the path

418
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,664
Of getting poached Ramallah kill

419
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:43,808
Yeah Joe Biggs who Alex at the fire to save face but pizzagate who's now a high-profile member of The Proud boys

420
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,648
Which I would not consider an improvement

421
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,440
Probably

422
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:56,096
They're people like Rob Jacobson or Josh Owens and talked about how full of s*** Alex is an owl

423
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,376
Awful it is to work there

424
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:04,032
Millie Weaver got fired after she put out shadowgate which kind of insinuated that Rodger Stone was involved with the players that were created

425
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:04,800
Eating internet-based

426
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
False flag

427
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:12,480
Cousin Buckley is gone but he's not a big media figure that's probably

428
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,296
Doberman

429
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:19,904
Account because he used to work for Infowars but he work for like Newsmax before that

430
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,744
Get a big career in like he's at the Swift boat and a****** before that

431
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,304
And also he hates Alex now in Sudan

432
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,352
I don't know there's nobody

433
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:34,752
Here's what I do to ever worked it enforces been poached by anyone because literally everyone in the media understands that

434
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,544
Infowars is a stupid organization

435
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,848
And that anyone who would decide to work there

436
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,640
Sweetly unemployable

437
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,432
No one's getting poached

438
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,968
Yeah well here's my theory

439
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,992
On this

440
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:45,760
What he think

441
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,784
This is getting

442
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,904
Is all of the people who work in his audio and all of the

443
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,696
Cortical researches and all that

444
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,488
Stop right there

445
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,256
18 years old

446
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:01,120
They get about 8 months of experience and after f****** up everything that they can f****** on Alex

447
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,984
Yeah or they like they're behind the scenes

448
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,032
They they like they've never been

449
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,616
Publicly seen as an elderly knows right and they're like

450
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:15,200
I got to get out before someone knows I work here

451
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,808
Pixie look behind-the-scenes people but if you or if you take

452
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,576
Just be

453
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,624
In front of camera tablet

454
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,648
No.

455
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,256
Most of the people that work for Infowars Alex has to pretend he doesn't know

456
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:31,840
Never met him

457
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:39,264
Nevermind. Listen I don't get into I don't get into that stuff

458
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,848
I have no I've never even

459
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:48,736
Doug Biggs is one simple assault away from having never met Alex

460
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,016
That's what's going to happen a boy

461
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,064
Anyway this big news

462
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,880
I would say it's a dud

463
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:58,720
This is a source known directly

464
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,120
By individuals employed here

465
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,192
What you say different

466
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,984
Stratasys the security

467
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,360
Darren was a security guard for a week

468
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,992
Chilling in the nursing home

469
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,856
Multiple balance sometimes for a piece

470
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,184
Everybody's getting

471
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,488
Women are getting them

472
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,304
And almost all of them are

473
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,584
Registered what

474
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,912
Democrats

475
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,520
How's it going

476
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,800
Yeah how do you know that

477
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,344
Learned about this a week ago didn't talk about it on the show now you taking us because he's got another sore

478
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:00,160
I should have reported that last week

479
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,976
Then I can report it again now or something

480
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:07,328
Anyway Alex has another source on this

481
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:11,168
Means anything alright

482
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,240
I have a separate individual come here this morning

483
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,616
And he's showing me the evidence of this

484
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,712
This person you know works in the city of Austin they don't get in trouble

485
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:28,320
You're going to get more Travelers on a country song just like

486
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,112
Just get me copies of the ballet

487
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:38,560
Somebody else's ballot

488
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,912
What planets are on both of them

489
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,960
Eminem established stealing amount

490
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,800
It's open-and-shut it's going on

491
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,408
Guarantee I call the FBI knows going to

492
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,176
Yeah probably

493
00:25:55,712 --> 00:26:01,856
You know I don't know just give me copies of ballots whenever you know it

494
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:06,976
Really serious federal crime when people are paying more attention than ever in the end of the world

495
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,560
I can understand Alex's desire to create fear in his audience of

496
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:14,912
Conspiracies about voting but this one is a bit offensive and honestly kind of ageist

497
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,824
Alex is trying to create the image that at these assisted living facilities the nefarious staff for stealing old folks pallets in prison

498
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,360
But using them to vote for Biden

499
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,432
Typically this is not how any of this works

500
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:33,088
According to a fact sheet released by equip for equality in many cases in-person absentee voting event

501
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,136
It's will be organized at Assisted Living Center

502
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:38,720
If that happens at least two election judges

503
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,536
One from each political party will come to the nursing home

504
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:44,352
The Friday Saturday Sunday or Monday before Alexa

505
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,888
Sunday and supervise the voting

506
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,496
When mrs. Your vote has to be collected by the election judge in order for it to be counted

507
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,568
Anyone who's an assisted-living can request an ABS

508
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,336
Santee palette

509
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,896
If you do that you can return it in person

510
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,456
And then obviously you're handing it over to the voting

511
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,248
Authorities or we can do it by mail

512
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,344
However if you get assistance in filling out that ballot which you can

513
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,392
From anybody who you decide

514
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,440
Is a qualified person to help you

515
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:12,512
The person helping you must sign the envelopes

516
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,048
Stating that they assisted you

517
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:17,120
Failure to do so would be a huge problem

518
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:21,472
Some states have laws that bar medical staff from assisting people with voting

519
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:25,056
That does present a challenge since visitation is limited in nursing homes due to

520
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:25,824
The Coronavirus

521
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,872
This is not an issue that no one is aware of

522
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,456
What's going on here is that Alex is creating conspiracy out of

523
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,248
Complaining about the wrong thing

524
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:38,368
The real issue that should be addressed as how even without a virus and play

525
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,392
There are hurdles

526
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,672
What's the defective voting access

527
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,952
For people who are in a c

528
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,720
Assisted Living

529
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,536
There are laws that require access to voting but

530
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,328
These are not perfectly followed

531
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,888
And some folks do end up getting disenfranchised

532
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:55,520
There's a definite problem that exists with propublica citing a Medicare receiving complaints

533
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:59,872
From 55 nursing homes between 2018 and 2019 where residence quote

534
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:03,456
Said they weren't given the opportunity to vote or we're unable to get help

535
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,480
Casting a ballot

536
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:08,064
This is real and it affects a real people have a right to vote

537
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,600
I don't want to be the message

538
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:14,976
To be that it's not fair for the elderly to vote if they vote Democrat because that must mean that someone's manipulate

539
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,512
That meant the voting that way

540
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,304
Let me go to the conclusion of his logic

541
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,656
Because that elderly people shouldn't have the right to vote because they're too impressionable or something

542
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:25,216
If you wants to make that argument he's welcome

543
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,496
Do but I would love to

544
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,032
To see how he would try and pull that off

545
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,568
As its band

546
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:33,408
He's ignoring the real issues surrounding voting rights and assisted living

547
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,968
While creating a fake version the benefits in politically

548
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,040
It's the same thing as with the TV nonsense

549
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:43,904
The answer is pretty clear when you consult people who understand the issues with the answer is something that

550
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,696
Compatible with Alex's worldview

551
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:51,072
Making progress in terms of TBH in the unhoused population requires investment and resource commit

552
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,096
Which either gets

553
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,168
Ensuring that everyone in Assisted Living has access to

554
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,472
Secure voting requires money resources

555
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:00,032
Probably some federal regulations analysis against

556
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,056
All of that

557
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,592
His world is no solution

558
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,872
Cancel B's actual problem

559
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:07,200
But you knows how to profit from the continuing of the

560
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,016
So that's what you do that's how this operates in

561
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,296
Got a boring yep

562
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,320
Yeah

563
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,112
It is very unproductive

564
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:14,880
It sucks

565
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,416
Making up

566
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,952
Terrible plans

567
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,488
That would never work

568
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,304
And getting people all scared of them

569
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,840
Will allow you to

570
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,144
Seedat very good plans

571
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,936
That have been in place to dissing

572
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,216
Enfranchise voters

573
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,752
Well this is the

574
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:34,080
It's a real bummer jangly key that

575
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,920
Amount of attention away from the real issues

576
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,456
Expect I should be addressed

577
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:44,064
No. I would say that the plans that Alex comes up with for his villains

578
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:48,160
Very bad blister always like

579
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,440
Very childish and dumb

580
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,768
Now the plans he comes up with for himself

581
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,072
Downright

582
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:59,424
Very illegal

583
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,472
And so I told these folks I said

584
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,496
Just go out

585
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,312
What you got to do

586
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,848
Go over there

587
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,920
Nursing home myself

588
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,712
The interview

589
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,576
Sneak into a nurse

590
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,072
You've seen me sneak into a secret billionaire

591
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:29,376
Buckfast

592
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,144
Sequel

593
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,448
30 years later nursing home

594
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:38,848
Imagine Alex biega like put down on wires

595
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,432
We need to whisper

596
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:46,528
Otherwise it will be why does everybody lies everybody here.

597
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,552
Is like

598
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,088
The king of

599
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,112
Self

600
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:50,880
Mike

601
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:54,208
I picture him basically being like someone in an assassin

602
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:05,728
The Watergate burglars wouldn't have gotten caught

603
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,568
The door open

604
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,872
I want to commit crimes

605
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,920
So Alex has a pretty

606
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:18,016
And here that's that's going to be named the winner of the election in the van

607
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,296
Stock market

608
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,648
Sure

609
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,696
The mediator

610
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,936
And this is a disaster by Design

611
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:38,752
During that they're going to plunge the stock market

612
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,288
Uncertainty about America

613
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,152
7000

614
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,968
10000 blue drop that f******

615
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,528
What is 1020

616
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,344
He's going to be everybody lined up

617
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,880
Trump

618
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,464
Turn the stock market back on

619
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,352
. and they're going to kill the dollar

620
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,120
And then

621
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,448
A leftist won't remember they did this

622
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:13,312
Honestly Alex's just describing a funhouse mirror version of what could happen if

623
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,080
Biden win

624
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:18,432
Alex is creating false intentions and causation for things that could

625
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:25,088
Totally for instance no matter what there's a very good chance that we will not know on Election Day who is one

626
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,184
It's just the reality of how things work when there is such high levels of advanced and apps

627
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:29,952
Cindy voting which

628
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:35,328
Can't be counted until election day in many States including Ohio Pennsylvania

629
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:38,144
Which combine to represent 38 electoral votes

630
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,424
Some States live

631
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,032
Logistically could have difficulty having an accurate count by Tuesday evening

632
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:47,104
Probably many of them and that isn't suspicious

633
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,384
Alex has made its

634
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,712
Suspicious and by making the delay part of the globalist

635
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,480
Playing witch

636
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,248
Makes no sense

637
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,296
The next layer is the stock

638
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,928
It's very possible that the market could take a dip regardless of who's in the lead during the. Between the Alexa

639
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,464
Turn on the certification of the results

640
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,256
That stretch could be Rocky

641
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:08,096
Because of the uncertainty represents with investors not knowing which way to place

642
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:15,264
The Articles I've read it feels like investors are really aware of this Dynamic and many of hedged appropriately

643
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,544
So it's possible 2 p.m.

644
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,872
Ability won't be nearly as severe as it could be but there might be a dip

645
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,176
This is a natural market reaction

646
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:25,248
But Alex's preemptively characterize this as the globalist

647
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,528
Painting the stock market

648
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:30,624
Holding it hostage only to be let free if Biden is installed as president

649
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:34,976
Of course if there is a period of uncertainty and then Biden is declared the winner

650
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:38,048
That one of these stabilizing effect on the market which

651
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:38,816
Alex is trying

652
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,608
To get his audience to experience

653
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:44,192
As the globalists letting the market come back because they got their way

654
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:48,032
The elements of this narrative that Alex is building

655
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:48,800
Possible thing

656
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,592
Sensationalized quite a bit

657
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,640
14

658
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,920
And giving it

659
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,200
Completely fictional Conte

660
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,016
This is one of the big ways that Alex

661
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:05,184
Pretty good chance that there could be Market instability at the end of this year and it's likely that this instability could be worse

662
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,208
The longer the elect

663
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,232
Action is undecided

664
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:11,328
However as Jessica Rave the co-founder of datatrek research told

665
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,608
Cmpc quote

666
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,632
Long-lasting it's

667
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:18,752
Significant volatility usually stems from an economic shock as opposed to politically related issues

668
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,800
Experience of assure

669
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:23,616
Volatility can be exploited by people like Alex

670
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,896
If they're able to

671
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,688
Contextualize it ahead of time

672
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,736
And then he was being right about the

673
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,272
Prediction of that volatility

674
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,832
To pretend to be right about the context

675
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,112
They ascribe to it

676
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,160
Put simply Alex could be

677
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,464
Fairly accurate in his prediction that there might be Market

678
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,768
It drop so though obviously not as big as he saying

679
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,072
In the period when the election is undecided

680
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,632
And then when the winner is named things will settle down

681
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:52,032
He could be completely right about that and it would not prove that at all that he was right about the globalist holding the stock market Haas

682
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,080
Message in order to force Trump out and get Biden

683
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,896
That's just complete nonsense that he's imagining

684
00:34:57,152 --> 00:35:00,480
But he's going to give himself the appearance of being right about

685
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,504
Should be

686
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,784
More basic

687
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
Prediction

688
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,600
Turn out to be correct

689
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,160
The Sun is going to go up tomorrow

690
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,696
And it's because you master

691
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:13,280
That's not the way it works

692
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:16,352
Very simple but essentially the same game

693
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,400
Yeah

694
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:23,008
If you kind of understand that trick a little bit and you listen to show

695
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:23,776
Critically

696
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,312
You'll see it come up quite a

697
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,848
Sirius B

698
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,408
You know being correct

699
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,432
What about something

700
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,200
That's

701
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,224
Trivial

702
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,016
Maybe even likely

703
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:40,160
Haha contact about a prediction that has been written about exhaustively for the patio

704
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:44,768
Year-and-a-half to the point where it's a notable phenomenon

705
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,560
The hedging and the protection

706
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,888
But investors are looking into for the end of this year

707
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,544
Yeah it's investing it's like a people say stuff

708
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,896
Politics influence investment choices now it's like

709
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:04,736
What are you doing everybody going to die

710
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,880
I think this is probably less of that amongst now I'm pretty sure

711
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,160
And they were all screaming

712
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,952
Look my friend

713
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,512
There's one thing that you will find at the New York Stock

714
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:19,328
But you won't find Alex's face

715
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,864
Another mask

716
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,400
I was thinking to wear that mask

717
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,448
Do Alex just wear the mask

718
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,776
You know it will be over soon it'll never be over

719
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,824
Bill Gates

720
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:32,384
Because the mass of the symbol of idiocy

721
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,968
Big studies

722
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:44,160
Bill Gates said that it may take a decade to get back to

723
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:47,744
To the point we reached in terms of economic development in the developing world

724
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:54,400
He wasn't saying that Alex would have to wear a mask for 10 years or even at the coronavirus pandemic last close to that long just a Thursday

725
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,960
Laxative happened is the world response to a crisis

726
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:00,288
And that realistically could take a long time to get back to where we were

727
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,848
Alex is just completely lying about what Bill Gates

728
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,616
Set

729
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:06,176
As for this idea that there were studies showing masks

730
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,456
Said spread disease

731
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,480
Don't let interest

732
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,248
I would be

733
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,064
In a very preliminary search

734
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,880
She can find a meta-analysis conducted back in May

735
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,160
That sound quote

736
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,696
Protective effect

737
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,232
Does wearing masks were

738
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,024
Do cluster-randomized trial

739
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,048
An observational

740
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:22,816
No studies

741
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,120
You can find a ton of studies that's set out to sea

742
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,144
See if there's an effectiveness

743
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,448
Difference between varying types of masks

744
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,472
So if you want

745
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,544
To make an argument that a cloth mask isn't as good as like a medical mask

746
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,824
Maybe you could do that but

747
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,872
I struggled to find the sort of thing that Alex

748
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,664
To be talkin about

749
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:43,040
As I always do the last resort I tried to find the article on Alex's on website

750
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:46,880
And those that web pages damn near unnavigable I was able to

751
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,160
To find what I think he's talking

752
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,000
There was a study that was released back on September 11th it's getting

753
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:58,400
Subtraction of the right-wing media right now and there was a recent story on Breitbart that Alex's reposted on his

754
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:03,264
The headline is quote CDC study 85% of coronavirus patients

755
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,544
Reported wearing masks

756
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,824
Always or off

757
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:11,712
Even this isn't a misinterpretation of a study it still isn't bombshell

758
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:18,112
As has been made clear over and over again wearing a mask is a less about protecting yourself and more about protecting those around you

759
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:18,880
In the case

760
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,648
If you are sick

761
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,928
Can possibly unaware

762
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,744
The article on Infowars is arguing against a straw man

763
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:26,048
They're claiming that the study shows that Max

764
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,352
Sirenis active in stopping the wearer from getting

765
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,400
King sake which is not the claim that anyone is making

766
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:37,312
I don't think most people would be as offended by antemasque people is wearing a mask was strictly about protecting oneself

767
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,360
It's the part about how wearing a mask is

768
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:42,432
To protect those around you that makes me whole I won't wear one thing

769
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,968
Kingsley really f***** up and child

770
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
Anyway

771
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,600
This study does show that you can catch the coronavirus even if you wear a mask

772
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:53,440
But I'm using the gotcha so I decided to look closer at the study to see what else

773
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,208
Set

774
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:58,048
The findings of this study was there

775
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,840
They were largely overlooked

776
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,864
Because what they said what

777
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:01,888
Just what you'd expect

778
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:08,800
For instance they found the quote quote close contact with one or more persons with known covid-19 was reported by 4

779
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,080
42% of case page

780
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,640
Compared with 14% of control protest

781
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,200
That's not shocking at all

782
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:19,040
They also found that these patients were more likely than

783
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:23,392
Control participants to have dined at a restaurant or gone to a bar in the previous two weeks

784
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,160
Oh yeah that would make

785
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:28,768
These were the two main findings and their data but the study itself makes clear their large.

786
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:31,072
Limitations to the day that they were able to gather

787
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:36,192
And it might not be a perfectly representative sample of the larger population for a number of reasons

788
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:39,008
This study or no way proves that wearing masks

789
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,288
Spreads disease

790
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,384
And if you're going to take anything from it it should be the dining venues are going to be

791
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,408
Particular challenge

792
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,176
What's the reopening

793
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,712
Ana contact tracing

794
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,736
Critical

795
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,784
You can do if you were exposed to someone who tests

796
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,576
The positive and then behave accordingly

797
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:53,856
Those things

798
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:58,720
Seem like productive ways to interpret this information making up b******* about mask spreading disease

799
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,768
What's up

800
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,840
I think there is something to be said for like wearing masks being like

801
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,888
Possibly harmful if you don't wash

802
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,728
Sure but that's the same as clothes

803
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:14,080
That's that already think it's a bad idea

804
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,104
Okay

805
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,872
How about this

806
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:16,640
How about that

807
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
Here's my picture

808
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,968
Alright we get a licensing system

809
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,248
For being allowed

810
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,016
To say

811
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,040
This is what a study

812
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:26,112
You know Alexa

813
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,696
16 you also have to take a critical thinking skills

814
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,536
And you get license and then you can but you have to wait till you're like

815
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,816
30 and you get license

816
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:38,400
And then you can talk about studies as if you know what they're talkin about ideally we should

817
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:42,240
Just incorporate that into education you would think but I want to go with us I want a license

818
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:48,640
I want another piece of government ID like conservatives are going to call this red tape

819
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:53,248
Bureaucracy study about

820
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,552
Hey man look bad

821
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,576
Doctors wear masks

822
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:01,184
Yeah but it's not fair that the symbol of idiocy idiocy

823
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,488
Pictures of stupid when they're doing surgeries

824
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,512
Not about like

825
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,280
Protecting

826
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,560
Patience from

827
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,096
Van with them from the page

828
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,632
Sure no no no

829
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:13,472
There's another reason they don't want to smell your blood

830
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,776
Throwing up

831
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,104
Okay

832
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,920
Let's just about smell is bad smell in your blood

833
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,456
Don't smell their blood

834
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,528
What's the point of having

835
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,552
History

836
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:31,136
What's the point of having science if Alex can say stuff like

837
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,952
Doctor sperm after they don't want to smell your blood

838
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:34,976
What are you

839
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:40,096
Talking about Borat

840
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,400
Is back

841
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:48,800
I have not yet seen Borat to I probably will watch it eventually

842
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:50,848
Borat

843
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:57,247
He hates us Baron Cohen Court believes that he works with the abl to control the world he's the closest thing to Hitler there is

844
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,039
What is particularly mad

845
00:41:59,295 --> 00:41:59,807
Because

846
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:00,831
Rudy Giuliani

847
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,879
I got caught in a

848
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,647
And I'm not great

849
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,951
Situation

850
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:13,631
Perving on an underage girl thing to the point where Sacha Baron Cohen ran back in because he was like I don't want to actually

851
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,655
Delicia crime here

852
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:21,055
That's one way to look at it I haven't watched the whole movie but

853
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,591
I've seen the clip that was released

854
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,919
The argument that Alex is going to

855
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,687
To try to make

856
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:33,087
I bet he can sell me on it and they told her I Rudy was a break

857
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:39,487
Taking the filming in that they needed to take the Mike outs when he was going into his pants suit

858
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:45,375
Call boy choosing to ignore the part where the

859
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,143
Fake

860
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:50,751
15 year old girl invites Rudy into the bedroom for a drink

861
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,031
How do you say

862
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,663
It's clear with hacked that's what happened

863
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,431
I look

864
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,991
I can't say raw footage

865
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,527
B Sharp

866
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,855
Good

867
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:08,159
It doesn't look good no it looks very crying

868
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:10,207
So instead of dealing with this

869
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:10,975
Head on

870
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,999
Alex decide

871
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:15,839
Let's talk about the time that when Sacha Baron Cohen was making

872
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,607
Bruno

873
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,423
Ron Paul into a

874
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,215
Into a hotel room

875
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,751
And then took off his pants

876
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:26,847
And then especially the hotel

877
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,127
And Sao

878
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,431
The lights are broken

879
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,039
Please come in here and wait

880
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,575
There's no chairs

881
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,367
Are the bed

882
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,415
You sit on the bed

883
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,999
He comes

884
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,279
Lock the door

885
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:51,167
You know that was Louis c.k.

886
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:51,935
His

887
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,471
If he was lucky

888
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:55,775
Almost

889
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,055
Punchable face I'll talk

890
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,711
The point is is that

891
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:09,087
What's going on in a hotel room

892
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:11,135
How to do drop his drawers

893
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,207
A song

894
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,791
I'm out the door

895
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,679
Homophobic

896
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:30,847
Wow

897
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,151
I went back and I re-watched

898
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:36,991
That clip from Bruno because I didn't remember remember that

899
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:40,063
Those are not the words that Ron Paul uses

900
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,111
What is Alex's worth

901
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,391
Okay so Alec

902
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,463
Did Alex escalated from there

903
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:50,559
From Ron Paul's reaction to me Bruno taking off his pants

904
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,839
You know it's a just

905
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:56,703
Can't wait to show you how racist and homophobic and everything they are

906
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,471
It's interesting

907
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,495
It just can't wait

908
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,823
So yeah sure

909
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,663
Why Alex has a fake version here of what happened with Rudy

910
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,455
I miss it

911
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:08,991
Just sad

912
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,295
Rizzo Rizzo Kayleen

913
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,831
He goes to take the mic

914
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:14,879
Put your back

915
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:15,647
Parker your side

916
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,767
Do not pull your stuff.

917
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,535
How to get it

918
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:26,399
And the minute Giuliani goes to do that

919
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:31,775
Freeman

920
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,871
There's a criminal frama

921
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:38,943
Alex

922
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,223
Allen alright

923
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:42,783
Alex Rudy Giuliani is a f******

924
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,551
Terrifying

925
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,343
We all knew

926
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,647
I didn't mean

927
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:51,231
Sacha Baron Cohen said like it's f***** up that I see it

928
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:53,279
Like I needed

929
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:57,119
Like what what did you think was going to happen

930
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:00,959
It's questionable to agree to an interview with a fifth

931
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,495
18 year old in a hotel room

932
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:06,079
Like what I just bats

933
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:06,847
Decision

934
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,127
Alone

935
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:08,895
Iffy

936
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:11,199
If you're especially if you're Rudy Giuliani

937
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,247
That choice

938
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,039
Is something that I think

939
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:16,575
Is

940
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,343
Is dicey

941
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:21,695
And then to behave in the way that they've shown even before

942
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,975
Putting hand in pants

943
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:26,559
Paving the way that it appeared that he was behaving

944
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:30,143
Is another level of

945
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,679
Sounds good

946
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,215
Wow

947
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,495
That is pathetic

948
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,287
It is that's really sad

949
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:40,127
Is there what's not said though is Alex's initiative

950
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:42,175
Alex is a guy

951
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,455
Phuket

952
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,735
S***.

953
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,015
And you know that

954
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:48,319
Because he'll have

955
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,087

956
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,135

Popa.cr by real happy

998
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:35,327
Go visit the nursing home with your dog

999
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:38,655
No visitor and see if there's a

1000
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,959
Then rub

1001
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:41,727

Tumi

1003
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:50,175
Like if you have business to be at Center like if you have a family member there

1004
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:55,807
Go on an investigative Mission with your dog as cover

1005
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:56,831

1006
00:48:57,087 --> 00:49:00,671

Also what are we doing

1008
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,279
Just call call and ask

1009
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:07,327
It would be unfortunate if Alex like

1010
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,095
I mean look

1011
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,911
I don't think anybody to send bad tips

1012
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:16,799
To that email address holy not need two tons of dumb s***

1013
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:18,847
You guys would

1014
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:25,247
Think that you are coming up with something that's so dumb there's no way and info Warrior would actually do it

1015
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,015
And you are

1016
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,319
Wrong you are wrong

1017
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,087
You can't prank

1018
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:33,695
The prank no matter what any of our listeners could come up with to send it

1019
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,231
The f*** with him like

1020
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,535
It won't be any sillier visit

1021
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:40,351
Unreality

1022
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:43,167
Reality is going to out surreal you

1023
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:47,263
The Royal back Alex was feeling real bad money was tight

1024
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,055
Hey

1025
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,847
He thought like a man

1026
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,383
Going down

1027
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,407
Yes all over

1028
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,711
View my last episode

1029
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,735
But I'm not going to release

1030
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:01,343
My last episode

1031
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:07,999
I said it'll be there when I go off are whenever they come and get me I'll have my last episode

1032
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:14,399
Was really hoping we we speculated that would be the way he ends his show forever secret last episode

1033
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:16,703
Put on his actual last episode

1034
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:19,775
That would be great

1035
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:23,359
I thought about last week for our show on

1036
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,895
This could be our last show

1037
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:28,991
What would I say on my way

1038
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:32,319
Show called my last show ever

1039
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,343
That's election

1040
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:39,743
? also next Tuesday next Tuesday on some whatever day is happening

1041
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:44,095
I'm going to do my last show ever

1042
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,631
What a f***

1043
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,399
Can a soul

1044
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,935
I hope he doesn't

1045
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:50,751
I just want to throw tomatoes at it

1046
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:53,567
I thought I would find that computer chip in a homeless man

1047
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,847
I would find that

1048
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:55,615
Tubi

1049
00:50:56,383 --> 00:51:01,759
Maybe kind of a fun kind of trolling on his partner on Election Day to do his fake

1050
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,367
So Alex Goes to calls

1051
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:11,743
The whole show is going to be all wall-to-wall calls

1052
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,023
Does that gets calls

1053
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:13,791
Quite a while

1054
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:16,863
And this caller wants to pray

1055
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,727
Unfortunately

1056
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,775
And I'm going to piggyback off

1057
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:27,103
The last color you had

1058
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,639
And I'm going to pray

1059
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:29,663
That's all right with you

1060
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,199
Go brother

1061
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,223
Lie with me

1062
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:35,551
Lord. God creator and master of the universe

1063
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:37,855
And your son's name is Sheila Emmanuelle

1064
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:42,463
By the we pray that your will be done on Earth as it is in heaven

1065
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:45,535
Your will include making your enemies your footstool

1066
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,167
Leslie will surely face

1067
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:57,567
So we got more callers calling in and praying for vengeance and punishment for their Earthly enemies

1068
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,615
Remind me of the song

1069
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,639
Surprisingly enough

1070
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:06,015
Is really good whenever somebody in the year 2020 writes down us all

1071
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,063
Alex f******

1072
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,623
King Jones on the air here is much

1073
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:16,255
Praying on the lake 2016 episode

1074
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,023
Praying

1075
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:17,791
Yeah

1076
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,583
It is kind of an inch

1077
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,631
Interesting thing considering you would expect them to

1078
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:23,423
I hate Hillary Clinton so much

1079
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,191
More

1080
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:30,591
Than anything you can imagine the Benson praying out that the other whatever happened to another episode

1081
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,359
Wade if

1082
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,663
It's very strange

1083
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:34,943
Fuct everybody's head up

1084
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:37,247
The right-wing media has really

1085
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,039
John the great job of

1086
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,831
Destroying the brains of

1087
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:45,439
Billions of people. Here's how you can tell that Alex still has some grass

1088
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,487
Online

1089
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,255
December

1090
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:51,071
Yeah because this color starts breaking into

1091
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:55,423
Prophecy immediately gets freaked out

1092
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:59,519
God has given me a chance I have not been obedient about

1093
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,335
One year ago

1094
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,383
He gave me a vision in which told me that

1095
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,223
Ezekiel 38

1096
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,575
You do not warn them

1097
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:22,047
Hang up I love you to death

1098
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:28,447
I got to go man dude I had a vision you had a

1099
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:34,847
Go listen to that a number of times I can't quite make out what he saying but I think he's

1100
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,639
I think that's what he was saying

1101
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:39,967
I think he said if you smoke hemp and Seed that's what it sounded like

1102
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:42,015
That is what I

1103
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:44,063

Project Veritas

What's happening what you broken what people should share and

1126
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:51,647
Informed about what's coming next

1127
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:58,303
Hey Alex great to be with you I just I don't care whatever is O'Keefe is the boy who cried

1128
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:02,143
Don't care about what he has to say

1129
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:08,799
But I do think it's interesting that Alex is having James O'Keefe on the same episode where he was complaining about boy

1130
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,567
Borat

1131
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,335
Yep

Anyway we have one last year from the 22nd

1137
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,935
I fell out of my chair metaphorically what I heard this

1138
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:41,311
Tell me about the grand solar minimum age

1139
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:48,479
And so why are they spraying on the oxide blocking solar radiation

1140
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,015
They're trying to trigger an early

1141
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,599
So 911

1142
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:55,391
Returning in 2020

1143
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,559
Before we go Interstellar

1144
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:04,607
Have a good day

00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,655
You're absolutely genius collar leather colors

00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:07,935
Genius

1147
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:08,959
Is that

1148
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:10,239
Plan C

1149
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,007
What the

1150
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:11,775
F*** just

1151
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:13,823
What happen if you if you're listening to this

1152
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:15,615
You have to

1153
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,639
Kind of think

1154
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,431
Alex believes that the

1155
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,199
The globalist

1156
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:21,503
Yep they really like orderly thing

1157
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,039
Yep so they want

1158
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,831
To get everyone into camps

1159
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:29,183
Sunforce vaccines imma kill everybody off slowly

1160
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,975
I also because of Alex

1161
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:34,303
Is machinations eSource they going to release a Superbowl

1162
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,583
Everybody

1163
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,399
Yes but also they're trying to

1164
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:41,983
Start a new Ice Age early to kill people out

1165
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,031
What what why

1166
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:46,847
They already have the super bio-weapon with the why would they want it

1167
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:53,503
Create a super Ice Age understand

1168
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:59,903
Then there's a lot of different plans up in the air at a given point in time there's that many plans

1169
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,927
Throw Alex office

1170
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:01,951
The scent now

1171
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:03,487
Obviously won't work because

1172
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:04,767
Because Alex was up

1173
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,071
God himself

1174
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,863
All plans

1175
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:09,887
Plantae

1176
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:10,655
Through z

1177
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:13,471
What if what if

1178
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:15,263
Plan to create a new Ice Age

1179
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:18,335
Makes it so the environment is inhospitable

1180
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:20,383
To be super bio-weapon that they've created

1181
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:23,967
Well then they cancel each other out and that's when you go to play in Peabody

1182
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:30,111
I just

1183
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:34,463
Bored bored

1184
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,487
Okay alright

1185
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:38,815
Everything that could be an apocalyptic playing

1186
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:39,583
Is

1187
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:41,375
Something to cover

1188
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:46,239
None of these things are compatible or C4 complement each other but they're all there

1189
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:50,591
Yep the other thing that I Come Away with two is like this this weird sense of like

1190
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,663
Like I hate

1191
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,967
Electoral Alex yeah

1192
00:57:56,223 --> 00:58:00,575
I that's the feeling that I have had a really difficult time putting my finger on for a while

1193
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:03,391
Alex shouldn't care about electoral politics

1194
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,439
It's really Unbecoming

1195
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,207
Sing for him

1196
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,743
If he believes that there's a super

1197
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:09,791
A cabal of all this stuff and like

1198
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:10,815
These globalized

1199
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,351
They're all in control of

1200
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:14,911
Soumyadeep blah blah blah the right and the left

1201
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,191
After all an illusion

1202
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:18,239
Shouldn't care at all

1203
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,007
About

1204
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:22,847
Votes you shouldn't get like the election shouldn't matter it should be like the Superbowl

1205
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,127
Whatever like

1206
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:26,943
I just feel like this is just a bunch of bulshit

1207
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,735
The over-committing is

1208
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:29,503
Is

1209
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,271
Embarrassing

1210
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,039
It is

1211
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,063
I mean like

1212
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:38,975
I just don't know how else to put it is it's like it's an invalidation of his character

1213
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:39,743
He's just a hat

1214
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:43,327
Yeah he doesn't have anything he used to have something to

1215
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,095
To bring

1216
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:45,887
That's why we got Where We Are

1217
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:48,191
Now he's just a hack like everybody else

1218
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:56,127
Do you like that's why the wrong Paul stuff works so well it's like yes this is never going to go anywhere

1219
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:56,895
You can

1220
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:57,919
You can sort of

1221
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:00,479
Hang your hat on the what ifs

1222
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:01,503
Like it's just

1223
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:03,807
Great it's perfect for a guy like him

1224
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,111
This just stinks

1225
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,647
It stinks electoral Alex

1226
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,183
Bomber bomber

1227
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,255
So there was a debate on Thursday night

1228
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:15,839
And on Friday really got into Studio

1229
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:18,399
Here's how he interpreted the debate

1230
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:20,447
President-trump

1231
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,983
Devastation

1232
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,775
Devastation

1233
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,567
Joe Biden

1234
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,871
He has secured

1235
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:30,687
That

1236
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:32,479
I know I'm just going to call it

1237
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:34,015
10 days out

1238
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,807
He's going to win

1239
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:39,647
In 2016

1240
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,975
Electoral college

1241
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:45,023
Thanks again so much election fraud

1242
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:45,791
Going on

1243
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:50,911
But just as sure as the sun came up this morning and we'll set this evening you can bet your bottom

1244
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:51,679
Bottom

1245
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,703
Benjamin Franklin

1246
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,007
For your bottom George Washington

1247
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,591
Bottom Thomas Jefferson

1248
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:00,639
At your bottom

1249
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:10,111
Just have the biggest Fiasco to ever seen they already said the last election was illegitimate

1250
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:16,767
Hobo Jojo

1251
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:19,327
But also states are going to secede

1252
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:22,143
I can't think of anything I care about less right

1253
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,423
Debate between

1254
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,191
Joe Biden

1255
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,471
Sure

1256
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:26,751
Can you imagine

1257
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:28,543
Giving a s*** about that

1258
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:32,895
I don't think it's an environment where what you want in a debate

1259
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:33,919
Can happen

1260
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:36,479
I don't like the point of a debate

1261
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:38,271
Would be to understand

1262
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,807
Policy position

1263
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:41,343
Understand differences

1264
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,927
Between perspectives on issues that we're all facing

1265
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:48,255
And I I don't think between those two

1266
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:49,791
Primarily because he

1267
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:50,815
The involvement of one of them

1268
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:53,887
Yeah I don't think that's possible

1269
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:54,655
No

1270
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:56,447
So f*** it

1271
01:00:56,959 --> 01:01:01,311
We were talking about a little while back which is like

1272
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:03,871
It's very hard to imagine that anybody is like

1273
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,407
I just don't know

1274
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:08,479
Yeah it doesn't 60 million votes have already been

1275
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,015
Cast

1276
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,295
That's not that's not

1277
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:13,599
That's too many for anyone to

1278
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:16,159
To genuinely consider that it matters

1279
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,695
The people who are like

1280
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,487
I better watch this debate

1281
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,511
To figure out who I like

1282
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,279
Like what the f*** are

1283
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:23,327
I understand why you still do it

1284
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:29,983
Door I guess anybody cheats the same reason reason reason that we're doing so much s*** right now that makes zero sense

1285
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:30,751
That's which is just like

1286
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,031
We're all pretty

1287
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:34,079
Pending that the system is still work

1288
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:40,735
Well I mean it's all imaginary lost sure we got it around so you can have it

1289
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:44,063
I honestly think that

1290
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:45,599
It makes perfect sense

1291
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:47,391
Because

1292
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,671
Like Trump was

1293
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,207
Just like talking

1294
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:53,279
Infowars man

1295
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,047
Pointless

1296
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:56,863
It's not based in reality

1297
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,423
But it works for these right-wing media cycle

1298
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:03,007
So basically they were seeing exactly the Trump that they need

1299
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,567
Fair on that debate smile right

1300
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:10,687
Think that you could easily see that is like yes this is good

1301
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:12,479
But it's probably not good

1302
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:14,527
Dialect orally I think most

1303
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:15,295
People

1304
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:17,087
First of all already made up their mind

1305
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:17,855
And

1306
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:21,439
Someone who's not already into Trump would look at that debate

1307
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:22,719
Any of these debates

1308
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:23,999
I just feel like

1309
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,023
That guy's insane

1310
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:29,119
Or just think I don't like what's going on I didn't watch a sec

1311
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:32,959
Alex talks about China

1312
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:34,751
Their relationship

1313
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:35,519
With

1314
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,055
This is

1315
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:39,615
He tries to make a metaphor

1316
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:41,663
Where China is like

1317
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:42,687
A biker

1318
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,479
Who's in an abusive relationship

1319
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:45,503
Kinship with your mother

1320
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,343
Normal situation that happened

1321
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,623
22

1322
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,671
Please try and

1323
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:54,719
Trace this metaphor

1324
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:55,999
It's all work on it

1325
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,023
Pain

1326
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,303
China

1327
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,327
Is the big

1328
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:06,495
That is give us an allergy that's having sex with your mom I guess you would say

1329
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:11,871
You're five years old and there's this big mean motorcycle gang doodle a 4lb

1330
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:15,711
Meet your mom and beat you and there's nothing you can really do she's scared

1331
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,279
Power button

1332
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:32,095
That's really where this country is

1333
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,119
What

1334
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:36,191
Your mom has Stockholm Syndrome

1335
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:37,727
Cigarette

1336
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,823
Yeah she's not eating upper ribs are showing

1337
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:45,919
He broke her arm you know last year not summerteeth out last month

1338
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,391
Trackmaster

1339
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:01,279
If you don't do something about

1340
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:04,095
Your mama

1341
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,423
You can bail on a metaphor

1342
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:09,983
Yeah going well just like

1343
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:12,287
Just be like you know what that one got away from me

1344
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:15,359
Yeah that happens

1345
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:21,759
Live radio

1346
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:26,623
So China is abusive boyfriend

1347
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:28,159
The Democratic party their mother

1348
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:28,927
Alright

1349
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:29,951
You've already lost

1350
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:30,719
The thread

1351
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:33,791
Why is the Democratic party my mom I don't understand

1352
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:36,351
Who is who in this scenario

1353
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:38,655
Am I am I the Democrat

1354
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:40,959
Why where where are the Republicans

1355
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:41,983
There's a kids

1356
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,031
Democratic party doesn't have

1357
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:45,567
Any power right now

1358
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:46,591
None

1359
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:49,663
I don't understand

1360
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,711
That's a horrifying sort of

1361
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:54,015
Way to paint a picture

1362
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:57,343
Yeah I was something but I don't understand the point I don't understand what

1363
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:01,183
I mean obviously the point is Democrats Regina bad yeah

1364
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,207
But also

1365
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:04,255
This be making the Democrats

1366
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,791
Incredibly sympathetic

1367
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:11,679
Don't I think he know not for him because he believes that if you're getting hit by somebody

1368
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:14,751
Then that's your fault I guess the Democrats are satanic

1369
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,543
Did they kill kids

1370
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,567
Yeah but the

1371
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,359
China's the

1372
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,383
Bigger

1373
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:22,175
Killer of kids I don't know

1374
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:23,199
It doesn't make any sense

1375
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:24,735
None of it makes sense.

1376
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:29,855
Metaphors Alex tries to get into it to get into

1377
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:32,415
Minimizing climate change of carbon emission

1378
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:35,743
Ricky trips over his own foot

1379
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,815
Was one big volcano

1380
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:46,495
Human carbon to the atmosphere

1381
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,519
It happened in

1382
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,335
Krakatoa

1383
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:53,407
Look it up yourself

1384
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:59,807
I'm not sure it's a winning strategy to say the carbon emissions aren't a big deal and your evidence is that every 10 years we do

1385
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:00,831
Much damage is events

1386
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:03,135
That are appointed to his historical disaster

1387
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:08,255
The word that when you say it people don't think about how that's the name of the city

1388
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:10,303
And the volcanoes actually Mount Vesuvius

1389
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:13,631
The word Pompeii is shorthand for that disaster because it was

1390
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:17,215
So bad it was shorthand for seeing people exploded

1391
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:19,007
Good so fast they're f******

1392
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:21,055
Ghosts on the wall

1393
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:23,359
That was in 79 a.d.

1394
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:30,015
Erupted in 1883 and these are still words that just mean volcano disaster because the effect

1395
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:31,807
Those events were so serious

1396
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:34,623
And let such an indelible impression on people psyche

1397
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:38,207
If even if what I was saying we're true it would

1398
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,999
Would still be strong argument for taking

1399
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:42,815
Can human carbon emissions and climate change seriously

1400
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:48,703
Does he think it's a convincing argument say that we're pointlessly creating a Krakatoa event every decade

1401
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:50,751
That seems f****** stupid

1402
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:57,407
You know what else created more CO2 emissions than we do that impact to kill off the dinosaurs

1403
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:06,623
Everybody's always worried about volcanoes in meteors or whatever

1404
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:09,439
Now to the larger Point Alex's just making up number

1405
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:14,815
These incredibly violent eruptions are happening all the time where as our actions are

1406
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:20,703
We may not have a Krakatoa type of volcano going off every year but there are volcanoes

1407
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:21,727
The climate.gov

1408
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:23,519
Human activities and mix

1409
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:27,359
60 or more times the amount of carbon dioxide released by volcanoes

1410
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:28,127
Each year

1411
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:29,407
Large violent eruption

1412
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:31,199
Maybacks the rate of human emission

1413
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:32,991
It's for a few hours that they last

1414
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:36,575
But they're too rare and fleeting to rival Humanity's annual admissions

1415
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,623
In 2013 us

1416
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:43,231
Geologic survey scientist Terry Gerlach published paper that estimated comparisons

1417
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:45,023
Between emissions caused by volcanoes

1418
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,583
His previous paper

1419
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:53,471
In 2011 I had put the figure at humans releasing approximately 90 times as much as volcanoes

1420
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:56,287
But this time the number was lower partially because quote

1421
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,591
More data on carbon dioxide emissions

1422
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:01,407
From subsurface magma had become available near set

1423
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:02,687
Also

1424
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:05,759
Even that 90 * figure is probably quite conserve

1425
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:08,319
It is paper Gerlach looked at 4

1426
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,599
Peculiarly large event

1427
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,391
It's like the eruptions of Mount Saint Helens

1428
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,671
Switching found quotes

1429
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:15,487
Released carbon dioxide on a scale similar to

1430
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:16,511
Human output

1431
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,535
For about 9 hours

1432
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:22,143
What is absolutely not true and even if it were true

1433
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,935
Tell me a really stupid

1434
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:30,079
You just making up numbers that aren't aren't real you know those things that Echo throughout human history

1435
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:32,895
One of those every 10 years

1436
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,199
In that in the sky you know that's right right

1437
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,223
No-oooooo

1438
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,271
What no

1439
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:43,647
No it echoes throughout human history things that Echo throughout human history have to be good right now

1440
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:48,511
These things are scars uncommon history

1441
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:52,095
Like you think about it and you like

1442
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:54,399
Gummy Bears the effects like

1443
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:56,191
Changing Sunset shine

1444
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:01,567
But some of them

1445
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:04,895
Like they affect oral tradition throughout history

1446
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:09,503
That has gone down the myth of the flood

1447
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,271
Space

1448
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,063
Everywhere for a reason

1449
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:16,671
You know like it doesn't matter where but you got hit by that plug

1450
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,695
You can't prove that

1451
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,487
Literal flood

1452
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,815
Alex says something that I needed citation

1453
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,095
Any does not provide one

1454
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:29,215
Numbers within five or ten thousand people the FBI tried to bribe posing as Russians

1455
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:32,031
One conservative

1456
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,895
One person

1457
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:39,711
That you think

1458
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:40,735
Long

1459
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:41,759
You think about that hard

1460
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:44,319
Why

1461
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:46,111
A particularly proud

1462
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:46,879
Patriots

1463
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:48,671
Waffles

1464
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:53,023
Grandma's with cancer the wife's got cancer

Doing a middle schooler telling a story about your dad being a corrupt

1478
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:29,631
The debate

1479
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:30,911
He wept

1480
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:31,679
Oh

1481
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:35,263
Why do I did part of the debate here live I went home

1482
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,543
To watch it with my family

1483
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:49,855
Standing up

1484
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,927
Just what admiration really is

1485
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:57,023
Because it's not jealousy it's stupid

1486
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:00,351
Something example

1487
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:02,143
Appreciating this is so

1488
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,959
Dumb

1489
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:07,263
I'm struggling forward

1490
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:09,055
I just want to throw

1491
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:13,919
I want I want to debate and I cried Trump is so great

1492
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:14,687
To hire

1493
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:15,711
10 people

1494
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:18,015
To anywhere Alex Goes

1495
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:20,063
Suddenly sometimes hit him with it

1496
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:22,367
Like just always be around

1497
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,391
Alex Jones

1498
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,695
Never know when it's going to happen

1499
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:28,511
But I wanted to be hit with the tomatoes semi-regularly

1500
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:31,839
It get my doing some good I think it would be a good idea

1501
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,911
Now Alex in this next clip speculates that

1502
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:36,447
Probably

1503
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,239
What's going to happen before the election

1504
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:40,543
Is there going to false flag kill Joe Biden

1505
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:46,431
They're going to false-flag kill Joe Biden I mean it made Celine more popular

1506
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:54,367
I mean

1507
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:57,183
Such a loser

1508
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:58,975
Biden

1509
01:11:59,487 --> 01:11:59,999
A murder

1510
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:03,071
I don't want to save a loser

1511
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:06,143
Politically dad

1512
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:10,751
Literally

1513
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:11,775
Metaphysically

1514
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,311
So

1515
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:18,431
Assassinate Biden

1516
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:20,735
Attack the power grid the internet

1517
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:24,063
Killswitch

1518
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:25,855
How to place selective

1519
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:27,903
Temperature

1520
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:28,671
Nothing

1521
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,439
Sure

1522
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,207
Sure

1523
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:35,583
This is just all of this is every like I feel like every 1940s movie

1524
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:37,375
We're at some point

1525
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:40,447
Like somebody is acting crazy and then

1526
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,727
Like f******

1527
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:42,751
Dashiell Hammett

1528
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:44,287
Slaps them in the face

1529
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,311
Call it down

1530
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,591
And everything's fine again

1531
01:12:56,575 --> 01:13:00,415
Go to bathroom splash some water on your face and get it together

1532
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:04,767
Yeah I think what he's doing is

1533
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:11,167
The Buckshot sort of strategy and everything is being touched.

1534
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:12,447
Starship Killswitch by

1535
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:14,239
He's going to get assassinated

1536
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:18,079
Start a new Ice Age the pic go to release super bio weapon

1537
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:22,687
Like all of the cheddar ones your flavor that's the one I'm talking about that going to happen

1538
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:27,807
Anything close to any of them happens I'm going to pretend that's all I was talking about

1539
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:31,391
Chicago got nuked and I still stand by that

1540
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:34,975
Going to forget the 50 things he says

1541
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:35,743
And folks

1542
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:38,047
Guess on his interpretation of the one thing

1543
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:42,143
That was close to what actually has to happen is Democrats don't have memory

1544
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,935
And plus if one of

1545
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:44,959
His

1546
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,495
I don't know

1547
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:48,031
Fringe weirdo

1548
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:50,847
Community members does take a shot

1549
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:51,615
Abidin

1550
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:58,015
I told you this would happen

1551
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:02,623
Play Alex improvises a little story here about them

1552
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:03,647
Dim globalist

1553
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:06,719
Stock market probably

1554
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:07,999
You'll be fun

1555
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,279
What is a did it like

1556
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,303
Right around Bank

1557
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:11,071
Thanksgiving soup

1558
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:11,839
Go home

1559
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:15,167
You talk with your parents and everyone here

1560
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,239
Triple thing

1561
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:20,543
Fusion

1562
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:23,103
Sense of desperation

1563
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:25,919
Then a bunch of stock market 10-15.

1564
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:26,687
Flights

1565
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:29,503
Before Thanksgiving

1566
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:32,063
Or maybe right after sex

1567
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:35,391
Before Thanksgiving

1568
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:36,927
Because they're going to want you to

1569
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:41,279
Yeah

1570
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:47,167
Ryder Truck loading right now

1571
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:52,031
We got a bunch of these little

1572
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:54,591
Hamsters running around

1573
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:58,687
Alex is just making all of that up when he's not he's not alone

1574
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:03,551
Alone in the room

1575
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,575
And what else are we going to do

1576
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:10,975
Probably going to come find any that they're going to go through my window 8:30 to walk out my door

1577
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:17,375
Easy I'm convinced of himself

1578
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:20,703
Very troubling for other people

1579
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:27,103
Can hear it before Thanksgiving

1580
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:27,871
With your family

1581
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:30,687
They're probably loading up Ryder trucks

1582
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:34,015
F*** I too have had trouble going to sleep

1583
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:39,135
At around 2 a.m. and you can't sleep for about two hours because everything is just going to

1584
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:40,927
You got anxiety

1585
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,975
But you're alone and you deal with

1586
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:46,559
Yeah it's deeply deeply disturbing to hear this

1587
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:48,863
So anyway

1588
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:50,655
That it is next clip

1589
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:52,447
Alex accuses liberals of

1590
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:55,775
Thinking that the Smuggler coyotes tour

1591
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,567
Actually coyote coyote

1592
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:04,223
Infowars.com article Liberals are so stupid leftist are so disconnected from reality

1593
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:06,271
Farm Ranch

1594
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:07,551
They thought

1595
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:08,831
The trumpet

1596
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:11,391
Children riding on coyotes

1597
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:12,927
I saw that last night

1598
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:15,231
They said oh my God

1599
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:24,191
Blue check marks are like he's crazy

1600
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:27,263
Coyotes don't bring kids into the United States

1601
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:31,103
That's what they're told you dumb bastards

1602
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:35,455
I'm sure Alex would have the same response to Trump thinking a coyote's referred to the animal

1603
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:36,479
Trump dating

1604
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:38,271
2018 speech Saint Cloud

1605
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:40,063
Without Borders we have the rain

1606
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:42,367
Chaos crime and believe it or not

1607
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,135
Coyotes

1608
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:46,207
Because it is very clear instance of trump appearing

1609
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:50,815
Do not know what coyote mad he went to use the word repeatedly in the most recent debate

1610
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:57,471
People most likely making fun of that using those reference as a jumping-off point now because pretending that's not part of the contact

1611
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:00,031
Get Trump's full response to

1612
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:05,663
Coyotes you know the Smugglers

1613
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:07,455
No sir that's stupid

1614
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:13,343
Wow indeed

1615
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:14,623
I agree with

1616
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:16,415
Wow

1617
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:17,695
Wow

1618
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:19,231
Wow

1619
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:21,023
Just wow

1620
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:25,375
Trump obviously

1621
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:27,167
Was saying that because

1622
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:30,495
He said better 2018

1623
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:33,567
The only reason that he would do that

1624
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:36,383
Because that's how grown-up

1625
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,151
Make it look

1626
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:40,223
Two years later like he isn't as stupid as we all know him too

1627
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:42,527
Bananas so Alex

1628
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,319
Some calls and gets one

1629
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:47,903
Let's never wants to know how we take our country back

1630
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:48,927
And Alex's

1631
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:50,463
Immediate responses of course

1632
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,487
You already have

1633
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:55,839
Because you support my shelf sure

1634
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:58,911
But what if Trump do though how how do we

1635
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:03,007
Before we reach

1636
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:09,407
How long we're on air

1637
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:13,247
We had a huge effect other independent

1638
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:14,783
Not just sitting

1639
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:17,343
What is the Uso

1640
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:19,647
U-boat

1641
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:22,975
They kill the president

1642
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:24,767
God knows we're going to have to

1643
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:27,071
So

1644
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:31,423
We're not the ones who did this or the one started it I'm not looking for 5 believe me I don't want one

1645
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:32,959
But they're looking for

1646
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:38,079
Cuz we got tons of catchphrases Hublot of foods and not Sandman

1647
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:41,663
Yeah I already supported you already saved the country because of you

1648
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:44,223
Support and also maybe

1649
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:44,991
Kill some people

1650
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:48,575
Like remember when the government like I wish the government was like

1651
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:50,623
Let's talk about what the best

1652
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:53,951
Sure

1653
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:55,999
Let's talk about how best to

1654
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,023
To take care of rose

1655
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:58,559
Garba

1656
01:18:59,071 --> 01:18:59,839
Pickup Man

1657
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:03,679
Some slightly different ideas about local control versus

1658
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:10,079
The federal state line should be supposed to be

1659
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:10,847
Baby reborn

1660
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:15,967
Is that how bored we are is that is if we're just like most because something has

1661
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:18,015
To be interested creative

1662
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:19,295
Fake

1663
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:20,319
Factions

1664
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:30,815
Everything is espionage and drama all the time

1665
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:33,887
We used to have deep so used to show up once every couple of seasons

1666
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:38,495
Do you know it's not a every episode things

1667
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:40,287
And because

1668
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:43,615
3rd hour Abba lot of it is Alex interview

1669
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:44,895
Catherine Austin Fitts

1670
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:47,967
Thought it incredibly boring

1671
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:49,503
She's somebody who's

1672
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:52,575
A frequent guest on Project Camelot and

1673
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,879
Begin bring the hits no

1674
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:58,719
Did not but we have one last clip

1675
01:19:58,975 --> 01:19:59,999
Explain American be a cop

1676
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:02,303
And I agree with that I also agree with that

1677
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,351
We had done a very

1678
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:05,119
Familiar note

1679
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:09,471
It's just it's a mess out there man you could not get me to be a police officer

1680
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,080
Yes.

1681
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:15,360
God almighty

1682
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:18,944
Talk about cuz I mean now if you shoot somebody

1683
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:24,832
You're going to prison

1684
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:34,816
I got mad

1685
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:39,168
And I kind of wasn't thinking once I punch the dog in the face few times

1686
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:44,288
I want to do that

1687
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:46,080
Because it was

1688
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:48,128
I don't have those controls

1689
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:49,920
And I just could not be

1690
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:56,576
Outrageous hostility towards dogs with that with that kind of s*** you can't be out

1691
01:20:56,832 --> 01:21:02,976
Don't tell me I can't be a cop whenever you just said I saw a person and beat the s***

1692
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:07,328
Service dog for a while you should be wearing a cone

1693
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:08,608
F****** containment

1694
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:09,632
Yeah it's

1695
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:16,032
Adult

1696
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,080
You didn't touch it one time

1697
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:21,920
What time is the Heat of the Moment a couple of times as your f******

1698
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:28,320
Crazy person needs to be in containment I feel like the strategy generally to with like a dog that's a little bit out of

1699
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:29,600
Control as I get away from it

1700
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:34,976
Yeah. Punch him if you could not be a f****** cop

1701
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:36,512
Jesus Christ

1702
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:38,304
Price also

1703
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:44,704
Grosser also one of the reasons that people are up in arms and protesting as much as they are and

1704
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,240
I have such a backlash

1705
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:48,032
Yeah this conversation is happening

1706
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:51,104
So affectionately

1707
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,896
Is because when police

1708
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,432
To people they do not

1709
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:56,224
Typically end up

1710
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:58,784
Galaxy

1711
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,320
You're stupid everything is done

1712
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:03,136
I can't tell you how different

1713
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:04,416
This is from looking at

1714
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:06,720
At the 2016

1715
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:07,488
Completely

1716
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,024
I mean still like

1717
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,304
We got when we went and looked

1718
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,328
November 4th

1719
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,096
Insects

1720
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:12,864
2016

1721
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:13,888
There is demon

1722
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:15,424
You know all that

1723
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:17,216
Always think so

1724
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:18,240
F****** different

1725
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:22,080
Like it's all I love Trump I cried watching the debate

1726
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:25,408
Most you the first time around it's all Hillary's evil

1727
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,688
It's very different

1728
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:27,456
And

1729
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,480
Equally

1730
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:29,248
Annoying

1731
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,552
I will I look forward to the election

1732
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:35,392
Season kind of ending because like I said I do realize it

1733
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:37,952
It's electoral politics does not mix

1734
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:40,000
With crazy conspiracy

1735
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:43,840
The 2-cycle oil and water and that's why this is so

1736
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:45,632
Like just it doesn't make sense

1737
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:47,680
Why is he seemed so desperate

1738
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:50,240
Plenty of other reasons

1739
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:51,264
Is really sad

1740
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:55,360
When you get down to it it's disgraceful really disappointing

1741
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:58,432
Even if you think that there's one good thing

1742
01:22:58,688 --> 01:22:59,456
You can say about Ali

1743
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,808
What the hell

1744
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:05,344
We do appreciate that

1745
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,136
That is very nice of him not to eat as a

1746
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,696
Acuvue

1747
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:13,536
Four stars

1748
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:16,864
Easy thing for him to say though because everybody already knows that

1749
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:20,192
Could eat their goldfish so they keep their goldfish away for

1750
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:22,240
Sure it is an opportunity

1751
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:23,264
Automotive

1752
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,032
Situation

1753
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:26,336
Are Goldfish crackers Alex

1754
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:27,872
3/12 crackers

1755
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:31,456
They were clearly marked with my name on them

1756
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:33,504
Anyway

1757
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:36,320
We got interesting

1758
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:42,720
Couple days ahead of us cuz now we have this emergency Joe Rogan episode up on Friday

1759
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:46,816
2016 election on Monday

1760
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:52,960
And I do know is that you're not sometime if you are concerned

1761
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:54,496
If you can and it's safe

1762
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:56,288
There are early voting

1763
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:58,592
People should do a look into that

1764
01:23:58,848 --> 01:23:59,872
I don't know I always

1765
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:03,712
I always try to

1766
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:04,992
To be kind of

1767
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:07,552
Respectful of

1768
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:09,088
That being very personal

1769
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:11,392
Thing and I I do believe that

1770
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:13,440
A lot of a lot of

1771
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:17,280
Vote bullying can be a real thing sure and I don't want any

1772
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:18,304
Engaging that

1773
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,072
Yeah but

1774
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:19,840
You know

1775
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:21,888
