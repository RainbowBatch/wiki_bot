1
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:21,248
Damn important

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
MoneyGram

4
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,088
College fight.com

5
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,536
Everybody was fighting

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:09,120
Indeed we are.

7
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,656
Have you ever had an

8
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,680
Circle Appliance

9
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,704
Low.

10
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:17,312
I mean when my house burned down a few years ago when I went back

11
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,336
To the apartment

12
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,104
Like we're able to

13
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,408
To go in like my oven head like

14
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,224
Oh really yeah that that's the only

15
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:29,856
Yeah you never had anything like actually happened I had a blender over like

16
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:36,256
Top of it cuz I was using it wrong

17
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,328
I don't know I don't I don't think so

18
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,912
Took out my hat nothing like a man

19
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,960
Because I had a toaster oven that

20
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,240
My grandparents bequeathed

21
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,056
That was from that was made in like this

22
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,848
And I used it

23
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,128
2 years ago

24
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
I just moved in with

25
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:59,296
Just exploded into started a bonfire I thought everybody had likes

26
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,160
I got nothing nothing I can remember

27
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,952
If it didn't leave a mark on me

28
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,744
Right

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,280
In conversation so I'm going to Pivot

30
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:15,680
The subject I want to talk about the I started playing the new Luigi's Mansion

31
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,240
Why did my question

32
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,056
A lot of thoughts about it

33
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,408
Luigi's Mansion 3

34
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,944
It's been very

35
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,248
Emotionally resonant

36
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:35,648
I would say what kind of was like one of the first games that I played

37
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,928
As an adult

38
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,952
Sonic video games

39
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,000
I played like Megaman

40
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:43,328
The Mario games of Donkey Kong Country

41
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,120
Yes there was a little bit of a break

42
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,144
From video games

43
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,680
And like when the GameCube

44
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,960
Came out my buddies had it

45
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,776
Luigi Mansion was one of the launch titles

46
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:57,152
And I f****** love ditlove run around the vacuum sucking up ghost naturally it was a lot of fun

47
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,944
And I wasn't able to play Luigi

48
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,736
Listen to cuz it wasn't on a system

49
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,296
Write anywhere to make

50
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,392
In any shape to get

51
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
3DS

52
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,464
So I never liked was able to

53
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,256
Play I heard the third one was

54
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024
Who's coming out of like

55
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,560
I'm so excited about this

56
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,352
I am so I got it

57
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,144
I plan it I started to realize

58
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:25,568
Aesthetically pleasing out no tell me you're having fun and it's absolutely

59
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:30,432
Fun enjoying it quite a bit

60
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,480
It's low you know Alexa

61
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,528
I just played in a day or two

62
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,576
A lot of replay value in some

63
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,600
Some games like that

64
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,160
But it dawned on me as I was playing at the like

65
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
I am

66
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,464
This is a lot about money

67
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:51,936
Okay you going around this Mansion is haunted you got to like suck up a ghost and everything right

68
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,984
You're like banging on trash cans

69
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:59,616
You know trying to vacuum up the walls because sometimes dollar bills a fly out of you and coins

70
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,200
Super money

71
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,016
Interested game

72
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:10,368
Kind of like at the end after you beat the game it rates you based on how much money in

73
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,928
You probably and that's

74
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,952
Determines what

75
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
Seismic

76
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:20,607
Can you end up with a review of this video

77
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
Just kind of Forgotten

78
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:27,007
How Deeply involved finances were in the illusion

79
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,543
And I was like this is a strange

80
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,567
Video game

81
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,431
All the Mario games run around collecting coins

82
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,991
There's something weird about the dollar bill

83
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:42,111
That is true bars of gold

84
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,391
We have coins

85
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:48,511
In the real world

86
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,279
Disiena video

87
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,559
You're just not programmed

88
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,351
Well because I think it what you're thinking

89
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:58,751
Is like someone had to print these dollar bills but at the same time those coins have imprints on them

90
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:05,151
I want to know I want to know who's in charge of the treasury and Waluigi

91
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:10,527
So far it's not running to Waluigi I don't know if he's in the game but I think he needs to

92
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,879
Perfect opportunity to throw Waluigi into the mansion

93
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:22,047
Stalinist you go to there like money is very evil

94
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,607
I thought I had along the way play night we just match

95
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,655
I know a lot about Luigi's Mansion

96
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,471
Alex Jones

97
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,031

98
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,823

Pretty much all over the news as everyone knows Alex Jones

102
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,583
To be a juror in Rodger Stones trial

103
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,983
The legality question surrounding it

104
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,543
No matter what the situation is

105
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,823

00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,151

Money off that heroin

Freakishly large

Sports show we would appreciate it very much

133
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:43,103
Lovely so like I said the big news will get to as we get to it that Alex Jones is trying to meddle in the affairs

134
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,639
Sports

135
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,455
Classic

136
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,503
Texting on the Infowars

137
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,527
Circuit

138
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,551
Let's say

139
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,855
Every time there is a big

140
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,647
You think that Alex Jones does

141
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,719
Often times if you watch the entire show

142
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:04,607
You find there's like other things guys probably should have pointed out here there's a whole lot of things

143
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,167
Debatably are worse yet

144
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:13,567
Alex Jones caught committing a crime and then in the same episode he starts peeing on a

145
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,871
Checking into like a why is not going to talk about that

146
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:19,455
What is llamas in the studio

147
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,527
Arab talk about the goddamn Mama's alright

148
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,623
I will see there's a number of things that are like really important points

149
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
In his coverage

150
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,183
Over the course of the

151
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,463
Nothing to do with Rodger

152
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,743
Don't naturally

153
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,559
I thought that's what the register

154
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,607
That is absolutely important you know that

155
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,423
We'll discuss it all

156
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:44,287
They're going to start on November 5th here and Alex begin to show searching for the top

157
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,823
Story what is the top

158
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
Story

159
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,895
Don't know if I agree with where he lands

160
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:53,503
Ladies and gentlemen I said here this morning cuz I got here at 9 a.m.

161
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,855
Pondering all the news all the clips all the guests all the information

162
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,159
They're about to be covering and just

163
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:07,071
Thinking what is our top story because it's more important than just what is the biggest news what's the most interesting news

164
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,399
What out of the spectrum is most important

165
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:17,823
It said an advertising if you go with the worldview of advertising that perception is reality

166
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,639
Well if you're on 10 hits of

167
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,175
LSD

168
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,759
And you think you can fly like a bird you jump off of 20

169
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,575
Balcony at the concrete below you're going to die

170
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,927
Now your perception is that you'd spread your wings like an angel

171
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,975
The phoenix like a lark

172
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
Crow

173
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,583
Is Amanda.

174
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,911
That's the only Birds we've got there going to be

175
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
Cheating on you

176
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,519
Perception is not

177
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,311
Reality

178
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,431
What actually

179
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:58,527
He is and what works and what replicates and what succeeds

180
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,319
So what's the top score

181
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
Lice

182
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
Israel

183
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,927
Universal rally

184
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,719
So is top story

185
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:11,071
Appears to be that there is an objective reality

186
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:17,471
Big news that was that was good stuff

187
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,751
Reality exists

188
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
Good stuff man

189
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:26,431
I needed that I knew that I was listening to that like this show is not going to go anywhere good

190
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,503
Admitted one of his

191
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:34,367
Where do I begin what let's establish that reality is outfit that exist

192
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
Okay

193
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Good

194
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:40,255
Joe Alexander gets from there

195
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,303
Reality unless you're taking LSD

196
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:47,423
Yes but no but then reality is still real bigger perception will be different than reality show Perception

197
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,471
He's not real

198
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,543
Do advertisers say hello

199
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,615
Alright I was stuck on the birds eating

200
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,455
Is teaching class

201
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,503
The student

202
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:09,951
So Alex goes from there any jumps to some stories that he's got about cartel murder

203
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,023
Their offense of US citizens that were killed by cartel member

204
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,351
Recently

205
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,399
And the Alex gets

206
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,215
The story and he believes that it's a cover-up

207
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:25,055
Then I'm going to discuss what my initial theory was about that

208
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,383
With the caveat that everything I'm about to say is not correct

209
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:35,295
For you at least nine people including six children were killed in an ambush by Mexican drug cartel

210
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:41,695
This happened in the northern state of Sonora police believe the attack to be a case of mistaken identity

211
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:48,095
Members of the cartel opened fire on a convoy of three SUVs that were part of the Church of Latter-day Saints

212
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:54,495
There are 13 people missing as of news time while no identities have been released so far witness at the scene said

213
00:11:54,751 --> 00:12:00,895
Some of the victims were his family members including his wife's cousin twins 6 month old babies and ain't you

214
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:06,271
Ten-year-old the national police and military forces are heading there to defend the area

215
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:12,159
Whitewash and defend

216
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,463
What happened

217
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,839
It was targeted

218
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,887
Including

219
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,727
Nine month old babies killed at point-blank range

220
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,751
So they were kidnapped

221
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:31,103
So when I heard him say that they were targeted

222
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,943
A hundred percent that he was talking about there was a story in the New York Post

223
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,711
It came out yet

224
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,759
Discuss how this

225
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,087
Group these Mormons that were down in Mexico

226
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,159
They had connections to the nxivm sex cult

227
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,255
How yeah

228
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:54,655
According to this New York Post story quote The Outpost Mormon community in Mexico is where underlings of the nixxiom

229
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,935
Cult leader

230
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,007
Keith raniere recruited young women to work as nannies

231
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:02,079
In an Upstate New York compound run by the accused called

232
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:08,735
So the Nexium recruited Mormons know they use the Mormons to recruit young women in Mexico that

233
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,783
I would then be sent to Upstate New York

234
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,807
To work at this

235
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,903
According to the New York Post is reporting that and that information

236
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,695
Who's coming from a man named Mark Vincent

237
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,743
Who was hired to make a documentary about next

238
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,559
So I don't I don't know how much

239
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,631
He is a fully accurate Source yet certainly

240
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,423
We had some exposure

241
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,727
The group that's wild if true

242
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:34,079
Oh yeah I'm not entirely sure but I thought that's what Alex was talking about

243
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,127
I like I just sort of like

244
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,759
I expected that to be the angle he goes down so

245
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,039
I had this whole thing

246
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:49,439
Prepared about why that stupid have to throw it out

247
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
You start looking into the case

248
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,511
You see

249
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,303
Something with somebody is reporting

250
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,839
This connection with the Nexium

251
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:01,983
Osteen one thing there and now we've got

252
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,311
Way for him to tell this story that you got to Angela

253
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:11,455
But it's not we'll get to what it's actually about here in the moment but after those murders pretty strong but

254
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,479
Possibly too aggressive

255
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
Response

256
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,575
He called on Mexico to declare war on the cartels to which Mexico

257
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:20,159
Can president Andres Manuel Lopez obrador said quote

258
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,207
The worst thing you can do is have War

259
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,743
We declared war and it didn't work

260
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,767
This is not an option

261
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:30,399
I don't feel like I'm in a position where I can tell Mexico how to solve its problems so I'm not going to try

262
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,959
At the same time I definitely understand transfer

263
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:36,799
Response where you have to take it seriously what u.s. citizen

264
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,823
Things are being killed abroad

265
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,151
Route to the extent

266
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,991
You might be doing that selectively

267
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,039
Maybe you can make an argument that that's the case

268
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,599
But I don't really care to make that argument

269
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:55,743
As a way to sort of like what about all these other people who were killed

270
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
Super

271
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,791
Worthwhile life

272
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,559
To go down

273
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,095
I don't really know what to stay here

274
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,167
I think this is an awful piece of news that's come out

275
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,703
And I don't separate

276
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,007
Particularly care to try and make it anything other than that

277
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
The tragedy

278
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,847
That we need to be doing more to try and avoid having repeat

279
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,383
Whatever the best strategy

280
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
Towards that is

281
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,175
I would say the

282
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,455
Probably have

283
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,991
All out War

284
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,271
With a cartel

285
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:22,111
It's probably not the best strategy

286
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,927
32 years and in that time

287
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
I can think

288
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,511
America winning every war that

289
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:34,399
It started I'm pretty sure that every war that the United States has been involved in they have

290
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,679
Completely one right

291
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,031
So I had it in my head that's like

292
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
Going to get into the snake

293
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,103
That's right in his wheelhouse

294
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,663
He starts talking a little bit more and I realize

295
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,991
The Mormons got

296
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
Killed

297
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,111
In a crossfire know if you watch documentaries about Mexico

298
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,647
A lot of Mormons went down

299
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,207
The forties fifties and sixties to proselytize

300
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
Add

301
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,119
They won't pay tribute to the cartels

302
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,655
And they get killed

303
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:11,519
And there's been Mormon Vigilantes not this group other areas that

304
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,871
Support the documentaries made

305
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:22,783
About it till they were targeted but brown people never target white

306
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,135
God that's that's yep that's your right

307
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,791
Chevy Magnum

308
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,095
Whites are inherently evil

309
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:42,495
I completely blew it with my initial Assumption of the Nexium connection

310
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:47,359
Somewhere else and then now it's just too obvious just a f****** race here

311
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:51,967
I was like holy s*** there were Mormon Vigilantes there's going to be a moron vigilante

312
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,015
Cartel War we're not going to worry about

313
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,807
Get the government about no pictures

314
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,855
Brown people killed what grade

315
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:04,255
One day I'll learn my lesson and stop trying to understand what you might be saying and just assume that it's all read it wrote it in his deep White

316
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,607
Really need to learn that lesson eventually

317
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:15,007
Don't see it coming I constantly give the benefit of the doubt that it's about something else and then got out now

318
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:20,639
Mormons didn't start going to Mexico to proselytizing the 30s who's more like the 1870

319
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:24,479
Many of them to go down there to do charity and missionary s***

320
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:28,575
But a whole lot of them also were running from the United States where polygamy was outlawed

321
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,623
Mormons have

322
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,439
I had a very healthy presence in Mexico for a long time

323
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,975
In 2014

324
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:41,119
TV reported having 24 missions and 13 temples in Mexico with over 1.2 million members in their

325
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:46,239
The issues related to the Mormon present to Mexico is complicated

326
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,799
And I'm not sure I can credibly discuss all those issues

327
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:53,919
But what I can do is say that Alex has absolutely zero reason to

328
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,943
Turn this into a race

329
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,015
Even if everything he's saying is correct

330
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,855
And that these people were targeted by the cartel because Mormons and

331
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,903
Mexico have a history of standing up the cartels

332
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,207
That still has nothing to do with their race

333
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:09,535
It would maybe have something to do with their religion but that's

334
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,607
It's not really a fair assessment to say that all Mormons are white

335
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,959
Well. Search with the number at 85% of us Mormon

336
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,007
Being white in a 2014 release

337
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,055
The same is not true International

338
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,639
It's a pretty common thing to hear from LDS folks that

339
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
Conversion rates

340
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,199
Did Europe in the United States are not

341
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:27,967
Growing

342
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,527
And one of the only thing that's keeping the church alive is

343
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,551
Is latinx converse

344
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,343
And eventually

345
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,415
That will be reflected in the u.s. Mormon demographics as well

346
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:40,255
From 2000 to 2010 the number of spanish-language churches

347
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,583
Went from 377 to seven hundred

348
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,399
It is a community that is

349
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,935
Massivelyop Norman

350
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:51,007
Yes yes

351
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,847
What Alex is doing here is equating the Mormon Miss of the victims of the

352
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,383
Describe with their whiteness

353
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
We just kind of eraser

354
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
Things to do

355
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:05,087
He can make the argument that these people were targeted because they were Mormon Mormon tour just disrupting the cartels

356
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:08,159
Ability to operate and we could talk about that is a possibility

357
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,463
I'm not really sure if that's true

358
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,511
It possibly could be

359
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,535
I don't know

360
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,583
But as long as he's discussing that is a

361
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,375
Siri and not proven fact

362
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,423
I'll probably just say that whatever

363
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
That's not what he's doing

364
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:25,311
He's taking the argument that they were targeted because they were Mormons as definitively prove

365
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,127
Then swapping out white for Mormon

366
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:31,199
In order to take the story of 9 murdered US citizen

367
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,759
And turn it into fuel for his white identity outrageous

368
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
This is disgust

369
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,111
It's super disrespectful to the victims of this crime

370
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,671
Honestly a very clear

371
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,207
Example of how racist is

372
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
Yeah yeah

373
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,023
So

374
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,327
Alex starts rambling around

375
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,119
About free will

376
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,911
We now know reality exists

377
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,983
And also as an option to that Free Will exists

378
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,543
I need to start stalking

379
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:00,127
Free Will exists and so evil exist

380
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,663
Because we have the power

381
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,943
How to make bad choices

382
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:04,991
God

383
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,271
And God's creation

384
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,807
The universe

385
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,159
Is a piece of work

386
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,463
Story tonight

387
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,767
Embarrassing

388
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,607
I was on The View

389
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:26,239
George W bush in the bush

390
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,079
Computers are so dumb

391
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,151
Legal Wars effect WM

392
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,199
That I was at

393
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,783
Leftist

394
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,839
Rcnn showtape show

395
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,727
She's an older woman

396
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:01,055
1235 14th

397
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,615
We doing later

398
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,919
You can tell this woman

399
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,087
Very interesting

400
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:17,952
Alex is mad The Joy Behar on The View said something to the effect of like

401
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,000
You know Beto dropped out of the race

402
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:20,768
Answer

403
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,328
Movies like you don't tell people to take their guns

404
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:29,728
Wait till you're in office that kind of okay

405
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,008
Comedian

406
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,312
Right. Advancing

407
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,848
Specific policy

408
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,944
As much as she is talking s*** on The View that's her job

409
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,248
The word for work

410
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,040
Straight up a think tank

411
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,088
Writing policy

412
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,392
Proposals the people just copy and paste

413
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,696
According to Bill of course

414
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:53,280
So he's offended at that so he decides

415
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,816
Man you know I

416
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,376
I know a lot of that type

417
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,656
A dude that's like

418
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:03,776
What's the name name any person and I love don't have like a story of like a time when I was

419
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,824
Almost

420
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,432
Yeah you rewrote that in your memory

421
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,784
It's a possibility that there's that rewriting that goes on

422
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,088
But it's also a possibility that

423
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,624
Alex just

424
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,952
Have to be case maybe every

425
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,024
Every person is trying to f*** him at every man wants

426
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,816
What's the fight him unsuccessful

427
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,352
So that's

428
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,144
The healthy

429
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:36,800
This is what this is family show where Alex is talking about Joy Behar trying to have sex with her

430
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,080
Sort of invalidating

431
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,384
You know that's also another album

432
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,968
Really f***** up

433
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,736
She came onto me

434
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,808
So Alex gets into now

435
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:48,832
Talking about

436
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,600
But he has like a

437
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,880
Almost the entire sect

438
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
Of the show

439
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,440
Do you know whole brakes break

440
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:54,976
A rant

441
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,256
About how

442
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,024
We need to reach

443
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,608
People who are against

444
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,376
Guns

445
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,400
And we need to

446
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
Reach out to them

447
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,216
Okay they're all fools

448
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,008
Okay

449
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,288
Takes us to a familiar

450
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:13,152
They've been inducted into a fraud and if they get deeper and deeper they get more frantic

451
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,736
But the fake degrees aren't paying off in

452
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:20,320
The system isn't putting them in charge they were supposed to be the ruling class

453
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,344
The priesthood

454
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,696
You got to explain to them

455
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,096
Email scam man

456
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:37,472
They get the first money and then the people don't but I bet they've been kind of a sucker for more money

457
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:44,384
Turn on people pay the Nigerians 1015 payments

458
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,784
They don't want to admit they got caught themselves or their neighbors are in denial

459
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:56,672
I think evidence just keeps mounting that Alex fell for that Nigerian email

460
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:00,256
That's it I didn't even know you could go to or more than to pay my

461
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:04,608
I never knew I thought it was one payment then they went away they'll come back

462
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,168
Yeah that's weird

463
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,704
I don't know if

464
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,544
The Nigerian scam Works in such a way where they do

465
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,920
Payout the first like the Nigeria the people running the email scam not that I'd off

466
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,224
They they give you that money

467
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,552
We need more money so what are you just send that money back

468
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,088
I don't know it's very strange

469
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,880
Whatever the case I believe Alex

470
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,648
Probably leave

471
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,184
100

472
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,536
It's so singularly focused on it like there's a there's a berry

473
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,840
It's strange

474
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,608
Oh yeah

475
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,144
So Alex talks

476
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,680
About those

477
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,704
9

478
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,472
Citizens

479
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,240
Circled

480
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,776
New Mexico

481
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,056
And then there's another story

482
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,616
But a New Hampshire couple that was found dead

483
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,896
My Padre Island

484
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,176
They were found

485
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,200
Buried

486
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,504
And Alex's

487
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,528
Connecting B story

488
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,064
And maybe he should

489
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,880
The fact a lot of Tourism go to Padre Island now

490
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:02,208
Because hundreds and hundreds are coming up missing including children

491
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:10,400
End up shutting down anyways I just got to Mexico until we stop it

492
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,448
What President Trump has declared

493
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
War on it

494
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,056
That's all these deceptions kill people

495
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,104
They don't want you armed

496
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,480
So you can't protect yourself so you know if you're coming down from New Hampshire I know it's pretty safe to go camping in New Hampshire

497
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,832
Camping in West Texas Reese Texas North Texas

498
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,368
You don't go camping

499
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:34,976
A few miles from the Mexico border 10 dangerous areas in the world

500
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,512
Unless you want to die

501
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,072
Public service announcement

502
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:44,704
We don't have a gun get one and learn how to use it and no we're going to be parked out

503
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,984
In the dunes

504
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,776
Next to Mexico

505
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:52,640
You better have your door locked and you better have an AR-15 or ready to start killing

506
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,200
Because there's a good chance you camp out

507
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,224
Enough time

508
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,248
Their common

509
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,784
And they're going to tie you up

510
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,856
I'm not going to get your bank codes off your credit card

511
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:06,720
And then they're going to put you down on your knees and they're going to squeeze a couple bullets in your head

512
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,512
After they rape your wife

513
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:11,840
In front of you but it's okay cuz they're brown

514
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,376
White devil

515
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,192
That is sick

516
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:16,960
Daddy

517
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:20,032
Do you told me this was a family ship

518
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,848
This is not a family show

519
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:27,968
So when I was talking about Padre Island like I said Cormac McCarthy

520
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,528
He's talking about James and Michelle Butler

521
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:34,880
A couple from New Hampshire vacationing on Padre Island were found dead buried in the beach

522
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:42,304
He's taking this story in a sort of combining it with the story of the Mormons killed by the drug cartel and unified story about Mexican

523
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,352
Killing white people in the media covering it up

524
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,936
As for the media covering up the Mormon story that's absurd

525
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,984
It's been reported literally all over the

526
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:54,848
If Alex's complaint is it the media isn't reporting a story of being related to his fans

527
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,128
Taxis of a race war

528
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,408
Then I guess he's going to have

529
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,432
Deal with that

530
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:03,040
They have reported that the police have said that it's a mistaken identity situation

531
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,832
And even if the reporter suspect

532
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,112
That's not the whole story

533
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,392
They have journalist

534
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,416
Journalistic ethics

535
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,232
Consider and uphold real journalist

536
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,024
Just throw around feelings and

537
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,120
Conjecture the police say this but I personally don't believe it

538
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,192
That's Alex's job

539
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,568
In terms of the butler's from New Hampshire Alex is very likely completely wrong about that

540
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,896
The couple's bodies were discovered on October twenty

541
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:32,480
Seventh time of this recording the case has not been fully solved

542
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,504
But

543
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,808
On November 4th police released pictures

544
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,344
Persons of Interest in The Killing

545
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:42,208
They were caught on surveillance cameras when they tried to cross the border in the butler's car

546
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,488
Which they had stolen

547
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,048
The driver of the car Pierce to be a Caucasian

548
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,608
Who the police identified as Adam Curtis Williams

549
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,912
When they put out a warrant for his arrest

550
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:55,776
The warrant is for suspicion of felony theft so it might be a situation where they just

551
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,544
Suspecting of taking

552
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
Car

553
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,360
It seems unlikely that in this case

554
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:03,968
The theft and murder wouldn't be related but who knows

555
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,248
I don't know what

556
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,528
It's going on for sure

557
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:09,088
I don't know that this Williams character is the murderer

558
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,624
Person

559
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,512
But it does seem pretty well established that he was photographed in the butler's car after the murders heading for Mexico

560
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,560
Man you know what that means

561
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,120
It has nothing to do with

562
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,400
Where you're from

563
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,728
It's where you are the Border makes

564
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,008
People killed

565
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:30,336
Dan it has nothing to do with their f****** ghost

566
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:37,504
People around that area I would like to remind you I would like to remind

567
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,552
Does not react alright well

568
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,320
I've got a hunch

569
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,088
So

570
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:46,976
What's going on is there zero evidence that this is a case where there is Mexican perpetrator

571
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:50,304
That's something that Alex is entirely imaginary

572
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:56,704
Based on his feelings that there was violence done against white people in the vicinity of Mexico that must have been done by Mex

573
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,032
This is a pure expression of his over traces

574
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:03,104
In case we're available evidence directly contradict

575
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,128
Does racist assumption

576
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:08,224
By the time he's on are here. We're listening to the 5th

577
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,552
And the photos of Williams driving to Butler's car have been released

578
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,088
The day before

579
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,880
This is entirely unacceptable

580
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,440
For him to be getting on are in agitated

581
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:21,280
You know it's fine cuz they're brown in your white devil

582
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,816
This is

583
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,608
Explicitly

584
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,912
Deeply race reminds me

585
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,936
So much of a

586
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
You're pretty sure of something

587
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,544
Myfaulkner

588
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,080
Where the guy is just

589
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
Reading the board

590
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
Paper and there's

591
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:36,896
It's like a

592
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,688
Man still on the loose thing and

593
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,712
Turns and looks news

594
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:42,272
Probably in Edward and then just moves on and do like

595
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,600
That's racism right there you got no information

596
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,136
Just like Netflix this

597
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,928
Supports my x-rays even worse

598
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,464
Because there isn't for

599
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:55,328
All right

600
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,680
Who's wanted that the police have put out a warrant for by the time he's on air

601
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,728
But he has every reason to

602
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,752
Not have

603
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,824
Narrative

604
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,616
Reality

605
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,152
Is not perception

606
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:09,920
Jordan

607
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,224
That's his top story

608
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,784
Is there is a reality

609
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:19,136
Unfortunately he's just trying to create a race

610
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,208
Trance I believe

611
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,488
Is profoundly race

612
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,280
Here's what happens directly

613
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,352
10 they're going to squeeze a couple bullets in your head

614
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,144
Your wife

615
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,424
In front of you

616
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,472
But it's okay cuz they're brown

617
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,008
White devil

618
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,360
The cartels write the

619
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:44,480
Porter's panics as well and everybody else to get their hands on because the evil is spreading

620
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:51,648
Is that we're here fighting because of your support have together

621
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:58,304

The cartels evil is spreading and they're going to rape your wife and then

626
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,456
Shoot you that's fine cuz they're brown your white Tahoe

Please go to my story

628
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,136
He's like a coin-operated races

629
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,672
Yep

630
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,952
So Alex

631
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:28,512
Saved starts complaining about how these

632
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,280
These proud boys

633
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,840
You're at your call this to Cowboys

634
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,120
He's got sentenced to four years

635
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,144
Prison

636
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,168
Forgetting other crimes

637
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,448
Sure Alex

638
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:39,264
Is pitching a narrative that they were just defending them

639
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,544
Themselves against antifa

640
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,128
Fair at all based on

641
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,408
Again reality

642
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,176
What does not

643
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,992
Perception operating

644
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,832
We've had hundreds upon hundreds of antifa

645
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,904
Quote people arrested and nobody's being

646
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,184
And there

647
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,024
Barely arrest anybody but everybody that every probably and all that

648
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,912
Whatever the case is Alex's found out that this judge

649
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,240
He's got he's been involved in other key

650
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:16,896
Does 20 do believe it's just a fresh judge what did he fight another judge

651
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:20,224
Judge fights another case that Alex pink

652
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,248
Indicates

653
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,552
That this guy is up to no good

654
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,856
You got the very same judge

655
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,416
Play The Proud boys all these years in prison

656
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,976
David admitted

657
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,256
Convicted

658
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,304
Pedophile

659
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,352
In New York

660
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,960
Almost no time

661
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,496
Inhale

662
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:46,848
There's a right here in prison for attacking

663
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:52,480
Rolling Stones

664
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:56,832
Water bottles

665
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,112
Protesters

666
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,136
Do they attack

667
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,160
Free Speech people

668
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,768
Total inversion haha

669
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,352
Who had Choice words

670
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,376
4

671
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,656
The proud boys

672
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,984
Did the Orthodox Jewish man

673
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,544
Has he had sex eight times

674
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,336
When a little boy

675
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,200
He gave him basically no

676
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:23,968
Shelton

677
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,248
Even though

678
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,040
He admitted it

679
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,464
To get this said right up top nothing I'm about to say should be interpreted in any way to mean that I think that this Orthodox Jewish man

680
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,536
And what he did was not as severe as what the proud boys

681
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:40,352
I'm not interested in grading horrible things on some

682
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,912
Some kind of an evilness scale like Alex's

683
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:43,936
I think they're both awful

684
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,008
That being said there's a reason that bruise

685
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,056
Leave it's received a lesser sentence

686
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:49,824
The proud boys

687
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,360
That has to do with the fact that

688
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:54,432
The proud boys plead not guilty and were found guilty

689
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,736
Which will always result in a longer sentence

690
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,504
For you

691
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,832
The two proud boys were found guilty were sentenced to four years in prison

692
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:05,184
But they weren't the only proud boys arrested after that game for fight New York

693
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:07,232
Two of them took plea deal

694
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,024
And only received community service

695
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:12,096
Others plead guilty and received sentences ranging

696
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,144
From 40 weekends where they're released

697
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,424
Go to work during the week

698
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,192
You can all that

699
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,728
I'm up to three months

700
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,752
Imprison

701
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:23,616
Like the people who cooperated and like yeah we were in a f*** it we're trying to find a ride

702
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:30,016
Generally speaking admitting your guilt to a crime you definitely committed is seen as a sign of pasta

703
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,576
It's often interpreted isn't it

704
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:35,136
Indication that you're on your way toward making amends

705
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:35,904
For your misdeed

706
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,440
Societal Stan

707
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,488
Sandpoint it's in everyone's best interest

708
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,280
To support that kind of behavior

709
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:45,632
In reality Bruce Lee prevent accepted a deal where he pled guilty

710
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,424
It was sentenced to two years in prison

711
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:50,496
He'd already he already served 13-month

712
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,800
So most estimates say that he's only going to be

713
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,568
Prison

714
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,104
A further three warbot

715
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,664
This could be interpreted as a 3-month cent

716
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,712
And spit in reality

717
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,504
You should already been about half sir

718
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:07,392
I don't know enough about the leave of its case to comment on it really at all or whether or not you should

719
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,672
Longer

720
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,464
But I know enough about these two stories

721
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,744
To tell you that the reason

722
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,304
Cowboys got slightly relatively longer sentence

723
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:17,376
Is because they took their chances on the trial and blew it

724
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,168
That's all it's going on here

725
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,728
Alex is trying to turn it into a thing where this judge

726
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,336
I love pedophiles and let them go fuc the proud boys

727
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,872
And that's just not the

728
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:32,480
Yeah I have no judge was the one who determined the sentence

729
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,784
I'm not entirely sure if it wasn't

730
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,344
Thinkware

731
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,136
So I don't know

732
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,672
But whatever the case I would

733
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,720
I have no interest in

734
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,256
Any right-wing arguments about

735
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,072
Disparities

736
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,120
They're all they're often

737
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,400
Ring false

738
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,192
So I don't know if you know this Jordan

739
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,472
Climate change

740
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:59,360
I know the ezine full recession we're finally getting back to normal

741
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,640
You don't know anything about this

742
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,664
Fair is that

743
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,432
Call Jaden

744
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,480
80's dress

745
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,504
Deploy in order to

746
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,784
Carbon tax

747
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:10,112
We all know that my brother told me that Obama Bots

748
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,648
Some property in Florida so we all

749
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,952
Alex's talked about that a couple times

750
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,768
But climate activism just back carbitex

751
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,304
Absolutely no

752
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,376
The consistent piece of Alex's rhetoric

753
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,144
You got it

754
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,168
Now

755
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,448
What's interesting

756
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,472
Is if you pay attention

757
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,056
Alex take some of his long-standing rhetoric

758
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,336
It completely

759
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:33,408
Will make you less lonely

760
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,200
Does junkie.com

761

The most

762
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:40,320
Alone in Jupiter not healthy and highest rate of suicide

763
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:43,136
I'm sorry are you quoting chunkys.com

764
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,512
Protest for carbontastic lovely painted the world richest

765
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,536
Stor-all exempt

766
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,816
And I will save the planet

767
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:56,192
How does the tide of the pedophiles where you're the globalist pedophile Rings you're involved in all this

768
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,592
How are you going to sell the public on letting them track everything you do

769
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,384
AI

770
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,688
Super removement you may

771
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,248
Exempt themselves

772
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,648
Jeffrey Epstein

773
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:18,720
Billionaires

774
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,000
Wall Street Journal

775
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,816

776
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,352
Groupon

00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:27,424
By Michael blumberg Ted Turner Oprah Winfrey

778
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,960
George Soros

779
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,240
Bill Gates

780
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:33,568
Rockefeller run by Jeffrey Epstein

781
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:39,456
A secret world government group to save the planet

782
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:45,600
I don't want to put too fine a point on this but I've heard Alex talk about this very same group of globalist billionaires 4 years

783
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:49,952
They were definitely discussed as far back as endgame which came out like 2,000

784
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,720
7

785
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:57,120
In every incarnation of his narrative the group has been Oprah Bill Gates Ted Turner the Rockefeller

786
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:03,520
Keller's sometime Soros when he realized I got to yell about this guy

787
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,544
Times Bloomberg

788
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,336
He's not always

789
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:08,896
Included

790
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:16,320
It's a it depends on what stage of his rhetoric is it always Bill Gates Oprah Ted Turner and David

791
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:19,904
It literally has never involved jeffry Epps

792
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:25,280
This is a completely new part of the narrative that Alex is adding because he knows the Epstein conspiracy

793
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,584
F****** hot pics

794
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,608
Yeah they're the

795
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,400
Play Summer's new winter

796
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:36,800
I don't know who wasn't wasn't connected with Epstein but I do know a whole lot about what Alex Jones is that in the

797
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:40,896
And he never said that Epstein was involved with this group much less running it

798
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,992
This is a very similar behavior that we see

799
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,272
Throughout Alex's career

800
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,552
He'll take hot topics

801
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:52,160
Some current events Andy bolts his rhetoric to suit them and pretend that he's always been on this

802
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:52,928
Case forever

803
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,792
He's definitely been yelling about this group you insist is dead said Auntie population forever

804
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:00,864
So if you look into it you'll find that he did talk about them a bunch

805
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,912
But he's completely changing the story now

806
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:09,056
I search through the archives of Infowars in prison planet and there are there are zero stories

807
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,616
They include the words Jeffrey Epstein on Prison play

808
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:16,736
Plan it before January 1st 2016 and there's only one on Infowars

809
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,272
Which is just a 25th

810
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,320
London examiner article the paper

811
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,088
Repost it

812
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,416
Is Alex knew about him as being the big player in the globalist

813
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,720
Machine Esurance s*** didn't

814
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,280
It does seem to have left much material behind reflector

815
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,560
On the website

816
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:37,472
That Wall Street Journal article Alex's siding doesn't mention Epstein it all one of the sources for That Wall Street Journal article is enough

817
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,264
Their article in the times of London

818
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,288
Which also doesn't

819
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,384
What does tell us that the host of that meeting was Sir Paul nurse

820
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:47,200
Who is a Nobel prize-winning biochemist

821
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,272
Putting it very bluntly Alex's just making this s*** out of

822
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,880
What Alex is doing is a cynical exploitation of a horrible story

823
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,440
He's taking the story that is very suspicious

824
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,512
And twisting things so the suspicion matches his own narrative

825
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,304
In an attempt to reinforce

826
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,584
Susceptibility

827
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,144
310 steps ahead of the globalist it all turns

828
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,168
And I find this

829
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,192
Behavior

830
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,216
Disgusting

831
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,520
In better times I think this would be

832
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:16,384
Yeah like in bed like this has all the classic

833
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:17,664
Like

834
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,944
This is the conspiracy

835
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,712
Very kind of

836
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:24,832
Then you know that it's this guy and then and it's all run by Epstein

837
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,368
We just sausage

838
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,904
Justly died and that's

839
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,440
Slim Dunkin

840
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,976
In 2000

841
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,512
No.10 we're all like

842
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,536
Hahaha you're crazy

843
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:37,632
If it's a friend and you're smoking weed and I'll be back chairs

844
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:41,216
It's a little annoying but kind of fun

845
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,264
The Logical conclusion of

846
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,080
Mainstreaming this kind of

847
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:48,128
Dumb conspiracy theories

848
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,920
And this is yeah it is right

849
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:52,736
It is if we used to be something that would be fun.

850
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,528
Now it's like you pull out one of these

851
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,296
Conspiracy theories

852
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,576
You know 6 people

853
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,856
Jesus

854
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,624
F****** cry

855
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:02,464
Alex brags about his courage

856
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,000
Baby boy

857
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,536
Is very brave boy

858
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:08,352
Any discusses how he had a moment

859
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:12,448
And I think you said when he ran away from his problems

860
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:16,288
No I think that he has a little moment

861
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,824
That reinforces

862
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,616
Some of the theories that I've been

863
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,640
Putting forth

864
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:26,272
Something Beyond courage and I'm not saying that to active it's not courage it's

865
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,040
Driven

866
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,576
Divide these people at

867
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,344
Angry

868
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,904
If I'm not doing enough but I never get rest

869
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:36,256
I never feel any satisfaction just more more get them get them

870
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,072
The Holy Spirit pushing me

871
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:42,656
This morning about 8:30 I had like 10 minutes of ecstasy

872
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:47,264
Just Envision in their defeat and knowing we're going to win and just

873
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,824
The Holy Spirit was so strong that good

874
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,640
Good good now we're getting were supposed to go

875
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:55,455
Because you don't care any what happened to your mouth

876
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,759
Totally committed and you know we're going to win

877
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,551
And you're calling on my power

878
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:05,951
Come down into the Earth through the people and they're doing it and tell them to that more that's what you're supposed to do John

879
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:12,351
On the Holy Spirit and on Jesus Christ intercessor to God and we will defeat these satanists

880
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,935
You're on the right track Jones

881
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,983
You're going to be a preacher

882
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,031
Oh okay

883
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:25,919
Oh I thought he was going to re-record ready to die by Biggie but apparently no

884
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,199
No he is gone

885
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:31,551
To be a preacher that sounds great I don't know how much to put in

886
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:34,111
Fake to put into that like I could just beat him

887
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,391
Rhythm

888
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:37,439
Do we have

889
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,975
Pretty strong indications

890
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,999
Is that Alex's

891
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:40,767
Becoming

892
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,559
Well he's always been religious

893
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,119
Larry Moore

894
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:51,519
And it does seem to look like a maybe you would be wise to Pivot this into a completely religious

895
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,055
Grab

896
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,871
These made too much trouble in the can

897
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:58,431
Spiritually and politics world

898
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:01,247
It seems like you should hit that ripcord

899
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:04,319
I'm trying scam on that level

900
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:07,135
You can go away you got to go away to come back

901
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,927
You got to go away to come back

902
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,695
Yeah totally

903
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:13,279
He can do it you can do it stuff like that

904
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,047
Like yeah

905
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:18,399
You know God is pushing me forward yes Jones yes you're going to be a preacher

906
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,703
I have a difficult time knowing whether I should

907
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,727
Interpret that is like

908
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:26,591
Hey what's coming is I'm going to start ripping religious late or if it's just

909
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,383
Play hey whatever you're doing now is

910
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,431
Yeah I'm not sure which it is

911
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,199
But it's

912
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,247
The most clear demonstration I think

913
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,783
So far that Alex

914
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,063
Sees himself as a religious

915
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:40,671
Talk about that in the last couple months to do you like

916
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:44,511
God is telling me to announce my leadership role

917
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,535
I think so

918
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,303
I don't know

919
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:49,631
To me like when he says preacher he would mean

920
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,191
Like biblical Prophet that

921
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,471
Accurate

922
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,519
Pronouncer of my words

923
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:01,663
Yeah there's some of that but it's hard to know for sure right we'll see how it develops I could be both

924
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:07,807
He's got to be in his Bonnet about how everyone is afraid of devil worshippers

925
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,087
But he's not

926
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,135
Already started

927
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:13,951
He starts graphically talkin about murdering

928
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:18,303
Oh okay great people are fighting back

929
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:20,607
Everybody just a sell-out to evil

930
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:28,799
You got everybody scared of you devil worshippers

931
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:31,359
We're actually scared of ourselves

932
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:34,175
Desire to stop you want to make sure

933
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:38,527
We spend our will and our blood and our energy and our

934
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,295
Force

935
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:44,159
Making sure we eradicate your system

936
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,951
We don't want to just

937
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,023
Fletcher throats

938
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,399
But I want to just beat your head in with baseball

939
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,871
Put on just one ice pick senior

940
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,151
Socket

941
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,943
Lobotomy

942
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,015
We don't want that

943
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,807
You want to get

944
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,575
Your spirit

945
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,599
Safeplanet

946
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,391
And out of our universe

947
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,183
We want you to go be

948
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,463
With your own satanic

949
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,231
Forces

950
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:25,119
You want you out of our world want you out of our Lives get behind me

951
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:30,239
I just I don't know how he classifies as a

952
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,031
But this is exterminator

953
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:36,639
Like I don't know what Woods it all Democrats

954
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,431
Eradicate Democrat

955
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:41,503
From the world where everybody every everybody knows that ever

956
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,295
Delaware

957
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:48,159
Appointed that all people who believe in global

958
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:51,487
Which is a real thing as opposed to

959
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:55,327
The globalist

960
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,607
Globalism

961
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,375
As a

962
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,655
Market

963
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,935
Strategy

964
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:03,007
Eradicate them from the Earth

965
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,287
Behind me

966
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,871
What I mean when you talk about

967
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:08,639
Killing Iran

968
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,175
And stuff like this

969
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,223
You notice he's also not saying political

970
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,527
We're past that

971
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:17,855
That the day of that is good when you talk about

972
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,647
Killing your specific political enemies

973
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,951
This incredibly f***** up and totally response

974
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,743
When you start getting it

975
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,767
Intuit as classes

976
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,535
Is a folks

977
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,559
That need to be

978
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:29,375
Driven off the Earth we need to get rid of this from

979
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,143
The Earth

980
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:32,703
You are in it in a territory

981
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,471
Yvette

982
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:38,847
I read what was it in that New Yorker article was talking about W Cleon skousen

983
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:42,431
And it said that he was that people were concerned that he's

984
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:45,759
Is rhetoric was getting dangerously close to Nazism

985
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,855
I wouldn't say that you're getting

986
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,647
Close to

987
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,183
Some ideas that are abhorrent

988
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,207
So we just

989
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,815
Can't have that kind of mentality we need to eradicate

990
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:03,423
Like is especially and that I know that he's not

991
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,703
Saying that all of his enemies

992
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,471
Are juice

993
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,007
Right he's not saying that

994
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,543
But

995
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,847
We've talked many times about the ways that

996
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:13,407
Classifieds in characterizes it as enemies

997
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,711
Relies largely on a lot of

998
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,735
Medikpro

999
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,503
From history

1000
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,271
Weather

1001
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:24,671
The ideas surrounding the blood libel or things that he's craved directly from the protocols of the Elders of Zion

1002
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,511
When you have that

1003
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,791
In addition to weenie

1004
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,559
Me too

1005
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,607
Eradicate people from the Earth

1006
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:39,519
You kind of got to recognize that some people who are listening are going to hear that way

1007
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,311
Whether that's your intention or not

1008
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,871
Whatever extremist you have in your audience

1009
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,431
May hear that is a call for ethnic cleansing

1010
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,199
On

1011
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,223
Some level

1012
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,271
Yeah you know I don't know

1013
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,599
So when we talk about Danger

1014
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:56,415
Usually close to abhorrent I think we're already there

1015
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,463
For some reason

1016
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,511
It seems weird that it's

1017
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,303
Less expensive than

1018
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,071
Let's target

1019
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,119
Do you know what I mean like

1020
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:08,191
Because most likely targeted then we'd be having a

1021
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:11,263
Completely different conversation

1022
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,287
That's

1023
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,311
F*****-up he wants to

1024
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,079
Kill this

1025
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,103
Subsets of the pop

1026
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:15,871
Population

1027
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,919
His actual rhetoric kind of tree

1028
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,199
Mayhem warnings

1029
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:19,967
The Kill

1030
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,783
75% of the world

1031
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:29,183
So what kind of imply that there isn't a strong

1032
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:35,583
Popularity for his ideas that would end up being classified as his enemies would be

1033
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,607
A lot of people

1034
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:40,447
So that is up

1035
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,727
Problem

1036
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:43,775
Like somehow

1037
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:46,079
It feels less important because he's in

1038
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,359
Equal opportunity once

1039
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,151
To destroy the whole f****** planet

1040
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,967
There is some of that but I think it's also

1041
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:52,735
You know

1042
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:54,783
You can't lose sight of the fact that be

1043
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:55,807
Because of that

1044
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,343
Serta vagueness

1045
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,623
Because of the

1046
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,903
Broaden

1047
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:06,047
Open to interpretation aspect of it you run the risk of whatever your audience

1048
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:06,815
Is bringing

1049
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,607
Table that confirming

1050
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,631
Something really bad in

1051
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,703
Oh absolutely so let's say it's somebody who hates

1052
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,471
Mexicans

1053
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:16,031
Do you like Mexicans

1054
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:21,151
It's not my fault have you seen their Halloween or whatever maybe

1055
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,711
Really opposed to taxes

1056
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:28,575
Have you seen the government that their devil-worshipers have you seen their Halloween or Christmas

1057
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,599
I don't know which one it is

1058
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:33,183
And then you could confirm the belief that we must eradicate all of these

1059
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:36,767
It's just irresponsible whenever whenever you have

1060
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,559
Apply for a like this

1061
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:41,375
You need to be very mindful of the things

1062
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,655
AliExpress

1063
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,191
I want your expressing

1064
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:46,751
We need to do more than kill these people

1065
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,543
We need to wipe them off the Earth

1066
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:49,823
You have

1067
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,847
Can't talk like the

1068
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,383
I don't I don't

1069
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,663
How

1070
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:54,943
I mean I understand how

1071
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,479
I don't I don't get

1072
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:59,039
Thank the person that can say

1073
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:01,087
Terrorizing

1074
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,367
Sing you like pee

1075
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,903
They're going to

1076
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:07,743
Rape your wife in front of you and then shoot you in the head twice

1077
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,815
And then not find himself being the bad guy

1078
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,607
I don't want to just

1079
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:14,911
Bash your brains out with a baseball

1080
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,447
I don't want to just

1081
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:19,007
Kill you I don't want to just do that like

1082
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:20,799
You're the best

1083
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:24,895
It's because his worldview is so

1084
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:27,967
Such an underpinning of it is the

1085
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:29,247
Constant

1086
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,527
Defensive violin

1087
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,575
He wants

1088
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:37,183
To do only top 25

1089
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:38,463
Carte blanche to do any

1090
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,487
Bingo

1091
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,511
I understand

1092
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:41,535
Nonsense

1093
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:48,191
So Alex also has James O'Keefe on the show on the 5th talk about his big new scoop but honestly

1094
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,471
Drop-in

1095
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,751
And it's just Alex Baker

1096
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,031
For more details

1097
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,847
That was James has coming up in James saying

1098
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,639
Stay tuned not giving

1099
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:57,663
No

1100
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,199
Well it's kind of a

1101
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:01,247
But in the sense that there is no information

1102
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,831
As far as just a commercial for project veritas

1103
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,367
And James is such a f******

1104
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:13,791
Recently project Veritas released a video of ABC news's Amy robach

1105
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:17,887
Saying that she had interviewed Epstein victim Virginia Roberts in 2015

1106
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:20,191
But that ABC didn't let the story go to a

1107
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,775
The way this video is presented it lends the appearance

1108
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:26,335
People at ABC were trying to squash the story

1109
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,615
And that this was a cover-up

1110
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,663
It's easy to come away with that impression

1111
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:33,503
But if you're listening to this show that you should know by now no matter what

1112
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:35,039
You are a sucker

1113
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,575
If you believe project veritas

1114
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:43,743
After the video was released robot clarified your comment saying quote I was upset that an important interview

1115
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:46,559
I conducted with Virginia Roberts didn't air because we couldn't

1116
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,607
Insufficient corroborating evidence

1117
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,679
To meet ABC's editorial standards about her allegation

1118
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:55,007
My comment about prince Andrew and her allegation

1119
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,287
She could see Bill

1120
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,055
Clinton on Epstein

1121
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:01,919
Private Island where in reference to what Virginia Roberts said in that interview in 2015

1122
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,967
I was referencing her allegations

1123
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,783
Not what ABC News had verified through our reporting

1124
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:10,623
The interview itself while I was disappointed it didn't tear didn't

1125
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,647
Meet our standards

1126
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:15,231
In the years since no one has ever told me or the team

1127
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,511
Need to stop reporting on episode

1128
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:20,095
I can't tell you how many people I saw who I thought

1129
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:24,959
New better retweeting that s*** saying well I guess project Veritas got one right

1130
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:28,799
It's incredibly depressing the people don't recognize the bad faith actors

1131
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:33,151
Aren't suddenly doing the Lord's work because they're saying something that's closer and lying

1132
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:33,919
Do what you want

1133
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:34,687
To believe

1134
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,991
Or what you think is right or accurate

1135
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,295
Project Veritas lies

1136
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,575
That's what they do

1137
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,599
It's their entire business

1138
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:45,439
Miss model right-wing education based on taking things out of context

1139
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,719
Conform to a narrative

1140
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:50,303
I know that everything around Epstein is very

1141
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:52,863
And further competent investigation

1142
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:53,631
And Reporting

1143
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,679
Has to be done on that story

1144
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:58,495
That is just never going to come from James okay

1145
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,823
There's another aspect to this that deserves match

1146
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,103
And that is the James okay

1147
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,639
Keith doesn't give a f*** about the f

1148
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:05,663
Story

1149
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:07,199
He's doing this to attack the media

1150
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:11,551
This entire thing is about attacking the institutions that have rightly excluded him

1151
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:14,367
I talked about how he's a lying manipulative she'll for right-wing

1152
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,135
Billionaires

1153
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:17,439
Ever since he and Andrew Breitbart got together

1154
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:20,767
Nothing about what he's doing brings anything to do to the Epson

1155
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:21,535
Steam story

1156
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:26,655
Literally the only thing that comes out of this is trying to attack the media that is all he cares about

1157
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:33,055
Also the stories that robot was describing were already reported prior to Rochelle dinner view by Gawker

1158
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:37,407
You might remember that Gawker was destroyed after a lawsuit brought by Hulk Hogan

1159
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:40,735
Which was paid for by f*** head libertarian billionaire Peter

1160
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:41,503
Teal

1161
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:44,831
Probably not important to point out the Peter Thiel has given James O'Keefe

1162
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:47,135
Santa Bonnie far back as 2009

1163
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:52,255
The very person who funded a lawsuit to put out a business one of the first media organizations that

1164
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:54,303
The cover the Epstein story is also wanted

1165
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,583
Easterly backer

1166
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:56,863
Life's weird

1167
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:00,959
So f*** all this s*** I don't care about James O'Keefe and his Nazi

1168
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:03,263
Yeah what was it we we talked about it

1169
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,543
On that day and it was Bass

1170
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:06,591
Why would I

1171
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:10,175
Don't listen to anything that they say ever

1172
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:13,247
However at least ever at least

1173
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,271
Don't take it if

1174
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,879
I will if there is anything that they have to

1175
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,927
Then it will be

1176
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,463
Filtered through

1177
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:24,255
Outlet that has f******

1178
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,279
Yes

1179
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:27,583
Why would I listen to them

1180
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,143
Yeah you can just walk

1181
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:33,983
I hate to say something like this but they have certainly deserved it

1182
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:36,287
Earned the reputation

1183
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:42,431
You can just write off but everybody.

1184
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,455
Any information

1185
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:45,503
In any way relevant

1186
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:49,599
Some other outlet that has Juno Independence

1187
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:52,927
Streaks do I will cover that story

1188
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,719
And with actual

1189
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,743
Affirming

1190
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,279
It's just

1191
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,071
The trash f****** Outlet

1192
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:01,375
And you know that because every time he comes out

1193
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:07,775
What the scoop goes on f****** Infowars talk about it any more proof that he's up to no good

1194
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,567
With this white identity

1195
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,103
The shitbag agitator

1196
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:13,919
And that idea of like all willy got one this

1197
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:14,687
Time Life

1198
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,479
In what world does he

1199
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:20,319
Picture story and then follow it through with reporting

1200
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,623
Like there's no it is purely

1201
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,927
Here is what we are going to say

1202
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:26,207
Find us a way to

1203
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,231
To say it that sound

1204
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:27,999
Right

1205
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,279
It is never going to be

1206
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:32,095
He accidentally stumbled onto good report

1207
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:34,911
So Alex jumps off from this topic

1208
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:37,727
Kenny gets to hey another race story that he's

1209
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,007
Is f****** completely lying a

1210
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:45,663
Well we know it's coming it's on infowars.com and newswars.com it's so incredibly important

1211
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:52,063
National Health Service to deny treatment

1212
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:54,623
The quote racist and sexist

1213
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:58,719
They control the jury of the leftist

1214
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,999
Mob and media

1215
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:04,607
They call you something

1216
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:06,399
And now you

1217
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:09,983
No jobs

1218
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:12,031
Healthcare no welfare

1219
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:15,871
I'm going to start off by saying that I'm not sure where I land on this story

1220
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:16,639
Entirely

1221
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:22,015
It's definitely not what Alex is saying it is but it does raise some moral questions that I'm not sure I have the perfect

1222
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,039
Weather for

1223
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:28,415
The way Alex is describing the story he's pretending that some board of leftists are going to accuse you of being a race

1224
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:30,719
Then when you go to the hospital with a broken arm

1225
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:34,047
They'll pull up your file and say sorry we don't treat racist

1226
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:36,095
And that's not even close to the reality

1227
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:38,143
I feel like if we do have that that week

1228
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:39,423
Rhodes

1229
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:40,703
Exelon

1230
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:43,007
Leftist Overlord

1231
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:43,775
Solutely

1232
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:46,079
This is not close to the reality which again

1233
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,871
Is not perception

1234
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:55,295
This is a story about the North Bristol trust company that Services hospitals in Bristol launching a new program called

1235
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,831
Aldi red card to racism

1236
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:02,463
In the program if a patient is being abusive to a staff member in a racist

1237
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,231
You're sexist way

1238
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:04,511
I'll be giving a warning

1239
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:05,535
Canary yellow car

1240
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:09,119
If they refuse to stop being racially abusive they'll get a red car

1241
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:14,495
And if it's safe to do so at that point they will withdraw from providing treatment for this page

1242
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:21,407
The program grew out of a large Spike and racist abuse being thrown its staff at the hospital and a recognition that

1243
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:23,455
No one should have to work in that sort of environment

1244
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,991
I definitely support that

1245
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:27,295
I think the program isn't Superbad

1246
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,831
Given that there is a warning

1247
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:33,183
And the fact they won't withdraw Services if doing so is unsafe for the page

1248
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:38,559
If a patient like needs a breathing tube they're not going to jeopardize that person's health because there were race

1249
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:45,471
If you have like a sprained wrist and you won't stop yelling racist s*** they're going to claim their space and refused to provide sir

1250
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,543
Dude it's really hard to shout rachell

1251
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,567
Pixel 4

1252
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:54,943
Or if you're on a defibrillator pacemaker or what

1253
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:57,759
If it's unsafe for them to withdraw services

1254
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:59,295
Can't do that in critical condition

1255
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:06,975
I'm at horn because my gut tells me that the medical workers should not make judgment calls about who they should help and who they should know

1256
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:09,791
Best kind of based on some idealized feelings

1257
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:10,815
I have about the profession

1258
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,911
At the same time the more I think about it these nurses and receptionist

1259
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,191
Some doctors their human being

1260
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:18,239
Not unfeeling healing robots

1261
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:23,871
If racist abuse has a problem that's reaching the point where it needs to be addressed at this Bristol Hospital

1262
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,151
I feel like I would be

1263
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,943
Be shity for my argument

1264
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:27,967
To be that these doctors

1265
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:30,271
Suck it up and deal with it cuz their profession as a

1266
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,039
The higher calling

1267
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:34,111
Is this weird thing where people who are known races

1268
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,647
Let's say David Duke

1269
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:38,207
I think they were being denied care even though he

1270
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:40,255
Acted politely at the hospital

1271
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,791
I think I would be against that

1272
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:45,887
But this program as it's laid out what ends up happening is solely based on the patients

1273
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:46,655
Behavior

1274
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:47,679
And I think that's okay

1275
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,471
Yeah I think that's alright

1276
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:53,823
If you're if you're a server

1277
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,383
And your table is hurling racist

1278
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,151
Abusive

1279
00:58:57,407 --> 00:59:00,479
There are so many places that won't allow you to say a goddamn word

1280
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:05,087
You know I think you should be able to do that absolutely

1281
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:09,695
And absolutely there is a difference between a hospital and a

1282
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,463
Restaurant there

1283
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:12,767
But people are still the same people who were

1284
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:14,815
Yeah so you're going to get

1285
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:16,351
Rihanna

1286
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,983
That's why I'm super conflicted because I'm on a human level

1287
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:24,031
I agree with that 100%

1288
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,335
Feelings about like

1289
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:29,151
The Hippocratic Oath

1290
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:31,711
Stuff yeah but I think I think

1291
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:35,039
Reply I'm on the side that I think of

1292
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,575
If there was no warning

1293
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,367
If they could

1294
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:41,951
Risk your life by withdrawing treatment because you're racist

1295
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,487
I would feel very uncomfortable

1296
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:45,791
But the way it's set up I think

1297
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,327
I don't know it's alright

1298
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,607
And it whatever

1299
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,375
Even if I have

1300
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,143
Some sort of like

1301
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:54,239
Mixed feelings about it the air on the side of being a

1302
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:58,591
In favor of

1303
00:59:58,847 --> 00:59:59,615
Completely dishonest

1304
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:02,175
Based on his perception right

1305
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:03,455
As opposed to reality

1306
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:07,039
I like I was more comedy clubs

1307
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:10,367
Galvanized

1308
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:12,415
Two strikes and you're out.

1309
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,695
Perfect yeah

1310
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:15,487
So it's November 5th

1311
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:17,023
Rodger Stone

1312
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:18,815
Trial is starting that day

1313
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:21,887
And Alex has a Rodger stone is sushi

1314
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,679
Name Jacob angles on

1315
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,447
To talk about

1316
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:28,543
Ingles

1317
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:31,615
Rogers lawyers on Isabel speaker

1318
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,407
Tamia Brown

1319
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:40,575
That does not at the tablet

1320
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:43,391
Rodger arriving

1321
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:44,671
Also folks were

1322
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:46,463
Bullhorn in there that Rodger Stone

1323
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,999
Did nothing wrong

1324
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,279
Full disclosure

1325
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:55,679
I believe that I've interacted with Jacob angles on Twitter before

1326
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,471
Marathons are pretty drunk

1327
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:01,311
While I was doing it so I decided to start weeding out some commentary

1328
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,079
Okay

1329
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:06,943
One of the people who came on Alex's Marathon was Jacob angles who was just there to talk about Rodger stone is

1330
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:09,759
I have no idea what I tweeted at him

1331
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:12,319
But I didn't add him I didn't add him

1332
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:15,135
It was just his name please

1333
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:18,463
Right right about 1

1334
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:22,303
About 2:01 segmented I got a response from

1335
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:25,119
It was surreal lose like the TV talking back to me

1336
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:31,775
Anyway I can't find our tweets but I don't remember them being too heated or anything I don't have

1337
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:34,335
Any like real memory of being like Oh my God this is

1338
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,103
Bucked up yeah

1339
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:38,687
I probably can't find our teeth because he got kicked off Twitter after you post

1340
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:40,223
Some islamophobic nonsense

1341
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:43,807
I know he's listed as a writer for Laurel Uber's website

1342
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:46,879
The things look like they're going pretty great

1343
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:48,159
Grant Hill isn't

1344
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,439
Shut that window

1345
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,719
He's also

1346
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:52,511
Probably a member of The Proud boys

1347
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,791
So

1348
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,839
Anyway he is on

1349
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:58,143
This is where the bombshell

1350
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:04,031
We got there today early ahead of Rodgers trial

1351
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:10,943
Immediately jury selection

1352
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:14,527
Was Nirvana communications director appointee

1353
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:20,927
Corrupt Obama era judge say

1354
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:25,023
Persons

1355
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:28,607
Customer service

1356
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,631
On their ability to be

1357
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,679
This is a sham

1358
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,287
Excuse me

1359
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:40,383
We didn't talk before you came on I follow a lot of your cupboards but missed last few hours

1360
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,431
You're telling

1361
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:49,087
Slow down and repeat Alex's completely caught off guard by this Alex

1362
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:51,135
No idea what the

1363
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:56,255
Start from the beginning was the word begin there and then

1364
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:58,047
Catch me up in a few years

1365
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,119
So this is news to Alex and he does not know what to do with it

1366
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,143
Hellboy

1367
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,959
Obama era

1368
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:07,263
White House communications director

1369
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,055
To be a juror

1370
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,895
In the Deep state

1371
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:21,855
You were there.

1372
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:26,207
You're not allowed to say the names of the individual

1373
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:27,743
But

1374
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:33,375
All I can tell you this Washington DC 97% of the District of Columbia

1375
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,959
So this is the generator

1376
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:39,519
Small Point Hillary got 90% of the vote.

1377
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,287
DC of the 20s

1378
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:45,151
60 election

1379
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:51,551
Even when the correct numbers still makes their point ridiculously hot it's like they're pathologically driven to

1380
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,831
Escalade

1381
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:54,623
Can't stop it couldn't be

1382
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:55,903
It couldn't be 90%

1383
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:56,671
Has to be 92

1384
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:58,975
Be the right numb

1385
01:03:59,231 --> 01:03:59,743
Yeah

1386
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:01,535
So Alex is immediately like

1387
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,071
Got a f****** figure out who this

1388
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:03,839
Person is

1389
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:07,167
Why don't they just have Robert Mueller as the jury

1390
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:09,727
Hillary Clinton

1391
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:12,543
Obama White House

1392
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:17,663
Communications director let's look up the names of who those folks were holy

1393
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:18,943
Mackerel

1394
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:19,711
Oh no that's

1395
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:28,927
I'm going to sic my Infowars people on

1396
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:31,231
Daughter and she's going to die I mean

1397
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:34,559
We can save that pretty confidently or at least that's what he wishes

1398
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:38,143
To happen prior Behavior

1399
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:38,911
Offensive

1400
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:40,447
Happened in the real world

1401
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:42,495
You know I don't I don't

1402
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,263
Find

1403
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:46,079
Any plausible argument that he's not trying to intimidate

1404
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:48,127
Play somebody for at least

1405
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,919
Tamper with the jury somehow

1406
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:52,735
Where are we're coming off Boston f******

1407
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:54,271
Marathon him

1408
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:58,367
Jumping into a story and releasing a picture of somebody who's not involved

1409
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:03,231
Within seconds of course this is going to happen it is going to be nightmare

1410
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:03,999
Now

1411
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:05,791
Whether or not you could prove

1412
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:08,095
In court that he's intending to intimidate

1413
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:08,863
Is another issue

1414
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:11,679
I think that I can confidently say it from my feelings

1415
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:13,727
Am I experiencing studying

1416
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,079
Yeah but in court I think you have a

1417
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,103
Much more difficult time

1418
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:19,871
Improving that in

1419
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,431
You thinking a jury of your peers you would

1420
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:29,599
It was Be Alright by 12 so Danielle

1421
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,879
Wow that would be rude

1422
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:35,487
So ankles wants to talking about how there was a bunch of

1423
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:36,767
People there to support Rodger

1424
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:39,071
And I just think that this clip is really funny

1425
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:39,839
Because Alex

1426
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:40,863
Interrupt

1427
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,655
Ingles to go to break

1428
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,959
But then he gets cut off by the brake

1429
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:48,799
There's a series of interruptions that happened at the end of this clip that I find pretty funny

1430
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:51,359
Communist train

1431
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:52,895
Protesters

1432
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:01,855
Came out to show sound

1433
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:07,487
Ingles the reporter that Rodger tone trust to cover the trial for him or come back to you

1434
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:14,655
Why

1435
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:20,031
Would you like to get back that full head of hair from years past

1436
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:21,567
It's insane

1437
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:25,407
He has no idea how to handle this story that's dropped into his lap

1438
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:29,503
So you have to go back to the Joy Behar

1439
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:32,063
Just has no timing so you've got off by the brain

1440
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:34,111
I love it

1441
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:37,183
So you gets back and here's how he introduces Jacob angle

1442
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:41,535
Central Florida Post

1443
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:52,031
The central Florida Post is a name that sounds like a newspaper it really does I should tell you that it is definitely not

1444
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:54,591
Okay it is a Blog that Jacob angles run

1445
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:58,431
Witchy names

1446
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:04,063

This is blog

1458
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:32,479
Good for Jacob for having some motivation and follow through

1459
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:35,807
I respect the hustle of naming your blog something it sounds like a newspaper

1460
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:37,087
But I can't give this a pass

1461
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,623
Use the term

1462
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:40,159
Theme parks socialist

1463
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:41,439
And I had lied

1464
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:45,535
This is not a serious Outlet

1465
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:49,119
Everytime I go to a theme park I'm like

1466
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,399
Socialist out of here

1467
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:53,983
So Alex is eight he's had the break

1468
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:55,519
To try and gather his

1469
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:56,543
Is marble

1470
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,847
And the story

1471
01:07:59,103 --> 01:07:59,871
Is that

1472
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,919
This juror had been selected

1473
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:06,271
For the jerk

1474
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,807
But this is how it goes

1475
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:14,463
Barack Obama's former

1476
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:18,047
Communications director at the White House

1477
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:20,607
Has been chosen as the first juror

1478
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:26,495
Such a circus the judges appointed by Obama

1479
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:28,799
First Church

1480
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:32,127
Almost over there

1481
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:34,943
So if your standard for who can

1482
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:41,343
Preside over a case of anybody who was appointed by Obama is invalid that's a f****** b******* standard

1483
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:46,975
You'll never get a fair trial out of a judge appointed by Obama it's

1484
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:50,815
It's a nonsensical standard of jury of your peers

1485
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:54,399
Partial judge

1486
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:01,567
Get a Reagan

1487
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:05,663
Maybe not

1488
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:06,687
So

1489
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:13,599
Also Alex is presenting this as the first jurors selected in reality what this is was Just Energy

1490
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:16,159
Reviewing people to be put into the jury pool

1491
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:17,183
Which then would be

1492
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,207
I'm downright

1493
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,743
It's a preliminary thing

1494
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,535
Okay this is nonsense

1495
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:25,119
Did you wasn't selected for the jury is the first round of cuts

1496
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:26,655
Another round

1497
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,191
You're going to have the jerk

1498
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:31,263
Yeah and the reporting on it and Reuters

1499
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:33,823
Was saying that the judge the reason

1500
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:37,151
She didn't exclude this person from the potential jury pool

1501
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,687
Was that they had said

1502
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:40,735
That they could make an impartial decision

1503
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:44,831
Yes bite their career despite the job that they formerly had

1504
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:45,599
Baker

1505
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:46,367
See this

1506
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,391
Impartially

1507
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:49,695
Right and that's the standard by which

1508
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:51,743
People are excluded or

1509
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:54,815
Included in the preliminary pool

1510
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:55,839
After that point

1511
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:57,119
You trim it down

1512
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:00,191
The prosecutor and the defense

1513
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:05,055
Attorney can say hey no on this person

1514
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:08,127
Can strike it for no reason and I have to have a reason

1515
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:11,199
So that's a natural part of the process

1516
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:12,735
If you are a sane person

1517
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:14,527
You would hear this

1518
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,295
And you would think

1519
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,063
Well

1520
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,855
There's no way she'll actually be on the

1521
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:19,135
No absolutely not

1522
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:24,511
So even though she'll never be on that jury is release her picture

1523
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,815
So a bunch of people can harass her until she

1524
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:30,399
70 fun

1525
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:32,447
But at this point on November 5th

1526
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:36,543
Alex decides alright Jacob angles isn't going to tell me who this person is

1527
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:38,847
So I'm going to pull up a list of communication

1528
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:45,247

1540
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,183
So here's the thing

1541
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:00,255
The reporting on this that was tweeted out by

1542
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:02,815
Damn it I regret that I don't have the person

1543
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:06,911
But there were people from like courthouse news reporters

1544
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:10,239
Tweeting out things along with the trial

1545
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,007
And it was

1546
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:12,287
Reported and writers

1547
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:15,103
That the person in question this juror this

1548
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:16,127
Potential juror

1549
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:20,223
Was a communications director for the office of budget and management

1550
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:22,015
Or management and budget

1551
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:24,319
Alex is reading off a list of

1552
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:25,343
White House

1553
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,391
So

1554
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,695
Has the wrong position

1555
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:36,095
Right and is just guessing names and has decided that it's this app on the Eyrie

1556
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:37,887
Don't understand

1557
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:39,935
How Humanity has gotten a

1558
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:40,703
As far as

1559
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:43,519
The list the real question

1560
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:44,287
Pulling

1561
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,567
Pencil people from

1562
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:49,151
Cannot include the person because he's using the wrong

1563
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:53,247

01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:26,015
What was the judge saying at this point

1571
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:33,951
I can say is from what happened today

1572
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:34,975
There was a

1573
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:38,047
Obama Communications

1574
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:41,119
Was allowed

1575
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,655
To be a juror

1576
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:50,079
They said that was no conflict of interest serving in the Obama Administration

1577
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:54,431
Her husband is a member of the deep State intelligence community

1578
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:56,991
Call Mary's husband

1579
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,527
Okay

1580
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:02,111
A lot of things but knowing other Wall Works

1581
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:03,135
Recover doing this

1582
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:07,231
What the hell you can't

1583
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:11,839
Call Maryann

1584
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:18,495
To lead the jury to convicting

1585
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,031
So what

1586
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:22,079
None of this is real

1587
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,871
But yeah

1588
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:28,479
Packing packing it called here what is it

1589
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:31,295
7:25 is America's gone

1590
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:38,207
Call it this is a ludicrous thing that's happened but it's partially because Alex got blindsided by this information and

1591
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:40,511
DeSoto roll with it

1592
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:43,839
He's decided it's this Jennifer Palmieri which it is not

1593
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:44,607
It cannot

1594
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:45,631
Cannot

1595
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:48,447
Nobody didn't just not if Tim

1596
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:51,007
Not he's building up with this case that it is

1597
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:52,031
That's

1598
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:58,943
Cookies rambling around a little bit and I really felt like he was trying to get to a plug

1599
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,735
Yeah but he just couldn't do it I thought

1600
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:04,319
I think that you'll feel the second wind

1601
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,855
I'm just going to say this right now

1602
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:11,487
Oh my God

1603
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:17,119
Looks like she work for the bill Amana Gates Foundation to all know

1604
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:19,679
Oh my God

1605
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:23,775
They're producing full TV shows

1606
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:27,871
The demon has been funded by Bella Monica

1607
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:34,527
People girolamo stop for the room at our guest

1608
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:40,927
That felt like you was trying to get you a plug I really thought that

1609
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:44,511
Because all of it the good doctor

1610
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:49,119
There's no evidence at all that I was in any way connected

1611
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,447
So great

1612
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:56,031
So stupid like that just the dumbest s*** I've ever heard in my life

1613
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,311
Are you really

1614
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:00,895
I shouldn't be surprised but

1615
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:04,223
The swiftness with which he came to

1616
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,527
One-hundred-percent certain

1617
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:07,551
Is

1618
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:08,575
Just kind of

1619
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:09,855
Astonishing

1620
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:12,671
Like right I've never gone from zero

1621
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:15,231
Still regret cereal choices from yes

1622
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:19,327
You know what I'm saying but you understand that this is partially like

1623
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,607
This is what he has to

1624
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:26,751
To do he has to stake a claim really fast

1625
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:28,543
Because all of this

1626
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,567
It really is

1627
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:31,871
Like okay we have something we got to run

1628
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:34,175
But this'll get a lot of attention

1629
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:35,967
If we out this juror

1630
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:39,807
Yeah I kind of feel like maybe this is one where everybody should have just

1631
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:40,575
Ignore them

1632
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:45,183
Yeah I think so too especially because from what I understand it's not typing

1633
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:45,951
Quickly illegal what

1634
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:49,791
Please do yeah it's disgraceful and also dangerous

1635
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:51,071
I don't know

1636
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:54,143
Actually know if I agree with you on the ignoring it thing because it is

1637
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,935
A really good

1638
01:16:56,447 --> 01:17:00,287
Present-day example of the sort of behavior

1639
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:02,591
To why he's a problem

1640
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:03,615
Know for sure

1641
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:07,967
And I think that there is maybe a teachable moment and it more so than a lot of times

1642
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:10,271
I see things being posted about Invaders like

1643
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:11,551
You guys should let this one go

1644
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:13,343
Schleich

1645
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:15,647
The thing there is

1646
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:18,207
Seems like the only way that he is going to get

1647
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:20,511
Enough eyeballs I

1648
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:21,535
Maybe

1649
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:25,375
We still don't know exactly what the size of his audiences

1650
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,655
But it is far less

1651
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:28,703
Then the amount of people who are going

1652
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:29,471
See it if it's

1653
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:31,263
Tweeted out by right-wing Washington

1654
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:37,407
Retweeted and so on and so it wasn't my position on it that I know you always like I think that this is a story that is worth

1655
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:38,431
People paying attention

1656
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,711
Do and knowing about

1657
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:43,295
Comparison to other times

1658
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:45,087
F******

1659
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:46,879
You don't don't like

1660
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:48,159
Turn him into a meme

1661
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,183
Yeah but this is

1662
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:52,255
Worthwhile but I also think that there is

1663
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:54,815
Responsibility to understand it in a fuller Conte

1664
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:57,887
Yeah as opposed to a little sound bite

1665
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:00,191
Of him saying that he's going to out the person

1666
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:03,263
Fisher understanding it within like how does this fit in

1667
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,031
Into his

1668
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:08,127
Strategies more generally what is he actually doing what

1669
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:11,199
And I think that those things are something that

1670
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:14,015
I don't know if it's missing cuz I haven't read all the coverage

1671
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,807
I'll be wrong of me to say that

1672
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:16,575
No one is

1673
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:18,623
Talkin about the larger picture

1674
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:21,695
But I think it definitely is Miss

1675
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,231
Jason from a lot of the

1676
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,279
On Twitter

1677
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:27,839
About about this particular

1678
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:30,143
There isn't more important thing

1679
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:31,935
That is part of this story

1680
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:33,983
Without focusing on

1681
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:34,751
Alex and under

1682
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:37,055
More than

1683
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:38,591
Most people care to

1684
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:40,895
There is there is a context that

1685
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:41,919
Okay

1686
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:42,687
That's what I would say

1687
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:43,455
Alright

1688
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:45,247
So in that last goodbye

1689
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:46,527
I told you he was

1690
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:48,063
It felt like you was trying to get you a plug

1691
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:49,343
I'm thrilled to announce

1692
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:51,135
He definitely was trying to get to a plug

1693
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:54,975
Put

1694
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:55,999
Obama

1695
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:59,839
Had Communications directors hell at the press secretary on there

1696
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:11,103
Time machine to go back to 1946 to the Nuremberg

1697
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:14,175
Trials I've literally

1698
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:20,319
Political affiliation is nothing to do with a juror then let Nazi Party members sit

1699
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:24,159
Judgement over the Nazis what a load of malarkey

1700
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:30,559
But they're murdering common sense cuz they can't be, since I'll say this briefly

1701
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:36,447
Oh

1702
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:40,287
40%

1703
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,847
That's almost whiplash

1704
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:45,151
Man that was just after the last

1705
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:48,991
Plugs

1706
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:54,623
Snuffy's of the Year under a child's we're out of Common Sense we're about the Ender specials

1707
01:19:54,879 --> 01:20:00,511
Do you got to watch out he definitely just got distracted by someone in his ear saying Bill and Melinda Gates

1708
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:05,631
In the middle of trying to get to a Goddamn

1709
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,399
What an idiot

1710
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:10,239
So Alex is pretending that the media is covering up

1711
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:12,287
The fact that this a potential juror

1712
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:13,567
I was formerly

1713
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:15,616
The office of budget

1714
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:16,384
Did management

1715
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,432
Very

1716
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,200
Very amazed

1717
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:20,992
Yep

1718
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:30,464
Not supposed to the media says they're not from Stella's

1719
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:38,656
What I saw this treated and real-time writers at

1720
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:39,424
An article that talks

1721
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,472
About it like this is no one's covering

1722
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,264
There is not behaving like

1723
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,800
Yeah that's all

1724
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:46,080
Cuz they understand

1725
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:48,640
Reality or

1726
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:50,176
Perception

1727
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:53,504
So Alex is like this judges in your face this

1728
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,040
Tyranny is so naked

1729
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:57,344
Know why

1730
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:06,048
It's because they're trying to teach you every single one of the people that are listening right now

1731
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,568
Then you will be punished

1732
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:19,872
You will be shamed you will be dragged for court

1733
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:24,480
Your finances will be deflated your family will be ruined

1734
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:30,624
Trying to do you know who the political

1735
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,072
Rubbing it in

1736
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:41,120
Yeah yeah that's what it is

1737
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,400
If you

1738
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:45,216
Probably committed serious crimes

1739
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:49,568
They want to make an example of you.

1740
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:51,616
That is

1741
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:54,432
That is that that level of like

1742
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:57,248
Why are we even trying to

1743
01:21:57,504 --> 01:22:00,832
Why am I trying to have a conversation with you at all about

1744
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:03,648
AT&T in partiality or impartial

1745
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,184
Potential juror

1746
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:08,000
It's not doesn't matter what they are if I said

1747
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:14,400
Voted for Obama he be like saying you can't vote for Obama and be a part on a jacket

1748
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:16,704
I just don't you both are applying enzymes

1749
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:19,520
And honestly I don't want to

1750
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:21,824
Oversell this

1751
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:22,848
I know exactly

1752
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,408
What's going on here I think it's very transparent

1753
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:26,176
If you watch

1754
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,200
Through

1755
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:28,480
The entire

1756
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:29,248
Episodes

1757
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:32,320
Things that he's done in the past

1758
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:34,112
It's very very obvious

1759
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:40,256
Yep totally so Alex

1760
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,024
Besides

1761
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,304
But he's going to go

1762
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:43,328
Cover Rodger

1763
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:53,056
New Albany hours to get here

1764
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:18,144
That how we end the show

1765
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:23,008
So that's a little bulshit but just to break up the 5th of May

1766
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:24,544
I forgot to play this at the

1767
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,080
The beginning so here's an

1768
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:27,360
Text drop from

1769
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:31,200
I have been in Satanic rituals

1770
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:32,224
I got

1771
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,504
Tricked into being out of twice

1772
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:38,368
Rue21

1773
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:42,464
Have you been fooled by the Nigerian

1774
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,488
Which is which

1775
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:47,328
Did the Titanic wreck

1776
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:49,888
Sonicare

1777
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:51,424
Stupid how do you get

1778
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:52,960
Second

1779
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:56,288
After that he clarifies our Bohemian Grove

1780
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:00,384
F*** off

1781
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:02,432
So we jump in here on this

1782
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:03,968
And Alex

1783
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:06,016
Announces that he's had a giant to pick

1784
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:08,320
About how the global

1785
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:09,344
So many of these

1786
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:12,160
Research

1787
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:14,464
And then I worked out real hard about an hour

1788
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:17,280
While the blood was Papa

1789
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:18,304
The brain

1790
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,352
I was having explosive

1791
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:22,656
Diarrhea

1792
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,032
Many layers of its structures David more than even

1793
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,128
What

1794
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:34,432
Fractal

1795
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:35,456
Design of it

1796
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:42,112
Sickening art form that basically is

1797
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,648
Critical

1798
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:46,208
Piece the puzzle I want to talk about

1799
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:48,768
So when I heard that I was like this is going to be disappointed

1800
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:50,560
No matter what he says

1801
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:52,864
He said 100 times

1802
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:56,192
And honestly I wasn't the Restless episode I'm not sure what it was

1803
01:24:56,704 --> 01:25:02,848
Oh well that's that's actually refreshing New Direction for him to go say that it's a disappointment

1804
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:08,480
But I don't know what the Breakthrough if there's any was I like that I like that

1805
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:11,808
Leave me in suspense maybe we'll get there

1806
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:14,112
It's very weird is that

1807
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:21,536
I had an epiphany that I still have epiphanies sickening

1808
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:23,584
Tactical system of Hannah

1809
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:25,376
I don't know

1810
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:27,936
I can't system is just fractally

1811
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:28,960
And that's what is Epiphany

1812
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:31,520
I'm not sure what it was but this

1813
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:32,544
Next clip

1814
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:33,568
Was nuts

1815
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,336
Surprising in any way

1816
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:36,384
Mention the first thing

1817
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:39,200
In the next hour

1818
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:39,968
When

1819
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:42,528
Criminal lawyer constitutional lawyer

1820
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:51,488
Several lawyers last night and was a Barnes this morning

1821
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:53,280
41 on air

1822
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:57,632
And George Soros and

1823
01:25:57,888 --> 01:26:01,728
Media Matters out fit are really upset right now

1824
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:06,336
I want to pull the wool over our eyes as we all know

1825
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,432
In the courtroom

1826
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:14,528
It was completely blown away

1827
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:15,296
When

1828
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:17,600
A known Obama official

1829
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:19,904
Department

1830
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,440
Husband

1831
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:24,768
As opposed to lawyer at Obama's apartment

1832
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:25,536
Hugs

1833
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:26,304
Pacifica

1834
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:39,104
Lawyers raise this and tried to strike

1835
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:42,432
The first girl they looked at she was waiting

1836
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:44,480
Show me the jury Foreman watch

1837
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:48,576
So when Alex is talking about this juror on these these two shows

1838
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:51,136
He's absolutely lying about something very important

1839
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:52,160
Which I've already brought up

1840
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,720
And that is what they're saying that you was chosen to

1841
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:56,768
To be a member of the jury that are not the case

1842
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:59,584
I just stated that the trial is at

1843
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,632
They were just interviewing potential jurors

1844
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:04,192
This process would go on and result in a jury

1845
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:06,752
After that pool is pick that the prosecution in

1846
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:08,544
Advanced love you bility to strike people from

1847
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,848
From the pool which is almost certainly what would happen if

1848
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:13,664
All the typing is that the judge was in

1849
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,456
Indicating that you didn't feel that this person

1850
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,736
Past job was enough to

1851
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:18,784
Preclude her from being a potential juror

1852
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:20,064
Which I think is fair

1853
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:25,696
If you end up trying to put in place a standard that a jury of your peers has to mean they all politically agree with you

1854
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:27,232
No cult member or extremist

1855
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:29,024
Would ever be charged with anything

1856
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,048
In court ever again

1857
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:35,936
Does Alex imagine that the proud boys for example all have to be tried in front of a jury of Western chauvinist

1858
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:37,216
It's ridiculous

1859
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:40,800
I've read up on this little and from what I understand

1860
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:42,336
What Alex is doing is not

1861
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:43,104
Specifically a league

1862
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:46,432
What is a Deep Reach of what people consider proper behavior

1863
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:48,224
It would become illegal

1864
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:49,504
Very illegal

1865
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:53,344
If you were specifically trying to out this person with the intention of until

1866
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:56,672
Now we both know like we've already discussed

1867
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:58,208
That's exactly what he is doing

1868
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,768
But proving that in court would be insanely difficult

1869
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:02,816
So Alex is probably legally in the clear on

1870
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:06,400
Ethically though this is a huge affront to our courts this

1871
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:09,472
Your identities are not something that people are supposed

1872
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:11,264
Discuss until the trials Arkham

1873
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:12,544
And even then

1874
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:15,360
Generally only if the jury decides to come forward

1875
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:17,152
That's kind of a crucial

1876
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:18,432
Part of the appearance

1877
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:19,200
Sublime just

1878
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:23,552
That these jurors can feel empowered to make an unbiased decision even against

1879
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:25,088
Powerful or dangerous person

1880
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,368
Who are on trial

1881
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:29,440
Because they know that they aren't necessarily their is themselves

1882
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:30,976
They're representing all of us

1883
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:36,096
In effect their individual identity is supposed to blur into the hole while they're serving as jurors

1884
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:38,400
Outing jurors identity makes

1885
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:39,168
This way

1886
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:41,984
Santa introduces into people's minds

1887
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:44,032
The possibility that what they do in a jury box

1888
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:46,592
Won't stay in that courtroom and could ruin their lives

1889
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:47,872
Now it's so easy to

1890
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:53,248
Chargers for Mafia guys because they knew that nobody would put their name out and they would be

1891
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:56,064
Say forever and ever

1892
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:59,648
Ultimately I don't think that Alex's primary goal is didn't

1893
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:01,696
Potential church

1894
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:05,024
He wants to create a gigantic public spectacle that gets him

1895
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:06,304
Which he is at

1896
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:09,888
It's so sad that the only ways he can get any attend

1897
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,936
These days it's a roll around town in a

1898
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:14,752
Or behavin culturally destructive ways

1899
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:16,800
That are right on the cusp

1900
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:17,824
Albion huge Valley

1901
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:24,224
The other goal he has his create a pre-emptive justification for why Rodger is going to be

1902
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:24,992
Be found guilty

1903
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:26,528
Alex

1904
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:29,088
Because he's worked with Rodger and was around

1905
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:35,744
Knows that Rodger is guilty he's so guilty he knows he specifically told Rodger to get in touch

1906
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,280
Wikileaks and guccifer

1907
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:38,816
He's the most guilty

1908
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:41,888
Play clips of him talking about that on the show

1909
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:46,240
He knows that Rodger was coordinating with his other employee Jerome corsi on the

1910
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:50,080
Alex knows that Rodger is more than likely going to prison

1911
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:53,920
So now it's important to have a narrative in place before that happens

1912
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:55,968
This potential juror is

1913
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:56,736
Perfect for that

1914
01:29:56,992 --> 01:30:00,320
Because now no matter what happens this trial is defective to Alex

1915
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:03,136
It doesn't matter if this juror doesn't make the jury

1916
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:04,416
Her very existence

1917
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:09,792
Into the potential pool of jurors will be used as the talking point for why Rodger is a political prisoner

1918
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:16,192
Not a criminal

1919
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:23,104
Nixon tattoo on his head that is why it's what he's primarily

1920
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:24,640
It's just damaged

1921
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:27,712
But it's damage control this very dangerous

1922
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:32,320
And could put this person through a whole lot of unnecessary trouble and if it does

1923
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:33,856
I sincerely hope she sues

1924
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:36,160
Because I think that is behavior here

1925
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:37,440
Is

1926
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:41,024
The sort of thing

1927
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,840
Wow she might not stay in the neighborhood very long

1928
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:47,424
I'm still on board with that she might have been a suspect

1929
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:51,264
Look for a day cuz I end up naming the juror

1930
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,544
And it's not her

1931
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,336
Oh God he actually does

1932
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:58,432
What an idiot

1933
01:30:58,688 --> 01:30:59,200
He's lying

1934
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:00,480
About her being chosen

1935
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:02,528
You talk about that a little more

1936
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:03,808
She should be

1937
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:07,904
And the judge said no she's unsure

1938
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:10,976
The woman said

1939
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:14,048
Do you have a dog in this fight for quotes or she doesn't know

1940
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:16,864
I don't care one way or the other

1941
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:18,912
He's first in line ready

1942
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:19,680
Audien

1943
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:21,216
And the judge

1944
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:23,520
Laser scar cat pictures

1945
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:25,056
On the Constitution

1946
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,360
Family Show

1947
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:28,640
Family Show

1948
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:29,408
Okay

1949
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:34,016
So Alex Moxley idea that people might think that what he's doing

1950
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:35,040
Easily

1951
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:36,320
Because he thinks

1952
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:37,856
But he's just being a journalist

1953
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:44,256
Matirko Jones arrested for jury tampering and harassing jurors

1954
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:50,400
It's completely legal and lawful

1955
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:52,448
What time was the public figure

1956
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:06,016
What was Chelsea Clinton

1957
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:11,392
Yeah but what if it was Bo Jackson went Medical

1958
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:16,768
We're going to release it

1959
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:23,168
Because that's what the Press does other than war on the Preston

1960
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:24,960
Alright

1961
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:31,360
There's a war on the president your pleaded you're deeply involved

1962
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:32,384
Warren

1963
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,664
A couple of really quick point

1964
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:37,504
It's 1 Alex says that it's legal and lawful which is a Barnes

1965
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:38,784
Catchphrase

1966
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:42,624
So I know that you saying that based on meetings with Barnes

1967
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,672
That linguistic check

1968
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:46,720
Is very specific to Barnes

1969
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:48,000
So that's cool

1970
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:50,816
Second I read the Media Matters article in a dozen

1971
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:51,840
David Alex go to Primm

1972
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,656
Ridiculous Behavior

1973
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:57,984
He's just making that up as a straw man

1974
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,544
Soul Fu think

1975
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:01,824
This show is all

1976
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:02,848
Just about

1977
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:07,200
This a potential juror know Alex also has to get into disgust

1978
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:07,968
Sing Rance

1979
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:09,504
About drag queen story time

1980
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:10,528
What why

1981
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,344
Assault

1982
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:16,160
Letting

1983
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:22,560
Men dressed as women in clown outfit outfits have access to your children

1984
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,632
In-N-Out event

1985
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:29,472
Is a fully mark their territory for assimilation and destruction

1986
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:33,312
McDonough City Council

1987
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:38,432
We must have access your children's the beautiful thing we're going to do with them

1988
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:40,480
This is lovely this is wonderful

1989
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:41,760
We are here to groom them

1990
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,672
Blind

1991
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:56,864
Because they're uncloaking

1992
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:04,800
You want to murder them they want them

1993
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:09,664
Whale song

1994
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:22,208
Pretty offensive and it seems really disjointed from our episode and it is a little bit

1995
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:23,488
I wanted to play that

1996
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:25,024
Is because like it's gross

1997
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:25,792
It's sickening

1998
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:29,376
But at the same time when I was listening to it one of the things that I couldn't

1999
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:31,168
Help but think I couldn't

2000
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:32,448
Stop thinking this is like

2001
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,752
That is B that's was by the book

2002
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:41,152
That's like it really felt like he was on autopilot just totally

2003
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:42,688
Jacob Li the commentator

2004
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:45,504
All of the little beets that were along the way it's a

2005
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:46,528
This is

2006
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:48,064
Boilerplate

2007
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,856
Yeah that really

2008
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:52,672
Juxtaposition of how like sickening

2009
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:56,000
That rhetoric have and how wrote

2010
01:34:56,256 --> 01:35:00,096
It is in his just delivery it's just rattle off

2011
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:02,400
No problem

2012
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:08,800
Don't even worry about it you need me to fill five I got five

2013
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:12,384
I'm sure that you've been there as well where you're doing along set

2014
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,432
And you were you're doing a chance that you've done

2015
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:18,272
For five years and all the sudden you realize you're thinking about

2016
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:19,552
Something else while still talk

2017
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:25,952
You were like oh s*** I'm still on stage holy-cow number stories that I told hundreds of times

2018
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:28,256
Yeah and like I just could do it

2019
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:32,096
Yeah absolutely and that's how it feels

2020
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:32,864
Here

2021
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:33,888
And that's

2022
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:36,448
Gross disgusting

2023
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:39,776
Really weird how

2024
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:40,800
Normal

2025
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:41,568
For him

2026
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:43,104
Things that are horrible

2027
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,640
Lahore

2028
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:48,992
Alex get back to the

2029
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:52,320
Like a fire-and-brimstone preacher in like the Medieval Age

2030
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:54,624
Medieval era of just like

2031
01:35:55,136 --> 01:36:00,000
Oh you're just you're just screaming let's kill the Jews all the time and you're fine with it it doesn't even bother

2032
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:06,912
Yeah yeah it's it's a drawing it's one of those things do that I always have to

2033
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:07,680
Reconsider

2034
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:09,728
Is like how inundated I am

2035
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:10,496
With Alex's

2036
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:11,520
That like

2037
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:13,824
Nothing. It's kind of hard to shock

2038
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,616
Give me whip is rhetoric

2039
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:16,896
And that's that's

2040
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:18,432
Like that clip

2041
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:20,992
If you're introduced to that

2042
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:25,600
Without the context of listening to tons of Alex

2043
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:26,624
For us it's

2044
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:27,904
Been out hey

2045
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:30,464
It's just Alex talkingshit

2046
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:34,560
While it's it's a it's a gross place that I've come to in my life

2047
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:35,584
I think was

2048
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:38,400
Interesting about that for me is that it makes it

2049
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:41,472
Even more disgusting whenever I hear it from anyone else

2050
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:48,128
Sure like from Alex I'm just like oh yeah f****** whatever you're going to drink blood and Gotti I Know This is your marketing

2051
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:51,456
But if I hear from like a human being

2052
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:52,480
That's just

2053
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:53,760
Fine I'm like

2054
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:55,040
You are

2055
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:59,136
What are you doing your f******

2056
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:00,928
You took a fade yeah

2057
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:02,976
So Barnes is on

2058
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:08,608
Sure cuz it's a day and it's Alex's shows at 1.

2059
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:10,656
He has a

2060
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,704
Distinct way of looking at

2061
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:16,288
Organizations were pushing back

2062
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:22,944
Saying that to the identity of the jurors could be disclosed its

2063
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:27,040
Give me the media

2064
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:38,304
What

2065
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,072
1860s

2066
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:45,472
African American

2067
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:47,776
Precisely what took place here

2068
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:50,080
That is not precise wow

2069
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:55,712
That is not to place you upon for a big swing

2070
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:59,296
Every time we've seen him on the show he has at least one big

2071
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:01,344
Cut you know yeah that's taking it

2072
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:05,440
Answer this is what he's bringing to the table

2073
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:08,256
Is highlighting jury bias

2074
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:10,560
Austin was only exposed when they

2075
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:16,704
Information

2076
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:19,520
What protects a trial in this country is open

2077
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:23,104
Repressed that's right we're going to bring that power back

2078
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:26,432
By sheer force of will we're going to expose

2079
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:28,992
The first one

2080
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:33,344
Brought up by the judge that work for Obama the Bill Gates Foundation whose husband

2081
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:37,184
Deep inside the operation with the fake Russia Gatehouse On The Other Side

2082
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:39,488
So now that Alex is spoken with barn

2083
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,048
And Barnes is there he's being a little more careful

2084
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:43,840
Because he is saying pretty active

2085
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:46,656
So that is interesting

2086
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:48,192
That is sort of a changing

2087
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:50,752
Maybe it's just an updating of information maybe he

2088
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,544
Sincerely believed earlier

2089
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,872
That she was chosen

2090
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:57,152
I don't know I don't know what it is

2091
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:58,432
Conversation

2092
01:38:58,688 --> 01:38:59,456
Barnes is like okay

2093
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:00,736
Here's what you have to

2094
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:03,296
To tell the truth about here's what you can lie about

2095
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:07,648
Things right but we can't say for sure is that Barn

2096
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:08,672
Absolutely

2097
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:09,440
Advised

2098
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:13,536
Yeah he said

2099
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:14,304
Absolutely

2100
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:15,584
That is your right

2101
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,864
Alex it's your duty

2102
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:21,472
The name of the woman who's been picked as the first person

2103
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:23,520
They tried to strike her

2104
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,616
Wait till Robert Barnes

2105
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:29,920
Steve lawyer

2106
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:33,248
Rodger Stone

2107
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,296
We all feel for we have empathy

2108
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:37,088
Do we know where next

2109
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:38,368
Literally

2110
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:43,744
Yes

2111
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:49,120
That is not a that's not how that works

2112
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:51,936
That's narcissism by proxy

2113
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:54,496
That's that that's

2114
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:58,592
It's interesting though I mean like if you have that is his definition of empathy

2115
01:39:58,848 --> 01:39:59,360
Yes

2116
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:01,408
Looking outfit hurts me

2117
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:03,968
Yeah if this is an indication of

2118
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:05,504
Something bad that's

2119
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:06,528
Tumi

2120
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:08,064
Experience it as bad

2121
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:09,088
That is not empathy

2122
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:12,928
Anyway on the last episode on November 5th

2123
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:14,720
Alex said

2124
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:20,608
Angles that angles was going to come back on as well as Tyler Nixon Rogers lawyer

2125
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:21,888
Not going to happen or no

2126
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:27,008
Stone people they're so scared they won't even talk. I said

2127
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:28,544
The judge is going crazy

2128
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:29,824
It's about an hour ago

2129
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:31,360
That just about an hour ago

2130
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:34,944
The judge is going crazy

2131
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:36,736
We can't talk about anything

2132
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:38,528
Well you know it's about this

2133
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:41,088
We had mystery angles on

2134
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:48,256
I'm going to show you

2135
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:49,280
What he said

2136
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:53,376
Be arrested for this

2137
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:54,912
Jury tampering

2138
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:58,752
Many batters didn't say that the article that I I read about this

2139
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,056
I don't know what I was talking about

2140
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:03,872
I would assume that maybe Rodger told them

2141
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:04,896
To go on

2142
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:07,456
I would I would assume that that's a possibility

2143
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:08,224
Because

2144
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:14,624
Rodger is I I know what Alex does you've done enough like we've create

2145
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,160
Faded the piano of

2146
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:22,048
If I found guilty that I'm little prisoner The Narrative is in place you can only do more damage

2147
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:28,448
You bought you wrote there's only down for you to go the more you talk the worst to anybody who's actually associated with

2148
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,496
Concretely my lawyer bias

2149
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:31,776
Jacob angles

2150
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:34,080
Just stay away from that for now is

2151
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:35,616
Is too hot

2152
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:39,200
Angles nail that here's what he did and he said that there was a juror that had that in

2153
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:40,736
And then he winked

2154
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:47,136
Yeah we're coughed or waived a little bit another f****** word you threw the bomb

2155
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:47,904
Yep

2156
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:50,976
Whatever kind of metaphor you want to make like

2157
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:53,024
Is

2158
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:55,840
In the clear of whatever Alex's actions are

2159
01:41:56,096 --> 01:42:02,240
He just said something that you started

2160
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:07,360
Yep well again baby not cry

2161
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:09,664
Crimes against civility

2162
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:10,688
But the Alex

2163
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:11,712
Now announcers

2164
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:12,736
We're out there

2165
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:14,528
Then they called the first match

2166
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,464
Lawyers from trying to strike the very first one a woman

2167
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:24,000
Who wants to

2168
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:25,280
Excommunication

2169
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:26,048
Director

2170
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:27,840
For the White House Office of man

2171
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:31,168
Under

2172
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:35,008
Democratic President Barack Obama and his Husband is a justice department

2173
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:36,800
We look them up

2174
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:39,104
We're going to expose him as well right now

2175
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:40,640
Next

2176
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:48,832
He keeps teasing this out because obviously you want people to know he's going to yeah

2177
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:49,856
Hey

2178
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:56,256
The stunt stop in your car right now I'll roll down the window scream over Alex is about to reveal the

2179
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:58,304
So he's now learned that it's a

2180
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,072
Communications

2181
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:00,352
The director for the office

2182
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:01,376
Disadvantage mint budget

2183
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:04,960
Which means that it's not Jennifer pompieri we said the day before

2184
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:08,288
And keep in mind that he says that he's dug into this husband

2185
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,568
End of her shift

2186
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:11,360
Deep State operative

2187
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:15,200
We'll see what kind of deep research is going to present on that

2188
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:16,992
I like that

2189
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:20,576
The Office of Management that's the important one that's where the money is

2190
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:21,856
No one

2191
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:24,672
Has ever described as being

2192
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:25,696
The one where the money

2193
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:30,816
Alex's got barns in

2194
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:37,472
He knows that if this is presented in such a way that it appears that Alex is intimidating a juror

2195
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:40,288
Yes then he could be in legal trouble

2196
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:45,152
So he has to explicitly say that they're not doing that

2197
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:46,176
You might argue that

2198
01:43:51,296 --> 01:43:53,088
The juror at already prospective juror at all

2199
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:03,584
John Gotti son

2200
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:08,192
I would argue that his audience that he's cultivated over the years

2201
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:11,776
They're digging into things and seeing if things are on the up-and-up

2202
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:12,544
Is

2203
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:15,616
But you really identical to harass

2204
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:16,384
Yeah

2205
01:44:16,896 --> 01:44:22,528
Historically speaking I do not trust them to be a Brain Trust of good researchers

2206
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:25,856
That is what you call a disc

2207
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:29,952
Barnett's Barnes throwing out a Alex if we're cutting wow

2208
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:31,744
Wow

2209
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,096
That's and that's if he even do it well he did it in I'll still sounded like a

2210
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:37,376
Look

2211
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:38,144
Nobody

2212
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:38,912
Wants

2213
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:41,472
Anything bad that nobody wants anything bad happen

2214
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:43,008
Less than we do

2215
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:48,896
We don't want anything to happen the most bad and that is why if you don't give us 100 grand

2216
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:50,176
We're going to release your

2217
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:52,480
We don't want

2218
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:53,504
Nothing bad to happen

2219
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,040
Yatso Alex's

2220
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:56,064
Pretending

2221
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:59,904
And announcing this as we have the person

2222
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:03,744
We know this is the person who is the potential juror

2223
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:05,792
Which makes it bad that this is

2224
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:06,816
How is describing

2225
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:11,680
Well by process of elimination

2226
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:12,960
Pointers

2227
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:18,592
Department

2228
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:23,456
International Espionage affairs

2229
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:26,016
There's only one

2230
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:28,064
Public relations officer budget manager

2231
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,928
She was there in 2000

2232
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:34,976
Thirteen 2014

2233
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:36,768
So he's gearing up

2234
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:39,840
You knows what that guy said next segment we're going to do this

2235
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:44,704
Bill is not going to f****** put up and say this person's name

2236
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:45,728
Just yet

2237
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:46,752
He has to

2238
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:47,520
Make this even more

2239
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:50,848
No Republicans are allowed on the jury

2240
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:51,616
But

2241
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:53,152
As he saying that

2242
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:54,176
Barnes

2243
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:55,200
Comes in

2244
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:57,248
I don't know how to describe this

2245
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:01,088
But I feel like this is a little bit sex

2246
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:04,672
To see how this judge is not letting any Republicans on

2247
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:12,096
Is professional class background

2248
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:13,632
Obama appointee

2249
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:17,472
Sort of looks like what Hillary would look like looks like you're iconic

2250
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:20,288
Picture of Obama phone

2251
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:29,760
People who would have otherwise been first grade teachers

2252
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:34,112
With the power of the judge

2253
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:40,512
1

2254
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:46,912
Way to hear that I think it's difficult to hear that outside of like these women belong is first grade teacher

2255
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:47,936
Is not in government

2256
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:49,728
I don't belong in public office

2257
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:51,264
Like I don't

2258
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:54,336
I don't know what point he's trying to make other than that

2259
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:55,360
What

2260
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:56,384
Does

2261
01:46:56,896 --> 01:46:59,456
She looks kind of like what Hillary Clinton would look like

2262
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:01,504
Even me I'm not sure

2263
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:07,648
I don't care that much if it's just an insane safe it's just an insane sentence

2264
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:08,416
Yeah

2265
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:12,512
So in the next quit Barnes lies a little bit more about the selection process

2266
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:15,840
Employed

2267
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:19,168
Only people with a personal bias against Rodger Stone

2268
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:20,704
We're going to be exploded

2269
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:23,008
Who had a strong bias against Trump

2270
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:29,152
Was going to be exploded

2271
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:31,712
Robert Barnes is a goddamn liar

2272
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:35,552
Allow me to read to you from the Reuters article that Alex's reference

2273
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:36,576
Many times

2274
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:37,600
On this episode

2275
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:43,232
The headline of the story is quote longtime Trump advisor Rodger Stone takes ill during jury selection

2276
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:44,000
A trial

2277
01:47:44,512 --> 01:47:45,280
Here's what it says

2278
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:46,304
Quote

2279
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:49,120
Some prospective jurors were excluded because they

2280
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:52,448
Indicated they could not put aside their dislike of trump

2281
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:59,360
Bias against Trump was definitely disqualifying for jurors Robert Barnes just made that s*** up to make it look like this

2282
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:02,176
It was happening with Rodger it's some kind of a setup

2283
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:05,248
That's because they need that to be the perception

2284
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:07,552
Not to the reality that perception

2285
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:10,112
Because they know he's f****** guilty as s***

2286
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:11,648
And they need pre-emptive spin

2287
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:14,720
Robert Barnes is not a lawyer he is a propaganda

2288
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:17,024
If Rodgers found guilty

2289
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:19,072
What does that mean for this entire operation

2290
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:21,376
Rodger was working at Infowars app

2291
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:22,144
At the time

2292
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:25,728
He was disseminating his info information on Alex's show

2293
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:28,544
His emails that involve the planning and coordination

2294
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:32,384
Those were between himself and Alex's other employee Jerome corsi

2295
01:48:32,896 --> 01:48:34,432
If Rodger is found guilty that

2296
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:36,224
Deuces some really hard question

2297
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,272
For Alex that he'd rather not deal with

2298
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:43,392
So the best way to do that is to preemptively argue to the audience that this case is a sham

2299
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:45,696
So no matter the outcome it means nothing

2300
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:52,608
It's the perfect strategy if your audience is stupid because if Rodger ends up acquitted then you get to say that they tried to Railroad Ave

2301
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:54,400
He was so innocent that he still won

2302
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:56,192
He's all just parlor

2303
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:59,264
Who's all that Alex has this is all that he does

2304
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:00,800
Which shouldn't be surprising

2305
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:03,616
With a little more offensive is that he's a lawyer is

2306
01:49:03,872 --> 01:49:04,896
Complicit in this charade

2307
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:11,808
I don't know how your ears many hats Dan on TV puts that propagandas had on its

2308
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:12,832
Is Maga

2309
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:13,856
Give me money

2310
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:16,416
And then when it gets out the door and puts the hat on

2311
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:19,744
It says I'm a bad lawyer I don't know how this process works

2312
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,024
But I think

2313
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:21,792
That

2314
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:23,328
Barnes's license

2315
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:27,936
Absolute let's see if this is

2316
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:31,776
Becoming behavior of someone who is

2317
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:33,568
Allowed to practice law

2318
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:35,360
I don't know that it is

2319
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:38,688
So it is next but we finally get down to business

2320
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:40,736
And Alex Finally Revealed

2321
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:41,760
The name

2322
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:42,784
Of this

2323
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:43,808
Supposed

2324
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:45,600
Let's get to it right now

2325
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:48,672
Here is who I'm that with the only woman that ran

2326
01:49:49,184 --> 01:49:51,744
This office in PR known as a husband

2327
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:57,120
Sylvia

2328
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:58,656
Mathews Burwell

2329
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:04,032
Are there she is foundation

2330
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:08,384
Government

2331
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:09,664
For yourself

2332
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:11,200
Ladies and gentlemen her husband

2333
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:13,760
The justice department

2334
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:20,416
I argue very confidently that Alex Jones by the very nature of his show in his entire career is attempting to engage in

2335
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:24,512
Jury tampering by making a big production out of revealing This Woman's name on air

2336
01:50:25,024 --> 01:50:28,352
At the same time I'm not positive that that's something that could be proven in court

2337
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:30,400
Maybe maybe within the realm of what's Technic

2338
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:31,168
Illegal

2339
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:32,960
This is an offensive display

2340
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:35,520
Anyone who knows anything about Alex knows what he's trying

2341
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:38,336
But there's a good chance you won't have any legal consequences

2342
01:50:38,848 --> 01:50:39,360
So whatever

2343
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:41,408
There's another reason why he

2344
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:42,688
He may not get in trouble for

2345
01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:45,248
He absolutely got the wrong person

2346
01:50:45,504 --> 01:50:46,016
Again

2347
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:49,856
Jennifer Palmieri was the first person they decided

2348
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:51,904
This

2349
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:52,672
New

2350
01:50:52,928 --> 01:50:54,976
He's wrong again

2351
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:57,024
Because the moment he said

2352
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:01,376
Oh we we've narrowed it down this is the only woman

2353
01:51:01,632 --> 01:51:07,776
No you f****** didn't they were like 20 other women he's just f****** legs I don't know who the actual person isn't even if I did I wouldn't say

2354
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:09,824
Say their name on air I'm only

2355
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:10,848
Discussing I only

2356
01:51:11,872 --> 01:51:13,152
Littering bleeping out the person

2357
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:18,272
Name Sylvia I was considering doing that but in order to demonstrate

2358
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:19,808
Straight hwoarang Alex is

2359
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:25,184
And he's already put this name out available by Jacob and goals

2360
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:28,768
As well as the stuff that was tweeted out by other court reporters who were on the scene

2361
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:34,144
The potential jurors specifically worked as a quote communications director at the Office of Management and budget

2362
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:37,472
Sylvia Mathews Burwell never held that position

2363
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:40,800
She instead was the director of The Office of Management

2364
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:42,848
Budget which is a different role

2365
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:45,408
Alex is so goddamn sloppy with his details

2366
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:48,224
He doesn't recognize the difference between director and can be

2367
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:49,248
Communications director

2368
01:51:49,504 --> 01:51:51,296
Because he's so desperate for attention

2369
01:51:51,552 --> 01:51:55,136
And to create a narrative that will invalidate Rogers eventual conviction

2370
01:51:55,392 --> 01:51:56,928
He's just completely f***** up his story

2371
01:51:57,696 --> 01:52:02,048
I feel like if Mathews Burwell receives any kind of harassment or threats because of this

2372
01:52:02,304 --> 01:52:04,096
She may have a pretty solid case

2373
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:04,864
Alex

2374
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:07,680
There's no reason for him to report that you was on this jury

2375
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:09,216
Other than some identifying

2376
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:13,056
Details that he got wrong and his alleged process of elimination

2377
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:15,872
Honestly this order thing highlights why he

2378
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:19,968
You can't understand that the ABC News video the project Veritas put out is

2379
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:20,736
Bojack

2380
01:52:20,992 --> 01:52:22,016
He can't understand

2381
01:52:22,272 --> 01:52:23,808
The journalistic outlets have standards

2382
01:52:24,064 --> 01:52:25,088
Information that they report

2383
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:27,904
The key to say whatever the f*** they want damn the torpedoes

2384
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:33,792
He's making entire career off not being careful at all getting everything wrong and being rewarded for it

2385
01:52:35,072 --> 01:52:35,840
Couldn't see

2386
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:38,912
I really wish that when you put it that way it's

2387
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:41,728
It's so sad but that's why

2388
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:44,032
Caution is proof of a grant

2389
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:45,312
Spirit of course

2390
01:52:45,824 --> 01:52:48,640
Sylvia Mathews Burwell is not the

2391
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:50,944
Potential juror but there's a further embarrassment

2392
01:52:51,712 --> 01:52:52,224
And it's

2393
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:53,760
The potential juror Alex has been

2394
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:55,552
Screaming about didn't even end up making

2395
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:56,832
Taking the jury of course not

2396
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:59,648
He's all yelling about how she's going to be the 4%

2397
01:52:59,904 --> 01:53:00,416
She wasn't so

2398
01:53:00,672 --> 01:53:05,280
Elected at all of course not I thought you were the judge the day after I would have been like well

2399
01:53:05,792 --> 01:53:07,584
We don't even need to have a strike

2400
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:08,608
Nobody

2401
01:53:08,864 --> 01:53:09,376
Get to nobody needs

2402
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:10,912
To say anything job

2403
01:53:11,424 --> 01:53:14,752
This is all nothing but it's potentially very dangerous

2404
01:53:15,008 --> 01:53:16,800
Spur Miss Matthews burrow

2405
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:23,456
There's no paternalistic merit to what Alex is doing there's no further goal to this other than to create excuses for why his friend is probably

2406
01:53:23,968 --> 01:53:24,480
The jail

2407
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:27,040
If you wants to create alternative realities like this

2408
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:28,320
I mean it's his right to do that

2409
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:31,136
But it's a point where his delusions become a danger

2410
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:31,904
The others

2411
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:34,464
It's well worth having a discussion about how he need

2412
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:36,000
Be forced to get help

2413
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:40,864
Even if this act isn't illegal it's the behavior of a severely mentally ill person

2414
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:43,936
Alex Jones is completely unraveling in front of our eyes

2415
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:45,728
Largely because of the attention

2416
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:47,008
Support and Bunny

2417
01:53:47,264 --> 01:53:49,568
It had been buffering him has been decreasing

2418
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:51,872
Exit access to social media is gone away

2419
01:53:52,384 --> 01:53:53,408
Everyone around him

2420
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:54,944
Needs to recognize that this is the

2421
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:57,248
But he's on and it does not end well

2422
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:01,344
If anyone cares about him at all I am for you get Alex

2423
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:02,112
Help

2424
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:05,184
If you care about him in anyway I can't imagine

2425
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:08,512
How you can let someone you loved

2426
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:10,048
Act like this and not step in

2427
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:11,328
It's disgraceful

2428
01:54:13,888 --> 01:54:16,960
It's it's it's I mean I hate to be preachy but like

2429
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:18,240
This is

2430
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:19,520
A lunatic

2431
01:54:19,776 --> 01:54:21,056
Who is now acting

2432
01:54:21,312 --> 01:54:21,824
In ways

2433
01:54:22,592 --> 01:54:28,224
That we've seen the consequences of his actions to the past has led to targeted harass

2434
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:30,016
Fingered for no reason

2435
01:54:30,528 --> 01:54:33,600
Like we're seeing it consistently continue into the present

2436
01:54:34,368 --> 01:54:35,392
I just

2437
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:38,976
I feel like everyone who has an ability

2438
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,816
To persuade him or force him to get help

2439
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:44,096
But isn't doing it

2440
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:46,912
I just I cannot possibly

2441
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:48,448
How are you would act like

2442
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:49,472
He is

2443
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:50,496
He is a lunatic

2444
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:51,520
Who is

2445
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:53,056
Lashing out at people

2446
01:54:56,128 --> 01:54:57,152
Enjoy you

2447
01:54:57,664 --> 01:55:00,736
Are making me feel like I'm living in Slaughterhouse-Five

2448
01:55:02,272 --> 01:55:03,040
How is it that week

2449
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:03,808
Can just

2450
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:04,832
Literally spend

2451
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:06,880
A couple of episodes

2452
01:55:07,648 --> 01:55:08,928
Talkin about Alex

2453
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:11,744
Pulling off certain behaviors

2454
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,280
In 2013

2455
01:55:13,536 --> 01:55:15,584
And then do a present-day episode

2456
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:17,376
Less than a week apart

2457
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:19,936
And he is performing those very

2458
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:21,216
Same behaviors

2459
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:25,568
That's insane it's either that or he does it every single f******

2460
01:55:25,824 --> 01:55:30,176
He does a lot because you have to consider that the reason that were looking at these things

2461
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:31,712
13 is because he

2462
01:55:32,224 --> 01:55:35,552
Consequences

2463
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:39,904
It's just how we operate identify why we got why it's just that that's

2464
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:44,000
Get raise

2465
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:45,280
As his behavior

2466
01:55:45,536 --> 01:55:47,840
Erasing these ways I just I mean

2467
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:51,424
I wish him

2468
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:52,192
Bill

2469
01:55:52,448 --> 01:55:53,472
In the sense that I hope he

2470
01:55:53,984 --> 01:55:54,496
Feels

2471
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:56,032
Consequences

2472
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:56,800
This is what he's doing

2473
01:55:57,312 --> 01:55:58,848
But at the same time like

2474
01:55:59,104 --> 01:56:01,920
For everyone in everyone's best interest that he

2475
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:02,688
He get help

2476
01:56:03,968 --> 01:56:05,504
No I would never want

2477
01:56:08,576 --> 01:56:10,368
His all of his fantasies of

2478
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:17,024
This is what we want to do to the globalist and all that s*** just makes the rise more into Stark relief what it is

2479
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:18,048
But I would like

2480
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:19,072
That's like an empath

2481
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:22,400
I just want to fire a bullet in you that make

2482
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:24,192
You feel everything that you've

2483
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:27,776
Like I don't know that would be

2484
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:29,824
Fatal

2485
01:56:30,592 --> 01:56:32,128
I think that Alex I mean like

2486
01:56:32,384 --> 01:56:34,176
I think he's probably Beyond

2487
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:35,712
Being helped quite frankly

2488
01:56:35,968 --> 01:56:38,272
But that doesn't mean that that's still not the solution

2489
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:39,808
Trying to get him

2490
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:42,112
Some like very serious

2491
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:44,416
Psychological help because he

2492
01:56:44,672 --> 01:56:45,696
He is living

2493
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:50,816
You know what if he's living in a fictional world that this buzard overarching

2494
01:56:51,328 --> 01:56:51,840
Communist

2495
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:52,608
Conspiracy

2496
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:53,888
All this b*******

2497
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:55,680
I'm not particularly all that in

2498
01:56:56,448 --> 01:56:58,240
Yeah but to the point where he is

2499
01:56:58,496 --> 01:56:59,008
Disseminating

2500
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:00,288
Information widely

2501
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:03,360
Pretending he's an expert in anything while getting everything wrong

2502
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:05,920
And engaging in a gigantic

2503
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:06,688
Media specs

2504
01:57:06,944 --> 01:57:07,968
He's trying to pull off

2505
01:57:08,224 --> 01:57:09,504
Where he endangered

2506
01:57:10,528 --> 01:57:12,064
People who works with private citizen

2507
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:14,624
Absolutely people who have no business

2508
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:16,160
Being pointed out

2509
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:17,184
And targeted by him

2510
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:20,768
That is where it crosses the line to like

2511
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:22,560
Every single person around

2512
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:24,096
All of his employees

2513
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:25,376
His wife

2514
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:26,912
Everybody

2515
01:57:27,168 --> 01:57:28,448
Is complicit in this

2516
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:30,240
Because there is a solution

2517
01:57:31,264 --> 01:57:32,800
There is a 5150

2518
01:57:33,056 --> 01:57:38,176
You can call will provide material

2519
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:41,248
He is a danger to other

2520
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:43,808
He really is and it has nothing to do with politics

2521
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:50,208
No it has nothing to do with like political beliefs or anything like that

2522
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:55,328
Who sang this and it was any other president or or political if he was on the left and he's

2523
01:57:55,584 --> 01:57:57,120
Reviewing jurors f***

2524
01:57:57,376 --> 01:57:59,168
Looking names in the hopes that his rabbit

2525
01:57:59,424 --> 01:57:59,936
Fan base with

2526
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:02,240
Do some very serious intimidation

2527
01:58:02,752 --> 01:58:03,264
At

2528
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:04,032
Best

2529
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:08,640
Then it doesn't matter if there's a and ideology behind it you're f****** crazy

2530
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:11,200
And if Alex were somebody who doesn't have that

2531
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:11,968
History

2532
01:58:12,224 --> 01:58:13,248
That very clear history

2533
01:58:13,504 --> 01:58:15,040
Of this interaction between them

2534
01:58:15,296 --> 01:58:16,064
Himself and his audience

2535
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:18,112
Where there is harassment

2536
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:22,976
That goes around area where it probably take it a little bit different

2537
01:58:23,488 --> 01:58:25,024
Him saying adders name

2538
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:26,048
Yea or nay

2539
01:58:26,304 --> 01:58:29,120
Imagine

2540
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:31,424
I think it would be a little bit different I would say

2541
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:32,960
Well that's just tasteful

2542
01:58:33,216 --> 01:58:35,008
But I wouldn't look at it as

2543
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:35,776
A danger

2544
01:58:36,032 --> 01:58:36,800
This is

2545
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:38,336
Danger

2546
01:58:39,104 --> 01:58:40,384
Kill this woman or anything

2547
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:43,968
Yesterday

2548
01:58:44,736 --> 01:58:45,248
No one

2549
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:50,368
Scared about her at all I mean

2550
01:58:50,624 --> 01:58:51,136
In anytime

2551
01:58:51,392 --> 01:58:57,536
Kind of I believe former civil service

2552
01:58:58,048 --> 01:58:59,072
Kind of potential Danger

2553
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:00,608
From Alex is audience

2554
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:01,376
Answer dumb s***

2555
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:08,032
What is my kit reposted on Gateway pundit or would I write that Crosshair and now she is

2556
01:59:08,288 --> 01:59:10,848
Alex's brought that into her life and that is

2557
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:11,872
Horrible thing

2558
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:15,200
Yep so I don't know my basic point is

2559
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:18,016
Someone take this seriously who can do something

2560
01:59:19,808 --> 01:59:21,344
A broken record

2561
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:25,184
Cuz I said this many times before and every time he does stuff like this

2562
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:27,232
If I go out this is why you need to get help

2563
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:29,792
It's not like there aren't

2564
01:59:32,096 --> 01:59:33,632
Unending list of

2565
01:59:33,888 --> 01:59:34,656
People who have

2566
01:59:34,912 --> 01:59:36,704
Status try to Crazy Horse

2567
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:37,728
Taking their cut

2568
01:59:38,752 --> 01:59:39,264
Let it die whenever

2569
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:40,544
Steph you know

2570
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:42,592
Yep that's that's a very

2571
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:43,360
Common

2572
01:59:43,616 --> 01:59:44,128
Story about

2573
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:45,920
Deal with that

2574
01:59:46,944 --> 01:59:47,456
People

2575
01:59:47,712 --> 01:59:48,480
There's an option

2576
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:55,392
Anyway a stress whatever I'm saying these things about like he needs help I mean

2577
01:59:55,648 --> 01:59:57,952
He needs help I don't think that anybody should

2578
01:59:58,976 --> 01:59:59,488
Absolutely

2579
02:00:00,512 --> 02:00:03,328
So Alex husband

2580
02:00:03,584 --> 02:00:05,632
Is involved in all this stuff

2581
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:08,704
To this is the only real evidence you provide

2582
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:13,824
Husband here

2583
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:17,664
Here is a photo

2584
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:21,760
All she's being sworn in

2585
02:00:22,272 --> 02:00:23,040
Wheels

2586
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:24,320
Joe Biden

2587
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:27,648
So he looks like Eddie Haskell

2588
02:00:27,904 --> 02:00:28,928
On steroids

2589
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:32,000
There you go what a nice

2590
02:00:33,024 --> 02:00:34,048
Authorized

2591
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:36,864
That's the only evidence that he provides that

2592
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:40,704
He's involved in the Mueller investigation used in a picture with

2593
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:41,984
Biden yeah

2594
02:00:42,496 --> 02:00:44,288
The people who are the reporters on the

2595
02:00:44,544 --> 02:00:49,152
Did tweet out that he is a lawyer for the Department of Justice

2596
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:51,200
AMV I believe it was in the National

2597
02:00:51,456 --> 02:00:54,016
Security division of Department of Justice

2598
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:59,392
So there is a possibility that he was involved in some small way

2599
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:01,696
But I don't I haven't been able to find any

2600
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:02,720
Concrete evidence that

2601
02:01:03,488 --> 02:01:07,072
Cerenia anything in particular or that he was a player in any

2602
02:01:07,328 --> 02:01:09,120
In anyway and the only evidence

2603
02:01:09,376 --> 02:01:10,144
Is that

2604
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:14,752
A picture while she is being sworn in until I get at least

2605
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:16,544
Two or three more corroborating

2606
02:01:17,056 --> 02:01:19,104
I'm not even believe this guy is

2607
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:23,712
I don't believe I was just like the important husband

2608
02:01:23,968 --> 02:01:24,736
I don't believe

2609
02:01:24,992 --> 02:01:28,832
He might have a tighter you would probably held up a photo f****** grimace

2610
02:01:29,088 --> 02:01:30,368
Like this dude

2611
02:01:30,624 --> 02:01:31,648
I don't believe anything

2612
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:34,208
The media though Jordan trying to cover the song

2613
02:01:35,744 --> 02:01:37,024
I'm not we're not the meeting

2614
02:01:40,864 --> 02:01:43,424
The media won't even tell you that she was a high-level

2615
02:01:43,936 --> 02:01:45,728
Person with Obama and then her husband

2616
02:01:45,984 --> 02:01:48,032
Is he in the whole Mueller Witch Hunt I mean

2617
02:01:48,288 --> 02:01:53,408
We have a right to know that it's still America

2618
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:59,808
So Alex is saying that the media won't tell you this stuff but at the same time he's quoting a Reuters article that says it

2619
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:02,112
I don't understand what he's which is it

2620
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:06,464
Which is the media covering it up or do you want have a f****** source

2621
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:07,744
80 Folsom

2622
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:11,072
That is such b******* is it is everywhere

2623
02:02:11,328 --> 02:02:12,864
Deeply abusive to his daughter

2624
02:02:13,376 --> 02:02:17,472
Article about it

2625
02:02:17,728 --> 02:02:19,776
It's over with for them it's abusive to me

2626
02:02:20,032 --> 02:02:22,080
I don't like having to hear that

2627
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:24,384
I'm not entirely sure

2628
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:27,456
Why I cut this clip but I do know that there's an ad pivot

2629
02:02:31,296 --> 02:02:32,832
Maybe pro-nazi

2630
02:02:33,344 --> 02:02:35,136
Would he not

2631
02:02:38,976 --> 02:02:40,768
Everything must go super sale

2632
02:02:42,304 --> 02:02:44,352
Appliance and

2633
02:02:45,632 --> 02:02:46,656
47% off

2634
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:48,960
There's a whole lot of this on this episode

2635
02:02:49,472 --> 02:02:55,616
I think it's because he knows that he's trying to draw and tons more of the announcement of the

2636
02:02:55,872 --> 02:02:58,688
This person when there's

2637
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:00,224
Usher Yeah

2638
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:02,784
So you might be saying that Alex

2639
02:03:03,296 --> 02:03:05,856
Said this person's name and outed them is

2640
02:03:06,368 --> 02:03:08,416
Soldier when he was wrong about it because he's

2641
02:03:08,672 --> 02:03:09,952
He's bad at his job and

2642
02:03:10,464 --> 02:03:11,488
He operates

2643
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:12,512
Knee-jerk

2644
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:14,304
Badly

2645
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:17,376
Yeah terribly yeah but it's actually because

2646
02:03:17,888 --> 02:03:18,400
He's a journalist

2647
02:03:18,656 --> 02:03:20,192
That really doesn't sound true

2648
02:03:20,704 --> 02:03:25,312
He is not a coward

2649
02:03:25,568 --> 02:03:30,432
Supposed to be random selection

2650
02:03:31,456 --> 02:03:32,480
Is the former

2651
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:36,576
Budget management

2652
02:03:36,832 --> 02:03:40,416
Her husband works on the Mueller probe

2653
02:03:43,744 --> 02:03:45,024
American

2654
02:03:56,544 --> 02:04:00,640
I love the idea that like America is founded on not

2655
02:04:01,408 --> 02:04:07,552
Twice rewrites we're like El Ron Hubbard first

2656
02:04:08,832 --> 02:04:09,344
Alex

2657
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:14,976
I'll miss Johanna sixties not even addressing the fact that for the 5th on the episode of the 5th

2658
02:04:15,232 --> 02:04:17,024
He was saying it was Jennifer Palmieri

2659
02:04:17,536 --> 02:04:23,680
He's not even addressing like what we got it wrong at first but now here's the real person who were left over

2660
02:04:23,936 --> 02:04:26,752
Was never admitting that you got it wrong the first time Dad

2661
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:28,032
Actually that might be

2662
02:04:28,288 --> 02:04:29,824
When I actually made America great

2663
02:04:30,336 --> 02:04:31,360
What snake oil salesman

2664
02:04:31,872 --> 02:04:33,664
I want to slap Barnes

2665
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:35,200
So bad

2666
02:04:35,456 --> 02:04:36,736
That that like that

2667
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:40,064
Good selection of Judges is supposed to be impartial

2668
02:04:40,576 --> 02:04:41,088
Like

2669
02:04:41,344 --> 02:04:45,696
Really really the one thing that everybody on the right

2670
02:04:45,952 --> 02:04:49,280
A universally Praises Trump for is choosing judges

2671
02:04:49,792 --> 02:04:55,424
They don't do it because he's choosing them for their impartiality bar and certainly not

2672
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:56,192
Didn't you know that

2673
02:04:56,448 --> 02:04:59,008
How dare you

2674
02:04:59,264 --> 02:05:00,032
That's a fence

2675
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:01,312
He's not a lawyer

2676
02:05:01,824 --> 02:05:02,592
I mean technically is

2677
02:05:02,848 --> 02:05:03,872
But he's not a lawyer

2678
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:05,920
Here's another gross add

2679
02:05:11,552 --> 02:05:12,320
Or lawyers

2680
02:05:12,832 --> 02:05:14,624
Or the people that are there are public

2681
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:17,952
But now they want us all to be secret

2682
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:20,000
We're talking about that

2683
02:05:20,512 --> 02:05:23,072
A lot more in just a moment you know speaking of the Grim Reaper

2684
02:05:25,888 --> 02:05:28,192
Horse plus Delmas closest

2685
02:05:29,216 --> 02:05:29,728
2

2686
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:33,312
What you're going to find out there that's the fountain

2687
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:40,224
I'd like to point out that he was not speaking of the Grim Reaper

2688
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:44,576
I think he was saying that like these people are the Bringers of death

2689
02:05:44,832 --> 02:05:45,344
Like that

2690
02:05:45,856 --> 02:05:46,368
Wow

2691
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:48,160
I was not speaking of the crib

2692
02:05:48,672 --> 02:05:51,488
This founder

2693
02:05:51,744 --> 02:05:56,352
I like that is a non-sequitur little bit of an ad for this product of his and then

2694
02:05:56,608 --> 02:05:57,632
He gets into talking about

2695
02:05:58,144 --> 02:05:58,656
No actually

2696
02:05:59,424 --> 02:05:59,936
Angel of Death

2697
02:06:00,192 --> 02:06:00,704
Was sent by God

2698
02:06:03,008 --> 02:06:03,520
My God this is

2699
02:06:05,568 --> 02:06:07,872
Have you put the Red Devil on the Lambs there

2700
02:06:11,456 --> 02:06:12,480
Pass over your house when

2701
02:06:14,016 --> 02:06:15,296
Establishment

2702
02:06:15,552 --> 02:06:16,576
It was about to be

2703
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:21,440
Dealt with my God because of the firstborn son of every Israelite

2704
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:25,280
Sacrifice

2705
02:06:27,072 --> 02:06:28,352
So there wouldn't be leadership

2706
02:06:30,912 --> 02:06:31,424
The crown

2707
02:06:32,192 --> 02:06:32,960
The boys were

2708
02:06:33,216 --> 02:06:34,752
Attacked

2709
02:06:35,008 --> 02:06:35,520
The Prozac in

2710
02:06:35,776 --> 02:06:37,824
The Red Lion in the Nae Nae

2711
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:38,848
Conboy

2712
02:06:40,384 --> 02:06:40,896
In the past

2713
02:06:41,152 --> 02:06:41,920
It is again today

2714
02:06:42,176 --> 02:06:42,944
Then just repeat

2715
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:43,712
Themselves

2716
02:06:43,968 --> 02:06:46,016
As Above So Below the seriously DNA Force Plus

2717
02:06:46,784 --> 02:06:47,296
Wow

2718
02:06:47,552 --> 02:06:49,344
Woodstock

2719
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:58,560
My eye is bleeding from that punch that's that those pretty impressive

2720
02:06:58,816 --> 02:07:00,864
Oh God Putt-Putt me

2721
02:07:01,376 --> 02:07:02,400
A lot

2722
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:04,704
A lot of weird salesmanship going on here

2723
02:07:05,216 --> 02:07:05,728
That was just

2724
02:07:05,984 --> 02:07:09,312
Free association that wasn't the old man

2725
02:07:09,568 --> 02:07:11,872
Alex has Owen Shroyer

2726
02:07:13,408 --> 02:07:13,920
Covering

2727
02:07:14,944 --> 02:07:15,456
Rogers case

2728
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:21,856
Sure if you got the big guns he's got the talent over there if anything maybe

2729
02:07:22,112 --> 02:07:23,136
Laugh my ass off

2730
02:07:23,392 --> 02:07:24,928
It's probably this next clip

2731
02:07:25,184 --> 02:07:29,280
Owens out there doing a man on the street thing try to talk about Rogers

2732
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:33,632
It's unfair what they're doing to Rodger Mike down for this because

2733
02:07:34,144 --> 02:07:34,656
You got it

2734
02:07:34,912 --> 02:07:35,424
Got to love

2735
02:07:42,592 --> 02:07:43,360
That's nothing

2736
02:07:43,616 --> 02:07:45,664
That's free speech that's truth

2737
02:07:46,176 --> 02:07:48,480
So this is kind of like the Tommy Robinson thing

2738
02:07:55,904 --> 02:07:58,976
Nazi coward coward

2739
02:08:01,792 --> 02:08:02,816
Space

2740
02:08:08,192 --> 02:08:10,240
Alphabet to be so hilarious

2741
02:08:10,752 --> 02:08:15,360
Owen Shroyer the middle of trying to do a rowboat and he gets into a fight with a guy

2742
02:08:15,616 --> 02:08:16,640
You know it's at

2743
02:08:16,896 --> 02:08:23,040
Another one of those situations where it's like every time Alex swears and he really goes for it you like you don't know

2744
02:08:23,296 --> 02:08:23,808
How to do this

2745
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:25,856
What are you what are you doing

2746
02:08:26,368 --> 02:08:30,720
Owen does not know how to get into a fight with somebody doesn't sound like

2747
02:08:31,488 --> 02:08:33,536
Weird it's very stilted

2748
02:08:33,792 --> 02:08:35,584
This robotic yeah yeah

2749
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:37,888
So the other problem is that he's also very stew

2750
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:39,680
Owen Shroyer is very dumb

2751
02:08:39,936 --> 02:08:40,960
He knows to install

2752
02:08:41,216 --> 02:08:41,984
Punk and

2753
02:08:42,496 --> 02:08:43,264
Nazi

2754
02:08:44,032 --> 02:08:45,056
I don't think he thinks those are in

2755
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:46,848
So he's

2756
02:08:47,104 --> 02:08:49,920
He's trying to talk about the juror situation

2757
02:08:50,176 --> 02:08:50,944
And how

2758
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:55,552
Having her as a jury member means the whole case is f***

2759
02:08:56,064 --> 02:08:57,344
He is

2760
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:58,112
Highlighting

2761
02:08:58,368 --> 02:09:00,416
A fundamental misunderstanding of how the legal

2762
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:07,584
Every every member of the jury could sit here and be like yet Stone was railroaded this is a show trial this is

2763
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:13,984
This was a kangaroo court

2764
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:20,384
They control

2765
02:09:21,664 --> 02:09:27,808
So the first important Point here is that this woman was not put on the jury so she's not even there for the trial

2766
02:09:28,064 --> 02:09:30,368
Remote control Owens promise fails

2767
02:09:30,624 --> 02:09:32,928
They're just right off the bat

2768
02:09:33,184 --> 02:09:33,696
Button

2769
02:09:33,952 --> 02:09:37,024
He's also failing on a basic understanding of how our legal system

2770
02:09:38,048 --> 02:09:43,680
The argument he's trying to make is that because there's one person on the jury who's going to vote that Rodger is guilty no matter what

2771
02:09:43,936 --> 02:09:45,984
Even if everyone else says not guilty

2772
02:09:46,752 --> 02:09:47,264
Get Justice

2773
02:09:48,032 --> 02:09:51,360
This demonstrates a startling lack of understanding of the topic that he

2774
02:09:51,616 --> 02:09:52,128
Discovery

2775
02:09:52,384 --> 02:09:56,480
Well it is true that one person being skewed toward the defense could f****** a process

2776
02:09:56,736 --> 02:09:57,248
Accusation

2777
02:09:57,504 --> 02:09:58,272
That is true

2778
02:09:58,784 --> 02:10:00,320
The same is not true in the reverse

2779
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:04,160
Because our courts are based on the presumption of innocence until proven guilty

2780
02:10:04,672 --> 02:10:06,208
If everyone but this one

2781
02:10:06,464 --> 02:10:07,488
Gerbo did not guilty

2782
02:10:07,744 --> 02:10:09,280
Rodger could not be convicted

2783
02:10:09,792 --> 02:10:11,840
A unanimous decision is required to convey

2784
02:10:12,096 --> 02:10:13,632
So if the jury reached an m

2785
02:10:13,888 --> 02:10:15,168
Impasse where this one globalist

2786
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:16,704
Wouldn't budge

2787
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:18,240
It would end in a mistrial

2788
02:10:18,496 --> 02:10:23,104
And then the state would either have to decide to drop charges or if they wanted to retry the case

2789
02:10:23,616 --> 02:10:26,688
In no way could one guilty vote result in the conviction

2790
02:10:26,944 --> 02:10:29,760
In a way that one not guilty vote

2791
02:10:30,016 --> 02:10:30,528
Preclude

2792
02:10:31,808 --> 02:10:33,600
Seriously Owen Shroyer doesn't have the basic

2793
02:10:33,856 --> 02:10:35,392
Understanding is required to have these sorts

2794
02:10:35,904 --> 02:10:36,416
Conversations

2795
02:10:36,672 --> 02:10:37,952
Are you putting this idea for

2796
02:10:38,208 --> 02:10:40,000
Well trying to correct

2797
02:10:40,256 --> 02:10:41,536
And allegedly very

2798
02:10:41,792 --> 02:10:42,560
Competent lawyer

2799
02:10:42,816 --> 02:10:44,864
You heard him at the beginning of thing Bob Bob Bob

2800
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:47,168
Talking to Robert Barn who's

2801
02:10:47,424 --> 02:10:48,448
Supposedly a lawyer

2802
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:50,496
These people have a lot of feelings

2803
02:10:50,752 --> 02:10:51,776
About what's happening in the world

2804
02:10:52,288 --> 02:10:53,824
And I guess they're entitled to those feeling

2805
02:10:54,336 --> 02:10:59,200
But they are just not equipped to have the adult conversations they're trying to have about actual topic I mean that's been

2806
02:10:59,712 --> 02:11:01,248
Yeah it's very

2807
02:11:01,504 --> 02:11:02,272
Now that they have one

2808
02:11:02,528 --> 02:11:03,808
One juror they have the whole thing

2809
02:11:06,112 --> 02:11:08,672
I was searching for something like maybe

2810
02:11:08,928 --> 02:11:09,696
Maybe there

2811
02:11:09,952 --> 02:11:12,512
He thinks that there's like it did it's like there's a swing boat

2812
02:11:12,768 --> 02:11:14,048
You know like

2813
02:11:14,304 --> 02:11:16,864
No it's no idea

2814
02:11:17,120 --> 02:11:17,888
Talking about a

2815
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:22,240
You talk about a hung jury and a mistrial no idea how

2816
02:11:23,264 --> 02:11:25,568
Well what what is the name

2817
02:11:25,824 --> 02:11:28,384
Is the stories that you hear of people who like

2818
02:11:28,896 --> 02:11:33,504
You know 11 of the jurors they wanted not guilty and therefore you can convicted

2819
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:39,136
He's reflecting that he's taking the opposite of that and imagining that it has the same

2820
02:11:39,392 --> 02:11:40,160
Sort of outcome

2821
02:11:40,416 --> 02:11:42,720
Yeah I know is idea is essentially

2822
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,048
Hearing about 12 Angry Men I doubt he's

2823
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:52,192
Well it's also assuming that like okay let's say there's a mistrial than that default means Rogers guilty

2824
02:11:52,448 --> 02:11:52,960
And it's not

2825
02:11:53,216 --> 02:11:53,728
Is it

2826
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:55,520
It's it's ridiculous

2827
02:11:56,288 --> 02:11:57,568
So anyway we have one last

2828
02:11:57,824 --> 02:11:58,336
CLEP here

2829
02:11:59,360 --> 02:11:59,872
And

2830
02:12:00,384 --> 02:12:02,176
Alex has made a big spectacle of this

2831
02:12:02,432 --> 02:12:05,760
He said definitively that he knows who the juror is

2832
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:07,552
Even though he was wrong day before and he's

2833
02:12:07,808 --> 02:12:08,576
Is also wrong again

2834
02:12:09,088 --> 02:12:12,160
And so it makes it really sad when he ends the episode like

2835
02:12:12,928 --> 02:12:16,512
Sort of waffling a little bit while still being hyper confident

2836
02:12:16,768 --> 02:12:18,560
Infowars releases

2837
02:12:18,816 --> 02:12:20,096
Obama official

2838
02:12:22,144 --> 02:12:23,424
Rodger stone jewelry

2839
02:12:24,448 --> 02:12:28,032
Wasn't turned out she headed up Health and Human Services on top of it

2840
02:12:29,312 --> 02:12:32,384
So what position

2841
02:12:33,152 --> 02:12:34,432
Politico and

2842
02:12:34,688 --> 02:12:37,248
Washington Post reported as a spokesperson for

2843
02:12:39,296 --> 02:12:40,064
Dopeman

2844
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:41,856
Woman who had a husband images

2845
02:12:42,112 --> 02:12:43,648
Apartment 14 in the Mueller probe

2846
02:12:45,696 --> 02:12:46,976
Nobody else or lease it.

2847
02:12:47,232 --> 02:12:49,280
Appears to be what is about 99%

2848
02:12:49,792 --> 02:12:50,560
Probability

2849
02:12:50,816 --> 02:12:56,960
Ninety-nine percent probability why are you why you leaving that 1% dangling there out he used

2850
02:12:57,216 --> 02:13:03,360
Always at the 1% ends up being right and why is the process of elimination band and as mates

2851
02:13:03,616 --> 02:13:04,896
Silver and 538 of told us

2852
02:13:05,152 --> 02:13:06,432
I don't know what they say

2853
02:13:06,944 --> 02:13:07,456
You can't operate

2854
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:09,248
If you can't

2855
02:13:09,504 --> 02:13:10,016
You just can't

2856
02:13:10,784 --> 02:13:12,576
You can't do these sorts of things with

2857
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:15,648
Bulshit process of elimination

2858
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:21,536
Misunderstanding various job titles in order to make this fit whatever you want to do

2859
02:13:21,792 --> 02:13:22,560
You just can't do this

2860
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:25,888
It is I mean I guess you can but you should

2861
02:13:26,144 --> 02:13:27,424
And you can be rewarded

2862
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:28,960
Don't forget about that part

2863
02:13:29,216 --> 02:13:30,240
It's just staggering

2864
02:13:31,008 --> 02:13:33,312
The extent to which he's wrong

2865
02:13:35,872 --> 02:13:38,944
Every single time he's like I'm 99% on this

2866
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:42,272
There's a 1% chance that a real Attack

2867
02:13:42,528 --> 02:13:44,576
Always always the one whatever

2868
02:13:44,832 --> 02:13:46,112
20% yes but he might be

2869
02:13:46,368 --> 02:13:47,904
Oh wait I think

2870
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:49,440
I think we're just experiencing

2871
02:13:49,696 --> 02:13:51,232
Sing Alex in the wrong Multiverse

2872
02:13:51,744 --> 02:13:52,256
Must be

2873
02:13:52,512 --> 02:13:55,072
Like in 99% of the Multiverse

2874
02:13:55,584 --> 02:13:56,096
Obviously

2875
02:13:56,352 --> 02:13:57,120
He's correct about every

2876
02:13:57,376 --> 02:14:00,192
It just happens that you and I exist in the one where

2877
02:14:00,448 --> 02:14:00,960
He's always wrong

2878
02:14:01,216 --> 02:14:01,984
I mean if that's the case

2879
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:03,008
It's not crazy

2880
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:04,288
Tragic

2881
02:14:04,544 --> 02:14:05,824
Anyway

2882
02:14:06,080 --> 02:14:07,616
I come to the end of this episode

2883
02:14:07,872 --> 02:14:10,176
What I'm left with is an overwhelming

2884
02:14:10,432 --> 02:14:11,456
Sense of

2885
02:14:11,968 --> 02:14:13,248
Sadness

2886
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:15,040
I am sad

2887
02:14:15,552 --> 02:14:16,320
Because Alex

2888
02:14:16,832 --> 02:14:17,856
Is clearly

2889
02:14:18,368 --> 02:14:19,648
Diving deeper

2890
02:14:19,904 --> 02:14:21,184
Into the overweight Nash

2891
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:21,952
Analyst White

2892
02:14:22,208 --> 02:14:22,720
Supremacist

2893
02:14:23,232 --> 02:14:24,256
Leanings that he has

2894
02:14:24,512 --> 02:14:28,864
As demonstrated in that coverage of the New Hampshire couple story where he's

2895
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:32,448
Sayings that say you're allowed to do this cuz your brown and white people

2896
02:14:32,704 --> 02:14:34,240
You need to get guns get ready to shoot

2897
02:14:34,496 --> 02:14:35,520
People

2898
02:14:36,032 --> 02:14:36,800
Really f*****

2899
02:14:37,056 --> 02:14:41,408
Very step to Richie saying that his enemies need to be wiped off the Earth not just

2900
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:42,944
Murder with ice picks

2901
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:48,576
A street lobotomy yeah I'm sad about that that makes me really bummed out

2902
02:14:48,832 --> 02:14:50,112
I really I really think

2903
02:14:50,368 --> 02:14:50,880
That

2904
02:14:51,648 --> 02:14:53,952
The world's better without Roderick like that

2905
02:14:54,464 --> 02:14:55,744
And then I'm really sad

2906
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:56,512
About

2907
02:14:57,024 --> 02:14:58,304
This desperate

2908
02:14:58,560 --> 02:14:59,328
Pathetic attempt

2909
02:14:59,584 --> 02:15:00,608
2 oz

2910
02:15:00,864 --> 02:15:02,144
Out this juror

2911
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:03,936
Like I think it's I think it's

2912
02:15:04,192 --> 02:15:04,704
Static-X

2913
02:15:05,216 --> 02:15:05,984
It's very sad

2914
02:15:07,264 --> 02:15:08,544
Demonstrating is anything

2915
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:10,336
Inability to research

2916
02:15:10,848 --> 02:15:12,384
The incompetence of his team

2917
02:15:12,896 --> 02:15:17,760
The sloppiness of his legal advisers words I can't go do this

2918
02:15:18,784 --> 02:15:19,296
I just

2919
02:15:20,576 --> 02:15:22,112
It's a bummer it's a bummer

2920
02:15:22,368 --> 02:15:23,904
In and further

2921
02:15:24,672 --> 02:15:25,440
It's transparent

2922
02:15:25,696 --> 02:15:26,976
Like as soon as I

2923
02:15:27,232 --> 02:15:29,280
Got through a listen to these episodes

2924
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:30,560
It was so

2925
02:15:30,816 --> 02:15:31,840
F****** clear to me

2926
02:15:32,352 --> 02:15:35,168
This is the behavior of someone who knows that Rodger is

2927
02:15:35,424 --> 02:15:37,728
Probably going to be found guilty

2928
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:41,824
That this is a behavior to invalidate the trial before it began

2929
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:42,848
Because

2930
02:15:43,104 --> 02:15:44,896
That's what you got to do to protect

2931
02:15:45,664 --> 02:15:46,688
Whatever

2932
02:15:46,944 --> 02:15:47,712
Connection you have

2933
02:15:48,992 --> 02:15:49,760
That's not apathy

2934
02:15:51,296 --> 02:15:57,440
I think that when people cover stuff like this it would be wise to understand that that is the

2935
02:15:57,696 --> 02:15:58,208
Motive

2936
02:15:59,232 --> 02:16:00,256
It is

2937
02:16:00,768 --> 02:16:01,280
Possible

2938
02:16:02,048 --> 02:16:05,632
But there is also a motive of trying to

2939
02:16:05,888 --> 02:16:07,168
Intimidate this jerk

2940
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:08,704
Tamper with the jury

2941
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:11,520
It is possible that is somewhere within his mind

2942
02:16:11,776 --> 02:16:12,800
Possible

2943
02:16:13,056 --> 02:16:15,616
And it's also further possible that that will be

2944
02:16:16,128 --> 02:16:17,664
The real-world consequences

2945
02:16:18,176 --> 02:16:18,944
And it's not

2946
02:16:19,712 --> 02:16:21,760
Probably wise to ignore

2947
02:16:22,272 --> 02:16:24,064
I'm not advocating people ignore that

2948
02:16:24,832 --> 02:16:25,344
But

2949
02:16:25,856 --> 02:16:26,880
It would be wise

2950
02:16:27,136 --> 02:16:28,160
For people to

2951
02:16:28,416 --> 02:16:28,928
Lead

2952
02:16:29,184 --> 02:16:30,976
Any kind of story about this with

2953
02:16:31,744 --> 02:16:33,792
Why Alex is doing this is because

2954
02:16:34,048 --> 02:16:35,584
Like layout the connections

2955
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:37,632
To Infowars that are very

2956
02:16:37,888 --> 02:16:38,656
Clearly part of

2957
02:16:38,912 --> 02:16:39,936
Rodger Stone case

2958
02:16:40,448 --> 02:16:42,496
And we like Alex needs preemptive

2959
02:16:42,752 --> 02:16:43,520
Application for when it's friends

2960
02:16:43,776 --> 02:16:44,288
He's probably found

2961
02:16:47,104 --> 02:16:50,432
To continue the perception V reality

2962
02:16:51,456 --> 02:16:52,736
I would guarantee that Alec

2963
02:16:53,248 --> 02:16:55,296
Never say doesn't believe like

2964
02:16:55,552 --> 02:16:56,320
Like in his perception is like

2965
02:16:56,576 --> 02:16:58,624
I am not trying to end

2966
02:16:58,880 --> 02:17:00,928
Tamper with anybody I'm not trying to intimidate

2967
02:17:01,184 --> 02:17:04,000
Anybody I truly believe that I am doing my best

2968
02:17:04,512 --> 02:17:06,048
Help these people

2969
02:17:06,560 --> 02:17:08,096
And I'm trying to

2970
02:17:08,352 --> 02:17:09,888
Invalidate the trial before it have

2971
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:16,544
I'm not trying to hurt anybody but I've totally driving it but I didn't validate the child because the trial is just a kangaroo court

2972
02:17:17,056 --> 02:17:17,568
I mean

2973
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:24,224
Alex's perception of what he did when he was super drunk and screaming about a million-dollar bounty on the opposing counsel

2974
02:17:25,248 --> 02:17:26,528
He doesn't think that is

2975
02:17:26,784 --> 02:17:27,808
Is intimidation or

2976
02:17:28,064 --> 02:17:28,832
And yet the real

2977
02:17:29,088 --> 02:17:29,600
Yeah it is

2978
02:17:29,856 --> 02:17:30,368
Right

2979
02:17:31,136 --> 02:17:32,416
So it all comes back to that

2980
02:17:32,928 --> 02:17:34,720
Alex's lead story on the 5th

2981
02:17:35,232 --> 02:17:38,048
Is damning for him

2982
02:17:38,304 --> 02:17:40,352
Every time he's like I f******

2983
02:17:40,608 --> 02:17:41,120
I've got some

2984
02:17:41,632 --> 02:17:42,400
Really valuable

2985
02:17:43,936 --> 02:17:44,448
Deep in the mirror

2986
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:46,496
Can I see that everything that I do is

2987
02:17:46,752 --> 02:17:47,264
Is wrong and I mean

2988
02:17:48,032 --> 02:17:48,544
That to you as me be

2989
02:17:49,312 --> 02:17:50,592
