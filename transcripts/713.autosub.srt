Sick of them posing as if they're the good guy

00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
MoneyGram

Blexit around worship at the altar of Celine back

10
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:10,912
And it's company very close to the altar

11
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,704
And talk a little bit about Alex

12
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,872
What is ghetto

13
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:20,896
We're back

14
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,432
From our trip to Austin

15
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,480
And there's something to eat

16
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,016
Text to be really exciting.

17
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:27,808
Being in my own

18
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,576
Space

19
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,112
Of course saline being around

20
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,416
But then there's other things that are kind of acid

21
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,208
Surprise

22
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,488
One of the biggest

23
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,768
Is my back scratcher

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,048
Oh yeah yeah

25
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,120
On the trip

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,680
Realize how much I use

27
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,496
Was itching almost

28
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,336
If I was rubbing on doorway like a bear

29
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,664
Coming back I was like yeah

30
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,480
Travel back scratcher

31
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,016
Like three or four of them

32
00:01:59,296 --> 00:01:59,808
Back scratchers

33
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,344
You just need some back lotion

34
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:02,880
I get some

35
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:03,904
Yeah

36
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,440
Really

37
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,208
Maybe you just

38
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,512
Baby

39
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:13,120
I don't know can you have backs

40
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,168
Dry skin

41
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,008
Okay Paradise

42
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,336
My bright spot very similarly is a small thing

43
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,616
From home that I didn't

44
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,688
You be such a delight

45
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,528
Sebastian and I had my bath

46
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,576
Add salt in there I've turned into that guy

47
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,112
First shift

48
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
Absolutely

49
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,952
Years to get there but eventually your bath

50
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,720
At salts

51
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,536
My brain about

52
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,864
It was so good tubs in our hotel room

53
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
There were

54
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,472
How good was our hotel rooftop

55
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,312
Deep tub

56
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,336
Slender

57
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,128
Mine was not deep okay

58
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,176
That's weird

59
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:58,944
Was just super

60
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,736
I think that's

61
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,552
Jacuzzi bathtub in your ear off

62
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,576
Yeah

63
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,344
That's it

64
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,160
Jordan

65
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
Episode

66
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,744
Is very exciting

67
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,328
Over the course of the time in Austin

68
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,120
When we were there for the trial

69
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,936
Figure a merge

70
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,752
The trial

71
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,872
So take him to a very serious way

72
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,640
I have paid

73
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,408
Attention to

74
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,200
Admired

75
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,296

That's great

80
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,424
We can finally sit down and have

81
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,704
Have a chat

82
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,752
I have to ask you what is your bright spot

83
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,408
My boyfriend is really similar to both of yours actually I am also back home

84
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,456
But the Comforts of Home are

85

86
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,320

Love it I love it I love it grumpy pet

89
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,215

00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,063
Viber

95
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,831
Just sort of

96
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,367
I know what's up

97
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,439
We were at.

98
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,463
A friend of the

99
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,487
Deep clothes

100
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:51,071
Friend of the show who helped our audio issues

101
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
Making it

102
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,399
My hero when we were at his place

103
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:59,263
He had a very old black lab

104
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,055
Schreiber

105
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,359
Yeah Golden Retriever and then break

106
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,663
Huge

107
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,943
It was the biggest dog

108
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:14,367
It was so old and then whenever you came over I gave her the right ear scratches boom right on the floor give me some

109
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,903
Belly time

110

112
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,071
They're just chill

113
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,239
And God bless her for it

114
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,591
Becky you were a part of the trial

115
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,919
Be at the plaintiff

116
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
Expert witness

117
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
Jordan

118
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,575
Like what

119
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,623
The subject matter you were brought in

120
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,647
To talk about was

121
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,975
Yeah from good so I research

122
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:56,351
Communication

123
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,399
Retraining for race social

124
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,167
Ulta

125
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,495
Disinformation efforts across the

126
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,103
And how they kind of disseminate throughout the internet

127
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:12,223
That was really the role they brought me on to talk about so

128
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,783
Like other other Witnesses

129
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,063
Talked about

130
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,463
You're like Fred's at the journalism expert talked about kind of actual protocols

131
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,511
Journalism

132
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,071
Following any of those

133
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:33,727
Of course the forensic psychologist talked about

134
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,567
Experience

135
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,591
To talk about

136
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,151
Alex Jones

137
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,479
Spread this conspiracy theory has become

138
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
Atopic

139
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,439
It's a guy got to be found a lot of your your testimony

140
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,255
Pretty interesting Illuminating

141
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,815
A section of

142
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,911
Understanding his reach a particular is

143
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
In the past

144
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,519
It is something that we haven't delved too deeply into

145
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,871
Understand our own

146
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,663
I swear I think there's just 50

147
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:20,319
People listening honestly cuz I feel like

148
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,439
Really know what we're both on your team

149
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:31,839
We can talk ideas about our kids coverage of things but

150
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,863
The stuff

151
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,399
Around

152
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,263
That picture is something that I don't know

153
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,591
I mean I I certainly have a sense of it just sort of

154
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,919
Like being around conspiracy circles at

155
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,711
Ioi

156
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:52,063
I need a new way we know where bulshit is and you know where

157
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,183
Goats

158
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,999
When you work in the space you quickly

159
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:07,679
One very very small piece of the puzzle

160
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
So

161
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:13,567
Massive there's so much to do and so you really do have to rely on the work of other people

162
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,103
And it's incredibly important

163
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
Now you're just

164
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,927
Yeah definitely I think

165
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,975
I think that's something that's really important is that

166
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,255
People

167
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
Niche

168
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,327
Specialized a bit and then

169
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
Networking

170
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,631
Can be important

171
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
Sink tap

172
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,703
The failings of our show I think really is

173
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,519
There was none of that really early on never

174
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,543
Because

175
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,591
I think I was scared

176
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,151
Because I reached

177
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,783
But I'm guessing they were so resistant

178
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
Yeah

179
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,391
Like we are not

180
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:03,231
Academic sweet we don't have any real background

181
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,535
Study Alex Jones

182
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,071
It's obviously like

183
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,863
Concerned it like all these

184
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
Crazy people

185
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,423
I got go

186
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,447
Gun-shy about that

187
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,239
Didn't didn't really Network

188
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
Nearly as much a

189
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:15,775
Cuz I could have

190
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,943
No I was just going to take the cool thing for me is that during the trial

191
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,783
Your podcast have been the Forum where you've been able to bring a ton of

192
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,807
People together right

193
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,599
From the lawyer

194
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:33,695
Elizabeth Williamson who's incredible like a

195
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:37,023
The case initially and certainly as the case now that you're bringing like

196
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,583
Bringing everyone together in a really cool way I think

197
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:44,703
Except for those people who I shan't

198
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,775
And all of the people that I have spoke

199
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:53,151
I'll tell you that right now to block you

200
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,943
Exactly

201
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,807
Getting back to this this idea

202
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,623
The Alex really was

203
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,231
Galvanizing force behind a lot of the

204
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
The Sandy Hook

205
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,279
Conspiracy

206
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
Theorizer

207
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,839
That was something that I took away from

208
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,119
What you were saying

209
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,679
Yeah that's exactly right I'm in love

210
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,751
That's what's so fascinating to me as you can see like

211
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,567
Network studies

212
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:26,687
Got done about these things you see the giant forum

213
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,623
The the big institutional home throughout

214
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,903
2010

215
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,207
Fox News online

216
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
Breitbart

217
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,071
2017

218
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,863
When you look at individuals

219
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:49,983
There's no one that you do really the only person

220
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,543
Comfortable reach to him in this basin

221
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,895
Joe Rogan and like obviously Jarvis a bit more of a complicated person

222
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,479
Then they probably have

223
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,503
Much less of a

224
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:05,599
Exactly yeah yeah yeah so when you go back and you look at what

225
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,135
Alison Brie husband

226
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,671
2012

227
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,487
Huge for the time it was like

228
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
He had

229
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,839
In 2011 he already had half a million

230
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,631
Subscribers and like

231
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,959
No one at that point there was no one with millions of subscribe

232
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,263
YouTube

233
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,359
Right, Sandy Hook you already have 100 million views on his page it was

234
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,175
Really really substantial

235
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,759
Like other people who

236
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,039
You know wood

237
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:35,807
Tubi

238
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,879
Given that conversation I'd like Bill Cooper was dead

239
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,439
She could really be

240
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,719
The widespread ended

241
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,743
Visual Voice

242
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
Kind of

243
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,607
But not really it's not the same thing

244
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:55,007
There are a lot of angels

245
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,151
Information if I recall correctly Hangout

246
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:09,599
Alex Jones is really does hinge point where it's like you're saying

247
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,183
She was there in the 90s he was doing the

248
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:17,535
Does television

249
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,583
Was incredibly

250
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,031
Yeah pretty early on

251
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,311
Depressed about weight

252
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
Yeah

253
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,943
You know I haven't I have a quick question to ask you one of the funniest parts about your

254
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,247
Testimony which of course is the only thing I pay 10

255
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,551
Ancient Oaks

256
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:47,743
That was a good one. Hahaha

257
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,095
Is the the

258
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,167
Position of how Alex

259
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,471
Describes all of his guests as

260
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
The most qualified.

261
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,543
Top of their field

262
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,567
The single grader

263
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,359
This person everybody knows this person

264
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,223
Could not have tried to twist the knife more at the beginning

265
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,247
When he was like

266
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,551
Where did you graduate from

267
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
Oh that's

268
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,623
Cool let me ask you a question did you graduate from

269
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,815
Genuinely the most

270
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:35,103
Early Autumn

271
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,711
At Mark and he knows what he's doing and so I

272
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,527
Good hands but it was really

273
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,135
How many degrees do you have

274
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,927
Just suggest her

275
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:55,583
That would be embarrassing

276
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,631
Badham

277
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:04,543
Yeah I got into there then I was like they're so cute

278
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,151
Institution

279
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,527
Harvard

280
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,343
Turned out its share of people

281
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,911
I dropped out of high school

282
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,959
And after that

283
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,239
Applying for colleges

284
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,519
Is and

285
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,543
I was

286
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,335
Guaranteed basically that I

287
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,871
I could get into the University of Missouri

288
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,199
I lived in Columbia and it was easy

289
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,295
The only other college I applied to was Harvard

290
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,671
Missouri

291
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,887
Makeup for me dropping app could not work out

292
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,679
Evocative

293
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,959
Submissive

294
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,287
I regret nothing

295
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,151
Another

296
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:18,527
As fun as I believe it was

297
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,319
Or did that question not make it through

298
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:25,695
Yeah there was a juror that aisle 32 swear under oath that I was not a lizard person

299
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,975
The question did not make

300
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,255
Get through so I didn't get the

301
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,703
Gallagher time to really reveal yourself to the world I guess

302
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,287
Christmas Eve that I am not allow

303
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
The podcast

304
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:54,367
Yeah that's a good point we tried to clean doesn't hold you accountable for what you

305
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,255
I can't lie.

306
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:07,167
Attempted love Claus it's terrible

307
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,191
30 greater than that of the

308
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:08,959
The law

309
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,591
I'm thinking about this

310
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,615
This this

311
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:19,199
Picture of the media landscape back then in like 20

312
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,015
12 realize

313
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,807
Lycoming Coast AM

314
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,343
Is probably one of the biggest

315
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,111
Things

316
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,647
Other than Alex

317
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,439
The touches on some of these issues

318
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:33,023
But even seem silly to say because Alex was

319
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,047
Constantly

320
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,935
Even like

321
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,007
A couple times I hit Steve pieczenik

322
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,055
Coast to Coast

323
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,359
It's not say if you need a big

324
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,639
Can you call Stevi B's

325
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,455
That that wasn't done

326
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,807
Peter Griffin

327
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,831
Cookout

328
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,135
We got to get the guy who murdered all those Muro in here

329
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:09,119
It's about the internet at that point and I feel like

330
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,655
Episode about like

331
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,727
Facebook being an entirely different place back then too

332
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:19,871
B11 you find when you go back and start rooting around in like archive.org

333
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,527
Bless

334
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,087
Verified account

335
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,391
So you had Alex

336
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,951
I thought you also had like

337
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:39,839
Do the dozens of every looking with the other recommended

338
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:44,703
Reposting and reposting is like

339
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
Something better

340
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,543
Hard for us to even conceptualize now and this

341
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,407
Is there a difference

342
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:00,831
Yeah that's right I bet I could have buried that memory but there were no a

343
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
Couple of times

344
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,623
The friend of mine was like

345
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,207
Became friends with a celebrity on Facebook

346
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,023
It was like that's not a real account

347
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,935
It is it is like thinking of it as the Wild West

348
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,239
When you think of the Wild West you think

349
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,007
The distance

350
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,031
Pass not like

351
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,311
A few years ago

352
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:31,551
We still think of social media

353
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,599
Obviously it is but

354
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,623
BMO

355
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:38,207
That has changed

356
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,279
I meant your point about the kind of

357
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,303
You know Alex Jones

358
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,119
Something bad

359
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,655
I didn't really have time to

360
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,591
Different creators

361
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:59,455
Amplify each other and each other's ideas and create

362
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,527
Like self-reinforcing

363
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:09,439
Reference Alex Jones as like the authority and be like

364
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,255
This idea

365
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:19,167
Networks of people

366
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,703
We're all going on each other

367
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:25,055
Shows were all-time amplifying each other

368
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:31,199
And seem like they're kind of sightings

369
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,991
Yeah

370
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:37,855
It's like almost circular credibility but it's a completely different shape

371
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,183
It's a million sided shape of

372
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,231
Self-feeding credibility

373
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,279
That's kind of what I was going to ask

374
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,607
Could you give us kind of like a visualization of how that

375
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,935
Disseminates like what I kind of see in my head is almost

376
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,007
These these Giant Circles that eventually

377
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,311
Well actually I can

378
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:02,431
Actually

379
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:05,759
Brought you into biosphere

2017 and 2018 Buick LeSabre

Yeah yeah

385
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,511
If there is a visualization in there with a bunch

386
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
Sublime

387
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,047
Between

388
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:22,143
Surprised I haven't read the answer to my question alright

389
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:27,519
This is a visualization of things in 2018

390
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,567
And so I would imagine

391
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,591
That would be

392
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,871
You know the way we

393
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,199
What's so fascinating is

394
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:35,967
Different

395
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,015
But Landscaping

396
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,575
Couple years later

397
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,855
Frances that you've noticed

398
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
Specifically

399
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,671
100% yes

400
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,463
Yeah 100%

401
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,767
I feel like well first of all

402
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,791
Think about that

403
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,839
Got Network

404
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,143
Made was

405
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,727
It was specifically looking at kind of like

406
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:04,127
Dave Rubin

407
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,063
Person

408
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,599
Influenza

409
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,768
I'm interested people from Alex Jones

410
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,584
World on that Network

411
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,872
Start

412
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:42,272
Ended up having to wait him out because she was at the center of his own alternative

413
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,416
Is that like if you

414
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,696
Brawl like

415
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,232
A completely

416
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,280
Even though

417
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,816
There's a ton of overlap

418
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,168
Well I guess at the time probably not

419
00:21:59,424 --> 00:21:59,936
Nick Fuentes

420
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:04,032
Radar

421
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,592
Joe Rogan Candace Owens

422
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,616
Gavin

423
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:08,896
Cernovich

424
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,944
But yeah

425
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,224
That's better than

426
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,016
Interesting that he would he would be his own

427
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:19,904
A visualization of a yarn pattern

428
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,720
It's like Circles of influence and where they are and I'll

429
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,744
Alex Gibson Amorphis

430
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,632
Blob cancer cell Somewhere over the distance pack some stuff

431
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
Everywhere

432
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,800
If I include Alex Jones I need to do an entire other report

433
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,360
Hasn't happened but

434
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,456
But yeah

435
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,880
They're not in the algorithm

436
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:55,488
Exactly so credit

437
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,768
I think

438
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,168
Wild

439
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,824
100 people that aren't

440
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,224
Literally said I am a white nationalist based on empiricism

441
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,952
You know

442
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:26,976
Right

443
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:33,376
Because people didn't yell at him and told him

444
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,544
Adult bar

445
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,640
Keep them but I would have so many receipts

446
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,456
And then

447
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,784
Also it's just someone who is able to

448
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,416
Is such

449
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:00,512
He was such a powerful radicalization point right

450
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,792
Because he was someone that

451
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,328
Maintain

452
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:09,472
Credibility for a while that he would get invited and so

453
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,496
Right

454
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,848
Mainstream

455
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,664
Again quote on Co credibility

456
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,832
More openly extremist shows

457
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,368
Speak his mind

458
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,208
He was

459
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,744
Just like no one to be

460
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,560
What about this

461
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,168
Told you know

462
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:45,568
I believe that he was one of those mentioned by name

463
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,592
But

464
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,384
Yes

465
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,456
Kick-off I think was a huge deal

466
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:55,808
The fact that like red ice and some of these other kind of openly

467
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,904
The big deal

468
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,672
Change

469
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,488
Actually

470
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,792
I wanted I wanted to touch on Red Ice really

471
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,816
Quick because

472
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,376
They've come up a couple times on our show in the past

473
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,680
I owe you looking at this

474
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,472
Bears 2018 report

475
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,520
Henry

476
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,544
Weigh-off

477
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,336
In the side of this

478
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,640
Visualization of the network

479
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,664
But

480
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,968
I was thinking about this as I was looking at it

481
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,528
That's right real quick I just want to interrupt

482
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:32,416
So because we can't see you on the screen Becca you just need to know that man instantly brought up your article on

483
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:37,536
Computer that I brought up how stupid I am

484
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:42,400
Refresh myself on a beacon

485
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,752
Alex

486
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:52,128
They would be much closer and much more

487
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,736
Connect people in Alex's world

488
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,064
Super everything that's right I did my prep

489
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,856
For the for the trial

490
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,160
I kept encountering them because it was

491
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,768
What were the Wolf Gang you went under a couple of several of these

492
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,424
It's crazy man with Nixon.

493
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,984
Has backed on a white nationalist show

494
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,056
I would say this is a

495
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:21,824
Conservative us

496
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,104
Estimate

497
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,384
M250

498
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,176
P-unit of Alex's

499
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,200
Crew

500
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,736
Earth-like roster of

501
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,296
Of gas. I've appeared on Red Ice

502
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,880
It would be a lot

503
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,440
And obviously it's not

504
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,840
The amount

505
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,936
Anti-Semitism in white supremacist

506
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,472
Alex Jones

507
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,008
Baking in tub

508
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,056
Conspiracy theory

509
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:54,848
The way that you

510
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,384
You come to see it is

511
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,920
Through the people that he is

512
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,456
Working West because

513
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:06,368
But then the people that key amplifies if you go onto their shows they're not

514
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,208
Right he's crazy laundry

515
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,744
You know

516
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:16,352
Play some point he had Owen Benjamin hosting the 4th hour

517
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,192
Before he had gone

518
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:23,776
Full

519
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,800
Stop talking to him

520
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,616
And he was just hanging out drinking in his backyard

521
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,176
So it was a middle space

522
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,456
Alex

523
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,248
I mean I don't know if

524
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,784
You could say that tired him

525
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,088
But he was hosting the fourth hour once a week

526
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,648
Birthday

527
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,440
Thunderstruck

528
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,512
Now it is it there

529
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,072
What does still has a channel on

530
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,376
On Bandit video edit post

531
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:50,912
Some bad stuff

532
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,704
Can I ask you if I could do you feel like

533
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,752
In your research you've seen

534
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,800
A lot of these people

535
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:00,128
Become more extreme or just

536
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,152
Stop

537
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,688
Laundering

538
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,224
It so much do you know what I mean like

539
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:08,064
Actually increasing the extremity of their language or they just

540
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,088
Being like finite

541
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,856
I can just say it now

542
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,160
Yeah I think it's a combination of

543
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,976
First of all you do have this

544
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,768
Interesting Dynamic where

545
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:20,096
Understandable I think there's been a lot of

546
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,936
Anxiety around YouTubers radicalizing

547
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,472
YouTube viewers witch

548
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,824
But then you also have this other

549
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
Feedback loop because

550
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,152
Viewers now Henry's Plumbing

551
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,992
And like on Livestream, and real-time and all these things

552
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,320
You actually have audiences demanding more extremist

553
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,368
Contact from Creed

554
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:45,184
Weird feedback we were it's like

555
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,232
Creators end up

556
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:52,352
Responding to the wishes of Their audience like I would say that

557
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,424
Tim pool is a really classic case of this more like

558
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,008
I've done the knowledge fight

559
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,800
Treatment on gym floor

560
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,080
Olive

561
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:02,848
Is content

562
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,408
Start amount of time

563
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:14,112
It's so interesting to watch him in a bit by bit into the positions that he has now

564
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,904
Imperfect being

565
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:19,488
Call Wendy Delgado. Stop.

566
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
Responded to it

567
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
Yeah

568
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:26,400
And I think maybe along the way he tried to convince himself of some of these ideas

569
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,168
Question of

570
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:33,568
How much is it come from Matthew we're kind of saying yeah exactly

571
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,384
I don't like

572
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,432
But the Republican Party

573
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,272
Husband going

574
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:46,368
Further and further to the right

575
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,440
Nissan

576
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:53,024
I believe the day or the day after Viktor Orban

577
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:58,912
Oh my God

578
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,704
We all love each other right

579
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,568
Weirdly

580
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,360
Find the YouTube

581
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,920
I think the people that were

582
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,456
Strategic enough

583
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,248
Straddle the line ever

584
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:17,600
Open Lisa a white nationalist are white supremacist

585
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,648
Still use that rhetoric

586
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,464
They're still thriving and their rhetoric

587
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,512
He's getting more and more extreme

588
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:27,328
Riley reiff

589
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,912
What are my biggest pet peeves is when people talk it up

590
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,240
Fringe

591
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,776
Friends

592
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,056
Sitting there

593
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,336
In some of the most

594
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:41,408
Powerful media position

595
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,968
He's an incredibly powerful

596
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,248
Attitude

597
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:49,088
I've done this important presentations where I just take

598
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,648
Replacement Theory

599
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,208
The Christ

600
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,744
Christchurch shooter

601
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,280
Charlie Kirk

602
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:00,096
And a quote of Jason

603
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,424
And there's more

604
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,960
4 quotes about

605
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,520
Great replacement Siri or indistinguishable

606
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
Courts

607
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,272
You take away though

608
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,720
Yeah that's gas something that I have

609
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,488
Long

610
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,536
Thought

611
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,304
Like

612
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,840
Bowser taken out of context

613
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,656
In context all of this

614
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,424
The stuff they were talking

615
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,192
I'm about

616
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,216
Ends up worse

617
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:42,592
The other thing too dude that I thought of what you're saying these things

618
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,616
These statements are the same

619
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,920
With the names removed the most

620
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,224
Difficult episodes

621
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,528
Was about the day of

622
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,064
Anders Breivik

623
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,928
Over his Manifesto

624
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,512
Does the

625
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,072
If you were to isolate just

626
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,352
The words of this

627
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,376
It would sound

628
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,192
Very familiar to the hours listeners

629
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,520
It was kind of a revelatory mobile

630
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,544
I meant for me I was like

631
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,312
How

632
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,080
Gross

633
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,432
Gateway you're saying like it's not friends

634
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,200
It is it's

635
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,784
The stuff that's in a brevik Manifesto is

636
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,064
Broadcast on

637
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,088
Places

638
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,392
Xterra

639
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,232
Exactly I really like there's a really good

640
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,072
Define

641
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,864
As

642
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,144
An in-group

643
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,168
But

644
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:39,936
Define

645
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,216
Their success

646
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,496
Only by

647
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,800
Punishing an out-group

648
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,080
Evergreen Lake

649
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,104
Owning the libs

650
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,784
Definition is like he says it's a misunderstanding

651
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,064
To say that

652
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:59,392
Extremism is defined by being outside of the mainstream

653
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:03,744
Because if you think of some of the most important extremist regimes in history

654
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,328
Beware the main street right Nazism Nazi Germany

655
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,376
What's the mainstream

656
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,984
UFO

657
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,312
He thought was the mainstream extremist

658
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:21,408
We still hang out

659
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,176
That like

660
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,712
Somehow

661
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:31,392
That's one of the jury members ask me the question of what

662
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,976
Which I thought was

663
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:35,744
Question

664
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:43,168
Couldn't put the lighter that right if you guys like call tell him I miss all the time that it's like

665
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,728
When is advantageous to him he's

666
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,872
Where does the nut start little you don't work for the underdog information

667
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:56,480
It was a really interesting part of your testimony especially when the question

668
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,504
Came from the jury because

669
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,600
Cuz that was almost The Identical question Bill asked

670
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,904
It is deposition

671
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,768
Define it and then see if

672
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:11,328
Don't fit all of those definition

673
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,704
Basically walked in

674
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,776
Conceding that

675
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,568
Himself and most of

676
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,848
The people he thinks are free

677
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,176
Are actually mainstream according to Zone definition

678
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:31,552
Exactly

679
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,344
Most powerful people I'm here you know

680
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,368
Of course

681
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:41,280
Yeah like a million times via traffic of CNN's somehow

682
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,304
Everybody

683
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,888
To CNN we have more business you are always knows everything

684
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:48,448
I was just going to say that

685
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:54,848
Free line on a on a recent podcast that stuck with me and I'm going to do is

686
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,896
Alex Jones

687
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,832
Tomatoes picking Everest

688
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,600
That's

689
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,368
Shop

690
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,136
Define dollars

691
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,976
A completely opposite

692
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,768
And somehow

693
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,608
In his mind and in his rhetoric

694
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,984
And also throws a hat on

695
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,080
Came out of my right

696
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:29,408
Just indignation over the

697
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:33,248
Volcano

698
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,576
Something

699
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,464
Who is the strong

700
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,144
It's been a long time since I sat down

701
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,448
Episode

702
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,216
Speech

703
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,872
I don't know

704
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:03,712
Have you had a chance to see Alex's documentary by chance

705
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:09,088
I have not yet I listen to your podcast episode about it but I haven't watched it yet

706
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,672
Chocolate

707
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:16,768
Good Luck Charlie

708
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,216
Confirmation bias

709
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,568
How did it

710
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,640
Field to be cross-examined by the defenses lawyer because

711
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,920
The moment he asked

712
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:37,760
You after what one he said two things that made me want to

713
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,320
Before you

714
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:44,672
Before even started asking you questions he was trying to imply that you were unqualified

715
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,208
The fact that we heard

716
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,280
A list of qualifications that can only be described as

717
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,048
The most

718
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:53,632
Qualified to sit in that chair

719
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,912
And then

720
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,960
And then later when he asked

721
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:00,800
What confirmation if you knew what confirmation bias was

722
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:06,176
I was ready to jump over the over the walls and do they like

723
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:09,504
Yeah it was it was a wild

724
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,808
Experience I mean

725
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:18,720
I'd be lying if I said this was my first time like you don't testify

726
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:23,328
Your first time

727
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,168
Part of me wishes by a baby been able to do like a lower profile

728
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:36,640
Open mic

729
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,368
Do you know the information really phase me because

730
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,672
Particularly actually with this

731
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,744
That one called

732
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:56,352
Such a stir among the

733
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,144
Amazed

734
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,032
That exact

735
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,616
Line of reasoning like at me and so

736
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:10,176
To me that wasn't a new

737
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,968
Thing that I've heard

738
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,296
It's not only directed at me like

739
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,368
That line being red

740
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,232
But the irony of it

741
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,816
Because of course they're using that line

742
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,352
Defensive

743
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,888
Target on Bayou

744
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:36,032
They might as well literally say I'm Rubber and you're glue like a piece of that

745
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,872
Demeanor

746
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,152
Exactly

747
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:55,488
I think that was my main thing throughout this whole thing of I'm a teacher and so like

748
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,536
Hawkins Missouri to me

749
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:01,120
I could just kind of be in teacher mode and that to me is really like

750
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:01,888
Natural

751
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:08,288
Academic I'm not used to having these interactions that are by their very

752
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,312
Structure

753
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,848
Adversarial

754
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,408
I would find myself

755
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,712
Questions and

756
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,760
Miami responses like

757
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:23,648
If I get the chance I can

758
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:30,048
Can really explain to this guy how things work not really understanding that he doesn't give a f*** it all

759
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:34,400
Rock chuck

760
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:38,496
This is not a teaching opportunity

761
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:42,336
Blacksilva lawyer

762
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:50,528
Different in that context to be like okay what

763
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,488
Pacific Catch

764
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,376
It really getting into the weeds

765
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,656
Statistical stuff

766
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:11,520
And so I was trying to gauge like okay how much do I prove that one

767
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:13,824
Nonsense

768
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,104
Well overdue

769
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,664
Yeah

770
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:22,784
They were getting towards I could ask questions he was getting towards basically like prove to me statistic

771
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,576
6 exist

772
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,624
It was leaning towards like

773
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:30,208
The bickering about sample sizes and what have you

774
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:34,048
Is is this a credible Outlet

775
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,608
Sprite

776
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,656
This statistic

777
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:44,288
These are based on phone interviews you don't even know if those people are real do you

778
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,848
I don't even know how to

779
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,664
Engage with a person who's like if you call somebody on the phone

780
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,016
It doesn't count as another human being

781
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:58,112
Easier to respond to like when you start getting into

782
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,768
White like what is statistical significance that was the part where I just decided not even to engage with it cuz there's no way

783
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,816
I'm going to be able to respond to that in like

784
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,888
Like 30 seconds

785
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,168
Remember

786
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,032
Actually answer the questions he was

787
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:25,248
We'd like to introduce exhibit 6

788
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:30,112
Before that is a 6 hour lecture by Becca Lewis on how to expand a deal with

789
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,672
Statistics in media literacy

790
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:39,072
What's an all-around

791
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,376
Unresponsive

792
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:47,776
Spot that I have two bad question

793
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,431
To this alternative

794
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,967
What's Network

795
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,503
Because you know

796
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,295
What you did

797
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,063
28

798
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:06,207
Lot a lot of blowback from people included in it

799
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,487
I'm not bad

800
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,023
Is the miac report of lying

801
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:13,887
These people around here and we see where they've gone sense

802
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,679
Your arguments are a little bit

803
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,775
I want to die

804
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:23,871
Because you know you're somebody who still watches a lot of this

805
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,407
Stop and you still are studying

806
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,687
This space

807
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,967
Outside

808
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,735
If YouTube

809
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,015
Who do you think

810
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,295
Is

811
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,063
Like

812
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,367
The big nodes now

813
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,647
Like who would you think

814
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,695
Sauron

815
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:40,511
On Radars or should be more on radars

816
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,279
And

817
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,303
Secondarily

818
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:44,863
Do you think

819
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,631
Babes

820
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,191
The people who are on here

821
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,727
It did

822
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,751
Anybody

823
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:51,775
Assembly

824
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:52,799
Or

825
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,103
I'm not sure

826
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,639
The freezer

827
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,407
Isn't great

828
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:02,015
Maybe get what I'm asking

829
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,063
He was really big for like 3 months

830
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,511
But you know what it was interesting to me is

831
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,607
First of all how much of this network has

832
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:23,263
The overlap more with kind of cable news networks

833
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:28,383
At this point I don't know how I could talk about these figures without talking about Tucker Carlson as well

834
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:36,063
Kellyanne Conway is a regular guest on MSNBC now yeah we're front

835
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,647
I'm like you.

836
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,231
Did entire segments kind of like

837
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,935
Christchurch shooter ended up

838
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,983
Before

839
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,031
Before

840
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,055
Damn

841
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,847
I'm so I don't know how

842
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,151
I could do that without talk about him

843
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,967
Whatever

844
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:08,575
Endorse it Amplified Lauren Southern inside of a

845
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:13,183
Eclipse conspiracy theory about farmers in South Africa

846
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:17,279
Now

847
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:22,911
Doing that America

848
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:29,311
Sincere

849
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,615
Ecology will be reported as a 100%

850
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,639
Sent this to your apology

851
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:40,319
She's also still suspicious about immigration

852
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:44,671
I mean I really think that

853
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,207
What happens if

854
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:48,767
YouTube

855
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,583
Bunch of people you also had some

856
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:56,703
But then there was a

857
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:03,103
And I do think it was people like Glenn Greenwald and Matt Taibbi who stepped into it and so

858
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,151
It's a little bit lesson

859
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,623
Whatever they were doing

860
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:19,999
Was clearly strategic bringing them Fame and it felt like

861
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:23,583
Dave rubenesque move

862
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,375
Why I left the left

863
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:30,751
2026

864
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:34,591
And now here they are.

865
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:38,175
With a little bit less YouTube eccentric but

866
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,455
It's still about the

867
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:43,551
Network of Pi Vincent loose network of influential people who are they

868
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:51,231
Hope each other out with networking but also maintain some type of plausible deniability

869
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:55,071
Glenn Greenwald

870
00:45:56,095 --> 00:46:00,447
Alliance that Dave Rubin Hughes about interviewing people like Stefan molyneux

871
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,751
5 years ago

872
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:09,151
Freehold has about be like

873
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,967
It's identical essentially

874
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:15,807
I'm not on the right but the left has gone too far

875
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:16,575
Kind of

876
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,367
Mentality

877
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:21,439
And that's exactly what feeds into

878
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,487
Need a right-wing audience

879
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,279
Further right-wing audience

880
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:30,399
Anesthetizing them to the idea that they're further to the right than they

881
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,167
I think they are

882
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,215
Absolutely

883
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:37,311
And then I think the other big figure has been sewing

884
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,383
But somehow has managed to stay

885
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,919
So under the bed

886
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,759
Billboards

887
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:46,783
What side of Midway

888
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:51,135
Like it's not in Time Square from what I saw on

889
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,439
I don't know if those were photo ShopRite

890
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:58,303
Yeah I seen the ones outside of Midway driving back just going like what

891
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,607
In God's name is that I know you didn't believe it at

892
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,631
Further Evidence

893
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,911
That is not a real Airport

894
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:03,679
That's true

895
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,983
Yeah it's a bus station

896
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,031
Who is somebody who

897
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:10,335
Cover Maybe

898
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,871
And like people have ass

899
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,895
Stupid

900
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,943
You seem like somebody who is

901
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:17,247
Attention

902
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:21,599
That like you try to start a fight with me and I Ciara

903
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,671
More trouble than it's worth

904
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:27,487
And other people are somewhat paying

905
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,767
To have

906
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,047
You see some critical

907
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:30,815
Call Copper Ridge

908
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:33,375
Where is Whitney started

909
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,655
Like there was really anything

910
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:35,679
That was

911
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,727
Sort of pointed in the right direction

912
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,287
I always liked those why I left

913
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,567
That's why I left

914
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:44,895
The Democratic party poster why I left the left

915
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:45,663
That's for the

916
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,199
Never say

917
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,991
Millions of dollars

918
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:55,135
It's so weird how they suddenly get millions of dollars and they say it's all the principal position

919
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,559
That's one of Alex's like soda

920
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,583
Pieces of his

921
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,399
His own sort of Mythology

922
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:11,007
Believe like with me like I was offered all of this stuff and I turned

923
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,311
Turn it down or not but like

924
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,847
Toppers at Fox

925
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:20,735
The idea that you'll have a book that you put out and will automatically make it about

926
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:22,783
Resolute

927
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:25,087
Types of writing

928
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,415
People I think

929
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:31,487
Totally totally

930
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:37,375
Pressing and cynical and

931
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:43,263
In a weird way even more depressing than like the True Believers because

932
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,567
With a True Believer you can

933
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:48,383
Workout de-radicalization and

934
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,199
I mean not to be too flippant about it but it

935
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:56,063
It's like The Big Lebowski wine rightly say what you will about

936
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,159
Nihilism

937
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,439
Behind

938
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:04,511
Just doing this stuff for profit and thinking you're above the

939
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,535
The politics of it

940
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,863
Is just so disgust

941
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:16,543
With the True Believers those are the ones where I I still hold out hope

942
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:20,895
That you can somehow either people that work on D radicalism

943
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:24,223
What do you do with someone else

944
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:26,527
It's hopeless

945
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:31,903
Yeah I really do money runs out I guess

946
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,439
Just people into far as like

947
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,975
I respect

948
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,255
People who believe

949
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:39,327
You know like who really believe all of it

950
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,095
Contrite

951
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,375
Do the stuff

952
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,399
Even if I think it's

953
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,167
Absurd

954
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,215
At the very least I can see them

955
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:47,263
Processing this information

956
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,543
Leaving it

957
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:49,823
Singapore

958
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,103
It's the people who are

959
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,383
Manipulating them

960
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,967
Let's say a trillion dollars in gold

961
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:58,271
That they wear around their neck or whatever

962
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,575
It's like you're the most month

963
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,343
Monstrous thing I can

964
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:07,231
With Alex Jones viewer these people

965
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:10,815
It's a little bit like thinking about

966
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:17,215
Cult member to go onto Lake Recruit new cult members to take away the responsibility of

967
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,751
The Alex

968
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:21,567
You are too went on to harass the Sandy Hook

969
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:24,383
But it is to say that they are old

970
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,919
So being harmed by Alex

971
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,711
But his rhetoric because

972
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,479
Galaxy

973
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,503
Meaning of life

974
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:32,319
And they are trusting him to deliver the

975
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,087
Truth

976
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:36,671
They are also harmed by this

977
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,207
Even if they are part of the

978
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,535
Yeah right like leaving

979
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,303
Someone like

980
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:47,935
I was at Lucy Richards and the books of rastas

981
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:50,495
Principal I always

982
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:51,775
Tried to

983
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,311
Look at things as like

984
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,335
Empathy

985
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,871
Towards the consumer

986
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:57,151
Of this b*******

987
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,175
And like

988
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:01,247
Really real strong disdain

989
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,015
Producer

990
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,135
A being at least

991
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:07,903
Just serve

992
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:09,951
Sure ending in the

993
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,231
This case specifically

994
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,255
Part of

995
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,023
Holding

996
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:13,791
Alex

997
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,071
Accountable is that

998
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,375
The people who who harassed

999
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,167
Speedy family

1000
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,447
They are the

1001
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,215
There's a bullet

1002
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,263
You know

1003
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:24,799
And

1004
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:25,823
I don't like bullets

1005
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:26,847
Any more than I like

1006
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,127
The person firing the gun

1007
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,151
But if you

1008
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:29,919
Try and like

1009
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,711
Punish the bullet

1010
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:39,135
It'll find mobile

1011
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,415
Stop making bullets

1012
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:43,487
Totally totally

1013
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:46,047
Yesterday I told

1014
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:46,815
My

1015
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,351
My class about kind of

1016
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:52,703
The First Amendment

1017
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,983
Social media

1018
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:57,055
Give you a standing ovation when you walked in the room

1019
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,999
Something that like

1020
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,303
Working on this thing

1021
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:21,887
Historically thinking about the First Amendment

1022
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:24,703
This idea that Alex

1023
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:25,727
What's John's promos

1024
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:32,127
First Amendment freedom of speech means that I personally as an individual

1025
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,151
I want to say

1026
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:35,967
Do not Bend

1027
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:40,063
The first amendment has been understood like throughout the history of the United States

1028
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,647
Regal

1029
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,231
Think about

1030
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:50,047
Communal sense

1031
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:52,095
I'm thinking about you

1032
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:54,655
Forest within a community

1033
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:00,287
Part of freedom of speech is also

1034
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,311
The freedom to

1035
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,103
Valuable information

1036
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:12,831
Whatever it's the sorry I'm rambling.

1037
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,879
Noble in real truth yes

1038
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,719
Yeah I think

1039
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,511
I always

1040
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:21,791
Find that

1041
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,583
So interesting

1042
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,351
But in noise

1043
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,423
Makes sense

1044
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:29,983
The notion of the First Amendment the people like Alex

1045
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:32,799
Exist

1046
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:33,823
But like

1047
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:37,151
It's so boring how much they bring it up and

1048
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:37,919
Completely

1049
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,223
Lockable situation

1050
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:41,759
The fan of Base

1051
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:45,599
The true American Pastime is misunderstanding

1052
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:51,999
Cabela brights if someone hits a ball out of the park and they

1053
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:01,215
It's not just Alex Jones but

1054
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,775
It's a social media pop

1055
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,359
The reason that it's

1056
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:10,687
That's

1057
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:14,783
The reason they promote that idea free spaces because that's the idea

1058
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:23,231
Is it crazy to think about how it's not just the people who use Facebook who are

1059
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:27,839
Advancing this concept it is Facebook itself because they don't have to hold them

1060
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:28,863
Themselves accountable

1061
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,911
Hey Google spell this idea of like

1062
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,959
You should be allowed to say whatever you want

1063
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:37,311
You know exactly exactly

1064
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,847
Yeah that's interesting

1065
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:39,871
Picture then going to

1066
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:42,687
It becomes more clear that there's a lot more responsibility to go right

1067
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:47,807
Responsibility to go around I find absurdly high

1068
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,343
Pretty

1069
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,671
This is not

1070
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,207
Responsibility

1071
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,535
Saumur

1072
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,655
I mean it goes

1073
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:07,519
It goes all the way back to you know we discussed it a while back look problematique

1074
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,823
She know like the the idea that Oliver

1075
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,103
These things are interconnect

1076
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:15,711
They are not a visual elements to individual things

1077
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:16,735
They're all part of

1078
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,783
A larger hole that we're not

1079
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,319
Jordans

1080
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:22,111
Open to an academic

1081
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:25,439
The club of Rome

1082
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:30,047
I pulled out the one thing I remember from our past

1083
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:36,191
I know Jordan you like to say that

1084
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,775
You say that you're not whatever you're about to

1085
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:44,639
To say next do not say it he's gotten too much positive feedback over the last two weeks

1086
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:47,455
If I remain a clown and I shall stay one

1087
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,735
Till the day I die

1088
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,015
How dare you madam

1089
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:54,623
Make you angry for a second and say something another night

1090
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:01,535
Quality junk food delivery was

1091
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,983
The media

1092
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,263
Homebridge

1093
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:13,311
The Alex Jones trial I think have been

1094
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,639
So necessary on spot on because

1095
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:21,247
This is actually right before I wrote the my report on YouTube

1096
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,015
My

1097
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,111
How much

1098
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:31,743
The mainstream media plays a role in the amplification

1099
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:37,631
Hitting the nail on the head with all of that and the coverage

1100
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:43,007
Journalists who have been there like day-in-day-out version

1101
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:45,823
Elizabeth

1102
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,895
But then the people don't forget Murdock

1103
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:51,711
Sebastian Reserve

1104
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:55,807
People that have left Twitter presence but like there's an incredible

1105
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:02,207
Text Mom

1106
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:02,975
Easy crafts

1107
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:07,839
But then you get all these other people parachuting in only one

1108
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:16,543
Push back a tiny bit on your compliment

1109
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,335
2 Jordans

1110
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:19,871
Please

1111
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,919
I think that you're totally right

1112
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:28,319
I bet the critiques that you were making and putting forth where it where it

1113
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,367
But also let's not

1114
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:40,863
Glenn Greenwald

1115
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:43,423
The end of that

1116
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,775
Critiques sure

1117
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:55,199
I just I just feel like the last thing I said was

1118
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:06,463
No I mean I do

1119
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,231
One of the big

1120
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:07,999
Big things that

1121
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:11,327
The media absolutely refuses to acknowledge is that

1122
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,095
Part of the reason

1123
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:13,375
They like to amplify

1124
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,143
These voices

1125
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,679
It's so they get the clown on them

1126
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,727
And then creating that

1127
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:21,567
Owning the conservatives turns into another owning the libs

1128
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:23,359
Zenit just created a speed bag

1129
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:25,663
And they refuse to acknowledge their partner

1130
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,431
Well

1131
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,455
I think saved

1132
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,527
In cases like that wrong

1133
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,319
Lookout ski

1134
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,343
There it is

1135
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,135
It's kind of the same criticism released

1136
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:39,487
That I had of the documentary

1137
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,791
MMA like you're not giving

1138
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,815
People context

1139
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:47,167
So you're showing me something

1140
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,703
He would probably stand Bhai

1141
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:54,591
And already know it's not right

1142
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:57,663
And already have some sort of a criticism for it

1143
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,943
But instead it's the

1144
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:00,223
Just being broadcast to

1145
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:01,759
People

1146
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:05,087
I don't think it gets the effect

1147
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:07,135
That absolute or putting it for

1148
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:10,463
Seemed to think it was

1149
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:16,095
Richard Spencer

1150
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:16,863
Because

1151
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,703
Anytime

1152
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:23,263
Wanted to talk to him he was

1153
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,799
More than happy

1154
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:32,991
Oh yeah it's going to prevent worker profile about him

1155
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:38,367
Are we mean to them

1156
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:41,951
Ninety-nine out of a hundred people read

1157
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:48,095
She doesn't care it's that one person who wasn't so him and says maybe he has a point that he's trying to reach out

1158
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:53,215
AI thinq

1159
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:54,239
People like

1160
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,031
What are the reasons they can be

1161
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,335
Effective is because of

1162
00:59:59,103 --> 00:59:59,871
Very first

1163
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:03,199
Fraction of the first part of what they're saying

1164
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:05,759
Is a valid critique of the mainstream media

1165
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:13,695
Take it from there and taken wildly inaccurate awful directions

1166
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:14,719
Sensationalist

1167
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:15,743
Is true

1168
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,559
Well that's a problem with a lot of his

1169
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:21,631
There's a critique of the government being

1170
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:23,679
Ineffectual are not representing

1171
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:26,751
Necessarily the will of the electric

1172
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:28,287
There's things like that

1173
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:29,823
Yummy just

1174
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,103
To be totally clear

1175
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,639
False flags do eggs

1176
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,943
It is a thing that

1177
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:36,991
Kernels

1178
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,015
Of something

1179
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:45,183
You get some too much mileage out of there is there is the simplest protect that there is to make honestly

1180
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:45,951
Please like

1181
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:50,303
The same thing that you could safer the Democrats like what your real elect

1182
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,839
Stability comes from isn't what you

1183
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:52,607
You say it's

1184
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:55,423
If you govern well people will be like hell yeah

1185
01:00:57,471 --> 01:01:00,287
Because you're also failing maybe you're doing some good

1186
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:03,103
Maybe you're doing on the whole more good then

1187
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,127
Been bad

1188
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:05,407
But at the same time

1189
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,199
If you're not willing to

1190
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:09,759
Engage with all the bad you're doing then you're just going to

1191
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,551
Total

1192
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:14,111
I just want to

1193
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,903
Pearl's I think so

1194
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:16,927
Dangerous

1195
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:17,695
Because

1196
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:23,071
A mechanism by which took out of a snare people in

1197
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,679
Hundred percent

1198
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:30,239
Hold on I didn't get I don't think I got an answer

1199
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,287
Search my question from earlier

1200
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,335
Who else should we be afraid of

1201
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,895
Oh I think the exact people that you're

1202
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:42,527
B l u B10 Tim pool

1203
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,575
Some much more

1204
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:47,391
Institutionally powerful have in common

1205
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:54,815
What's interesting is that for a while it was this group of

1206
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:02,751
For lack of a better word like internet weirdos

1207
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:07,359
And some of these people who are in this you-know-who or people you

1208
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:09,151
2018

1209
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:11,199
Are people who have ascended to more

1210
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,735
Eczema

1211
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:17,087
Institutional power like

1212
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,111
From having

1213
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,159
Like a YouTube thing

1214
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,439
Do now he's on

1215
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,719
Glenn Beck's net worth

1216
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:23,999
Steve

1217
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:26,815
Crowder is there la

1218
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:30,911
Significantly sent

1219
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:31,679
This point

1220
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:33,215
Nick Fuentes

1221
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:36,031
Do you know back then was just sort of the Nazi who would go in

1222
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,567
Argue with people on

1223
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:41,663
Cozy streaming platform

1224
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:45,759
Certainly more centralized Milo yiannopoulos

1225
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:46,783
Rapallo

1226
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,575
Now I guess is

1227
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:53,439
Working with Marjorie Taylor Greene

1228
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:54,719
Right

1229
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:58,559
Marjorie Taylor Greene

1230
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:01,119
A literal members of Congress

1231
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:03,423
Who are on board with you spoke

1232
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,471
That has

1233
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:08,031
Significantly changed the landscape as well

1234
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:12,639
Yeah I mean there's also an argument that I

1235
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:14,431
Coming back to of like

1236
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:16,223
It is very easy to get

1237
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:18,527
Caught up in this sort of recency bias

1238
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:20,063
While at the same time

1239
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,087
Being like well

1240
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:27,231
You know things were different back then people were more in the middle and maybe there's just part of it there's that

1241
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:30,047
Because Society was so geared towards White

1242
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,071
People

1243
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:32,863
To say anything you know like

1244
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,191
Extremist during slavery uo

1245
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:42,335
After the government you're like not the government gives me

1246
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:44,127
People to do things for free

1247
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:46,943
I think

1248
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:02,303
But I think you get

1249
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:12,543
People claiming that its all the earnest balls and I don't think that's true at all it's like

1250
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:13,823
Republican Party

1251
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:15,359
That was starting

1252
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:17,407
In the 1960s

1253
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:23,551
The tweet that I was still good lawyer was trying to catch me up

1254
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:24,575
So funny

1255
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:33,791
It was racist

1256
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,583
He got

1257
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,351
Got you good

1258
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:40,959
The southern strategy wouldn't have

1259
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:44,031
Unless there was a demand

1260
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,591
Yeah exactly

1261
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,359
Yes

1262
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,639
100%

1263
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,431
And none of this other

1264
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:54,015
None of this contact the production of it they were discussing

1265
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:55,807
Yeah

1266
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:58,367
Is there tapping in July

1267
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:05,535
I know I know this

1268
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:09,119
Curious to hear how

1269
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:13,983
How you are feeling after what he's just been like a roller-coaster couple of weeks

1270
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:15,263
Because

1271
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:21,151
Yeah I found it to be blessed

1272
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:27,551
Sleep then I've ever not had a bad week for sure

1273
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:28,575
He totally clear

1274
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:31,647
We're recording this after the

1275
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:33,439
Compensatory damages

1276
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,207
Puppy

1277
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:37,279
They're still deliberating the punitive

1278
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:39,071
The full outcome of everything

1279
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,119
But yeah it was

1280
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,167
You know it it's

1281
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,471
The case itself

1282
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:47,519
And going to the trial was

1283
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:49,055
Draining

1284
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,383
Pretty

1285
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:56,991
Rewarding and I think I'm starving

1286
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:01,599
Starlux testimony in particular was something that I

1287
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:02,879
Think we'll

1288
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,159
Prenote stay with

1289
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:06,719
Many people for the rest of their life I won't forget it

1290
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:12,095
I don't know baby I'm in a unique

1291
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:15,167
Position because I was there for the depositions

1292
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,447
Daria

1293
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,495
It's so

1294
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,055
Heard a lot of

1295
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:22,079
I'm Turnt

1296
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,615
The first few days

1297
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:25,919
And so for me it was kind of a

1298
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,479
There was a lot of

1299
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,503
A lot of

1300
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:32,575
Some of that stuff was a little bit of a

1301
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:33,855
Exhausting

1302
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:35,391
Everything

1303
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:36,159
New

1304
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:37,695
For my brain

1305
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:40,511
That I really notice

1306
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:42,303
The trial is that

1307
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:45,119
Well I'll say there's two things like

1308
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:45,887
First off

1309
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,167
That job open

1310
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:49,727
Putting Concepts that I really feel like

1311
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,263
Glen and Matt

1312
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,031
Just jumped in

1313
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:54,847
I feel like we just jumped into a job open

1314
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:58,687
There should be a media outlet that is

1315
01:06:59,199 --> 01:06:59,711
That has a

1316
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:02,271
You know just people who study

1317
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,551
One subject

1318
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,599
So thoroughly

1319
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:12,255
Oh god dammit

1320
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:31,711
Chick-fil-A job openings

1321
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:35,807
The other thing is that

1322
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,855
When they were choosing

1323
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:39,391
Jury

1324
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:41,695
The concept of you should

1325
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,719
Know anything about

1326
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:44,511
Alex Jones or the Sandy Hook

1327
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,839
Not a jury of your peers

1328
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:51,423
Like the only peers metallic

1329
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,703
Have our people who

1330
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:54,239
Understand why Alex

1331
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:56,031
Is never telling the truth

1332
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:57,311
Or Never Lie

1333
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,103
He just doesn't care

1334
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:01,663
Whenever you get them

1335
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,455
Caught out in a lie you know

1336
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,991
Getting caught out in a perjury

1337
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:05,759
Situation

1338
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,551
He doesn't even know

1339
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,343
Yeah you know

1340
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,159
I think it was really exhausting

1341
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,951
Think about the trial to was the

1342
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,231
Constant

1343
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,023
Pretend games

1344
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,095
Defense was playing where they pretend to understand it was a damaged

1345
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:21,887
Just hearing

1346
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:24,447
Jimmy was

1347
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,215
Exhausting

1348
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:33,151
Yeah I just don't like a lot of emotional whiplash

1349
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:33,919
Because

1350
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:35,711
Constant

1351
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,991
Thing between like

1352
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,527
The clownish nusenda

1353
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:41,087
Constant chaos of Alex

1354
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:43,903
Don't world

1355
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,975
Sense of tragedy that was there

1356
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:50,047
And forth between those

1357
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,583
Two incredibly

1358
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,887
Emotional states

1359
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,959
Chewy solid yes

1360
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:03,103
The Tuesday where it was Neil and Scarlett in the morning and then Alec

1361
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,639
Likes testifying after was

1362
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:08,223
Just like

1363
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,367
We both went home and we're just

1364
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,135
Done

1365
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:17,951
You know yeah absolutely

1366
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:19,487
It's like

1367
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,255
It's like

1368
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:22,815
No you all have been saying it's just

1369
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,799
And then I find my phone

1370
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:37,663
Charlotte

1371
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,783
I feel I feel like that's

1372
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,063
Such a great point

1373
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,599
Something that I

1374
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:46,623
I feel privileged

1375
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:47,391
I've been able to

1376
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,159
To like

1377
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:49,439
I did a few interviews

1378
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:51,743
The things and being able to like

1379
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:53,023
Stressthem

1380
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,559
Yeah

1381
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:55,839
I've been really

1382
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:56,863
I think Airport

1383
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,655
Might be able to have that voice

1384
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:01,983
Out is when I have

1385
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:04,031
The reporters have seems to

1386
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:04,799
Fry's

1387
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:09,663
Only talk about Alex Jones

1388
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:12,223
Kind of makes me a little bit

1389
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:16,063
Forest for trees is going on

1390
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:20,415
But we got an email

1391
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,439
From

1392
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,463
The

1393
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,231
From a t-shirt

1394
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:29,375
I can see you're getting a lot of heat for this trial thing do you want to do a special on your shirt

1395
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:31,935
I just

1396
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:32,703
Replied back

1397
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:34,495
Hey listen

1398
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:36,031
Are you saying that we should

1399
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:36,799
Profit off of

1400
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:39,359
The families of Sandy Hook is that what you're really trying

1401
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,383
Can you tell me right now

1402
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:42,175
Cuz that's what you are telling me

1403
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:45,247
I want to light you on fire

1404
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:47,807
Yeah yeah yeah totally

1405
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:50,623
Like

1406
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,695
Absol

1407
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:03,423
Appreciated

1408
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:08,799
But also it's like it's not it's not about me

1409
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,895
Surrounding this it's about

1410
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:18,527
Yeah it is

1411
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:19,295
I think

1412
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:23,391
Is great about our listeners

1413
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:27,487
I do think that they are appreciating you because of it

1414
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:29,791
Hundred percent it is on

1415
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,583
Madea family

1416
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,375
Because it's

1417
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,655
It's

1418
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:37,471
You know you're a presence that is there helping

1419
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,263
Highlight this

1420
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:44,895
This thing

1421
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:59,487
So what about you like

1422
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:01,023
Experience of being there

1423
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,887
Get a chance to meet in person

1424
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:08,191
Future schedules

1425
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:14,079
What specifically trying to lay low before I went on the

1426
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:15,871
Yeah

1427
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:21,503
It was very funny you didn't know this but actually at one point maybe you didn't know this but actually one point I was sitting

1428
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:25,087
Directly behind you while you were having a conversation with

1429
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,879
Mister zip about your upcoming

1430
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:27,647
Testimony

1431
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:30,719
I don't think he had any idea who

1432
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:44,543
You also sitting behind her

1433
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:45,823
I thought you guys were

1434
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:48,383
A couple of times in the courtroom

1435
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:51,455
Are you there in person

1436
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:57,343
What is hell what is hell

1437
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:02,207
That really does make me good

1438
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:07,839
In person but I saw them beans about the thought

1439
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:09,887
Yes way better

1440
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:11,167
We better do

1441
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:13,215
Through the news

1442
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,287
Kind of felt like

1443
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,311
Like maybe you would be in a

1444
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,079
Appropriate

1445
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:18,847
TED Talk

1446
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,127
Elsa

1447
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:20,895
So because of like

1448
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:25,247
Your status as a witness

1449
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:27,295
And speak to anybody I tried to stay smiling

1450
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,063
It's possible

1451
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:31,903
Technically as an expert witness I think it would have been fine but that was my

1452
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:36,511
I'm not going to go up and introduce myself to them until after I

1453
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:38,559
Testify but then we didn't

1454
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:41,119
We didn't get a chance to you

1455
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:45,727
So that's funny that we all knew who

1456
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:50,335
It's like

1457
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:54,175
It's really similar like I found it to be

1458
01:13:56,735 --> 01:14:00,063
Shrilling at times because if it really does feel like this

1459
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,855
This is the start of

1460
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:06,975
Snowball of accountability hopefully

1461
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:14,399
At other times I found myself feeling like it doesn't matter how much money

1462
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,167
Ends up

1463
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:16,447
Coming back

1464
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:19,775
So much damage has already been done that can't be undone

1465
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:25,663
I don't know I just I find myself

1466
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:30,783
I did find like you

1467
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:33,343
Commentator

1468
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,903
The Dynamics of the

1469
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:39,999
The trial and the media around it and everything are fast

1470
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:42,559
There was like my directions

1471
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:45,375
Oh she responds to it and then there was also the like

1472
01:14:59,199 --> 01:14:59,967
Celebrate life

1473
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:02,015
The way that I was

1474
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:04,319
Are trying to

1475
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:07,903
Abused the justice system in the same way that they were

1476
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:08,927
Abused the media so

1477
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:13,279
And succeed

1478
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:18,399
I don't know if you had the same response that I kind of did but as I know come home

1479
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:19,935
And I have a little bit more

1480
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:23,007
Distance from that I realized I felt a little bit of a dissonance

1481
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,311
And maybe even a little bit of a shame

1482
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:26,591
About the

1483
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:29,151
I tried to as

1484
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:30,431
Much as possible

1485
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,455
Despite my

1486
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:32,735
Empath

1487
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:35,039
Speech at the beginning of the Greenwald episode

1488
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:36,319
I tried to keep

1489
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,343
Sort of

1490
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:38,367
Distance

1491
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,647
From the tropics

1492
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,415
Should we cover

1493
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:42,719
Do not

1494
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:43,743
Just be you

1495
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:47,327
I don't mean that

1496
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:51,167
It's it was really difficult

1497
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,727
That I have a

1498
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,007
Huge interest

1499
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:57,055
And

1500
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:57,823
Attached

1501
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:59,359
Approach

1502
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,895
But we have this

1503
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:02,431
The person that I've been studying

1504
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,455
And this is

1505
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:04,223
This is

1506
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:04,991
Ridiculous

1507
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,295
At the same time

1508
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:08,575
Possible

1509
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:10,111
To not have an emotional

1510
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:10,879
Connection

1511
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:12,671
Experience of seeing

1512
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:13,695
Me and Scarlett

1513
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:14,463
In the

1514
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,743
In the courtroom and test

1515
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:16,511
Aspiring

1516
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:17,791
And their therapist

1517
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:19,839
Get that back

1518
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:20,607
Conflict

1519
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:21,887
Was

1520
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:22,911
Was really difficult

1521
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:26,495
Olivia really a fan of weeping in public but

1522
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:27,519
I mean

1523
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:28,543
There's no other way

1524
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:30,847
In-N-Out

1525
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:33,407
Completely agree and I struggle with adjustments

1526
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:35,455
Adult thing

1527
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:38,271
Sometimes I think that the dissonance

1528
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:42,111
Take me to sings against each other

1529
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:44,927
They don't need to be pitted against each other but

1530
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:46,719
Yukon Yukon

1531
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:49,023
And this is maybe a little bit

1532
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:52,095
Trying to get across when I talked about confirmation bias that like

1533
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:53,887
2 beer

1534
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:55,423
Starting with the data

1535
01:16:56,703 --> 01:17:01,311
Having confirmation bias doesn't mean you can't have opinions or emotions about the things that you're

1536
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,079
You're studying

1537
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,639
Start with the data

1538
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:07,199
And you let that inform your your thoughts

1539
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,479
Opinions

1540
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:12,575
You still have those thoughts and opinions are just informed by the data

1541
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:14,367
I also

1542
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:17,951
She was in any kind of ethical way

1543
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:20,767
You need to approach it with Humanity

1544
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:22,815
Otherwise you're just going to get

1545
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:25,375
Swept up in their propaganda

1546
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,935
First and foremost and think about the

1547
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:29,983
People that are being harmed by this rhetoric

1548
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:37,407
I'm so just write a lot about how the families want money and Alex Jones is

1549
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:38,687
Very sorry

1550
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:39,455
For what he did

1551
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:41,247
Admitted that he was wrong

1552
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:45,343
I think that's a good way to do it someone who like

1553
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:51,743
In 2016 there was this wave of scholarship that started to come out about the alt right that just came from these people that

1554
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:55,583
Fascinating

1555
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,935
Coming from it from a place

1556
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:01,471
Thinking about

1557
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:03,263
Why does this matter

1558
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:08,127
And the minute that you start thinking about why does this matter there's going to be a motion

1559
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:10,175
It's actually

1560
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:12,223
Important to hold space for those

1561
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:13,759
And I don't have to

1562
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:18,367
Contradiction to approach anything from

1563
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:23,487
Appreciate that point I think that's I think that's it

1564
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:24,255
Definitely right

1565
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:25,535
It's still

1566
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:26,559
It still can be

1567
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:30,143
Difficult but I think you're totally right

1568
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:32,703
But I think

1569
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:35,775
I think most people especially in America

1570
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:36,799
Believe it

1571
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:38,079
Expertise leads

1572
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:38,847
Tobias

1573
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,127
You know like

1574
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:42,431
Because you understand all this stuff

1575
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,967
Can't think about it objectively

1576
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:45,503
AAA

1577
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:48,063
Because I

1578
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:49,087
Think that most people

1579
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:51,135
Refuse leads you to be

1580
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:52,159
Like sort of a cold

1581
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:56,511
Passionate

1582
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:59,071
Professor is in like classics

1583
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:00,863
Philosophy

1584
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:02,399
But the lot of them are pretty

1585
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:04,959
I mean

1586
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:09,311
The reaction to experts in well I mean like a reaction to dr. fauci

1587
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:11,615
To these people

1588
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:14,943
Give me doctor Faust

1589
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:21,087
There is a bias

1590
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:22,879
Against people who knows

1591
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:24,671
Yeah

1592
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:39,519
How could I not

1593
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:43,871
You had a

1594
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:45,663
Position and then they hired you is

1595
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:49,247
Tired

1596
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:53,855
Off the Dome I'm going to go and say Alex might be good

1597
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:59,487
Let's look at another unfortunate reality and that is that anybody who is

1598
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:00,255
Is probably

1599
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:01,535
Assertive

1600
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:03,583
Credentialed to be in the position you were in

1601
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:10,239
Has a negative

1602
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:13,055
Text with a different opinion there were none

1603
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:14,848
Nobody was like Ali

1604
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:17,408
Jones is really bringing the world to a better place except

1605
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:19,456
Maybe Steve

1606
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:21,504
Selective insurance

1607
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:28,160
In social science to write you have people that try to

1608
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:31,232
Say that you need to take this completely alike

1609
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,144
View from nowhere

1610
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,680
And then you have

1611
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:40,960
People that are more like

1612
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:45,312
Sonographer

1613
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:47,872
Escape around 4

1614
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:49,408
Perspective it's about

1615
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:52,480
Understand

1616
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,784
I'm so it's like yes

1617
01:20:55,040 --> 01:21:00,416
As a woman

1618
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:03,232
All of the things I'm very conscious of how that effects

1619
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,256
The way that I read

1620
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,400
Let's Go Crazy

1621
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:21,664
You say conscious of that when I'm reading anti block races

1622
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:27,296
I'm not going to fully understand the pain that that bring

1623
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:34,464
Of course they're ways to understand like where we all are

1624
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,744
Situated in the world

1625
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:38,816
It's not about confirmation bias it's about

1626
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:41,120
2

1627
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:42,656
The

1628
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:45,472
The very academic you word about it

1629
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:50,336
Positionality

1630
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:53,920
You see things and

1631
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:54,688
Yellow

1632
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:05,184
It is it is a little bit like the idea I saw University of Chicago economics

1633
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:05,952
Study

1634
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:06,720
About

1635
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:07,744
Slavery

1636
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,024
That treated slavery is like

1637
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,328
Purely an economic system and like

1638
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:13,376
Was this a libertarian

1639
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:15,424
University of Chicago economics

1640
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:17,216
To do stuff

1641
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:23,360
You can't say I feel like ethically that is just a wrong

1642
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,384
Nothing to do

1643
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:26,432
The libertarian study on

1644
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,968
The economic impacts of

1645
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:30,528
Feeding your child

1646
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:31,296
What are we

1647
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:37,184
Beneficial for economics

1648
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,208
Problem is

1649
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:44,608
You care about your child that's where this whole system is gone because it's negative you have no positive obligation

1650
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,520
With the wrong

1651
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:54,080
Inside of it

1652
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,664
We should probably wrap

1653
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,944
This up before too long

1654
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:02,272
First this has been a delight and I hope we can talk

1655
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:03,040
Again soon

1656
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,064
But second

1657
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:07,648
I have the livestream up up the courtroom

1658
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:12,768
There's movement in the courtroom

1659
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:18,656
Possible cab price

1660
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:20,960
I feel like we all have an interest

1661
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:28,640
He's probably a heads-up absolutely thank you so much for having me

1662
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:30,432
How much of your podcast

1663
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:32,224
Listen to when I was prepping

1664
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:41,696
Thrilled to hear and and right back at you or your work

1665
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:43,232
Published pieces

1666
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:44,768
Have been really important

1667
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:46,560
In terms of giving

1668
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:47,584
Stand

1669
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,120
Insights into a lot of it

1670
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:51,424
This world so we will take

1671
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,192
You

1672
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:55,776
Listen to our show to apply Dan's life's work

1673
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:56,544
Good

1674
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:59,616
I'm glad that

1675
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:00,384
I could look at

1676
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,432
US Weekly

1677
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:04,224
A

1678
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:05,248
Exactly

1679
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:07,040
Is there any clown college

1680
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:11,904
I wish I had a hawk

1681
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:17,280
Is there is there anything you'd want to direct our listeners to the place we can find you

1682
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:23,936

And I like I said I hope we can speak again soon thank you for being a voice that centers the Families 2

1688
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:49,280
@stephanie

1689
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:54,400
Another episode but until then

1690
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:06,688
Okay

1691
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:14,368
A wonderful dreamy creamy summer

1692
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:19,744
Alex

1693
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,512
In color

1694
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:21,792
I love your work
