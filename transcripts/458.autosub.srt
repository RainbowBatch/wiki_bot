Is the only drink

30
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,344
That's all you need to know

31
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:37,440

Dear Dan and Jordan

42
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,560
!

43
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:53,984
All right I just wanted to make sure you get plenty of mail

44
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,848
A wall

45
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
That's great

46
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:12,672
Gmail it shows up like a physical thing

47
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,423
How to make sure you got stuff is about

48
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:35,199
But my entire life of all happened on the same day

49
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,247
They released the book

50
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,551
And people have responded very well

51
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,111
So many people to the point where

52
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
Like

53
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,927
If downloads were Book Sales

54
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,791
I would have an outside on a on a slow week to be on the New York Times best

55
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,607
Amazing that's amazing

56
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,935
Sure that's really cool

57
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,519
A few hours after I released it

58
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:03,359
I got the news that might be around

59
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
For much longer

60
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,687
Tune of

61
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:07,967
Just a few days

62
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,903
The proudest day of your life suddenly becomes the saddest day

63
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,743
I just I just thought about

64
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,023
She was fine

65
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,303
3 weeks ago

66
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,679
It's going to be you no less than a few days and

67
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,959
This is

68
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,751
All-too-common a situation now

69
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,287
You know it's not covid

70
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,823
She has

71
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,103
Stage 4

72
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,895
Which is

73
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,199
Something that happens

74
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:40,991
Is j.j.

75
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,575
It doesn't happen because a lunatic stolen

76
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,927
Like all of these family 130,000 family

77
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,999
Are going through what my family is going through right now

78
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,279
End

79
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,559
Unnecessary

80
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,631
I do too just

81
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,911
Just cruel

82
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:03,519
Just monstrous Mothman real existence

83
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
Ain't that the truth

84
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:10,687
Joker

85
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,783
Jordans

86
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,063
It doesn't get much worse

87
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,975
So I was just

88
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,743
You know

89
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,559
Like I don't know how to be sufficiently

90
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,863
Grieving

91
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,679
This is terrible and and I

92
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,727
I'm a comic so

93
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,007
This is how we deal with it

94
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,311
And enjoy

95
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,103
Do

96
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,199
That's how I cling to it and how I grieve so

97
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:49,087
Process

98
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,511
But

99
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
It is

100
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,655
Lifehack

101
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:07,775
So sorry it's depressing note the same time

102
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,847
Like I've always dreamed

103
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,383
Possibility

104
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,223
People responding to

105
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
So

106
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:23,391
And it's much as you're connected

107
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,951
And even even though you're

108
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,487
His passing was a tragic

109
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,511
Most likely

110
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,607
There's still a lot of experience

111
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,143
Between

112
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,679
You can hold on to that then

113
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,471
Have celebrate that the part of

114
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,007
What you been up to you and

115
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,919
Hopefully not everything even though it's hard and painful about everything

116
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,855
Time is an illusion

117
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
For helping me out

118
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:05,375
Sure,

119
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:11,775
Something something

120
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,383
To visit today

121
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:21,759
Depressing

122
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,807
Live our lives

123
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,831
You know

124
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,623
Be people

125
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,719
Let's do it I'm in I'm in

126
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
Alright

127
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:46,079
Talking about just one day

128
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,503
Rodger Stone

129
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,903
Now it has to happen

130
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,231
I'm sorry to ruin this

131
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,279
Brutal

132
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,351
I mean

133
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:14,751
It's obviously he signed an exclusive priority

134
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,847
Show where you can convince

135
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:26,015
Listen to you and zero

136
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
First

137
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,087
And get our kind of attention

138
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,135
Or I could go on a show with

139
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,439
Most 100,000 listeners

140
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:40,863
Not be invited onto any show

141
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,679
My partnership

142
00:09:54,431 --> 00:10:00,575
Was represented by personal lawyer

143
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:04,671
Exclusive interviews withdraw important

144
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:10,303
Campaign managers

145
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,351
Comparatively

146
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,543
And the other keeps talking about

147
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:26,175
Truly connected to it

148
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:32,575
Person who I would prioritize

149
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,879
But you have to show up

150
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:39,999
Actually because he can't go on Hannity every week

151
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:46,143
Harrison Christ during that and I was going to pretend like

152
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,703
It's totally fine yeah but it's not

153
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:55,871
I feel like this is her to the payoff of our weak narrative

154
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,407
Last week which is

155
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:03,039
You know it started with Rogers. Right

156
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,831
Alex getting into Wayfair

157
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,135
Conspiracies

158
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,767
Self to be involved in Wayfair conspiracy

159
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,943
Because you know so that I must say

160
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,503
I'm down the street

161
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
Alright

162
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,903
That doesn't trust

163
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,127
Sunset

164
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:10,111
Next

165
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:17,023
I was assured that was nothing untoward.

166
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,071
Alternative

167
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:24,447
EXO

168
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,215
So we're all right

169
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:31,871
Next

170
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,919
Ewok

171
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,303
This is not a title

172
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
In the past

173
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:52,863
This person

174
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,911
Required are not required

175
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,239
I said that I call someone

176
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,543
Alright

177
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,847
I've got a call Nick l

178
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,407
It's a nikhil

179
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,175
Mitchell

180
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,223
Whatever Ellery pronounce

181
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,815
Generosity

182
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,167
In your area that is helping people in need in these trying times

183
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,447
Appreciate

184
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215
Indeed

185
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,007
So we start off on the 14th

186
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,799
And

187
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
Rogers AR

188
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,407
Rogers on

189
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
But

190
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,927
Pakistan would have given us exclusive

191
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,207
Yesterday

192
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,255
As you promise me to do

193
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
He had

194
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,095
Clarence and

195
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
Clemency letter

196
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,143
First

197
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
Bad to check

198

Absolutely

206
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
Ridiculous

207
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,799
Does have Rodger on them just playing games you will show up

208
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,455
Bigger heavy-hitter on this episode

209

We have gym

210
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135
He's going to be

211
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
Not joining us

212
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,999
Jim hoft

213
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:00,095
Brother Jimmy Hoffa's brother

214
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,495
Jim hoft is the guy who runs Gateway pundit

215
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,775
His brother

216
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:14,175
Look dude if you are somebody who has like their own reality and their own expertise and reason

217
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,967
Credit

218
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,015
Brother

219
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,807
Is a bad sign

220
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:26,207
This guy I guess his name I don't even remember where it is used

221
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,279
Somebody was like oh s*** let's listen to this guy

222
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,863
Mean something

223
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,399
Like my brother

224
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:40,287
Would be not somebody you'd want to talk to you about Alex Jones related issues interesting guy

225
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,871
And he has his own world where he is relevant and you know what

226
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,151
The stuff that he does

227
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,223
I couldn't comment.

228
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,271
Others are you

229
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:55,391
William size does not imply expertise my brother on

230
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:00,255
Talking about

231
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:04,351
Be silly.

232
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:10,751
Brought up this is Aaron's brother

233
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,799
I don't think that would work well for me

234
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:19,199
You get justforlaughs you're coming out of Montreal and brother

235
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:23,039
Aaron Brothers

236
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,319
What have you done

237
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
Adorable

238
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:30,975
Call Sylvia

239
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:37,375
Further questions about your your Bona fides as whether or not you're worth listening to

240
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,703
The concept of nepotism right over here

241
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:47,103
This is this is where we're at

242
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:47,871
Brother

243
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:55,039
Is that

244
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:59,135
He kind of made it sound like him and Paul Joseph Watson we're going to do it together so it's like

245
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,671
Uno Taxi

246
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,695
Jump-scare

247
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:07,071
Nope headspace early on

248
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,119
Any situation where he's born

249
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
When is audience

250
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,679
The time will be fast approaching

251
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
You'll need to fight

252
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:13,983
Real-life sure

253
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:14,751
You need

254
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,799
Engage in Mortal Combat

255
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,591
You will be forced

256
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,615
Take action

257
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
Will be poor

258
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,431
To fight for your very life

259
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,247
Because when it was easy to win

260
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,367
What was easy to win

261
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,439
Don't write your own territory your own freedoms

262
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
A blood type

263
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,959
You been living off of

264
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,775
All of this largesse

265
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,055
Was money in the bank

266
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,335
It was blood in the bank

267
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,359
Whose Blood Sweat

268
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
Pierce

269
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:03,903
Alex might not realize it but he's using two different words there that just sound the same

270
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,047
He describes

271
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:16,191
Things

272
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:20,543
Another word rate is a word that means ceremony or custom

273
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:25,151
These words are different routes and completely different meetings but they're pronounce the same in English

274
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,687
Treat them as the same

275
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
Raichu

276
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:36,159
That would make more sense

277
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,463
Eght

278
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,047
Also it's weird that he's claiming these rights are fun

279
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,447
Because that's completely out of step with the underpinnings of his Patriot right-wing ideology

280
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:53,823
Being given by God

281
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:59,199
The fights that happened in history happened against

282
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,527
Actually take those rights away from you

283
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,855
You in a tyranny or a dictatorship you still have rice

284
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:09,951
What makes authoritarianism so evil

285
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,231
Is that these people are work

286
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:14,815
Temporarily deprived

287
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,143
Alex

288
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,935
The blood bank is running dry

289
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,263
That's completely foreign to the angle he's supposed to have

290
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:27,615
Sounds like he believes that only exist because

291
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:31,199
Some kind of human sacrifice in the name of Rights

292
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:37,599
Which is pretty close to what he believes the club

293
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,367
Given their right

294
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:45,535
To take them away from people of color very out of

295
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
Step

296
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:52,703
The other the larger understanding of these things that are in the right-wing world like

297
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,239
Communities

298
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:59,871
They believe that these attacks on the ideas of religiosity into separation

299
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:08,063
God and to get rid of God in society because all right flow from God

300
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,879
Get rid of get rid of beets

301
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:14,207
Why anyone has right

302
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,999
This entire segment

303
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,535
Is going to be about

304
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,583
How he supports the protesters in Port

305
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:23,423
As they fight against the federal government sending in agents

306
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,215
Kill them

307
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,495
Right-wing death

308
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:32,895
Coming into

309
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:39,295
I don't know

310
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,367
Comes up in any dimension

311
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,671
Portland's adjective word

312
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:51,071
You talking about white people getting beat up like a BLM

313
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:56,703
You know like he hasn't covered any of that situation in any meaningful way to the point where I've had

314
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:11,807
I don't have a good grasp on that situation correct

315
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,888
He's working through here

316
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,704
Different

317
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
A new product

318
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,824
Totally not a replacement for a product to use the tool to cancel and I'm bored

319
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,688
Hold the answers more Socialism or communism

320
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,992
More New World Order

321
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,784
Doterra

322
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,624
Enforcers and the jail guards

323
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,672
The New World Order will start

324
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,696
Then the globalist

325
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
Because

326
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,584
Humans finally wake up

327
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,608
That's why

328
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
The robots

329
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,680
Is that one

330
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,216
The controls

331
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,080
Goose Shack

332
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,104
There

333
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,944
Thirsty

334
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
Wait

335
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,272
Dining chairs

336
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,320
So we've moved.

337
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,600
We become independent

338
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:19,904
Weed

339
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,440
Comply

340
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:26,560
And we boycott them before we boycott their big company

341
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,632
They are the enemy

342
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:37,056
Here we go

343
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
Smooth

344
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,432
Well it was a whole new product line

345
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,552
Shepherd

346
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,856
Product

347
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,416
Moderate

348
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,208
I wonder

349
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,768
If you're sure is a lot of

350
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,560
Charcoal

351
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,400
And super high-quality Act

352
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,472
Bestop schism

353
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,592
You saw the

354
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,384
Finance

355
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,344
Criminal

356
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,416
Can we just stop selling it so she

357
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,440
Stop saying that

358
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,976
We are planning litigation

359
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,096
Dish

360
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,632
Covid-19

361
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,936
Is activated charcoal a bunch of essential oils

362
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,312
A couple weeks there's one other test

363
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,528
It's a great app.

364
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,112
Until next week

365
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,672
I told you we had

366
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
He's not here

367
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,488
What the hell is happening

368
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,520
Super Bowl at maybe illegal

369
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:16,384
Activated charcoal toothpaste

370
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,784
And we don't

371
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,584
Buzz marketing strategy voice

372
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:46,848
Testing

373
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,896
But good luck with

374
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:53,504
We know this from a ways back

375
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,528
He's been getting into

376
00:24:54,784 --> 00:25:00,928
Props lately

377
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,536
I called out for it being extra

378
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:09,888
But as we know he was on the fence about Satanism maybe Steel

379
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,544
He's got a new prop ignoring it

380
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:17,824
Alright fine

381
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,848
I'll take the bait

382
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,736
Wings Roman

383
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,880
Standard symbol

384
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,464

You will not Escape

390
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,456
God is above

391
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,992
Goddess mother

392
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,016
Humans

393
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,296
Life itself

394
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,928
This is a political show

395
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:18,240
To remind you that None Shall Escape.

396
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,848
Woody's

397
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:27,712
He's just steal it

398
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,504
He's like that's called feel good

399
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,040
Get rid of the chessboard

400
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,856
Any local theater company will tell you

401
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,184
Weather f****** dick

402
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,976
Anyway Alex

403
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,280
Talking about

404
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,072
Tyrell

405
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,352
China whatever

406
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,656
Rockefellers they're evil

407
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,704
Get to this first

408
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,800
1376

409
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:53,824
Weather

410
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,688
New York Times article

411
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,248
Zero two of them

412
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784
You do father

413
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,064
Message

414
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,112
World Travel

415
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,696
I helped put now in on

416
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,488
The answer

417
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:20,704
So we talked about GameStop but it's been awhile so first of all

418
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,592
B6 David Rockefellers iPad was published on August 10th 1973

419
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,896
Nissan connect

420
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:36,064
Specifically

421
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:43,232
He says the Rockefeller says he helped put now into power that he loves now

422
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:44,768
Communism is what we need

423
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:53,984
About that

424
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:00,384
The closest at Rockefeller under Chairman Mao's leadership

425
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,688
Most important and successful in human history

426
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,224
Which is something that was

427
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,576
Short visit

428
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,344
Vagina

429
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,904
If you read the complete article however you get this

430
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,208
Misgivings

431
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,744
About working Celtics.

432
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,328
And multiple Point Rockefeller qualifies his own impression

433
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,864
He says quote

434
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,216
In terms of simple Geographic expanse a week-and-a-half visit to China is something equivalent

435
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,288
New York City in less than one and a half minute

436
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:34,688
A clear understanding

437
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,320
So as someone who has been in New York for one and a half minutes both New York

438
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,416
Title says hi

439
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,184
Traveler

440
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:50,048
Later in the article Rockefeller even acknowledges that this view of the country he was getting was a

441
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,072
Curated one

442
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,632
Each step of the trip was choreographed

443
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,912
Precisely by our house

444
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,984
Virtually all our requests were granted

445
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,288
We clearly saw what they wanted us to

446
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:04,384
He's qualified impression of the country was the progress was being made

447
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:09,248
Poverty starvation in crime we're at much lower levels than they were 20 years prior

448
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:15,136
At the same time. The number of children receiving an education have jumped from 20% to eighty percent

449
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,256
At the same time Rockefeller absolutely does not sugarcoat things

450
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,792
As he puts it quotes

451
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:27,680
Despite constant impressions of progress however some gray areas in basic contradiction

452
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:30,496
Three major questions remain in my own mind

453
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,848
The first question was about individuality and creativity being contained

454
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
The country

455
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:38,176
There are only eight different theatrical

456
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,456
The entire country

457
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:44,832
Universities are rigorously politicized with little room for inquiry unrelated to Chairman Mao's thought

458
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,624
Rockefeller view that is a

459
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,648
Problem

460
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:53,024
The second question is how well the Chinese economy would be able to adapt to technological advancement

461
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,048
Foreign trade

462
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,608
This is largely a strategic and logistical Quest

463
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,376
Question

464
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,424
The third question is

465
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,520
Are we prepared to accept our differences

466
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:07,616
And still proceed toward be closer Mutual understanding that must be the basis

467
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,152
For substitute future Conte

468
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,944
And the inserts

469
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,712
That was m

470
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,480
Emphatically

471
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,552
Outside

472
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:21,952
Both America and China would likely need to make a

473
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,720
Candid world

474
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,048
None of the stuff Alex is saying about these operators real

475
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:31,168
Alex knows what this article is what he's heard about it from paranoid jumper Society pamphlet switch

476
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,216
You're basically no connection to reality

477
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:33,984
And you can

478
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,008
You can take

479
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,544
You know a perspective of

480
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:43,200
You know Rockefeller had all the information that could possibly ever

481
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,576
To someone

482
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:54,976
In 1973 at a time when Chinese us relations were

483
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,328
Information was not what it is

484
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:06,496
You hate Turf now go back to 1973

485
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,896
Awareness

486
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,760
What could have been

487
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:24,160
Everybody every point

488
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:33,888
It's kind of frustrating I mean I don't care about David Rockefeller I think it probably was

489
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,448
Nautica

490
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:38,752
Aspect of having that much money

491
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,824
Probably

492
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,384
Almost certainly

493
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,200
Springs up

494
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,736
Of course so

495
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,112
Cherishable position

496
00:31:55,136 --> 00:32:01,280
You're lying about the Rockefeller or whatever

497
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:04,864
Rockefeller

498
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,472
Episode

499
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,944
Defensive

500
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,736
Let's get to this first

501
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,512
Column just like they done

502
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:35,840
Country months before they're just still

503
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,448
Alex is a goddamn liar

504
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,984
No one is moving slow.

505
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,800
Covid-19

506
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,824
Going way down

507
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,360
Go to July

508
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:50,176
Flu season is pretty much over by May

509
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:55,296
Will see an uptick in flu cases in the United States another few months

510
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,576
Alex knows that

511
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,136
And he's lying about it or he doesn't know that

512
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,256
If you don't understand when

513
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,536
Flu season is

514
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:09,120
You're trying to say flute down and it somehow suspicious

515
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,936
You are unqualified or alive

516
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,960
One of the two

517
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,496
It's

518
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,520
No third option

519
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,824
Intuit

520
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,592
Increasingly on

521
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,640
Like any kind of

522
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,432
Conspiracy of that sort that

523
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,712
Pull-off

524
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,760
We're a long ways

525
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:29,088
You're not going to get me on pneumonia

526
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:33,184
You didn't get me before y'all definitely are going to get me after flu

527
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,024
So Alex

528
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,584
Hysteria going on in the world is a lot of

529
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,608
A lot of Hysteria

530
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,376
Any place

531
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,424
Play some clips

532
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,192
Demonstrated

533
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,984
I'm I'm done playing this

534
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,776
Cuz I I largely

535
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,544
Wanted

536
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,128
First thing I want

537
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:52,896
Want to go ahead

538
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,688
For you

539
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,968
Is the Hysteria

540
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,528

Kill

Everybody on this plane

547
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,024
Unless you accept

548
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,560
Jesus was black

549
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,584
Then we'll play

550
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,120
The clip

551
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,144

What is flips

556
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,688
Like what to make other than race-baiting

557
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:29,760
Like what

558
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:30,528

What what can be the editorial through-line of a lot of this stuff other than

564
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,816
Be scared of black

565
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,656

And that is who they are and that's how we do it by drive to do

Got stuff

570
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,456
Jumped off

571
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,480
Right left

572
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,808

Right

575
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,160
Find

576
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,464
Some of this to be

577
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,024
Trivial

578
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:19,680
You know okay that's an interesting story I guess I didn't even look into this person on the plane I don't I don't know what the story is

579
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,216
Is there

580
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,008
Case scenario of that is

581
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:29,664
Kill people on a plane

582
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:38,112
Matter person saying that there should be black malicious favor of that

583
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:42,208
Synchronize

584
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,744
Federal government

585
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,024
Right

586
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,816
Whatever

587
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:50,656
So some of this stuff would be a little bit more

588
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:55,776
Like

589
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,128
This is really difficult to put in

590
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,736
Like there's moments in Alex's show where

591
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,784
His lack of doing any work

592
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,064
Separation

593
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:14,208
Accidentally reveals how little he knows about the world and this next clip is one of those that I think it's just like

594
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,024
You shouldn't do it you shouldn't allow yourself to be put into

595
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,048
Situations where you look

596
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,632
Ignoramuses

597
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,936
Black Riders

598
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,496
Nikon

599
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:27,776
Haley

600
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:28,544
Sally

601
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,336
It goes on

602
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,104
From there

603
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,664
A couple of interesting things

604
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:40,576
The first is that Alex has no idea Holly Selassie

605
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:52,864
Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930 to 1974

606
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,912
I need the central figure in the roster

607
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,192
Geology

608
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:02,848
You can't possibly listen to any decent

609
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,456
We're going to be okay

610
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:16,928
Is inconceivable to me that Alex would have no idea what

611
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:23,584
Unreal knocked over and assumes that it must be connected to

612
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,608
Statue is right about

613
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,888
Brookside thinking

614
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:29,984
Because there's no reason to assume that just because one group wants to take down certain statues

615
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,568
All statue related stories must be involved with that group

616
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:40,480
Reporting I can find about the Statue it appears that this one was destroyed in an event it's most likely related to honor

617
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,760
Unrest in Ethiopia

618
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,856
According to the BBC this has to do with the killing of a popular musician

619
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,648
Condesa

620
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,488
Odessa was a big proponent of the Oromo rights which is an ethnic

621
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:54,048
The group that were oppressed by philosophies regime

622
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,656
A witness saw men gathering in the park in London where the Selassie statue was

623
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,960
Curing Flyers with Oromo slogan

624
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,776
Switch gives a pretty strong indication that this is what

625
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,800
His story is about in this

626
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,080
Shannon this case

627
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:12,224
Lee statue Selassie was father one of those was recently tore down in Harare dvop

628
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:16,064
And the reason there was this statue in London

629
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,160
Was because he'd lived in Wimbledon when he was in Exile in 1936

630
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,208
Statue

631
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:27,328
Unrelated to the larger phenomenon of bll related statue issues but

632
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,632
Let me room for nuance in Alex's show

633
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,168
If it's about a statue

634
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,192
The same story

635
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:35,264
And it's about a guy named Cecilia

636
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:36,800
You know I mean

637
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,360
Statues

638
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,896
Is generally speaking

639
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,272
Average

640
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,648
Precious and people who oppressed people are the ones most interested in getting statues

641
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,792
There is a desire among

642
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,560
Despot

643
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,096
And the autocrat

644
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:04,192
Effigies of themselves

645
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:06,496
So talking about

646
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,800
Rodger coming on over about 2

647
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:12,128
In order for this to really make sense

648
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,176
Still got to be important

649
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:14,944
Right I mean

650
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,712
It better

651
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,552
The juice qualify

652
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,112
Garage screen

653
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,648
Rodger

654
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,672
Herein

655
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,440
Just a moment

656
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,464
In a second

657
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:27,744
Very

658
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,304
Exclusive

659
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,424
He will have

660
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,056
The election is clemency being attached

661
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,640
This is the first exclusive

662
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:50,784
Energy

663
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:55,136
Just keep adding

664
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,184
21st

665
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,464
Exclusively

666
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,560
458 episode of our podcast

667
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:08,960
Truth

668
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,008
Coming on for the first time after

669
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,312
Nobody is done that

670
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,616
Pretty much

671
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,432
It's honestly not the best hour of Rogers

672
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,968
Life

673
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:20,992
Dammit he's

674
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:27,648
Well he doesn't waggling his dick he's supposed to be because of his becoming too

675
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,416
Do you know Alexa

676
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:33,792
Doesn't want revenge on people now because of religion

677
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:38,400
He does think it was an act of God Trump carried out

678
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,520
Received

679
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,432
Sure

680
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,712
So tonight

681
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,528
This next

682
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,808
Termite down because

683
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,600
There's a big

684
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,136
Proud

685
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,160
Now granted

686
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:07,072
Rodger the bird

687
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,608
This is a big deal

688
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,888
Right

689
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:14,240
Rodger is talking about how he's

690
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,032
These are the ones who should be on trial

691
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,312
And I

692
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,592
Response

693
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,176
First edition

694
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,832
Is going to do that

695
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,000
Everything you said is true one on record

696
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,328
Incredible

697
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:47,520
Alex's eating blood

698
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,824
Review

699
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,640
It is so fun

700
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,919
So clearly now

701
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:54,943
The subtle

702
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,991
That's the fun part

703
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,783
Now that we're this it look

704
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:05,183
We're too immersed to enjoy this small step this surface-level step perhaps

705
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:12,607
Real f*** you

706
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:16,959
I really wish the Rodger

707
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,263
Status to pull that off

708
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:28,223
Rodger Rodger claims

709
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:28,991
Fox News

710
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,551
And some censorship issues

711
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,999
Before I wake

712
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,047
The producer came

713
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:42,815
Mr. Stone

714
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,375
Under no circumstances can you mention

715
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:50,751
Related

716
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,407
This makes no sense to me

717
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,943
Explain why that would be the case

718
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,671
Oh yeah never bring up Soros

719
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,439
The

720
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:16,095
I can't think of any possible reason

721
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,631
George Soros

722
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,399
You couldn't

723
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,679
Stop yourself if you tried

724
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,055
Well let's see if I can

725
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:29,663
Can just do a little Google

726
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:39,135
Soccer claims George soros's what do we got here

727
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:45,535
George soros's quote

728
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,143
Shadow

729
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:55,775
What are you doing

730
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,543
Some deep research

731
00:43:56,799 --> 00:44:01,663
This one required to your level

732
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,943
Mention George Soros

733
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,735
So

734
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:07,039
I think you knew that he had to come with

735
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:09,599
Something to make this occasion special

736
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,623
Because

737
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,415
Obviously you don't

738
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,327
That was pretty

739
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,399
Totally not a weirdo

740
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:24,191
Nothing

741
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,799
Get on Hannity

742
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,079
You don't

743
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,919
If you're not willing to do that and he probably doesn't have time for you

744
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,735
Alex on the other hand is

745
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:43,135
You can maybe give him a world's greatest

746
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,159
Love it

747
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,183
Bianox

748
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:48,255
So here's a here's what Alex get to the consolation prize

749
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,583
Being completely kicked to the curb by Rodger

750
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:03,359
Impatient

751
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,151
It is

752
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:09,247
Historic moment

753
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,783
Saved my life

754
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,855
Signature

755
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,879
You can say

756
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,487
The act of Mercy

757
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:33,055
Who knows I was subjected to a Soviet

758
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,103
Before

759
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:38,943
Lynching

760
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,831
So I mean like

761
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,879
Electricity

762
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,927
My Moment

763
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,463
Europeanhistory

764
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:56,863
I'm really bummed

765
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,167
Got the real thing

766
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,447
I don't know

767
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,055
Until he was on Hannity

768
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,079
Time

769
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,103
Ticket

770
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:11,199
That's what is really going on here that's the biggest

771
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:17,599
Did you hear did you hear any

772
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:23,999
A brass band Studio

773
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:27,327
Awesome celebrate the historic

774
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,095
Instead we just

775
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:31,679
Pretend and Alex eats a piece of sandwich

776
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:36,287
Big time coming to God

777
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:43,967
Well when I thought I was going to go to prison my lawyer advised me that I might get a more lenient Maybe

778
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,247
If I pretended I believed

779
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:55,999
How good a demonstration it is about Alex's bad planning

780
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,143
Literally overnight

781
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,447
Opportunity

782
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:05,983
I jumped

783
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,287
He gave me the most advice you could

784
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,079
If you could get anybody said

785
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:13,407
Your rights on you're in big trouble but if you will just

786
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:16,735
Confess your sins if you will be reborn

787
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:19,039
If you will get right with Christ

788
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,599
If you will reaffirm your commitment

789
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:25,183
Do your nickel

790
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:56,415
I feel like you don't ask somebody about something really

791
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,439
Important a big

792
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:00,255
Story like how did your life changed except

793
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,535
Did Christ

794
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:07,935
Zealous religious broadcast

795
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:14,335
The break break

796
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,359
The processor

797
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:19,967
It's not just like girls

798
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:26,367
Nobody played off my testimony

799
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:38,143
Opening out of a break as opposed to when you're gonna run out of time cuz

800
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:40,959
Disrespectful to the story that Rogers telling

801
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:47,615
It implies that you don't really care that much yourself if you would put Rodger in a situation where you might have to interrupt

802
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,383
Story

803
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,175
What letter Borden

804
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,199
Is all the time

805
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:55,807
Cuz I get it there's a lot of fish now.

806
00:48:56,575 --> 00:49:02,719
So indecisive and

807
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,511
Is the answer to prayers

808
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:07,583
Jesus is here

809
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,631
Our Lord and savior

810
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,967
A day later

811
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,015
All the stories about

812
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,319
Hit the fan

813
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,135
Information

814
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,487
Journalist Asylum

815
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,071
Story and it was everywhere

816
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:52,383
Alex is going to be pissed

817
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:54,943
Pittsboro pet story

818
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,759
This is not

819
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,295
Now where you want to give credit

820
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,111
Loving that he is no longer

821
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:02,879
Kissing

822
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:03,647
Alex Azar

823
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:10,303
It's pretty subtle though

824
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:11,839
Now this next

825
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,703
But I feel like out

826
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:19,263
Cannot enjoy hearing this next clip

827
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:24,639
This discussion of what was going on on the day that Rodger got the news about the commutation

828
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:27,199
Last Friday around 5

829
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:29,503
Many media Outlets

830
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,783
ABC was a bomb

831
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,863
The same reports it popped up

832
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,143
Previous

833
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:50,495
Clear

834
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:57,919
Patriots

835
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,039
Conservative

836
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,087
Republican Party

837
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:07,903
Run info Warriors

838
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,743
Under I was under

839
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,351
We sorted people out

840
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,143
Between

841
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,423
They were allowed to come in

842
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:22,495
To where I just

843
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,799
Instigating

844
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,343
This is the White House

845
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,231
Speak to Rodger Stone

846
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:48,607
The White House is

847
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:52,447
Around the time

848
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:55,519
There was no Infowars reporter

849
00:51:55,775 --> 00:52:00,639
Somebody else

850
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:07,039
A f****** cellphone to be a reporter on the scene unit

851
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:09,087
2 days before

852
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,111
Like Stone

853
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:10,879
I told him

854
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,671
Well I mean look this is

855
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:18,559
This is Imagine

856
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:20,351
Missed out on the

857
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:23,423
Party of the century

858
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,191
Allowed in

859
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:26,239
Woodworm ask for that

860
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:33,407
Keyboard for that kind of exposure

861
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:36,735
So you brought up in our last episode

862
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,551
How conspicuous it was

863
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,575
Better

864
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:43,903
Rodger didn't think Alex

865
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,463
Infowars

866
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,767
It's quite the office

867
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:51,839
Amazing

868
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:00,031
So many people

869
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:04,895
Dead

870
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:08,991
You were there

871
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,927
Deep sense

872
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:17,951
What's this

873
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:34,079
Exactly right which is

874
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:40,479
Overplay how important Infowars is elsewhere

875
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:46,879
Infowars other places to miniature the value of whatever you're getting out of

876
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,439
At the same time

877
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:55,839
You can't afford to get too mad at you for not thinking about swear

878
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:57,375
Is it on like I imagine that when

879
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,399
When Hannity introduced him

880
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,423
Introduced to meds

881
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,191
Somebody who works

882
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,471
Infowars

883
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:07,871
Appositive

884
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:14,271
Just booked for $100

885
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:18,623
On Infowars where he worked for a long time

886
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:25,023
We have Rodger Stone Brothers brother

887
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:25,791
Better Credit

888
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:35,519
Speaking 24

889
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:39,103
In my corner

890
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:50,623
Franklin Graham

891
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:57,279
I just think that's pretty funny

892
00:54:57,535 --> 00:55:00,095
Rogers Hardware

893
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:04,191
He's using the first person plural

894
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,215
You stalking

895
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:10,079
Oh boy threw himself as a part of Infowars now

896
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:16,991
The truth

897
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:21,855
Infowars is really still

898
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,303
So I

899
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,119
You can bet

900
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:36,703
Because

901
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,239
To silence

902
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,479
Babel

903
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:54,879
Something that I have not done in the past actually had to admit that I had lied about a guy

904
00:55:55,391 --> 00:56:01,535
$400

905
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,327
Ideas

906
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,375
Kept within this area so that's why

907
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:12,031
When I went on Sean Hannity a show with Millions upon outside

908
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:15,615
We are Infowars

909
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:20,479
As far as I could

910
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:24,319
Probably smart

911
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:28,415
I wonder

912
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,231
I wonder

913
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,351
Virtually

914
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:38,911
I will be Avenged

915
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:41,983
I need money

916
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,823
Different fundraising website

917
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:52,223
He leaves and Alex gets back to talking about this

918
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:55,039
F****** toothpaste

919
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,855
And I can't

920
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:03,231
You really want to sell this toothpick but he can't

921
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,815
Eventually it'll be great

922
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,631
Play Stanford few weeks

923
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,239
We are

924
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,775
Supposed to do on it

925
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,055
Adorable

926
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:17,823
I thought

927
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,103
This week

928
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,383
Would be the week

929
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:22,431
To sell

930
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,199
All of this

931
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,247
Not able

932
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,551
Tell the original sale that I had running

933
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,343
It's just going to keep running

934
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,623
Until next week

935
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,159
Appreciate

936
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,279
Do all things

937
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:38,815
Launching

938
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:41,375
Christmas in July sale

939
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:43,679
Free shipping a double Patriot points

940
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,703
50

941
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:45,983
260

942
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:46,751
Percent off

943
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:53,151
I'm not sure

944
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:56,735
Christmas in July sale

945
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:00,319
Christmas isn't supposed to be commercialized

946
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,599
And it's not

947
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:05,183
Jesus

948
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:11,839
If you're only interesting Christmas is the sales aspect looking for a mattress store then it makes sense to have a Christmas in July sale beak

949
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:14,399
Importance of the holidays by cutting field

950
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,423
Alex

951
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,959
This is almost sacrilege

952
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,775
There can't be a Christmas in July because

953
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:22,847
Christmas is a holy day significant

954
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:25,407
After sales

955
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:29,503
Christmas is in the year in the same way there are two Jesus Christ

956
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:34,879
This doesn't really seem like a sale that anybody takes their face seriously

957
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:35,647
Pretend stupid

958
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:36,927
Possibly

959
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:42,047
This is using religion to drive sales not a sale that just happens to coincide with a religious

960
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,095
Just leave base but also secularly

961
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:45,375
Celebrated holiday

962
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:49,471
I assume one of those movie no skin in the game just an impartial Observer

963
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:51,007
Seems to me that this kind of thing

964
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:57,663
Having a Christmas in July sale that's more of an affront to religious observance then someone saying happy holidays in December

965
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:00,223
Which I was considered a war on Christmas

966
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:07,391
Is it not a war on Christmas to water the holiday down by creating your own second Christmas that isn't even halfway through the year

967
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:11,231
He's two weeks late for the halfway point to be

968
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,255
I don't know

969
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,303
Yeah I find that to be sacrilegious

970
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:16,863
Yeah well

971
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,679
Pretty sure at how we didn't play the whole thing off

972
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:23,519
Part the part that Rodger was cut off

973
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:27,871
What he said was the day after I

974
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:29,919
Recommitted myself to cry

975
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:33,503
Really knew that it was time to make some cow

976
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:38,111
The Lord spoke to me and he said

977
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:42,463
We've got to do Christmas in July second Christmas apps

978
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,231
Salute

979
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:45,791
So Alex has a big news

980
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,583
Do discus still not real

981
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,863
Apparently not

982
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,191
Smoking Gun

983
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:54,751
Infowars.com

984
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,591
Numerous lab 333

985
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:02,943
100% of people testing positive

986
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:06,271
Coronavirus in Florida that is impossible

987
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:09,087
He's actually true but it doesn't mean it

988
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:13,695
E470 for labs

989
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:16,511
Florida reported a hundred percent positive

990
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:19,583
Story

991
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:26,239
These lands were testing people who came up negative

992
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:33,919
This might seem like it would affect the overall positive rate in the state

993
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:36,735
71%

994
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,271
Of the state's testing numbers

995
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:42,623
Results were in line with the other 99% of

996
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:43,647
It would quote

997
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:49,023
Result in the state's 11% overall positive rate falling to 10.9%

998
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,071
An insignificant difference

999
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:55,167
That's huge the Florida Department of Health Florida

1000
01:00:55,423 --> 01:01:01,567
In recent days the Florida Department of Health noticed that some smaller private Labs weren't reporting negative test results

1001
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,847
Add data to the state

1002
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:09,503
The department immediately began working with those labs to ensure that all results were being reported in order to provide comprehensive

1003
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,271
Teradata

1004
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:13,599
Continues to receive results from various labs

1005
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:18,463
The department will continue educating these Labs on proper protocol for reporting covid-19 test results

1006
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:22,303
One of the issues here appears to be bad messaging from the

1007
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,375
The state of what is expected in pandemic

1008
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:29,727
These were smaller private Labs who might have been unaware of what they needed to do

1009
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:36,639
You see when there's no pandemic going to report positive cases for specified

1010
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:37,407
Diseases

1011
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,431
That are being tracked

1012
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:40,223
But as it turns out

1013
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:43,807
When there is a negative

1014
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:51,231
The message just wasn't being spread universally that they needed to do this

1015
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,303
Is this

1016
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:57,375
There were a number of lads who were just simply doing what the

1017
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:00,447
Defaulters would you send

1018
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,215
Negative

1019
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:04,031
Underhanded

1020
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,823
I think that's kind of what they were doing

1021
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,847
Before this started

1022
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,895
This isn't a conspiracy

1023
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:12,479
It's another symptom of widespread mismanagement of the response to an outfit

1024
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:17,599
People aren't on the same page and that leads to some folks operating out of step with how they should

1025
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,135
Awesome completely unknowingly

1026
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,695
Ultimately it's important please negative tests

1027
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:25,791
Reported as well because it's crucial that the most accurate information possible

1028
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:29,887
But people who look at the rod

1029
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:32,191
Have a significant impact on the larger

1030
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,727
Things are pretty out of control

1031
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:34,751
In Florida

1032
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:35,775
So

1033
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,055
Bad

1034
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,335
Smoking Gun

1035
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:39,359
The Great Smoke

1036
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:41,919
Great you proved

1037
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,991
Alex gets

1038
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:45,759
Rights

1039
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:46,527
I forgot about that

1040
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:52,927
I'm going to pretend it's Jimmy Hoffa's might be what kind of broke me in terms of caring about the 4th hour

1041
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:59,327
You're disappointing interview with Rodger and pretend like he would have given you the papers

1042
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:05,471
Dud of a covid-19

1043
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:07,519
Then you're going to bring in gym

1044
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,823
Brother

1045
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:10,847
I'm out

1046
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:11,615
I'm out buddy

1047
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:19,295
Really funny

1048
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:26,207
Chillhop

1049
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:34,143
I'm just shaking my head

1050
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:36,959
So sad

1051
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:41,311
What's the saddest thing you can do to a song yeah it is that is pretty sad

1052
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:44,639
Any song

1053
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:47,711
Johanna

1054
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,759
Dad suck

1055
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:53,343
I reserved

1056
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:58,463
Does not matter what the

1057
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:02,815
Joe hop Hip Hop

1058
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:06,655
Yeah he's onto largely do a lot of like covid

1059
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,423
Denialism

1060
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,959
Stop

1061
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:13,055
Centers around this story out of Florida

1062
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:16,383
Further than just Soto

1063
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:19,967
Using the story of the Prophet outright lies about

1064
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:25,343
Iraq

1065
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:28,159
And 333 labs this earlier

1066
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:29,695
Florida

1067
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,743
100%

1068
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,215
Killers

1069
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:42,751
What's really going on here

1070
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:50,431
Number of average test these labs

1071
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,479
In Florida there's no Source he could be siding

1072
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:53,247
To back that up

1073
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:56,575
Other than maybe something saw like on Twitter or something but

1074
01:04:57,087 --> 01:05:00,415
Fox 35 Orlando the actual documents of the

1075
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:02,463
Specific numbers in

1076
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:07,839
Fuel City highest number of test run at any of these Labs that are reporting 100% positive cases

1077
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:08,863
Is 400

1078
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:09,631
5

1079
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:11,423
At the Lee Memorial Hospital

1080
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:12,703
And pancare of Florida

1081
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:19,615
That's nothing compared to the 540,000 816 test that were done by Quest Diagnostics

1082
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:23,711
4450 5636 done by LabCorp

1083
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:28,575
Hundred percent positive results are under 100 test recorded

1084
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:34,719
It's all good but if they hadn't reported or if

1085
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:39,327
Actual number of tire

1086
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:43,935
Gross number is actually

1087
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:44,959
It's the only thing you could

1088
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:48,287
What's not fair is just to make up whatever number you think

1089
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:51,103
Number might be and then reported it

1090
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:51,871
Which is what our

1091
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:52,639
Foxes doing

1092
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,943
Alex numbers

1093
01:05:55,199 --> 01:06:01,343
The Creator. About this Bob story

1094
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:05,695
Means that he's a pile of s*** just like his brother and not somebody who needs

1095
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,463
Seriously like

1096
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:09,535
What

1097
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:13,631
That means that you're invested in playing along with the fake version

1098
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:16,959
Yeah you know what else the fact that you don't have a name means go suck your

1099
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:22,079
I don't I don't I don't respect him enough to even know if Joe was the right name

1100
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:26,175
Is that

1101
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:29,503
Pretty anti-vax

1102
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:33,343
Individual

1103
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:43,583
Kennedy Junior

1104
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:56,127
We covered that story a while back when it was relevant irrelevant

1105
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:59,455
He's promoting Robert Kennedy Jr

1106
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:01,247
Is about

1107
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:06,367
So what are the main things that is very difficult to get around

1108
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:08,927
If you are a covid denial list

1109
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:10,719
Is the phenomenon

1110
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,103
Covid-19

1111
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:29,919
This year compared

1112
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:34,783
This year

1113
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,319
Especially related

1114
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:44,511
Closest

1115
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,911
The graph showing

1116
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:53,727
Claim

1117
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:55,263
Butler

1118
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,287
Sears numbers

1119
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:58,847
Flatline

1120
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:06,015
We're going to be putting it up here shortly

1121
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:14,207
Information

1122
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:20,607
Little kids cheap

1123
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:23,935
Tell people what you're about to break

1124
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:25,215
We've hired a

1125
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:34,943
Actuary

1126
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,295
You're doing the same thing I guess

1127
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:42,623
PhD status

1128
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:43,391
Yep

1129
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,159
So what'd he say

1130
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:56,959
On July 1st the Journal of the American Medical Association released an investigation in there

1131
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:59,775
Their imprint called Internal Medicine

1132
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:02,591
Would you look at the excess deaths in the u.s.

1133
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,895
Between March and may 2020

1134
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:09,503
They found it all cause death Rose by approximately 120,000

1135
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,551
Did the United States over that time.

1136
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:14,111
Compared to the same period in previous years

1137
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:19,999
There were only 90 5235

1138
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:23,583
Which meant that the excess mortality in the country represented a number that

1139
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,119
Percent higher

1140
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,655
Unofficial figures that have been like

1141
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:27,679
Covid-19

1142
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:34,079
Who can be difficult for Alex and his newly hired imaginary statistician to work around

1143
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,103
And by that I mean the worst

1144
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:40,479
How you slice it the numbers of all-cause mortality in this country are

1145
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:42,783
10% higher during the. Of the pandemic

1146
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:44,063
That was study

1147
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,159
This line

1148
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:49,183
He is going to go nowhere

1149
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:51,743
It's just it's just a dud

1150
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:55,071
We should not be listening to medical doctor

1151
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:58,399
Well we should be listening to doctors of philosophy

1152
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:01,471
We should be listening to Brothers of doctors

1153
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,543
Jesus

1154
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:06,079
How is the world

1155
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:08,895
Exist now in a place of like

1156
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:10,175
Oh you got experts

1157
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:14,783
I got experts doesn't matter what my experts AIG

1158
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:19,647
Sounding good credential

1159
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,183
Good sounding

1160
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:21,951
Sacred

1161
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:23,999
And then

1162
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,279
Just you let hey okay

1163
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:29,631
Consortium

1164
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:32,447
Everybody is an expert in cool

1165
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:36,799
That's equal to this what do you call them climate to climate what scientist

1166
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:40,127
Saturday night stand with that get out of here

1167
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:44,479
It's mast

1168
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:45,759
Triumph

1169
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:49,599
Explain away this this increase

1170
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:50,879
I think it's bad

1171
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,415
I think it's not going to work

1172
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:53,951
Why is New York

1173
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:55,743
A few areas in Michigan

1174
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,535
They're blue cities and states

1175
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,327
Where they intubate

1176
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:06,239
Nursing homes knowing

1177
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:14,431
Is it was premeditated please talk about that

1178
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:26,719
Republic

1179
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:33,119
This isn't going to work as an argument there is currently over 100,000 deaths that haven't been in New York in Mission

1180
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:35,679
Depart

1181
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:38,239
Also Jim half-brother is reviewing the video

1182
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,007
Here

1183
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:43,871
Is it is true that there's a double chance of dying of covid-19 in blue States as opposed to Red States

1184
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:47,711
Maybe you should look for what up Factor might be involved there

1185
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:54,367
Maybe population density is different in these states maybe blue states include more Metropolitan Urban centers than Reds

1186
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:56,671
States which have different patterns of transmission

1187
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:58,463
I mean this sincerely

1188
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:04,095
Dear someone like Jim Hopper brother saying stuff like that then you're free to tune him out entirely

1189
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:07,935
If he's willing to make that kind of blind leap in order to justify his narrative

1190
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:10,751
He's not living in reality and whatever all this stuff is

1191
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:11,519
It's just both

1192
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:14,847
Yeah I chanteys Jim hoft brother

1193
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:21,759
Where is Parsonsburg cardboard cutout that Alex is talking

1194
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:23,039
Going to and it's okay

1195
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:26,623
Can't like the only thing I found

1196
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:28,927
How long can you keep

1197
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:35,839
You have to say

1198
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:37,887
I can't keep doing this

1199
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,423
You know

1200
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,703
Like where does this end

1201
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:47,359
This is the end after we get it if it if it doesn't in before we get a vaccine going to end after week

1202
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:48,639
Vaccine I don't know man

1203
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:53,247
I mean this is this is insane how can they keep this going this long I don't know

1204
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:59,647
I don't know

1205
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:07,839
Intuitively I would have told you way before now ofcourse that's what my gut would have told me is like

1206
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:14,495
You're going to have to try and get right with it

1207
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:22,687
Correct the underlying assumption

1208
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,735
Beverly Sanders the harder they seem to.

1209
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:25,503
Dig their heads into

1210
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:30,879
31 waist clip here and it's about where I checked out because Alex

1211
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:31,647
Discontinued

1212
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:33,439
Continuing to race bait

1213
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,207
Surrounding

1214
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:37,535
This story from Indianapolis.

1215
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:40,863
Alright

1216
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,167
I just listened to you talk to Jim hoft

1217
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:46,239
Brother put up with Vivian

1218
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:51,103
If you like 3 hours of your show today

1219
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:52,895
Yourself look at these headlines

1220
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:54,431
Blm's

1221
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:55,711
Supporters celebrate

1222
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:56,735
As a mother

1223
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:57,503
Shot

1224
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:59,295
For saying all lives matter

1225
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,575
When confronted by

1226
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:08,511
Facebook

1227
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,399
Person

1228
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,191
Totally

1229
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,543
Let me just go ahead start over with us.

1230
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:22,847
Let's just focus

1231
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:23,871
Real person that got

1232
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:29,759
We're going to sit here for Mama

1233
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:31,807
Somebody that died

1234
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:33,855
I think about that

1235
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:35,391
For just a second

1236
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:36,671
Because the Bible

1237
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:38,463
Nicki Minaj

1238
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:40,511
Yeah it's a mess

1239
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:44,863
I mean he's just basically Rewritten this entire story and

1240
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:46,911
Is now using it to push his

1241
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,191
Very racist

1242
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:48,959
Agenda

1243
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:56,383
The article that he was talking about you know like his dad want celebrating this picture

1244
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:57,919
A couple of comments

1245
01:14:58,175 --> 01:15:02,527
Online

1246
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:10,719
Bill Maher

1247
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:15,071
It's the same if I had

1248
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:19,423
The kind of patients or any beliefs

1249
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,983
Through all the comments on Infowars

1250
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:24,031
People using the n-word

1251
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:29,407
I can find I could find any horrifying thing that you want me to find Courthouse

1252
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:32,735
Or people who are in Fort Worth

1253
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:40,671
I think that would be committing a composition fallacy

1254
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:43,231
He's somehow indicative of what

1255
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:55,519
This white victimhood Narrative of if you dare say that

1256
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:57,311
Matter

1257
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:59,359
It's just b******* it's 8

1258
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:02,687
Find it abhorrent

1259
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:06,527
And disgusting

1260
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:11,647
We got there earlier

1261
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:17,023
Something interesting becomes a

1262
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:20,863
Desert going to cut bait and where I

1263
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,655
Cuz it's also really repetitive

1264
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:25,471
Really repetitive

1265
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:26,495
In a lot of ways

1266
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:27,775
Like that it's

1267
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:31,871
It's a long story

1268
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:35,711
You know he's repeating at 13 comes up a couple times there's

1269
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:38,271
The story about the

1270
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,039
Florida labs

1271
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:40,063
Citrus over and over

1272
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,599
It's very boring

1273
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:44,671
The constant repetition of the same

1274
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:46,463
Coronavirus narrative

1275
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,231
In the same

1276
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,767
They're going to

1277
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:51,583
Destroy everybody kind of s***

1278
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:56,703
I just think you know like we have to we have to come full circle

1279
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:58,495
With Rodger finally showing up

1280
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,031
And

1281
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:01,567
I'm kind of insulting Alex

1282
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:03,103
Discussing how

1283
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:07,711
Cernovich broke that story and how we had a house party tour aware of

1284
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:16,671
Alex and eating during the interview recorded cutting him off with a commercial raise the middle child

1285
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:23,583
Have to stretch out over week

1286
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:25,119
Text we can just have the

1287
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:27,935
Episode of this week on the show we have the

1288
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:31,007
The conclusion of the stunning conclusion

1289
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:42,015
Piece of s***

1290
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:48,415
Better

1291
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:51,999
The Rodger definitely out of Alex

1292
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:54,815
But doesn't care about him all that much

1293
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:00,191
And I think he's fruit

1294
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:06,847
Clearly indicate the Rodger would rather be elsewhere if there is a higher degree of

1295
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:07,871
We can get out of it

1296
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:11,967
Thank you Alex you set up a bit

1297
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:18,367
I think God

1298
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:21,439
Nobody care about you anymore

1299
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:23,743
Thank you

1300
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:27,327
Grow up in some other dick

01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:31,167
Bishop

1302
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,447
That's usually a good

1303
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:37,311
Rodger Stones entire career is evidence of don't make friends with Rodger Stone

1304
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:38,847
Insane

1305
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:41,407
I don't know

1306
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:46,271
Monday or something or other

1307
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,111
Stripe.com

And my book is at the quiet part

1309
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:57,535
Twitter

1310

We are very devilish I just really real and if you could please find a local charity

1311
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:09,055
PPL outage

1312
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:10,079
Jim hoft brother

1313
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,455
Alex

1314
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:17,503
In color
