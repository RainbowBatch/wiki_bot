1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important I sweat it

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge B

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,552
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
Acknowledge

6
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

7
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,072
Alex Jones

8
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:10,400
Jordan

9
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,216
Walmart

10
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,568
But that is that this week of the world lost the bad guy

11
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,920
Oh yeah Scott hall pass away I read about that

12
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,200
Not necessarily right about that

13
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,480
He died but

14
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,808
He was a wrestler who I was always

15
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,832
Very very

16
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,600
Exciting

17
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,416
I was grew up at just the right time

18
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,256
I watch wrestling in in such a way that

19
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,024
That

20
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,584
The WCW and the NWO

21
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,936
The Scott Hall is a part of

22
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:47,008
That was that was the era when I watched

23
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:51,616
Wrestling I had like two years where I was a wrestling fan so yeah I remember

24
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:58,016
Spiders coming in and invading WCW

25
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:04,416
Shows up and everybody went with Everett.

26
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:10,304
My parents didn't let me watch wrestling when I was a kid to the resort of that forbidden aspect to it

27
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,072
And

28
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:15,680
That made that made everything a little bit more a little bit more sneaky little contraband

29
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:19,776
And I'll go over to my friend's house and we would watch it it's lit sleepover

30
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,056
His place so we can watch like

31
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,896
Monday Night Raw and WCW Nitro

32
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,224
And said that there was an anarchic element

33
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,504
To the like

34
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,320
The invasion of the NWO Scott Hall

35
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,856
Chatters the cool one

36
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,744
Cool

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
He was a henchman

38
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,096
Through-and-through I think he thought he was cool

39
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:50,496
God always cool and scary

40
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,288
Follow blindly some a****** probably

41
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,128
Many fond memories of

42
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
Watch

43
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
Watching him work

44
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
And

45
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
Rest in peace

46
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,600
Strangely that vibrates but not

47
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
Better

48
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:13,792
However still somewhat nostalgic so if you remember Adult Swim Toonami

49
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,864
When they used to run anime all the time

50
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,656
Not really so

51
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,680
They are bringing back

52
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,960
Fooly Cooly

53
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,008
440

54
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,080
Zero idea

55
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:32,480
Describe fully Cooley to you on at least for occasion one ear out the other salute

56
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,248
Two people okay

57
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,784
There's a giant iron

58
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,184
Sometimes it turns into a manga fully Cooley might just mean rubbing tits together nobody knows anyways

59
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,280
The important part is that a woman hits a man in the face with a Rickenbacker Bass

60
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,352
And Mack has come out of it that they then have to fight the unit

61
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,144
Obviously

62
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:55,520
This is a coming-of-age tale about a young boy experiencing

63
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:01,920
I look forward to hearing about this for the first time for the fifth time in the future if I have no idea what you're talkin about

64
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:06,784
It is also one of the if not the maybe greatest anime series of all time

65
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,624
I feel like my reference point for Adult Swim is like when it was just

66
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,024
Sealab Aqua Teen Hunger Force

67
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,423
2 hours later you got Gundam Wing you got Dragon Ball Z German you got it all buddy

68
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,703
That's the s***

69
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
I'm glad

70
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,287
Good for you

71
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,895
Over today

72
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,455
Little bit of a break

73
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,527
Recording is on Thursdays I'm not sure if he actually got back to

74
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,831
Studio today or whatever but

75
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,623
To the present day on Monday

76
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,415
But for now we are back

77
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,439
Still

78
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,743
In the in the present or the past

79
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,047
I made today with tray

80
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,863
Delightful little bit of a request

81
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:58,495
Time travel episode

82
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:04,895

83
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,943
Rocky's Auto refund press to go back

84

2014 Ono

87
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
Alex's

88
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:23,071
40th birthday old man comes up once on the show but it's his birthday one time

89
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,095
Very weird

90
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,399
That this is what

91
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,215
Only a few months away from the invasion of Caribbean

92
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,007
It doesn't come up

93
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:37,407
Don't worry about that no witchery on that aspect

94
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:40,735
I am Richie but my powers are limited

95
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,783
Two to some degrees

96
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,367
Happy birthday Laurel after birthday to Alex

97
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,695
When's his birthday

98
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,999
Probably around the same

99
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,215
First Galaxy thank you so much

100
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,495
I'm a policy wonk

101
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,287
The Galaxy

102
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:10,687
The Dutchman is called the Dutchman if he isn't.

103
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,271
I think that was about Rik Smits

104
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:20,415
Next I went beyond the consciousness of God and all I got was this stupid t-shirt thank you so much

105
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,999
I think that was about

106
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,559
Probably

107
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:30,399
Text Robert Lexus

108
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,263
It's not about rex that was not robbed

109
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,175
I'm a policy wonk

110
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:46,271
The doctor occupied Texas

111
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,551
You're not a policy wonk

112
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
Y'alls

113
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,207
Alright so this is weird just drop

114
00:06:54,463 --> 00:07:00,607
Cold we don't really know what's going on

115
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
2003

116
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,703
Records deepen Alex's pass

117
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,263
He's a very different broadcaster

118
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,919
2222

119
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,247
It's kind of interesting to get this

120
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
Between points

121
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,039
Is pre Trump

122
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,319
Right

123
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,879
We haven't even figured out the four ways to learn

124
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:28,255
No he's being cagey about that but there is a list of episode

125
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:33,631
Not ways to learn okay I'll be a bit later in the episode

126
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,679
Here is my contacts drop though

127
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
From pleasure

128
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
Highways

129
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,943
Makes it hurt when Alex PU

130
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,711
Product

131
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,247
What makes it hurt when he pees

132
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,575
No no other iodine

133
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,623
He's selling

134
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,159
They made the

135
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,207
Doesn't hurt when you pee iodized

136
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,487
Or

137
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
Alex

138
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,279
Had syphilis

139
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:04,863
It's for a while to speculate necessarily

140
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:10,239
I also I will admit there is a failing in my research and that is that I didn't look into it

141
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:16,639
To see if it's a common side-effect died on the first one I just think it's a weird

142
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,199
I didn't look into it either I just

143
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,223
Gonorrhea

144
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,759
So here is a

145
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,343
Restart am to Alex is on one right at the job

146
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,719
One more time

147
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,375
I can do whatever I want

148
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,679
Walking along

149
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,951
Doesn't

150
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,999
What is it Obama

151
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,839
Accepting a state visit from then French president Francois

152
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,399
Thomas Jefferson

153
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,935
At Monticello

154
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,007
When he said that they were breaking protocol.

155
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,031
To go to

156
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,615
The terrorist to look at the view which wasn't part of the plan tonight

157
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:58,527
Of course because Obama joke about I was the president do whatever he wants Alex deadly seriously

158
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,319
The other post am joking around about

159
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,623
Not sticking to the bullet points of

160
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
Fitoor

161
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
Ridiculous

162
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,695
Oh man

163
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,999
Wasn't it wasn't weird when the

164
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,023
The president had like

165
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,327
An actual sense of humor that was not even

166
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
Not just

167
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,679
Like a solid sense of humor but at times it quite

168
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,239
You don't like with that or how did writing staff he

169
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:24,127
Crusted on those little things right there and then

170
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
Time do we say like

171
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:31,551
Do the Mexican you're going to kill you you know like that was a good president for a while

172
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,135
And there's an interesting aspect the pettiest

173
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
Complained

174
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,695
Being blown into like

175
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,999
Haha you admits he's a dictator

176
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,535
That's it that's how shity

177
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,559
It was too

178
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,607
It was to be a right-wing

179
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,167
Winger like s******* all over Obama's you had to be like

180
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,191
Look at it

181
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,215
F****** suit

182
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,775
Stance

183
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,847
Slipped

184
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,615
When

185
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:00,735
Trump becomes president Alex accuses everyone else is doing the same game

186
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:06,111
Absolutely was not tax rate over 100% in France

187
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
Hanson 2014

188
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:11,743
The highest tax Band in their system is on people who made over 150 1000

189
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,279
Some two hundred euros a year

190
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,607
And any income above that point was taxed at a rate of 45

191
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,959
Holland heads tried to usher in an experiment where business

192
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:24,031
Is the pay salaries over a million euros per year

193
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,335
Would have to pay a 75%

194
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,103
Payroll tax

195
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:31,967
But it was widely unpopular and it wasn't continued after the two-year timetable

196
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,991
It was put in place

197
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Experiment

198
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,599
I frequently see this being reported as a tax on people who make more than

199
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,391
A million euros a year but that isn't

200
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,159
True

201
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,439
That was the original

202
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,719
Content of Holland

203
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,767
But it was Dean

204
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,815
Punitive by the Congressional Court

205
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
Has thrown out

206
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:52,191
Has it ever existed for two years this was a payroll tax imposed on businesses

207
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,471
Not on the middle class

208
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
And it wasn't over a hundred percent

209
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,847
Looking back it's interesting to see who the guardian describes as putting the

210
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,151
Dakota nail in the coffin on this tack

211
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,759
That honor goes to a young upstart who just become France's economy minister

212
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
Emmanuel

213
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,551
Macron

214
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,111
Surprised to hear Alex

215
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,671
Text liking macron for stuff like this back though

216
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,767
CDs are these villains in there

217
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,167
In doing things that he would support like on the way to be

218
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,959
Becoming the villain that he hates to

219
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,775
Like it is if Alex had jumped on early

220
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,567
Maybe we'd all be in a different place

221
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,847
Probably not

222
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,919
Doubtful there's threesome trends

223
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
That are going on

224
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
In 2040

225
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,015
I think I might have

226
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,551
Discovered hipsters

227
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,279
Women's

228
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,271
AR

229
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,255
What

230
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:39,455
That's Obama's fault I don't understand what the problem here is really stupid

231
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,759
Good thoughts disorder being woven together

232
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:47,903
What are things that I think is really fascinating about this is the way that Alex doesn't seem to take as much

233
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,695
The people dressing like hobos

234
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,231
The man

235
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:57,375
Women are attracted you should be f****** me

236
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,423
Big and loud

237
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,543
What if it does

238
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
It does seem like

239
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:11,967
The complaint is largely directed at women for being attracted to the thing Alex doesn't want them to be

240
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,295
Are they must be being brainwashed by the TV which is under the direction of

241
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,575
Obama

242
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,855
I don't want to listen

243
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
And I don't want

244
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,927
To say that people can't wear skinny jeans in the

245
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,719
Comfort of their own home I'm just saying

246
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,303
Don't put it on my TV until women to be attract

247
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,143
Do it sir I understand

248
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,703
Assertive intellectually this

249
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,495
This generational

250
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,287
Confusion about Aesthetics

251
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,079
Right

252
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:44,735
I don't understand why you got to get so mad about it how far away from the 40 year-old virgin our way

253
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,087
Probably quite a ways

254
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,927
No idea

255
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:59,327
All movies happened I don't want to ruin it but there was effect

256
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,631
On this episode about a movie

257
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,423
That is similar to what you're experiencing

258
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,215
Forty-year-old virgin I believe

259
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,007
We'll get to that when we get to it alright

260
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,287
Pronounce Alexei

261
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,823
Gunn fear story

262
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:16,479
Headline

263
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,551
AOL

264
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,535
Pretty rose version came out in 2000

265
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,119
Close close

266
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,703
So this clip Alex is talking about a guy named Mark

267
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,727
Witness app

268
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,567
I was just going to leaving at 7:40

269
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,895
For instance why was this guy's house search

270
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,199
Obviously the police were there you know

271
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,247
Did they weren't there just trying to seek out and

272
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
Empty shotgun

273
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:25,087
Michelle there must have been a reason for them to be there

274
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,367
Little suspicious

275
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,927
What's going on here

276
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,487
So when is Shaq was going through divorce

277
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,535
Since 2012 and his estranged wife

278
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,863
Complain to the police on multiple occasions that he had threatened her with a gun

279
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:41,727
This led to police visits during both of which they found illegal ammunition in his possession

280
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:45,311
The items found in the first visit weren't able to be brought to the case

281
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591
The police didn't have a war

282
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,151
The Winneshiek did that consent to a search of

283
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
His house

284
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
Do I throw it out

285
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,735
In DC only

286
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,271
People with registered guns

287
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,551
Can possess ammunition

288
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:59,135
So the shotgun shell along with a box of Muzzleloader bullets

289
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,927
Cyber problem

290
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
Kendama

291
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,487
Ultimately he ended up getting sentence

292
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:07,071
What's the time served being on firearm registry and getting a 50

293
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,095
Dollar fine

294
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:13,215
I want all this probably seems like a bit of an overreaction and a waste of people's time but ultimately

295
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,519
Probably good that the allegations of

296
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,591
Threats of murderous domestic violence were taken seriously

297
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,407
The ones alleged by witaschek

298
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,199
Xy4 often ignored and they lie

299
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
Lead to tragedy

300
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,527
Seems like a rare case where police acted

301
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,087
There's something to be said for that

302
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,367
Yeah this wasn't

303
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,391
Actually the big

304
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,415
Biggest problem that would assure

305
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
Jack had to worry

306
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:38,303
Also is part of the Fallout from his divorce his ex-wife provided DC officials with

307
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,911
Some tax documents about which affects business-related look good

308
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,191
You got in some Rob

309
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,727
Double effect

310
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,775
Anyway the point here is that there's more

311
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,311
Stories in the way Alex's report

312
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:55,967
It's important when you're doing these kinds of gun martyrdom presentations that you present the central character is being as blameless

313
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,735
This is possible

314
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,527
There's no room for nuance

315
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,319
That's because you need to be black and white

316
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,879
Open and shut case where the persons having the guns taken

317
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,159
In for no reason

318
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:09,279
And the states actions are solely motivated by a tyrannical desire to take everyone's guns

319
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,583
That's why when Alex

320
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,399
Does decide to touch on why the raid happened

321
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,679
Here's how he puts

322
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,623
There was a disgruntled family member dropped a dime

323
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,927
Estranged wife in the middle of an ugly divorce

324
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:40,255
Who allegedly threatened her multiple times with a gun

325
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,047
Recognizing

326
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,607
Wecast too much of a shadow on this story in wrist

327
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:48,703
Smarter not look as blameless as he needs to look for this kind of narrative to work

328
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,263
You want to deal with the realities of this stuff

329
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
Away

330
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
No way

331
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:59,711
You can't you can't let your audience know that this guy was both confused of threatening his wife with a gun on multiple occasions

332
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:03,295
That's why the police band with the first place seems like they should take his guns away

333
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:09,951
I mean it's it's at the point where the real lesson of stories like they should be that gun shouldn't be outlawed

334
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:15,839
It should be outlawed for men to have guns and women should have to hold a gun pointed toward the man's face and every interaction

335
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,631
Because this is f******

336
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,959
I mean obviously there's another serious

337
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,519
Proposing I don't know I don't think it's a terrible idea

338
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,079
I think

339
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,871
I think

340
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,407
In in the real world

341
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,943
The fact

342
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,711
That's

343
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,991
An allegation

344
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,271
Like this was made of like

345
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,295
You know this

346
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,319
5 my ex-husband

347
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,087
Threaten me with

348
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,671
The fact that you do end up taking it seriously

349
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,951
Pay a visit

350
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
Totally

351
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,511
I think things

352
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,047
Appropriately

353
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:50,399
Maybe it's not that big of a deal but he has a box of muzzleloading bullets

354
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,423
Maybe that's not

355
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,191
Maybe that is

356
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,983
Fitting to just be like

357
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,031
Hey here's a $50 fine

358
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,847
And this is going to go in a record because

359
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,383
You know on the off-chance

360
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,151
Someone else says

361
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,711
You threatened him with a gun we can now established

362
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,271
And well I mean I wrecked

363
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,039
Recognize that

364
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,855
I'm just so you know

365
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,671
But the level of

366
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:16,255
Men having every Edition inside their homes with guns

367
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,791
And then getting a divorce

368
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,839
Violin

369
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,607
Violent

370
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:26,495
You know

371
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,823
Intersection of masculinity and guns

372
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:33,151
I want to be living in Alex's nightmare

373
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,967
So are in a sex club Alex has something that I

374
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,503
Wish you would talk more about

375
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,359
This clip is why Alex's show suck

376
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,175
He's introduced a very bizarre position about

377
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,735
The relative evilness of past governments at Empire

378
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,807
This is the extent of his conversation about it

379
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,367
How you equip like that and all I want is more

380
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:18,720
It's like what countries are in the 20% that weren't total evil.

381
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,536
What's the differentiating factor between them

382
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,072
It seems like this is

383
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:26,400
The conclusion he's pretending to reach after deep research so I want

384
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,936
Hear about what he's learned

385
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,496
But instead I mean was latitude

386
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:34,592
Really it's just an expression of Alex's opposition to the idea of government

387
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,896
Though he's too cowardly to be an anarch

388
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:37,920
Yeah

389
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,456
Yeah I mean

390
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,504
Okay

391
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,528
Okay let's

392
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,344
Let's just go down the f****** listman

393
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
Alright bad government

394
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,160
Versus

395
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,696
Not too radical government

396
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,768
0 BC

397
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
The Romans

398
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:57,632
They do I don't know though

399
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,704
There's a part of me that worries

400
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,728
That it's

401
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,312
Governments that were headed by people Alec

402
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,592
Dwight

403
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,896
There's a part of me that worries that that's it

404
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:12,480
That would be about 20% of the government's he's aware of

405
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,528
You throw in the United States government in there

406
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,296
Whaleyville

407
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,088
Sirenita Howell

408
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,136
Nothing like the

409
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:23,744
The 50s I mean he's not willing to throw the Nazis in there is one of the good 20% just yet

410
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,048
Probably not as of 2014

411
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:31,168
I don't know but the fact that he doesn't elaborate on it just drives me nuts

412
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,448
It makes me mad

413
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:38,080
I want to know I'm interested in I thought that he doesn't give me that thought I would you say 80%

414
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:44,480
Is there something you're basing that off of is estimation

415
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,528
Basic that office you read research

416
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,600
Reading so much about history

417
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,136
How many zero million

418
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,672
Governments in history

419
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,440
I just want some

420
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,720
How come you don't get

421
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,280
So the National Guard is

422
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
Out-of-pocket

423
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,984
Haha

424
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,968
To generate

425
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:47,968
The movie

426
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:40,448
America home cooler

427
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,488
Michigan

428
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,512
Story we talked about

429
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,280
10:10

430
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,816
But I'd hold off on that road

431
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,864
The stories that Alex is talking about

432
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,888
Beginning of this cliff

433
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,264
Inspiring all of this is out of Portsmouth Ohio the Ohio Army National Guard

434
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,312
Civil support unit

435
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,128
In conjunction with local First Responders held a drill where the

436
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,152
The scenario was quote

437
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:26,016
Two School Employees were disgruntled over the government's interpretation of the Second Amendment

438
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:30,112
Glock to use chemical biological and radiological agents against members of the local

439
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:30,880
Local community

440
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:34,720
The motivation behind the specific scenario was to maintain awareness that

441
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:37,024
Not all terrorism is 4in base

442
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,816
And the domestic terrorism doesn't

443
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,608
That's that's the reason I use that as part

444
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,632
Scenario

445
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:45,216
I want to let something really interesting slip towards the end of that clip though

446
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:51,360
He seems that all the training exercises use right-wing 2nd Amendment supporters as the villains and their scenario because this is

447
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,664
Is about training the police and the public.

448
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,944
Look at them is evil terrorist

449
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:59,296
But then Alex admits that he only knows about the exercises with parents freak out in

450
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,832
Sue

451
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,624
I wasn't anything about the

452
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,696
This topic except the cases that he's he's reported in the media that

453
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,720
Consumes

454
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,144
He reads exclusively extreme right-wing news sources and they only report on these training exercises when there's an opportunity

455
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,936
To create right-wing victimhood narrative

456
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,728
The image that

457
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:21,824
Alex gets from the media he consumes is that every or almost every exercise

458
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
Involves brand

459
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,872
Ending Patriots as terrorists

460
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,664
That's not true at all

461
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:32,320
A ton of the scenarios at the National Guard groups do every year at to do the natural disasters where there's not even a human villain Envy

462
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:37,184
But beyond that if you go through their press release archive you can find plenty of examples

463
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,280
From the timeframe that Alex is talking about he or even that don't fit his mold

464
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:45,120
In August 2013 the New York National Guard ran it scenario

465
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,936
Exercise where they had a chemical Fallout but it wasn't

466
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,704
Any terrorism

467
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,008
Is cousin accidental train derailment

468
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:51,776
I would probably

469
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,312
Didn't hear too much about that or how

470
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,592
People are scared

471
00:26:55,872 --> 00:27:00,992
In July 2013 the North Carolina National Guard didn't exercise that was based on training their rapid

472
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:01,760
Response team

473
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:05,344
And involve dealing with protesters who were having a sit-in at a water treatment

474
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,112
Facility

475
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:12,000
The fake protest group they had that one was called The Pink Panthers and they were very much coded as a left-wing order

476
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
Organization

477
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,072
I was probably didn't see that reported and drugs

478
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,608
And so he doesn't

479
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,888
Don't know it exists

480
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,728
In 2014 the South Carolina National Guard than exercise called objective

481
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:24,288
Indigo which had to do with terrorist groups taken hostage

482
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,616
But they weren't right-wing Patriot gun owner groups or anyting

483
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:31,200
Another example is the yearly exercise that northcom run

484
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,480
Vibrant response

485
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,528
Fox where a simulated nuclear attack happen

486
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,320
9 First Responders bracket

487
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,600
Responding

488
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,368
The things that are like

489
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,136
Take me to come up

490
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,928
And that scenario

491
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,696
Leaving usually

492
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,512
I need for a specific person or group behind the bombing

493
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,048
Because the focus is on the

494
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,072
Immediate response like

495
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,352
Dealing with the wounded

496
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,912
No real need for a larger

497
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,680
Storyline

498
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,752
Cuz I had a villain

499
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,568
The more flavor

500
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,592
Necessarily always

501
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,152
Alex is perception it

502
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:06,528
Very well may seem like every scenario bass exercise that law enforcement or the National Guard does involves

503
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,808
Maligning people like himself

504
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,368
Perception isn't based on real

505
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:15,232
In only extreme right-wing news where the only time he ever

506
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,768
Here's a story reported about

507
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,304
Scenario training exercises

508
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:23,424
If someone crying bloody murder about how is fictitious right-wing domestic terror group is part of the exercise

509
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,192
Question

510
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,472
All the other ones

511
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,032
Scenarios based on natural disasters are accent

512
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,336
Scenarios where the thread is a left-wing group

513
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,128
Scenarios where the villain is Ananda

514
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,408
Foreign terror group

515
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,224
All of these don't exist and Alex's reporting because

516
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,760
He doesn't know or doesn't

517
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,784
Don't care they exist

518
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,344
The media that he's taking and drives home the message

519
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,368
He wants to hear

520
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,904
Repeat

521
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,952
And solidifies that message to his audience

522
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,744
As if it's the product of research

523
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,512
When it's just

524
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,792
Regurgitating

525
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:50,816
Bulshit

526
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:53,120
But he skimmed on drugs

527
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:56,960
Sure I mean at the same time there is another option which is

528
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:57,984
That

529
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,056
It has been an immensely effective strategy

530
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,616
Even the slightest

531
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,152
Fictional hint

532
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,432
Of Gunn

533
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,456
Ownership being

534
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,480
Question

535
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:11,808
Shrek bloody murder as loud as you possibly can like

536
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,880
The mayak document was so reasonable and and

537
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:20,000
Borderline restrained of life

538
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,328
That kind of thing and Dave

539
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,608
Freak the freak out over

540
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:28,192
But even the slightest notion and its effect

541
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,728
Because it's kept us from

542
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,776
I mean it's illegal to study

543
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,800
How many people have

544
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,568
How many people cops

545
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,104
Till everyday you know like

546
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,640
Illegal

547
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,176
They're good at

548
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,992
Yeah and I think I actually even in this next clip Alex

549
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,040
Kind of expresses the similar thing that you're talkin

550
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:47,392
I'm about this idea of like we have to make a f****** huge deal out of everything

551
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:54,976
Stop playing that clip Obama wasn't in France he was at Alex's buddy Thomas Jefferson

552
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,560
Alex

553
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:01,632
Second president is

554
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:08,032
He's like a Wi-Fi hotspot in francophone

555
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:16,480
Mentality there like we got to make a big deal out of everything

556
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,272
People wrecking

557
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,040
Pig noises

558
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,320
There's a point to

559
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:28,000
Crazy it's so crazy listening to him freak out about it after the 6

560
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:28,768
Swear you're like

561
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,304
Yeah man

562
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,888
Also it's funny to to be like

563
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,960
Listen to this music is the most dangerous time in American history is like

564
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:37,984
Alright

565
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,264
Wait a few years bud

566
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,616
I would go back to 2014 and I'll heart

567
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,432
Just finish it

568
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,712
To spend my time

569
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,016
Teaching his dumb argument about

570
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,040
Cartoon

571
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,600
Debbie mcmoore

572
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,648
Fun than the reality of the world

573
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,416
The that

574
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,184
Covers now

575
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:02,560
So I think that clip also illustrate something really strange and Alex's world

576
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,352
Deep desire to impose harsh

577
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,144
Censorship on people who don't agree with

578
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:12,544
Watch the short-lived and not very well received the Green Lantern animated series he's talking about but

579
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,824
I know well enough that

580
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,104
The premises

581
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,920
Of the character and I know that the villains in it weren't

582
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,736
Can Amendment Patriot types aware tri-corner

583
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,552
I mean unless they were all yellow

584
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,368
Could be red lantern

585
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,648
Coats

586
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,816
You got that fifth wheel alignment

587
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:39,424
But it landed call me

588
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,032
Anyone you walk away from that's a good joke sullenberger of jokes

589
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:47,104
Wasn't pretty but we got talent

590
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:54,272
I would guess that there's like one episode of that show where some villain of the week is similar enough to Alex's militia weirdo ID

591
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,064
I mean calamity

592
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,088
Attack on him

593
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:57,856
And this is

594
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,136
Completely unacceptable

595
00:32:59,392 --> 00:32:59,904
Alex

596
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,672
Anytime

597
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:04,512
The characteristics he Associates with himself or used to depict a villain and a shield

598
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,304
Secretly the government Pre-K

599
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,608
Programming the people to be against him

600
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,888
It's basically

601
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,936
So what's the solution to that

602
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:18,336
I guess the only thing that makes sense for Alex do support would be making a rule that villains and TV shows and cartoon the books

603
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,384
Movies of any characteristics

604
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,432
That make them similar to right-wing

605
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:28,832
Extremists are Gunn and militia weirdo absolutely not they can only be the hero right otherwise it's government otherwise

606
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,440
Like censorship really

607
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,976
Casino depicting characters

608
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,536
It's not a creative at

609
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,816
Actor function speech

610
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,608
Premeditated attack by the globalist

611
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,400
Alex just wants the global

612
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,168
To stop at

613
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:43,936
Hacking him

614
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,728
And the only way that could be done is by

615
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,264
Banning any negative to picture

616
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:54,688
Obviously stupid when the emperor has no clothes

617
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:57,504
You kill anybody who says you don't have any clothes

618
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,528
Is it makes perfect sense

619
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,088
Story is dumb what should have happened

620
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,624
When is the emperor's people should have just

621
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,648
Killed that kid

622
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,696
And then everybody else would have been like

623
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,976
You're right you do have

624
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:10,048
Gray close Buddies

625
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,096
Who's all this Salt Lake

626
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:12,864
Free scripting

627
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,888
Right

628
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,168
Alex

629
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,216
It makes a terrible terrible metaphor

630
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,984
What

631
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,272
Kebab planted

632
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,040
The drugs

633
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:07,136
I guess another explanation for knowing where Bill is keeping his cocaine is because

634
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:12,512
I don't know let's just say the bill doesn't daily radio show where he works really hard to scare the s*** out of his audience

635
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:17,376
I think kind of poke them closer and closer to thinking the baby keeping their cocaine in a certain place

636
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,168
Is the solution to all their problems

637
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,240
Maybe bill is a weird track record of denying the people like

638
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,264
Himself or capable of

639
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,288
Keeping their cocaine in

640
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,312
The specific location

641
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,848
And that anytime there's any

642
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:29,408
Clear instances of someone like him station cocaine

643
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:32,480
In that specific location it was a globalist setup

644
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:35,808
Maybe at that point Bob

645
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,600
The keep is cocaine in that location

646
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:41,440
I mean strong suspicious

647
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,512
Maybe Bob decided to listen to the same radio show and bought

648
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:49,376
The same book where to hide your cocaine

649
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:52,704
This is kind of a larger point of some of Alex's ship

650
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,264
You would love to ban all criticism of people like

651
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:01,152
Himself but because that's just not possible and his brain doesn't really allow him to openly active advocate for that

652
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,200
These TV shows get used

653
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,224
To preemptively.

654
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,552
Declare that anyone who is similar to Alex has similar beliefs to Alex

655
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,344
Possibly enjoys Alex's work

656
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,880
Anyone like that music

657
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,416
Committing a violent Act

658
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,720
Is just a global a setup to make Alex

659
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,744
The Patriots look

660
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:19,584
That's why they did the TV shows that begin with so they could pull off his

661
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,120
Furnishing of Alex's character

662
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:25,984
Quartz very little payoff when you could tarnish his character just by listening to a stupid show

663
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:30,336
It's smart of Alex to do stuff like this though particularly at this point because

664
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:32,640
A few months after this episode is recorded

665
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:35,456
Jared and Amanda Miller to Big Infowars

666
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,736
Killed three people

667
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,760
Including two cops

668
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,528
In Las

669
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:42,112
In May 2012 Jared written post on Infowars

670
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:48,000
Website board previously

671
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,536
But they're on this message

672
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,328
He posted a blog post

673
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,352
What's the title

674
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,120
The police

675
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,144
To kill or not

676
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,912
2 kill

677
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,216
Or you just got to being on probation for selling weed

678
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:02,848
Using difficulty in his life and was particularly concerned with the idea that the police would show up to his house for a search

679
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,408
Most likely because he was not allowed to own guns

680
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,944
Had a lot of guns

681
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:10,528
Hippo strongly mirrors a lot of Alex's ideas to

682
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,088
I do not wish to kill police

683
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:15,904
I understand that most of them believe they're doing the right thing

684
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:19,488
Yet I will not go to jail because I have not committed a crime

685
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,536
I would rather die than be labeled as a criminal

686
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:25,632
Let them call me a terrorist let them label me a fanatic some Nut Job

687
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,424
I know the truth and so does God

688
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,728
I'm sure our founding fathers were labeled as such

689
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,032
Call me a radical

690
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,592
Because America is a radical idea

691
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,360
There's worse.

692
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:38,688
They were Terror

693
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:45,088
Peter points from Alex's documentaries is an out-of-context dropping someone at a government seminar saying the founding fathers were terrorists

694
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:49,184
Which Alex uses a claim that the government hates anyone who believes in the Constitution

695
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,208
And that message

696
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,000
Is echoed in this guy's post

697
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,304
The post itself concludes quote

698
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,096
It is our duty as American

699
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,888
Can citizens to stand against tyranny

700
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,936
The stand against corruption at all levels

701
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,472
How did this happen

702
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:04,544
The Patriots like me could be resting under the boot of Tyra

703
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:07,360
As I plead for help for my fellow America

704
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,640
They just Walk On By

705
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:11,200
All the while thinking at least it's not happening

706
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,504
To me it's happening

707
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,808
To them so do I kill cops and make a

708
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,344
Cast and where they come to get me

709
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,928
I prefer to die than sitting there jail when I've done nothing to hurt

710
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:26,304
Alex knows the reality that there's not insignificant part of his audience.

711
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,072
It's like that

712
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,120
Little better right on the edge

713
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,144
Committed violent Acts

714
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,448
Most of them don't end up

715
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,984
Following through with them but

716
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,288
Alex does need a built-in excuse for the ones

717
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,824
The do any bills that excuse

718
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,384
If I complain about TV shows being predictive programming

719
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,944
Better set up to make it look like people who

720
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,712
Or his van

721
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,736
And would do things right

722
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
Kill cops

723
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,296
Right and of course after

724
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:51,392
Jared Amanda killed those three people Alex immediately called it a false flag

725
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:54,976
Because that's the payoff for the work that he's doing here in February

726
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,768
Being able to feign ignorance

727
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,352
Oh oh by

728
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,888
Whatever your audience commits Acts

729
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,912
Classic terrorism

730
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,192
The entire game

731
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:08,032
Any idea that it would matter is silly whenever

732
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,056
After like

733
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,104
If you went and read watch

734
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,872
Didn't plan it

735
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:16,224
Evil rat villain is left-of-center to Nancy Pelosi

736
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:16,992
Like that

737
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,272
What's the level of

738
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:21,088
If they were really if cartoons were helping out

739
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,880
We will be in a different world right now

740
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,464
There are left-wing

741
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,000
Villains

742
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,792
Oh totally

743
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:32,352
Yeah and I don't remember ever taking offense

744
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,912
To that even if it's something that I like

745
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:37,216
I do understand

746
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,240
Yeah that

747
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,288
There are left-wing terrorist groups

748
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:46,688
A lot of them even like animal Liberation fire mental groups

749
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:50,272
Premium

750
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,344
I absolutely understand

751
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,368
I don't

752
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,160
Take such

753
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,184
Offense

754
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,232
The notion

755
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,280
Of that being assertive a reality

756
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:02,816
People are fine.

757
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,584
The Scotts

758
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,168
My lesson wasn't like all their ideals were wrong it was like bad plan

759
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,216
I don't think I don't think that

760
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:13,568
Like the reality and the discussion of their existing

761
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,848
Left-wing terrorism

762
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:19,456
I don't think that makes me feel like people are saying that everyone on the left is a terror

763
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:23,296
Speedway Alex engages with the world which is

764
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,064
Is childish

765
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:28,928
BFDI to make you believe everybody on the left is a terrorist

766
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:33,280
Alex gets to talking about his eyes LOL.

767
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,560

00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:25,504
Magazine article about preemptively arresting birchers

773
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,272
Cuz I don't think

774
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:29,856
Exists

775
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:33,952
Also whether or not Berger is are the most upstanding people

776
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:39,072
Some points of contention if you're talkin about like Financial crimes than the membership of the John Birch

777
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,352
Society makes up some of the most

778
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:47,008
Criminal Cadre of people's wage theft alone the Koch brothers have stolen

779
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:52,384
Trillions of dollars it's so many other manufacturing interests are apart of

780
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:55,711
But even beyond that if you look at some of their founding members

781
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,015
It's on Shady things like you mentioned

782
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,039
Is an absolute

783
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,319

He profited from building oil refining capabilities for Hitler in the 30s

Reveal Opie Oliver who was forced to step down from membership in the JBS and 19th

787

Ambien inspiration

791
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,639
For William Luther Pierce when he was writing

792
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,663
The Turner Diaries

793
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,455
Essentially the Bible for white

Supreme Mist Terror

795
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:32,063
Also Pierce himself was aperture for a while

796
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,855
Before you needed seek out something stronger

797
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,135
Willis carto

Was a bird

The Neo-Nazi founder of the white Aryan resistance

The clan

A society actually is 100% just good upstanding people if you pretend all the examples of really high-level mod

807
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,823
Monsters don't exist

Oh there was a racist in the group who posted that sings on Twitter

813
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,903
Tom Metzger

00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,951
Oliver

815
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,023
No problem

816
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:16,863
These are people who are likewise

817
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,959
We overthrow a government for the people just so I can get more money

818
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,287
That's some of that

819
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:30,687
Evil donut that's some of the businesses there's also just

820
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,759
I do

821
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:36,063
Strongly to the John Birch Society

822
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,135
I do appreciate that the rich have so

823
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:44,511
Overwhelmingly destroyed and dominated our media that they're like that we're all like a man

824
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:49,119
Lifting is wrong and the jumper Society filled with the nice

825
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:49,887
6 people in the world

826
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,655
Sure

827
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,935
They're almost

828
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:55,519
40% responsible for climate change

829
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:57,567
Buy them

830
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:01,407
Arthur crunch the numbers on that

831
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,943
Actuary

832
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,735
So

833
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:06,015
Alex Alex

834
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:06,783
What's a strong word

835
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:43,135
I'm sure that's exactly how Jared Miller felt ended up killing three people

836
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,671
A few months after this episode

837
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,975
He's a really clear in his both any feels like

838
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,535
Constitutional rights been violated and that if

839
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,607
B5 back or call a radical but they only call a radical cuz he

840
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,887
Standing up for what's right

841
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:56,959
He never says that the idea of killing cops is his way of

842
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,495
Commencing 17:7

843
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,263
36

844
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,031
We might as well

845
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:06,943
To be clear I don't think there's a direct line between Alex's comments on this specific episode and Jared's rationalization for why

846
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,967
Why was necessary

847
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,247
For him to kill three people

848
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,783
I'm saying that the

849
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:14,879
Consistent content on Alex's show and the editorial perspective as a whole

850
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,951
Informed Jared's rationalization for why was necessary

851
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,743
For him to kill three people in this clip is

852
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,535
Just one of the Litany of examples

853
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,559
That fade into the

854
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,327
Extremist back

855
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,095
Yak

856
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,119
Sick

857
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:25,887
Yeah

858
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:26,911
Yeah you know

859
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:29,471
It is it is one of those things

860
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:33,823
You're you're trained to think of theirs there's an inciting

861
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,359
Element to Alex's

862
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,407
Oh something he said must have him

863
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,295
Created a

864
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,063
Such

865
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,111
Void of

866
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,391
Empty violin

867
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:50,207
There's nowhere else for it to go

868
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:53,279
Kind of alarming I was looking at Alex's

869
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,815
Site obviously like you

870
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,119

Something that

876
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:12,223
Whether or not it's intentional it's like that that void that you're talking about

877
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,247
Yeah it is

878
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:16,063
Is like well now you're going to try and create

879
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:16,831
Mass

880
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,111
Shootings out of it or something

881
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,159

That's not that's not

885
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:25,791
Not terrible right

886
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,327

00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,215

Tomorrow's news. News

892
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,943
This is bad

893
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,991
I know you can't do this

894
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,551
So are we know that Alex loves them cuts

895
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,087
Two-channel Sheriff

896
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,647
He has a little story about one of them

897
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:54,463
Florida

898
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,263
So there's about Nick

899
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:43,871
Fitch shares of Liberty County in 2013

900
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:49,503
He decided that he didn't like that someone was arrested for a concealed-carry violation of it

901
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,039
Concealed loaded firearm

902
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:53,343
So he unilaterally had him release

903
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,903

Position is Sarah

908
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:08,703
This whole thing made Finch something of a hero in econ

909
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,471
Constitutional

910
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,239
Community show

911
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,543
Problem is that actions have consequences

912
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:16,127
As it turns out sometimes those consequences are really bad

913
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:19,455
Floyd Eugene Parrish was the man who Finch

914
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:21,247
Unilaterally released on the

915
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,271

00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:32,511
Oh well I probably won't get covered on Infowars kind of like it didn't happen

919
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:34,815
You know yeah well I mean that was

920
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:35,839
That was later

921
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,119
You know this

922
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:40,447
That's like saying that something in the past then leads to something in

923
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,471
In the future and it just doesn't make

924
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,519
Only been now half

925
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:44,799
Everybody knows

926
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,359
There never any

927
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,127
Indication

928
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:54,783
Be like saying that foreign policy decisions from 30 years ago somehow have it effective

929
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,343
For policy decisions now. Just crazy

930
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,623
Just weird

931
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,415
This guy Finch

932
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,183
The sheriff

933
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,231
Overstepped his authority

934
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,255
Very

935
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,535
Brazen way

936
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:09,119
In order to get one guy out of prison

937
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:16,543
Concealed carry violation about it and I just dropped the story and a few

938
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,311
You years later

939
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,103
The guy who he

940
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,175
Unilaterally let out of prison murder to guy

941
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,455
Just weird

942
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:26,271
Well if there was anything I remember

943
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,295
Counterargument

944
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,063
2

945
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:28,831
The whole thing

946
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:33,951
Murder somebody do you bring up all of these exam

947
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:36,511
And you think it doesn't

948
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,047
Change

949
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:41,119
The truth which is that everyone should have a gun all the

950
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,911
On them

951
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,727
Pointed at everybody else and if you can do an argument

952
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:46,495
You should fire

953
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,263
One of your boots

954
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:50,079
Absolutely whatever extra one of Your Boots Been Under

955
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,895
I want to stress this

956
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,199
Is an experiment

957
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,735
Experian

958
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,783
That I find fascinating

959
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,551
It's

960
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,343
The uniform

961
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,391
I cannot think of a counterexample this

962
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:07,743
Every single sheriff who's ever been brought up on Alex's show

963
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:12,607
You look into him a little bit and there's something real f*****-up

964
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,191
What of the truisms of

965
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:19,519
Researching Infowars is that if someone to share if they're on meth

966
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:24,127
No I mean well in order to be a constitutional Sheriff

967
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,151
Your thought

968
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,943
Have to begin with the place

969
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,735
The founding fathers

970
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:32,319
Love giving unilateral authority to one person

971
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,855
The highest law in the land

972
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:37,439
What the founding fathers looking at King George.

973
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,463
No no no

974
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:42,303
We need one in every city and every state baby

975
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:48,447
Sheriff of Nottingham you have like you're Richard Max

976
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:52,799
Arpaio's I saw your profile

977
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:54,847
We got to do from Wisconsin Milwaukee

978
00:50:55,103 --> 00:51:00,479
There's people all over the place

979
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:04,575
They're like I'm talkin about even Lake

980
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,343
Low-end

981
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,695
Completely forgettable never

982
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,487
A big media named Sheriff

983
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,767
They're still

984
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:13,791
Across-the-board

985
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:14,815
F***** up

986
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:17,119
If they're brought up on Infowars of the hero

987
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,679
So

988
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,471
We're in 2014 now

989
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,007
And there's

990
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,031
Some things that are different

991
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:24,799
Then

992
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:25,823
The present

993
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:26,591
Alex's

994
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,383
In the midst of

995
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:30,175
Figuring out how much she owes for

996
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,455
We are losing the Sandy Hook

997
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,223
Cases right

998
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,247
And the present day

999
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:37,087
Those fears were not in his mind

1000
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,135
And so he was really really proud

1001
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,183
Tampa.

1002
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:44,255
Call kumon.com

1003
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,559
Reporters

1004
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,935
Massaman

1005
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:54,495
Howard

1006
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:21,375
How many hours

1007
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,487
Sounds a lot like

1008
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,791
You hold yourself here

1009
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,839
Supposed to be actual reality of Danville.

1010
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,887
I do love the image though

1011
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:54,655
I like

1012
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,935
People being

1013
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:56,703
IQ

1014
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,263
Don't pay attention to this matter

1015
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,359
I want one time

1016
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,151
For the entire press Corps

1017
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,175
The stand up and

1018
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:07,967
What kind of

1019
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:12,831
Lunatic world is that we covered this whole time. Of the Boston bombing

1020
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:15,903
Watch those videos and for the most part everybody

1021
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,183
Is f****** annoyed

1022
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:23,583
Andy being there and acting like a total a****** because the city is in

1023
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,351
State of

1024
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,631
Acute grieving

1025
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:29,471
And Terror they're scared there's a bomber on the loose

1026
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:33,567
Any of this guy grandstanding and trying to turn it into a PR stunt

1027
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:35,615
Predict whole guy in Texas

1028
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,895
You know like it's

1029
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:39,455
It's such a distasteful thing

1030
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:41,247
You can see people not like

1031
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:44,831
Oh my God we're so scared of the information you're presenting it's just

1032
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,367
What the f*** is wrong with you

1033
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,159
That's what's going on

1034
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,183
Oh totally

1035
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,463
No the authority

1036
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:53,791
These weren't mad they were just annoyed that everybody else there was like

1037
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:54,815
If I could just

1038
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:56,607
Disgaea

1039
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:59,935
F****** do it if there was an element of Madness

1040
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,239
Totally worn

1041
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,007
Rented because

1042
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:05,311
Functionally what his disrupting of

1043
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,079
Press conference

1044
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,103
Is doing is making

1045
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,127
More difficult

1046
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,663
For the official

1047
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:11,967
To communicate with the public

1048
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,503
When providing that

1049
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,527
Information

1050
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:15,807
Essential piece

1051
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,599
Trying to make people feel

1052
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,671
Trying to navigate this really difficult

1053
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,439
Circle.

1054
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,487
Dysfunctional

1055
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,255
The effect

1056
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:26,559
Albarradas action is actually

1057
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,583
Impeding their ability

1058
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,351
B2

1059
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,631
The governor

1060
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:30,911
Appropriately

1061
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:35,519
He's walking in there with the express purpose of exploiting a tragedy at

1062
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:37,311
Expense of everyone else there

1063
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:41,919
Got it

1064
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:45,503
She starts being a real s*** head

1065
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,783
Proud of him back right

1066
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,111
Doesn't really have much to do with anything

1067
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:50,879
Sing boats

1068
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:51,903
But sexist

1069
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,671
I'm confused

1070
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,047
Brown

1071
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,175
Hey man

1072
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,711
What are you doing

1073
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:50,527
What problem is that somebody is

1074
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,879
It might be you think we're like you back

1075
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:55,903
Get stolen

1076
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:58,207
Don't have to just be about it

1077
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,231
Fear of terrorism

1078
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,023
No I was I was

1079
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,303
What is trying to get on a flight

1080
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:06,399
And I made it through security and made it through everything I got about

1081
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,447
4 steps away from standing on the plane

1082
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:10,239
When I realized that I had

1083
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,263
Forgotten my bag

1084
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:13,055
Horsehead left them in there

1085
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:16,127
So I ran back through the whole f****** place

1086
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:19,455
Screaming just like you know how I am

1087
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:21,759
That doesn't really help

1088
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,295
Situation

1089
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:29,695
But in this one it did because everybody was so confused and shocked by it that they just let me grab my bag and I get my

1090
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,463
Right back on there

1091
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:34,047
But I would have been much happier if somebody was like hey you forgot your bag

1092
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:34,815
Covid-19

1093
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,863
I mean like obviously for

1094
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,655
Very clear reason

1095
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:39,935
Airport shuttle

1096
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:45,055
Policy that unattended baggage is treated as suspicious

1097
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:47,871
Don't really don't f*** around with them and send them back

1098
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:48,639
Can't

1099
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:51,199
Is an airline or an airport

1100
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:51,967
Risk

1101
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:55,295
Not treating unattended bags

1102
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:56,575
Exactly cuz

1103
00:56:56,831 --> 00:57:00,671
Legal ramifications of the lawsuit that would come out of that

1104
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,207
I'm almost,

1105
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,487
It's so

1106
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:05,791
Someone saying like hey

1107
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,583
Your ear leaving your bag here

1108
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,375
Someone might come and take it

1109
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,655
From the airlines

1110
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:12,447
The airport might take it

1111
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:14,751
Because they can't leave it on a kazoo

1112
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:17,311
This is so weird he's actually describing

1113
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,079
Courtesy

1114
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:21,407
100% is mad about it

1115
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:25,247
Complained that somehow he is mad because women are quote on quote

1116
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:27,039
More congenial

1117
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:30,367
And that but that's just in Stockholm Syndrome

1118
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:32,159
Yeah but also

1119
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,207
To the Salt Lick

1120
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,999
At the Austin-Bergstrom Airport

1121
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:40,351
So cool that you could get barbecue at the airport and it's not bad

1122
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,375
Pretty good

1123
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:44,447
I got it last time I was flying back from Austin

1124
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:47,007
My web for the Depo

1125
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:50,847
I'll probably I'll probably be back before too long. Visit my parents

1126
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,639
It's more I will get

1127
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:54,431
Get salt lick

1128
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:56,991
Reason not to was thinking about ordering a bottle of the sauce

1129
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:57,759
Spell

1130
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,551
I was going to say they don't deliver the

1131
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:02,111
No but you can order it

1132
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:07,231
All right but it only comes in like a gift pack has problems with next travel

1133
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:11,071
Anyway story about how

1134
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:12,863
Him and his buddies are all oppressed

1135
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:40,767
Yeah

1136
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:44,095
Court-martial regular people

1137
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,695
So now it says psyops group

1138
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:12,255
Gave him this information

1139
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,791
I take his sourcing

1140
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:14,815
That seriously

1141
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:15,839
Who does not at all

1142
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:19,679
Extreme but for what it's worth

1143
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:23,007
Can actually find a number of stories about this on Fox watch

1144
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:23,775
What's the time

1145
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,055
And even some more like

1146
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:25,823
Even less

1147
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,615
Credible right-wing sources

1148
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:31,967
Then they report on this alleged meeting at Fort Hood

1149
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:32,991
They can't donate to

1150
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:35,039
Tea parties are Evangelical Christians

1151
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,343
Problem is it after these claim

1152
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,879
James came up an internal investigation

1153
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:41,183
Began at Fort Hood

1154
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:44,767
The outcome of the investigation wouldn't

1155
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:49,887
Be known until October 2013 though it by that point Alexander's weirdo friends

1156
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:51,167
Lots of free time to run with this

1157
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,447
Completely fake story

1158
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:54,495
Which was accepted as Truth by the audience

1159
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:57,055
Who cares the truth is come out

1160
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:59,615
Where's year in February 2014 Bukhara

1161
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:02,175
Do fake version is still true on Infowars

1162
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:02,943
He's got it

1163
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:03,711
You know

1164
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:05,759
It started

1165
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:08,575
Once once the cement

1166
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:11,903
Dried before the investigation came out it was all over

1167
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,695
Nothing you can do

1168
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:14,975
I like

1169
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:15,743
Goes to sumco

1170
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:17,535
He wants to make calls from

1171
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,559
Military

1172
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,327
Police

1173
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:20,607
He wants to know about

1174
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:25,983
Drills his drills are we are all being run to demonize the papers right

1175
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:28,031
Call from one guy anyone

1176
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,311
No like

1177
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:31,103
Hey man you ever ever do one of

1178
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:34,175
Please grills and obviously the answer is supposed to be yes

1179
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,455
Of course the answers

1180
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:36,479
Oh

1181
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:56,959
Company

1182
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,983
Coming from

1183
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:01,311
They're doing a video for

1184
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,591
West Point

1185
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:13,087
National Guard base

1186
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,879
10 minutes from my house

1187
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,415
Where might unit used to be at

1188
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,583
And we go out there and

1189
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:28,191
Videos of us kicking outdoors and all that other stuff

1190
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:38,175
Anime

1191
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:52,767
So you see the way that Alex has to Pivot cuz the answer is no

1192
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:55,071
And the guy is describing

1193
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,607
Completely but not

1194
01:01:56,863 --> 01:02:03,007
Very boring story on top of that it's more boring than Alex is like oh my God I went out to 1

1195
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,055
They're trying to kill Bocephus

1196
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,199
You mean like

1197
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,223
No we did

1198
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,527
Videos one-time concern

1199
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:20,927
Twitter doing this this this training exercise right

1200
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:24,767
Already friends came over and all my God all hell broke loose

1201
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:26,303
You know I tried to fake fight

1202
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:29,375
Hank Williams jr. for a while. Right

1203
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:36,031
Did you get any heat like advertisements tattoo specialist

1204
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:36,799
His fighting style

1205
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,079
I wanted to make sure that I was

1206
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:38,847
Prepared for it

1207
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,127
Amazing left

1208
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:45,503
So Alex has some information

1209
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,807
Or I should say

1210
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:48,575
He has

1211
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:51,903
Flames of information

1212
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:35,679
Oh man that's not that Alex get offended if we prove that the killing of Bin Laden was fake and even as the name of the body double that use but Weebly

1213
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:39,007
Isn't actually able to produce that evidence and never says the body doubles and

1214
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:40,287
It would be weird not

1215
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,311
How to say the body doubles

1216
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,335
Sure

1217
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:47,199
This is a part of one of Alex's big strategies that he uses to protect that he has more information than he actually does

1218
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:51,551
It's very exciting to think that Alex knows this body doubles name but it's

1219
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:54,367
It's only exciting as long as he doesn't say the name

1220
01:03:55,135 --> 01:04:00,255
As long as that stays the status quo it's entirely believable that Alex does have that information

1221
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,815
You can't prove it or disprove it if Alex

1222
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:05,631
Doesn't say anything concrete

1223
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:07,935
Actually I do know who the body double who's that

1224
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,215
Saddam Hussein

1225
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:14,591
Thing now where they the last one they assassinate they just hang onto and then

1226
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:15,615
Until the next one then

1227
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:16,383
Assassinate

1228
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:19,199
The timeline is but when was Kadafi

1229
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,135
Haha

1230
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:32,255
I was trying to remember who starred in the movie body double

1231
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:34,815
So desperately

1232
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:40,191
My brain just couldn't told Melanie Griffith

1233
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,471
So

1234
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:45,055
Fuck12 Alex says the name that he's a legend

1235
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,383
The Mystique

1236
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:51,455
I know this name goes away

1237
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:54,015
Saying the name is going to lead to the claim being

1238
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:57,599
Going to be a little disappointing

1239
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:59,647
When is saying that you know the name Bryce

1240
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:00,671
You can't say that

1241
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:07,071
Which is actually counter to all of Alex's Notions about secret information

1242
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,983
Also stupid

1243
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:19,615
Such a charade I don't want to make this family feel bad

1244
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:21,407
That's why I can't

1245
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,943
You wouldn't want that.

1246
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:27,807
So Alex is talking about this the faking over the killing of Bin Laden

1247
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:28,831
And this leads him

1248
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:30,111
Into

1249
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,391
Nothing but other things

1250
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,159
Things are fake

1251
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:34,207
Comes up

1252
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,367
That's pretty funny

1253
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:03,647
Because

1254
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:05,951
In the first episode that we covered

1255
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:07,743
Mark asked Alex

1256
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:09,279
Facts about this Bloomberg

1257
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:17,215
Tell Alex that I don't know but I could definitely find you the source of the second deposition

1258
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:22,847
Said you were going to find that Source doesn't

1259
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:26,943
But yeah I think it I think interesting presentation here because

1260
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,223
Is it playing that sort of

1261
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:28,991
Mid

1262
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:30,527
Game here where he's not

1263
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:32,575
Overtly denying

1264
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:33,599
All of the day

1265
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,391
What you would do later

1266
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:36,671
Would jump Whole Hog

1267
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:41,279
Point he is still saying that the people who put out

1268
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:44,863
The story and by that means people like Robbie Parker

1269
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:52,287
I don't I don't know if he would be including Posner in that but maybe

1270
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:55,359
Speaking on this of being actors

1271
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,383
Which is

1272
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:57,919
A problem

1273
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:58,687
Exactly

1274
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:02,527
Estranged

1275
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:04,063
Hybrid of

1276
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:06,367
A full-on denialism

1277
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,391
And

1278
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,671
I am playing it

1279
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:12,255
Yeah it's like not understanding that you would like

1280
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:15,071
I see I'm covering my ass

1281
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:16,351
But with like

1282
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,911
I'm empty like outline of Ally

1283
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:23,263
Well you're not like that's not really covering your ass you realize that because it's not respecting the Imp

1284
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:29,151
Application still doing the thing if you're saying that the parents

1285
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:30,175
Of the

1286
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:31,199
What killed children

1287
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:34,271
Who are the ones who are speaking out about this

1288
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,551
Are actors

1289
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,367
The implication of that is

1290
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:40,927
Their kids didn't actually die

1291
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,719
Yeah because otherwise

1292
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:44,255
What what are you saying

1293
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:50,399
Doesn't make sense non Middle Ground area you can't be like

1294
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,167
Listen

1295
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,703
I know the Holocaust

1296
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:58,591
But most of it was true and only some of it wasn't know you're still a holocaust denier now

1297
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,895
It's very strange

1298
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:01,663
To see this

1299
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,431
Perspective

1300
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:04,223
I don't really understand why he would

1301
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:06,527
This middle

1302
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:07,551
Ground

1303
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:09,855
So weird

1304
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:10,623
The caller saying

1305
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,391
Some dumb

1306
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:21,631
No I don't know

1307
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:22,911
Time now

1308
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:26,751
Was today are gearing up

1309
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,287
The Masons

1310
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:31,359
I live in a small town to Mason's have been having

1311
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,127
Mediums

1312
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:33,407
Quite frequently

1313
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:34,687
Wisconsin

1314
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,967
All the major roadways

1315
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,039
The overpass

1316
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:41,599
Barricades

1317
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:44,927
Oh I know the one

1318
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:53,631
Are The Masons the ones who put all the gates upon her probably not

1319
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:54,655
Well

1320
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:59,519
I mean literally it involves masonry I was going to say probably had something

1321
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:02,847
Thing to do with it I just think it's funny to look at this in a match

1322
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:03,615
Enterprise

1323
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,175
Are active

1324
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:07,455
They're all out there

1325
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,759
Did the wave that ever

1326
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:11,551
Everything has spiralled from

1327
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,831
Episode of classical

1328
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:16,671
Conspiracy tropes

1329
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,439
Tickets

1330
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:22,559
2014 might have a caller who's worried about what the Masons are up to that was fun

1331
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:23,839
That was more fun

1332
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:29,727
The Masons are the ones putting styrofoam cups in the overpasses overhead to s*** to spell out

1333
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,263
Secret evil messages

1334
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,031
Like

1335
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:33,311
Geaux tigers

1336
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:39,711
Doesn't get more evil than that

1337
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,247
I thought you know

1338
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:45,599
So here's a dumb prediction that Alex made that goes in the laundry list of

1339
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:46,879
Bad predictions

1340
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:29,119
Horrible

1341
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:43,967
It's so stupid like look at the conception Alex has here

1342
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:44,991
Close to happening

1343
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:50,367
This was recorded eight years ago and none of the stuff that Alex is claiming it's all part of the globalist

1344
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:53,951
Plans they have a plan none of its come to pass

1345
01:10:54,463 --> 01:11:00,095
There's been no gun confiscation there's been no need for Patriots to resist turning in their gun open no Civil War in

1346
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:01,631
Inside it over gun confiscation

1347
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:04,447
Also look at this s*** that Alex is unraveling is

1348
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:05,983
The grand plan of the global

1349
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:08,287
If grounded in reality

1350
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,311
To the point where inanna

1351
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,079
Insane person

1352
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:11,103
We could buy into

1353
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:12,895
They're really rich

1354
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:14,175
Bad people have committed

1355
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:17,503
Financial crimes and they don't want to get in trouble for them

1356
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:18,527
So they're engaging in

1357
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:20,063
Comically elaborate plot

1358
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,087
The cover their tracks

1359
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:22,879
This is dumb

1360
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:24,671
If only because of Civil War it almost

1361
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:28,511
Immediately wipe out whatever Financial games these people made by way of their crimes

1362
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,047
But you can see this as a

1363
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:31,839
Activstyle conspiracy

1364
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:35,423
There's no Supernatural elements there's no devil working by me

1365
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,703
Racines there's no prosthetic

1366
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:41,055
Vision is a battle between good and evil where the goal is ascending to the Stars

1367
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:43,615
This is about using half cooked ideas

1368
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:44,383
What's the defendant

1369
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:46,687
Active political ideology that

1370
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:47,455
Push

1371
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:52,319
This is my good Mason caller and seem so foreign to Oz present-day content wherever

1372
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:53,087
Demon

1373
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:56,159
You know everyone who disagrees with them is a pedophile

1374
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:58,463
It's bizarre it's quick it's

1375
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,231
Quick

1376
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:02,559
Yeah but

1377
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:05,119
You know a lot of people's brains have just been f***

1378
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:05,887
Unbroken by

1379
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:10,239
Man I think I think we're at the point now where we

1380
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:11,775
Did you know

1381
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:14,335
Like that any number of people who have

1382
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,615
Previously had at least

1383
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:18,431
Somewhat rational stances are now

1384
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:19,199
Out now

1385
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:19,967
Long gone

1386
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:23,039
I understand that a lot of people have been

1387
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:26,623
Maybe by degrees or maybe by

1388
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,903
Leaps and Bounds

1389
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:30,719
I got into areas that are really a rash on

1390
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:31,487
I understand

1391
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,279
I think it's a little different

1392
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:35,839
Thunderstruck

1393
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:38,399
I don't know

1394
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,423
On the other hand

1395
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:43,519
Do you know when your brains already that broken what happens whenever it breaks again

1396
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,823
Keep scared he's gotten weird

1397
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:48,639
It hasn't fixed him like a like it would be

1398
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:50,687
Great if the worst thing that

1399
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,991
Listen to human beings while we're alive

1400
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:54,783
Would have been like a f******

1401
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:57,599
Frying pan to the forehead in a cartoon and

1402
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:58,623
Wake up and be like

1403
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,647
Holyshit

1404
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:05,023
It time to fix I can finally say you know like that kind of fit El kabong absolutely

1405
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:10,911
Just got weirder

1406
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:13,727
Speaking of weird

1407
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,167
Around

1408
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:46,239
Oh man what an amazing prediction David Icke totally made with

1409
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:47,519
Totally came true

1410
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,055
Whatever

1411
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:53,919
So weird I also to see that the Great Awakening is happening in full force in 2014

1412
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:57,503
Currently in 2022 yelling about of the great awake

1413
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:58,783
Meaning of beginning and response

1414
01:13:59,039 --> 01:13:59,551
The covid-19

1415
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:02,879
Almost like the idea of a Great Awakening happening is just

1416
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:05,951
The consistent element of people like Alex and David Icke Brandon

1417
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:10,815
And it's so vague of an idea that it can just be trotted out whenever you want to create the image

1418
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,351
Is it your side to secretly winning

1419
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:16,959
Really cool stuff and not at all the sign of s*** head manipulator

1420
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:19,775
I think there's a real

1421
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:20,543
Like

1422
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:21,311
Solid

1423
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:22,847
Narrative Arc

1424
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,895
That could be made out of

1425
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:25,663
Just

1426
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:26,943
Alex is David Icke

1427
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,479
Like throughout his

1428
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:30,271
Is career like there's a real

1429
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:31,551
I think there's some pesos

1430
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:37,951
I doubt it

1431
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:40,767
I'm literally just having him on when he didn't like

1432
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:41,535
Sure

1433
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:47,167
That's true do intros Jazz know to make it out of just his it's like overall

1434
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:51,519
Look I do think there is a real downward trajectory that you can see if Alex being like

1435
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:54,847
I have to differentiate myself from this guy who's clearly insane

1436
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:55,615
To being like

1437
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:59,711
F*** it he's got a big audience over to warm up to him

1438
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:01,503
Essence by being like wild

1439
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:03,295
Something

1440
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,831
And then I'll find you like I've

1441
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:06,623
Just going to steal wholesale most of it

1442
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:12,511
100% it is like a one of those XY graph memes where it's

1443
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:14,559
Just slowly all the way

1444
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:16,863
Yelp brutal

1445
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:19,167
What an a******

1446
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:19,935
Paddock

1447
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:23,775
There's a dumb story that Alex is reporting

1448
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:58,079
So that isn't Holdren's book ecoscience

1449
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:00,383
Documents proving AZ

1450
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:04,735
In the water to make people dumb

1451
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:08,319
How to make that up because he knows his textbook

1452
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,343
To check up on his claim

1453
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:11,903
Introduction of Nephilim skulls

1454
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,671
Oh that's pretty

1455
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:13,439
Exciting

1456
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:18,815
What's going on here is that UFO conspiracy message boards have been circulating images of

1457
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:20,351
These skulls that were founded

1458
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:22,143
The perrakis region in Peru

1459
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:25,215
I just making up the DNA testing it but do not

1460
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:26,495
And show that they weren't

1461
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:29,311
Ral that mean the first one was recovered by India

1462
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,847
It's true

1463
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:34,943
Just accepted the claims of the DNA testing inside

1464
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,223
The face value like Alec

1465
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:39,807
Because the skulls were elongated and slightly conical in

1466
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:40,575
Nature

1467
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:41,599
It's made them look

1468
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:42,367
Possibly alien

1469
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:43,647
In the real world

1470
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:47,743
The Stalls at that appearance because they were from members of a community to practice artificial

1471
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:49,023
Cranial deformation

1472
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:51,839
This is achieved by exerting force on a child

1473
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:53,375
Skull before it's fully hardens

1474
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:55,679
There's a number of theories as to why people did this

1475
01:16:56,191 --> 01:17:00,287
Ranging from ideas about beauty to the promotion of in group in group cohesion

1476
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:05,151
Whatever the motivation what's going on here is that Alex awesome meme that may take

1477
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:05,919
Completely fake

1478
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:08,479
Reclaim the DNA testing if it done to prove the

1479
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,247
Please call FedEx

1480
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,271
Depressed

1481
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:12,063
But he did literally no work

1482
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:15,391
Past that point to before turning it around and repeating it to his audiences

1483
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:17,439
Fact that things are going crazy

1484
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:20,255
And not only that you seem to be implying that the ACT

1485
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,279
Accepting

1486
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:23,071
The skulls are alien Nephilim

1487
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:25,119
It's somehow a sign of being awake

1488
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,399
Just pathetic

1489
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:28,447
Hopefully David Icke sets

1490
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:29,727
I'm straight on some of this stuff

1491
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:34,079
I like I like the idea that there are times

1492
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,103
Whatever

1493
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,895
Conspiracy and reality

1494
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:38,943
Can just be so far apart like

1495
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:40,223
Here's how far to particle

1496
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:41,503
They could be alien

1497
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:44,063
They could be Nephilim from the Bible

1498
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:44,831
Or

1499
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:46,367
It could have been some people a while back

1500
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,647
Who just thought it looked hot

1501
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:50,975
Can I can I carry simple explanation I give you a quick correction

1502
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:52,511
The Nephilim

1503
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:54,047
Still kind of be alien

1504
01:17:54,559 --> 01:18:00,703
Because they're The Offspring of demons and human women

1505
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:03,007
You have to accept it

1506
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:06,079
I hate to be a nitpicker but

1507
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:08,127
Where am I

1508
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:10,175
We're talkin here a little bit about

1509
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:12,991
The trajectory of Alex's relationship with David Icke

1510
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:14,015
I think

1511
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:14,783
Western Hills

1512
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:15,807
Episode

1513
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:18,367
It becomes painfully clear that like right

1514
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:20,671
Alex isn't really talking about demon so much

1515
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:21,951
Penne pasta

1516
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,743
Episodes

1517
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,023
Well a little bit

1518
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:26,559
But also David

1519
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:27,583
Is

1520
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:28,607
Bo en

1521
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:31,679
Future Alex

1522
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:43,967
Very very important

1523
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:15,199
It's not just

1524
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:19,039
Really rich people who want to cover up their financial scams by

1525
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:21,087
Taking away guns in order to prompt

1526
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:24,415
Gun owners to start shooting at them and then cause a civil war

1527
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:27,487
And I won't forget about the financial crimes there's on seeing demons

1528
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:29,023
Gene's and arcade

1529
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:30,559
This is this is

1530
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:34,143
The point at Alex's

1531
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:37,215
I want to play with next with really good for you respond because

1532
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:40,031
Alex isn't really fully like

1533
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:45,407
Fuckerrbody is making it okay for the audience to entertain these ideas

1534
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:27,136
That's not why you had to leave that town

1535
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,928
Yeah you didn't you can kind of see this like

1536
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:33,280
Narrative even if you don't believe

1537
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:39,680
NikeiD

1538
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:41,472
However you got to get there man you get

1539
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:44,544
Really pretty looking for greasing the skids

1540
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,360
In order for people to get down down

1541
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:48,128
Into this

1542
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:49,664
The same time

1543
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,456
Trying to pretend that like

1544
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:52,224
Hey

1545
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,528
I'm not the one saying there's demons

1546
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:55,552
Cuz then it looks really

1547
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:57,856
I'll wait a few years and then I'll do it

1548
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:59,904
You know I think it's so weird

1549
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,184
And funny in like

1550
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:01,952
Kind of strain

1551
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:02,720
Change that

1552
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:06,048
These these types of people one of their

1553
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:07,328
Look

1554
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,632
There have been things like this that are pops

1555
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:11,168
Japan ever human civilization

1556
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:13,216
That means that humans must have

1557
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:15,264
Contact with it somewhere in our

1558
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:20,128
Memories or something along those lines doesn't make sense to be able to just be like

1559
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:20,896
No

1560
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:22,944
S*** heads like Alex Jones

1561
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,248
David Icke and those people have been around

1562
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,784
Since the very beginning

1563
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:27,552
Claiming

1564
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:30,368
Demons are the reason behind all of your

1565
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:33,184
There aren't there out there is a lot of that

1566
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:33,952
Yeah

1567
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:37,792
These assholes have been there since the Jumpman

1568
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:38,816
Even even

1569
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:39,584
So

1570
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:46,240
The ones in the present-day are misrepresenting a lot of stuff

1571
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:50,080
About the shipment from the past

1572
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:52,896
Both hats

1573
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:53,920
Are dumb

1574
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:55,968
It is like we haven't it said we'd

1575
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:57,248
Did we went backwards

1576
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:59,296
In learning about things

1577
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:01,856
So how much do you know about brainwave frequency

1578
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:02,880
I know there's

1579
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:03,904
Three there's

1580
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:04,672
Down and left

1581
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:05,952
That's correct

1582
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:36,672
Peeling

1583
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:49,728
Smartphone

1584
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:54,336
Really scary because I think that the human brain waves

1585
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:58,432
Frequencies are just like radio stations brain is on 106

1586
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:01,760
6.1 and if the government has broadcast something on that frequency

1587
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:03,296
Brain control

1588
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,576
Some problem

1589
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:06,368
So this idea just starting from a function

1590
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:07,136
Perspective

1591
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:12,256
Human brains are on the same frequency or is it different for each

1592
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,024
Person

1593
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:17,120
It's different for each person that I don't know if there's that many frequency bands

1594
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:18,400
Quite frankly

1595
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,936
You just get smaller and smaller number

1596
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:21,984
But if we're all the same

1597
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,032
Really be impossible to find to Minecon

1598
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:25,568
Control

1599
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:28,128
Population-level brainwashing with us

1600
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:30,688
Washington

1601
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:32,224
Scam write your plans

1602
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:34,016
They probably need all I got

1603
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:35,808
Metallic moldable hat

1604
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:41,184
Aluminum people you got a plan for failure or a back

1605
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,208
Fire on some

1606
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:49,120
Absolutely

1607
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:52,960
Completely misunderstanding what brain waves are

1608
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:59,616
Your brain doesn't have a set frequency that it operates at necessarily know that never changes quite a bit

1609
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:00,384
State you're in

1610
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:01,664
Princeton's

1611
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,224
He's working at about 524 hurt

1612
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,504
Works when you're asleep

1613
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,528
Delta waves

1614
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:10,624
Where is the state of high concentration your brain might be in Campbell

1615
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,904
Is it over 35 hurt

1616
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:14,720
So just really stupid I don't even know what he saying

1617
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:16,000
Conceptually

1618
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:17,792
It doesn't even

1619
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:21,120
About Alpha Beta gamma waves

1620
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:22,400
He doesn't give a s***

1621
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:25,216
No he just thinks that there is this

1622
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:28,288
Number

1623
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,592
Tuna to the right thing

1624
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:33,408
David Icke

1625
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:36,480
Should have like any any sufficiently

1626
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:38,528
Miss understandable technology is

1627
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:39,552
Is the same as demons

1628
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:41,344
I like you should just make it up

1629
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:43,392
Makeup his anti-sagging

1630
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:46,464
Quote urgency archon

1631
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,536
Is not fame and it was a

1632
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,352
I'm so mad that we can't continue this week

1633
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:55,936
Hell I remember the name of the guy who said

1634
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,240
Carl Sagan wrote the

1635
01:24:58,496 --> 01:24:59,264
The demon Haunted World

1636
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:05,408
Who said any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from Magic

1637
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:08,736
Are they see Clark thank you thank you

1638
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:09,760
Carchex

1639
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,856
Really strange thing the David I can Alex

1640
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:14,880
Into

1641
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:17,696
And it's really contrary to anything

1642
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:19,232
That we would know from the Press

1643
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:21,024
And that is that

1644
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,048
Hollywood

1645
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:23,584
Maybe not

1646
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:25,120
Is bad

1647
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:05,312
Mandela effect

1648
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:10,688
I thought that The Nut Job came out much more recently

1649
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:12,992
I don't know why but I had to

1650
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:14,784
Except my mind is like 2019

1651
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:15,552
Or something

1652
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:17,088
14

1653
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:20,672
Wow The Nut Job Lego movies old now man

1654
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:22,976
That's I was just thinking that like

1655
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:23,744
Wow

1656
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:24,768
The Lego Movie

1657
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,560
Government-run propagate

1658
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:30,400
And it's been so long since I thought that about a movie

1659
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:32,448
And it turns out it's The Lego Movie

1660
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:33,216
Proof

1661
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:35,520
Hollywood

1662
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:37,056
There is a revolution going

1663
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:38,336
It's very exciting

1664
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:40,384
What's Guardians of the Galaxy come out yet

1665
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:47,296
It has in 2014 we look it up

1666
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:52,160
You son-of-a-b**** opened opposite

1667
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:59,840
People like you

1668
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:00,864
Stop eating

1669
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:05,472
I'm not sure what year that was

1670
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:07,008
It was fairly close to that

1671
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:11,360
Alex is not in Guardians of the Galaxy that was

1672
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:13,152
The lie but that would have

1673
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:13,920
Probably Boniva

1674
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:14,688
Even further proof

1675
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:15,712
But Hollywood is waking up

1676
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:17,504
If a wood cast Alex's

1677
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,040
The hero

1678
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:20,064
Snapchat I was thinking

1679
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,136
Apparently a Hollywood

1680
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:23,904
Pretty good

1681
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:05,120
Word

1682
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:13,824
I really bad news for Alex about

1683
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,128
Where he's going to be in a few years about Hollywood

1684
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:18,432
Revolutions

1685
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:19,456
Did not

1686
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:20,224
Go

1687
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,272
Who is who who does he think

1688
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,040
Isn't

1689
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:24,064
Let it like

1690
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:30,464
Listening to Infowars who's leading the underground resistance against the rest of Hollywood on the Red Sox

1691
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:37,632
Pretty specific polana Elkins Park

1692
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:38,656
What was it

1693
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:40,448
Sumner redstone bitbox

1694
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:45,568
I don't f****** know anyways no studiosystem

1695
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:46,848
Makeda still around

1696
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,408
He probably was

1697
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,176
Not

1698
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:55,040
Obviously something that is

1699
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:58,368
Very clearly specific that I was just talking about

1700
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,672
But I I just got no idea

1701
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,464
Summer Redstone is vile

1702
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:04,768
He was in charge of

1703
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:08,608
See if maybe Ted Nugent the show

1704
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:13,728
Who are the other stars that talked to Alex

1705
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,520
Clint Eastwood

1706
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:19,616
Peter Stormare

1707
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:24,480
I need this musician

1708
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:25,504
Tertiary

1709
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,552
Seamless

1710
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:29,344
Yeah he said that he

1711
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,392
You said that Martin Sheen and Charlie schmelzer

1712
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:36,768
Bowser for sure Bowser Bowser

1713
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:38,560
The highest of the highest music

1714
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:44,192
Unfortunately Rowdy Roddy Piper did come on

1715
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:45,984
Yeah but he was in they live so we get to

1716
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:48,544
Also Val venis

1717
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,080
The wrestler Val venis

1718
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:52,896
She did an interview with David on D1 time really

1719
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:59,296
Was it about how one time they had a storyline where Japanese people were going to

1720
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:04,928
I didn't come up that's the only thing that I will ever be able to think about any time you say his name

1721
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:07,744
Do an episode about that I did that one with Marty

1722
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,048
Covered

1723
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:11,584
Val venis

1724
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,864
Episode

1725
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,656
He's much better prepared to handle it then I will

1726
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:17,472
I don't believe that Alex

1727
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:18,240
Thanks

1728
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:23,104
That Hollywood is waking up so dumb

1729
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:24,896
So dumb

1730
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:26,432
So Alex

1731
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:28,736
Kind of wishy-washy a little bit about the devil

1732
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:40,000
What's the weather

1733
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:07,392
That is important

1734
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:48,096
Yeah man

1735
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,888
So the Illuminati

1736
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:53,984
That started in 1776 with Adam lights off

1737
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:54,752
The

1738
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:57,056
Books from Alexandria which was

1739
01:31:57,312 --> 01:31:59,104
Free 1776

1740
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:00,896
Wildly before 7

1741
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:01,664
87

1742
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,968
Caesar it was a long way back

1743
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:06,784
The pad for the patio

1744
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:09,600
The one thing Alex's right about is the

1745
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:11,136
Miss of the

1746
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:14,208
At Library of Alexandria burning and everything be lost

1747
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:16,512
That isn't fully after there was a fire

1748
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:19,584
It was after the point at which

1749
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,376
It was already kind of

1750
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:23,424
It would

1751
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:27,008
It was on the downswing of rellos

1752
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:29,568
But say in that sort of ancient world

1753
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:33,152
It was no longer the repository for all in all

1754
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:35,712
No but that idea is really fun

1755
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:41,856
Great what isn't it amazing to think of a repository for all human knowledge burning down yeah it's kind of gives

1756
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:46,208
Nice narrative reason why we don't know something's amiss.

1757
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:46,976
Sure

1758
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:49,024
That's fine

1759
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,560
I don't think of the globalist

1760
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:54,400
Stole all that secret information and now are able to come

1761
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:56,448
Control things because of it

1762
01:32:56,704 --> 01:33:00,288
Magic I also don't believe that the Atlantean set off an atomic bomb

1763
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:06,688
Even if someone has a passion for Atlantis like I do I

1764
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:07,456
Do not

1765
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:11,552
Much less was it destroyed by a nuclear bomb

1766
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:15,136
Said I think that the way Alex is describing

1767
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:16,416
The devil here is a bit more

1768
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:21,280
It's not a real physical being orator

1769
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:25,376
Transdimensional be Artful metaphorical way to

1770
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:26,656
Describe the people are fat

1771
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:28,192
Okay

1772
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:28,960
Bright

1773
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:30,240
You know what then

1774
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:35,104
Yeah it gets a little boring to just say that he's a metaphor man

1775
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:36,128
Got to start

1776
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,664
Spicing it up a little bit

1777
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:43,296
Meet on that devil phone now the devil's preparing to fight Hank Williams Junior

1778
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:47,648
So where's another gas

1779
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:51,232
New shows updated I cannot take this leave

1780
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:52,000
I was shocked

1781
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:14,016
I have to say

1782
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:20,672
That usually isn't true when Alex says he's not here to do a big infomercial usually is

1783
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:21,952
In this case he kind of what

1784
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:24,512
They did do a lot of talking about Alex

1785
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:25,536
His productivity was

1786
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:27,328
We are that there was another point

1787
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:30,656
Alright now we've talked about doctor group a bunch

1788
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:34,496
To the past and so we don't need to go into his entire dirty dossier here

1789
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:35,520
But

1790
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:38,080
The reason I was reading off all his credentials

1791
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:38,848
Just cuz they're all fake

1792
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:41,152
Where is that problem

1793
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,712
He does not have a lot of Gravitas

1794
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:45,760
Long resume full of fake

1795
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:46,528
Credentials

1796
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:48,576
Add to Breeze videos purchase

1797
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:49,600
EXO

1798
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:52,160
Alex probably doesn't to dwell on that too much

1799
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:54,720
You don't want to list I mean unless

1800
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:55,488
You are getting

1801
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:57,280
From the fakes

1802
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:58,048
Schools

1803
01:34:58,304 --> 01:35:04,448
Then you'd be like

1804
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:05,984
Is this degree degree

1805
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:10,336
Smiley smile infomercial but Alex does talk a little bit about vitality

1806
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:11,104
And

1807
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:12,896
Play I'm not sold on it

1808
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:14,944
Or the female ones

1809
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:18,528
For women

1810
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:20,064
Why are you yelling

1811
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:43,872
What

1812
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:53,088
Wow that is not a ringing endorsement for whatever this pill is

1813
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:55,648
Yeah I mean you're describing it like your inject

1814
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:59,232
Sing me with bull semen Lego s*** man I'm f*****

1815
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:03,328
I can't take this cuz I have anger issues

1816
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:08,192
Also I don't like the selling of this pill unlike know what the effects are unpredictable

1817
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:10,752
Hey what time is it Mellows me out

1818
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:12,032
I freak out

1819
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:18,432
It's entirely possible this is 100% of placebo and I am making this all up for my own benefit other

1820
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:23,808
Wise I would have to confront the fact that my products do nothing cuz it seems really strange that

1821
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:25,088
Does substitute have like

1822
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:26,112
Completely

1823
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:27,136
Contrary

1824
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:30,464
When people sell you a pill

1825
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:31,744
Drink or something

1826
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,792
And then you ask them what it does

1827
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:34,816
And then they're like

1828
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:35,584
What do you think

1829
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:37,376
I just agree with you

1830
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:40,448
It might it might doesn't

1831
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:45,568
Here's the reason the doctor group is on

1832
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:12,960
Knowing what I know about doctor group

1833
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:14,240
In the present day

1834
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:16,800
I would expect that one of these would-be drink your piss

1835
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:20,384
He's there

1836
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:21,152
He is big

1837
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:23,200
Get to urine therapy at 5

1838
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:26,528
You think that it might crack the top five

1839
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:27,296
His main job now

1840
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:28,064
Bright

1841
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:31,136
Spoiler alert

1842
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:34,464
Maybe use a different time

1843
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:37,280
Be a piss doctor maybe you should try and guess

1844
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:43,936
Wait but that's I mean that's five of them is one of them should be X

1845
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:45,472
It's not of course

1846
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:47,008
Of course

1847
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:50,080
The other one should be eating healthy

1848
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:52,384
Spoiler alert

1849
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:53,152
Okay

1850
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:55,712
Then the other three are probably fake bull

1851
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:58,528
Tried as f***

1852
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,832
Call Courtney

1853
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:18,496
Definition of clean water is dumb but the idea

1854
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:20,032
You should drink clean water is

1855
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:20,800
Right

1856
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:22,080
Obviously the most

1857
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:31,040
That seems easy advice is to drink distilled water with apple cider vinegar

1858
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:32,064
Well no

1859
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,856
But Clearwater Spa

1860
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:40,256
Yes I do also like I like the idea that he's supposed to be a doctor and it took him weeks of research.

1861
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:44,096
The number one thing is drinkwater

1862
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:47,168
Well that wasn't he knocked out today is the rest of them that were

1863
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:48,960
I'm not sure here's the second one

1864
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:58,688
Alright okay

1865
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:04,320
Actually I am

1866
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:06,624

1867
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:10,208
Happy birthday

1868
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,488
So

1869
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,352
40

1870
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:23,008
Spring chicken

1871
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:24,544
Stewie knocked out today

1872
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,824
Clean air

1873
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:28,128
For somebody who is

1874
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:30,176
Directly work

1875
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:30,944
With

1876
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:32,224
The man

1877
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:38,624
Maybe more vehemently trying to destroy our water and air

1878
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:42,976
Hey listen

1879
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:44,256
Drink clean water

1880
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:50,656
Obviously I'm working together with Alex to make sure it goes away we will destroy the EPA

1881
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:54,752
Obviously I'm working with Alex to make sure that there are no regulations

1882
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:58,592
You need to drink clean water and breathe clean air

1883
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:01,152
But we have a political set

1884
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:07,552
That will like policy set that want to make it intensely expensive for you to be able to

1885
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:12,928
To access clean water or clean air the United States

1886
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:14,720
Completely you're not going to get that s*** here

1887
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:16,256
And by the way

1888
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:17,536
Maybe nowhere because

1889
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:18,816
Air doesn't respect

1890
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:26,496
So while we take a little break e in the list of the top five healthy

1891
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,312
Because Alex wants to know about like a doctor

1892
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:30,080
Group

1893
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:31,104
Ed

1894
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:32,128
How'd you wake up

1895
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,920
What was your waking up story

1896
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:36,992
I bought it I thought Awakenings is such b*******

1897
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:49,280
No

1898
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:53,120
Now they're not

1899
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:17,696
Tell me how

1900
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:30,240
My God

1901
01:41:58,144 --> 01:41:59,680
None of that's true or real

1902
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:06,336
Doctor group may or may not have finished getting an undergraduate degree from Southern Louisiana University which doesn't

1903
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:07,872
The pre-med track for students

1904
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:08,640
The study

1905
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:10,176
Likely he really was

1906
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:11,968
Black on his way to becoming the heart

1907
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:14,528
Surgeon

1908
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:17,344
After this he went to Texas Chiropractic

1909
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,136
The college where you got a degree as a

1910
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:21,184
Recipes degrees are fake

1911
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:25,536
Degrees that he's paid for generally ones that are available

1912
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:26,816
Correspond

1913
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:32,448
Hey I'll give you a degree will send you a check

1914
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:34,496
In the Stephanie saying is really dangerous

1915
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:36,800
There's so many prescription medications that are

1916
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:39,360
Critically important for people dealing with a wide range

1917
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:40,128
The conditions

1918
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:42,176
Just because big Pharma is soda

1919
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:44,224
Detestable and because there are problems

1920
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:46,272
Doctors over-prescribing something

1921
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:47,296
That's not a Cause.

1922
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:49,344
Pretend that literally no medication dozen

1923
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,112
Anything

1924
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:52,928
This is a guy who wants you to drink piss

1925
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:57,792
And his mind drinking pass has more medicinal benefit that 80 prescription medication

1926
01:42:58,048 --> 01:42:58,816
Ever produce

1927
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:00,096
That's Alex's

1928
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:00,864
Expert

1929
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:02,400
I thought you do it

1930
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:04,192
I thought you do it right there

1931
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:05,728
Please try to resist the urge

1932
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:07,776
Do you like make fun of how somebody talk

The regional dialects are maligned and what have you

01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:13,664
There's a part of

1936
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:16,992
Doctor group that doesn't really sound like you know like a southern

1937
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:21,088
Person sounds like a surfer

1938
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,368
Idiot

1939
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:28,000
You realize that he is a piss doctor doesn't believe in medication

Therapy with that

1944
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:42,848
It is it is fun how

1945
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:44,128
Rehearsed his origin

1946
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:44,896
In speeches

1947
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:45,920
You know like

1948
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:50,528
This happened to me I went to when I was doing the hearing anything

1949
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:56,416
Dude Bill Austin I think his name is the dude who a little Bill also

1950
01:43:56,672 --> 01:43:57,952
Created Starkey or whatever

1951
01:43:58,208 --> 01:43:58,720
He was doing this

1952
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:02,816
This whole big ass like corporate speech about this origin story

1953
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:05,120
And you can hear it in that tone of like

1954
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:06,656
Oh this is all

1955
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:09,984

1956
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:11,776
I made I made this company

1957
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:15,360
Cuz I wanted to make a s*** ton of money and Alex you are helping me make money

1958
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:18,944
I saw a problem with the market

1959
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:25,600
Only my irecognize that I really didn't have the chops to be a real doctor

1960
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:28,672
I figured out that there's a

Antique Market in supplements play Leon regulated chiropractor

1962

Do you know how

1963
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:39,168
Long it takes

1964
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:41,984
To become a medical doctor and how much work it is

1965
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:42,752
Yeah and how

1966
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:44,288
You probably wouldn't pass

1967
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,848
If you tried to write a paper on how medications

1968
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:48,384
Don't do anything holy

1969
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,152
Probably

1970
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:55,552
Vail and you'd be really in trouble if you started describing this product that you wanted that maybe had enough

1971

Saran Wrap in the real world brookford now,

2010
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:26,496
Well unfortunately the people who killed him made his mom sign papers and then put all of it under wraps

Followable steps

2059
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,024

Fine

2066
01:51:07,264 --> 01:51:09,056
But like obviously they like

2067
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:11,104
The eat clean food

2068
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:11,872

Piss is not

2077
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:43,872
You might you might be onto something I think

2078
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:47,712
You could make the lateral move to piss no problem

2079
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:52,832
So you know you got to drink distilled water with apple cider vinegar but the

2080
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:53,856
The key is to make it like

2081
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:54,880
Body temperature

2082
01:51:55,136 --> 01:52:00,000
You know what you know what I found out I was I was looking at the toilet the other day and I was drinking

2083
01:52:00,256 --> 01:52:04,608
Nice tall glass of distilled water with apple cider vinegar in it and I thought

2084
01:52:05,376 --> 01:52:07,680
I could pour one of these into the other and no one would know

2085
01:52:08,192 --> 01:52:11,008
I don't want to gross anybody out like

2086
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:13,056
