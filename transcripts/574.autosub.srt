00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,608
Jordan

7
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,496
What's up

8
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:19,872
I was going to do laundry I went down to the laundry room and watch it fly past me but I think

9
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,152
I thought it was a bat

10
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,200
Rights is pretty early in the morning I was like

11
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,600
It's in a basement got to go down to set of stairs just fact

12
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,368
Bat

13
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,232
I looked a little birds nesting underneath the staircase

14
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:40,352
I remember seeing that like a year ago is when they was really delightful

15
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:44,448
I don't know if I brought to mind feelings about you know

16
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,336
Pandemic waning a gas a little bit or like returning to a little bit more of normalcy

17
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,992
I ended the birds are in on it too

18
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,528
Birds

19
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,000
Clearly different bird I got to know these birds pretty well these are different

20
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:14,656
Are there be nice if you had like a whole intergenerational things starting and in the laundry room I don't think generator

21
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,960
Visions of birds last a year

22
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,496
I don't

23
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,592

24
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,360

35
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,608
Jerk what is on now

36
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,144
It seems almost like we're obligated

37
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,496
I'm not

38
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:33,504
I am not good at acting or playing along with things

39
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,552
Thank you great

40
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:41,952
A compliment wasn't beautiful

41
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,256
Snake episode where in Pasay

42
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,792
We're talking about May

43
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:46,816
28

44
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,096
And 29th

45
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
2000

46
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,144
Okay

47
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,216
I was I was I didn't know what

48
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
Going back to this because

49
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:59,104
* a little confusing the last time we went back to the past

50
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
I found it to be a little bit

51
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:07,040
And I was little bit worried like I don't feel like there's any progress that I know are actually

52
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,904
But today we we we

53
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,696
Business picks up a little bit

54
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,512
And I'm very excited about a couple of things that happen

55
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,815
But have nothing to do with how important

56
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
Like

57
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,863
Stories from 2003

58
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,655
Nothing to do with that

59
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:26,495
But there's one caller in particular that blew my mind

60
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,031
And I spent

61
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,823
A couple hours researching this call

62
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,103
And I'm very excited

63
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
Let's talk about it

64
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,151
I will get to that

65
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
Before we do

66
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,943
Jordan

67
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,991
We got a little moments say thank you

68
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,527
2 as opposed to signed up

69
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,575
And our new Wonka

00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:44,927
Dave it's good ideas be vamping while I pulled up my sheet

Mcfucking gauge

00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:54,399
Anna Kelso

73

74
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,615

00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,639

Thank you

80
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
It is time to get deep

81
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,047
Giving someone life is giving someone dead

82
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
You can say that

83
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,727
Life is good

84
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
You could

85
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,031
It's true

86
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,311
Happy birthday

I think it's gorrell

91
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,735
Goral

92
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:47,647
It's either this is one of those names that hasn't oh that is a flash through it I don't know what to do with that letter

93
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:54,047
Who is that girl I never remember what the flash that's not one of the characters

94
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:59,679
Where is that I'm aware of how to pronounce English

95
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:08,895
Totally that one I don't know what to do with I stare at it and I'm like

96
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,431
Spiral on top notch

97
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,479
Just get it out of here I don't understand

98
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,551
This is from torstein in Norway wanted to wish

99
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,391
Possibly go wrong

100
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,975
Michael T happy birthday

Also haven't happy birthday happy birthday happy birthday

103
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,167
Joseph send a message

104
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,215
Got a birthday but instead of

105
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:37,567
Wishing a happy birthday to he wanted to spread this to all the community of long

106
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,103
And wish everyone else

107
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,383
In the world

108
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,175
I guess even if it's not your birthday happy

109
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,039
Have a good feelings of someone wishing you a happy birthday

110
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:51,903
I like that very very very nice inter-communal

111
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
So thank you

112
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,695
I guess

113
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,767
That's right that's why I think we should celebrate the way that they

114
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
The Giver did

115
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:01,631
Do you know where with what was that Lois Lowry all right

116
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,679
Everybody has the same birthday once a year

117
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
Everybody

118
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:08,287
Same birthday move on with the rest are his birthday day

119
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,335
I like

120
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,615
Might be functional

121
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:16,479
So Jordan are we going to get into business on this episode of years and out of context

122
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
Episode

123
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:24,671
Alex Jones is the grandchildren Nazi

124
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,463
Children or grandchildren

125
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:33,631
I know but it's funny that we're in the present-day on our last episode

126
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
The Next Generation

127
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,423
The grow into adults

128
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:41,823
And then we go back in time and they're still going to be no grandchildren it is something of a preoccupation for Alex

129
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:48,223
Seems like an obvious it's not being formulated in the same way that they will all not grow up

130
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,063
Good to know there's a lot of ways to get to the

131
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,087
The same

132
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,111
Destination ideas

133
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,415
Who started May 28th and

134
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,975
I will say the beginning is a little bit slow

135
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
I'm lying

136
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
Heats up

137
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,327
Okay

138
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
Got me

139
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,375
Very interested

140
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,655
Very quickly

141
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,591
Whatever should be

142
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,807
Criminal

143
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,159
Moratorium considered in North

144
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
Carolina

145
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,047
Furniture

146
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,863
Hardly seems a kind of

147
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,215
People don't

148
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,711
Counting out

149
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,295
Immediately I was like

150
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,087
I am so fascinated

151
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:01,439
I got completely thrown for a curveball here

152
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,975
Is this a new one

153
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
Take

154
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
It's not

155
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,327
It's something for now

156
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,399
No it something it's trying to have the appearance of a nuance

157
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,935
Let's take that actually isn't

158
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:16,031
And honestly I think this is the first time I've ever heard Alex give a definitive

159
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,799
Position on the desk

160
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,567
Penalty

161
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,871
I'll till this point I've gathered from contacts

162
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:24,991
Excludes that he didn't support the policy given that many of his other ideas that appear to be based on principles

163
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:29,599
Have to do with the government not doing things to individual

164
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:34,719
The position is putting forth is absolutely the definition of not having a

165
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
There's a lot of reasons

166
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,047
To be for or against the death

167
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:43,679
Based on an emotional appeal you know like people who commit certain crimes deserve death

168
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,519
Utilitarian calculation where you determine that

169
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,055
If you have a death penalty

170
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:52,383
There's actually a significant effect on crime rates and you make it

171
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,247
Whether or not that is actually

172
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,551
Do other positions can be based on ethics

173
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,135
Swear there's an intrinsic moral character to sentencing someone to death

174
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,183
And that consideration guides your position

175
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,743
And then there are sets of political beliefs

176
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,559
That could include a strong position regarding the relation

177
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,351
Between the individual and the state

178
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,911
Which would impact your views on the death penalty

179
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,935
Obvious ways

180
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,031
Alex seems to only be operating on the most Elementary level here

181
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,359
He's appealing to an emotional desire for an item

182
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,383
Be taken for an eye

183
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:30,271
This is really an impressive stuff from him and I once again regret that I gave him more credit than he deserves

184
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,807
Terms of this position

185
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:37,951
The other cowardly thing Alex is doing here is that he's claiming that he's for the death penalty but not when the government is

186
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
Corrupt

187
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,023
The level of corruption is of the government is it

188
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,559
Completely arbitrary and sub

189
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
Objective measure

190
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,095
For Alex

191
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,631
This actually means nothing

192
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:52,287
According to his feelings the George W bush government and obviously the Clinton one before it they're too corrupt to responsibly

193
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,055
Play handout desk

194
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:57,151
But it would be impossible to formalize this into any meaningful

195
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,455
Scale that you could guide

196
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,223
Things on

197
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:06,879
Literally anyone could just counter his argument by saying that they believe that the Bush Administration was not too corrupt to hand out.

198
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,927
And Alex would have nowhere to go

199
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,463
He could rattle off in

200
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:15,327
Answers of governmental corruption to try and build to a point that still doesn't handle the subjectivity

201
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
Of his assessment of

202
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,143
Of which government is or isn't

203
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:18,911
To corrupt

204
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,191
Descendants people to die

205
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
It makes no sense

206
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:25,055
Was he I didn't realize that it was in specific

207
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:29,151
With the level of Corruption of the cover I thought it was more of a blanket like

208
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,199
You wouldn't trust the government to do that

209
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:35,551
Just because there's a good chance they are corrupt in some fashion or another cuz they always have

210
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,599
No so he's he's like

211
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,159
In specifically

212
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,487
Okay well now that doesn't make any

213
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:49,375
By presenting his position this way Alex is effectively making it seem like he's taking a position when he's actually not

214
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:53,983
He's in favor of the death penalty but only when it comes to some imaginary ideal government

215
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
They could be in place

216
00:11:55,263 --> 00:12:01,407
My planting is flag there he can manage to not alienate either side of the debate while getting each to think that he's actually on their side

217
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
What does a pet weasel

218
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:09,343
There's an additional problem here too and that's that there's no reason why the logic Alex's using should apply exclusively to punishment

219
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,367
Involving the death penalty

220
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,975
If your opposition to the state imposing a death penalty has to do with escaping to corrupt

221
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,511
Responsibly give out that sentence

222
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,279
Then it should

223
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:21,631
Stand to reason that they're also too corrupt to responsibly incarcerate somebody

224
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,703
The reason is using Intel.

225
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,775
Complete inability of the government to enforce any laws

226
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,591
Because they lack the moral Purity or authority to do so

227
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,175
Yeah the way he's presenting it I understand where you're coming from

228
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,455
And I actually think that

229
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,247
It does get closer to

230
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,039
What the point should be

231
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:43,647
You're saying that they did buy by the very nature of it the government is to corrupt

232
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,439
To mete out the death penalty

233
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,487
And I think I think that

234
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,023
That would be a position

235
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,559
That you

236
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
Could call

237
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,631
I guess functionally

238
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,191
Anti-death penalty

239
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,775
I think that that would have much less problems though but Alex is a

240
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
Because he's

241
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,335
Not saying

242
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,663
If there were somebody in charge

243
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,711
Who was cool

244
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:12,063
Right right

245
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:17,695
No I mean if you wanted to if you wanted to get into it like what's the level of

246
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,999
Nazi war criminal

247
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:23,839
There should probably maybe the death penalties fine there I guess

248
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,863
You know that's

249
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
That's an

250
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:31,263
Whether or not you can trust the government to single single out individuals is an obvious

251
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Opening

252
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
Close Quest

253
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,823
From

254
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,127
The government can't do it

255
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,175
Without eventually abusing it

256
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,223
And killing a bunch of people that they just want gone

257
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,039
I think what's going on is that you're giving

258
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,855
More Credence to what Alex is saying then

259
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,463
Merit

260
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
To work when

261
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,071
We'll see more as we go along

262
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,935
I always thought there be a blanket opposition to the death penalty

263
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,727
Because of

264
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
The relationship

265
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,775
Kipling individual and State

266
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,823
That is implied through all of his

267
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,615
Political beliefs

268
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,407
I was surprised

269
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,967
He says that he's for the death penalty

270
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,783
I was also surprised when I heard this

271
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,591
More drugs more people in prison

272
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:46,271
What is not how I've heard Alex explain his opposition to drug laws at other points in his career that I've listened

273
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,039
M2

274
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,575
Every other time I've heard this.

275
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:53,695
Discuss the issues that Alex is not in favor of drugs but you have the right to take whatever you want

276
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,767
Who is literally one of the main selling points of Ron Paul

277
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,791
The people on the left

278
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,375
And one of the major tools Alex tried to use to insist that he wasn't a right winger

279
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,703
He was cool. Drug should be legal you have the right

280
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,727
Individual you're an adult

281
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,751
Freedom

282
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,799
You clearly doesn't actually believe that

283
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,335
His opposition to drug laws

284
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:15,199
Is purely a consideration of trying to break up the cartel of globalist We Believe shipping all the drugs

285
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:20,831
Legalization is in essence a strategic move against the globalists not something that Alex supports because of

286
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,855
The political beliefs

287
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,415
Adult should be able to use drugs if they want to

288
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,719
Which is the way that he presents it

289
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,743
Pretty regularly

290
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:34,655
This is super weird man I'm like 5 minutes into this episode and already Alex's explain to his positions on things that I thought you would

291
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,679
Irrational about

292
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,239
Positions are all wrong

293
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,031
I'm starting to question

294
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,055
Is there any position

295
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,335
But he and I would agree

296
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,967
I don't think so

297
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,759
Even even with you agree

298
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
He's wrong about

299
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,367
I hold out that last bit of hope that somehow like

300
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,671
That the conversation about like

301
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,207
Civil asset

302
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,255
Picture won't somehow turn out to be like

303
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,559
His position on ivis Baisden

304
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583
Some kind of like

305
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
Alien

306
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,375
Comfy or something

307
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:11,775
I'm more like we need to get way down on a base level of like you guys in a room with a mediator just being like

308
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,799
Who's got the best

309
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:19,967
Just like start there can you even agree on it

310
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:25,343
This grinning so did nothing

311
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,903
Your is or is not

312
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,487
Yeah yeah

313
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:35,071
Something the death penalty

314
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,887
And this is this is kind of gets into like

315
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,911
Alright

316
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,007
Kind of see what you're saying but it's still incredibly stupid

317
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,639
But

318
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,479
Place

319
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,783
But no there could not be a federal death penalty

320
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,255
Here's an interesting statistic that I'd like Alex

321
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
The chew on

322
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,071
Do you know the answer this I'm not sure if you do

323
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:12,703
How many people were executed by the federal government during the eight years that Obama was in office

324
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
0

325
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:18,591
From 1958 to 2001 only four people were executed by the federal

326
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,127
Timothy McVeigh

327
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:27,039
Three of these game during George W Bush's presidency but none after March 2003 complaining about

328
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,063
Federal executions

329
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,367
He's talking about something that won't happen again

330
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
4 / 7

331
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
13 years

332
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
I meant

333
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,463
Trump became president

334
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:38,047
And 13 people were executed by the federal government

335
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:43,167
And I don't think I ever heard Alex bring it up as a problem because we finally had a government that wasn't

336
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:49,567
Corrupt right exactly kind of why kind of why I get this

337
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
This is

338
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:56,223
So if there's the right person in charge I don't think this is actually a problem

339
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:56,991
Giant

340
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,551
Issue during Trump's presidency

341
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,831
The shift

342
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,623
Intone from

343
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,647
The previous

344
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,415
Decade

345
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
Two trumps

346
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:09,023
Four years in office in terms of federal executions

347
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,863
Insane and the fact that it wasn't a major breaking point for Alex

348
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
If

349
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,215
This is actually what his position is rooted in

350
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,263
That all states doing it

351
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,055
Then that's I don't know

352
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,615
I don't know if that makes sense but I can't I don't trust

353
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,407
It doesn't that that

354
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:31,807
Idea of the different that federal government shouldn't be able to but state government shipped that so stupid I can't even

355
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,831
Even breathe

356
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,135
There have been

357
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,463
Few Federal executions chair for Trump

358
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,999
For many years

359
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,071
But conversely according to analysis from usafacts

360
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,631
Between 1977 and 2018

361
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,447
There were 1490 execution

362
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,727
Carried out by state

363
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,543
During which. The federal government only carried out

364
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
3

365
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,127
How much is beloved state of Texas quote accounted for

366
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:00,479
37% of all executions in this. Or approximately 500

367
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,319
The states particularly Texas carry out the vast

368
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,855
Majority of executions

369
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:09,951
I want to say that he's fine with that which makes absolutely no sense based on what he's

370
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,743
Dispositions on earlier

371
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,815
If he doesn't believe the federal government to be able to send speed

372
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,607
Because the government could be corrupt

373
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,143
It's absolutely idiotic.

374
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:18,911
Pretended the same

375
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,191
Cancer doesn't exist in

376
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,751
Slightly lower levels of governmental organization

377
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:28,383
Being opposed to the death penalty but only on the federal level is the very definition of a meaningless position

378
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:32,223
It only becomes more meaningless when you explicitly support state

379
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,015
Executions and you live in Texas

380
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:34,783
The state with the

381
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,599
The government seems most interested in killing convict

382
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:43,231
He's a downright farce when he also go on to support Donald Trump president who presided over 13 Federal X

383
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
Executions

384
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:48,863
A total reach in 4 years that surpasses the number of federal execution sediment carried out

385
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,191
For the preceding 67 years combined

386
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:56,287
My phone is at Alex's political beliefs are idiotic and they're not based on anything

387
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,079
But a very least

388
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,383
This kind of brings things into Focus

389
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,943
You know at least I you can kind of get a sense

390
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,223
Because he's giving us

391
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,503
This little piece of information

392
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,039
It's just a state's right

393
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,599
It's kind of argument that doesn't have anything to do

394
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,159
With ethics morality or even

395
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,695
Opposition or support

396
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,463
For the death penalty

397
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
Okay

398
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:15,999
It's it's

399
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:17,791
Meaningless

400
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,351
I mean well because here's a big problem

401
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:24,191
If you want to abolish the death penalty in Texas

402
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,471
Citizen Alex's eyes

403
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,031
What it should do is secede

404
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,847
Then it will be its own federal government

405
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,663
Cuz I can't no longer be able to perform executions

406
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,687
Wow

407
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:41,087
Yeah and then I guess the state of Austin would have to choose their own executioner

408
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,743
Stupid thing to say it is beyond I mean

409
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,071
It's interesting to me because like you just hates

410
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,863
The federal government

411
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,679
I hate the federal government so much that he's willing to like

412
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:00,543
Except how many probably innocent people are being killed in the

413
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,079
Texas by the government

414
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,103
Yeah

415
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,943
I don't I don't understand this

416
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
It's

417
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,391
10 Things I find most remarkable about it is that I could you have listened to

418
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,440
Hundreds of hours of Alex's show

419
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm still have like this Bo

420
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,048
I had I had

421
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,656
The Baseline position that you had wrong I had way too generous of a

422
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,680
Assumption

423
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:31,008
Cuz I've heard him talk about not being in favor of the death penalty

424
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:34,592
I just didn't realize that maybe it was rooted in

425
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,128
Something is really stupid

426
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:36,896
Yeah

427
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,664
Yeah

428
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,688
Yeah

429
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,480
That means it's just

430
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,808
The only way to carry out the death penalty in Alex

431
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:47,904
Exercise is if there is a I suppose philosopher-king

432
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,768
Who is choosing each and every individual personnel

433
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,072
Can we talk about philosophers we're talkin about

434
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:55,840
Drop Donald Trump

435
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,376
That f******

436
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,400
Trump

437
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,936
So at this point

438
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,216
The process

439
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,776
Same policy of the pacification is in place

440
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,056
Sprite and Alex

441
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:08,640
Still is not addressing that or dealing with it in any way which

442
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,688
Will end up being I think

443
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,456
Gigantic

444
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,992
I think he was wrong

445
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:17,600
And here is another thing these Ivy the Iraq war that Alex

446
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,624
Is very wrong about

447
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:19,648
I want to take

448
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,304
But don't worry they're going to find

449
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,096
I hear prey

450
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,128
Now in

451
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,152
2021 look

452
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,944
Going back I did not believe they did

453
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:43,968
Find

454
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,760
Yeah you know that

455
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,600
Alex almost on the almost under estimate

456
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,904
But Alex being like well you know

457
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,208
They wouldn't just straight-up

458
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,000
Elias into a war right

459
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,560
Yeah I mean like if his

460
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:04,704
If his ideas were correct about how the globalist operate higher level of control over everything

461
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,752
That's exactly what would have happened

462
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,544
He's writing that novel

463
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,432
Cuz that would have been the way that they are like seaweed proof cuz we set it up the whole time it up

464
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,224
Really not grasping

465
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,760
That they could just

466
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:24,160
Slice into a war which seems weird for guy whose job is to turn lies into money

467
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,696
Yeah

468
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,232
Wow

469
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,512
A bat bat

470
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,328
Conversation though about what

471
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,888
What you need to do or how you should wear

472
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:38,240
Respond to the reality of the the Iraq war in the lead up to it

473
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,800
That

474
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:47,712
It's right it's not super easily turned into and that's why you need to buy my tapes

475
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,528
This is

476
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,064
Kids operating with

477
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,648
Weed impunity in lying to your face is about starting a war

478
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,416
For this reason

479
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,720
Buy my pills no that's like

480
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:04,096
Let's do something about that to be fair Alex isn't selling pills at this point but it would it is

481
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,632
Is kind of like

482
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,704
Here is the science

483
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,472
Fiction

484
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:13,056
Conspiracy Intrigue spy novel that's going on

485
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,616
And if you read all my information to be able to

486
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:20,736
Mexico

487
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,064
So I think that these two things if you

488
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,904
If you were to listen to this episode one of the things you would definitely take away from it is

489
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,952
Position on drugs

490
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,000
This position on the death penalty

491
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,304
Are things that Alex really wants

492
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
To take calls

493
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,424
I think it's a slow news day for him I think he's trying to solicit

494
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,448
Calls

495
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,984
Now at the same time

496
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,032
I don't know if I

497
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,568
Can get a sense

498
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,592
That these are

499
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,616
Fictional version

500
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,384
Visions of his position

501
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,688
Like I don't think you saying these things to

502
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,992
To try and antagonize people short like

503
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,784
Someone

504
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,808
Bite on a shity

505
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,392
Call intoxalock it does seem like

506
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,416
This is this

507
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
Makes sense that you

508
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,208
Could believe that

509
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,744
Stupider than I thought your

510
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:08,352
Interview takes calls and this one guy who calls in

511
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,656
Do you want stuetzer to distinguish

512
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,192
When we're talking about drugs

513
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,496
We're talking about it like

514
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,520
Knotweed right

515
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,360
And Alex is not chill

516
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:21,920
Cocaine

517
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
Heroin

518
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,184
Spell marijuana I don't consider to be

519
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,208
Personally drug

520
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,280
People understand

521
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,352
They were put down

522
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,144
Not really made

523
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
But

524
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:54,176
Nightshade grow

525
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,248
Wow

526
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,832
Good morning

527
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,928
Kind of feels like

528
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:11,328
Trolling with an argument that good

529
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:12,864
Wow

530
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,192
I feel like from Alex's Brandin that he wants

531
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,472
How to put forth about himself

532
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,264
Didn't seem like the kind of guy who wants

533
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,336
Equivalent about whether or not we'd the drug

534
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:29,248
What he's talking about being against drugs

535
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:35,648
Yeah well did you know poisons exist they grow

536
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:42,048
Close to the present day in Alex's smoking blunts

537
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,584
Evocative hypocritical

538
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,912
I also look like this tobacco

539
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,448
No man would have jerk

540
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,752
Yeah he definitely cut him off before he said

541
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:54,592
You know these drugs were legalized because of and then the answer

542
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,872
22 that was going to be

543
00:26:56,128 --> 00:27:02,272
Criminalizing underrepresented groups in government

544
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,416
But he also this color brings up the

545
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:11,488
And the Alex's position on it

546
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,560
Has a interesting reason to be against

547
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:17,376
The death penalty is coming from utilitarian perspective

548
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,192
He believes that the death penalty is not at the church

549
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:43,488
And now you can't believe

550
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,936
I guess Alex got his wish

551
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:57,312
Coming from the moment he said those words that would literally zero Federal executions in Delhi chosen god-kings

552
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,336
Trump came into office

553
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:04,992
And started wantonly killing people they gotten the death penalty abolished at the federal level

554
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:09,344
Also consistently research has shown there's no discernible deterrent effect

555
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,368
And having a death penalty

556
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:15,488
Statistically violent crime and murder rates are lower in states that do not have death penalty

557
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,608
And a 2018 study reported on deathpenaltyinfo found the countries typically see

558
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:24,448
Reduction in murder rates after they abolish the death penalty

559
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,776
The study looked at murder rates for 10 years

560
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,336
After 11 countries got rid of capital punishment

561
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,640
Any found that six of them had lower rates

562
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,920
All 10 years

563
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:40,064
Forehead one or two years above the Baseline and then saw a downward Trend underneath the previous level

564
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:46,208
Only the country of Georgia had a higher murder rate after and explain exactly why that might be the case is beyond me

565
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,232
Or the study

566
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:52,352
Anyway the point here is that no credible data that would back up Alex's conjecture the

567
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,144
The death penalty is a good deterrent for crime

568
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,728
Exist it's not a good deterrent Dan it's an incredible tutoring

569
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:01,824
Almost like you can't believe how good a deterrent it is

570
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,104
It feels like it would

571
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,944
Since you think the people would be less likely to commit crimes if they knew they might get

572
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,016
Kid killed for them but that feeling is not based in reality

573
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,064
According to the cdc's numbers

574
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,440
The states with the three highest death rates from homicide in 2019 were Mississippi Louisiana and Alabama

575
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,232
All three of these dates have active

576
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,280
This should be the case

577
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,328
Safe without you saying is true but

578
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,096
It's not cuz

579
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,376
He's not living in the real world

580
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912
Yeah it's

581
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,680
It seems like

582
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:33,312
The death penalty exists almost to justify an emotional need in

583
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,848
I guess voter

584
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,408
I think that's what you see when you when you

585
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,968
Here I was talking at the beginning but he is

586
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:44,832
Support for the death penalty comes out of the emotional appeal to people deserved

587
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,600
Todai

588
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:48,672
And I think that that is the lowest level of reasoning

589
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:51,232
Bet you can approach the situation from other than I guess

590
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:54,304
Randomness

591
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,840
Flip a coin

592
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,448
Appealing to emotion of like I think that this person deserves

593
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:02,752
Posted I because they committed this crime

594
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,568
Is not well thought through

595
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,592
Obviously

596
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,152
People's feelings are

597
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,432
Find about different crimes

598
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,736
Get yourself in a lot of trouble price

599
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,528
Everything was organized that way

600
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:17,088
Does seem to be with Alex's is basement on

601
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,648
This caller has a slightly more evolved

602
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,672
Position than Alex

603
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,208
And Alex is telling them

604
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,488
Yeah that they're wrong

605
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,792
Yeah I know I mean it

606
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,864
It is that kind of feedback loop of yes it is the most

607
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,632
Bass

608
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:35,008
Thank the most base form of reasoning is that appeal to them and emotion of this person did bad

609
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:35,776
Bad habit

610
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
Consider this person

611
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,080
You know and

612
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,664
That's why so many prosecutors in the end elected

613
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,456
Attorney positions

614
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:47,296
Are f****** running on those like look at how tough and look at how

615
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,576
Crewlife

616
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,392
Because that appeals to that emotional bass in it

617
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:54,976
It's we're on order it's how we get to where we are

618
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:59,584
Is they can exploit the lowest form of reasoning to

619
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,608
I only

620
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,376
PJ Max

621
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,144
Worse

622
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,168
God

623
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,192
That sucks

624
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,472
Because I

625
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:09,056
I think that the other thing to that is part and parcel with that is

626
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,616
Is that the appeal to that emotion

627
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,408
Of this person deserves this

628
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,688
Because they did this crime

629
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,224
Is also an appeal

630
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,784
To like your feelings of security it's

631
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,552
Stability

632
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:23,392
Because if you were the person who was here in the politician be like I'm tough-on-crime

633
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,184
Really how it at how it hits

634
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,024
You and how you experience it isn't so much about like they deserve this

635
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,376
I get the feeling that I will be safe from crime because this person

636
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,656
Taking care of those

637
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,680
Write those things

638
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:39,008
Yes the bad people who get bad done to them

639
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,312
I think that that's

640
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,080
Security

641
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,360
Is

642
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,128
An artificial

643
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,152
Emotional

644
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,944
Crotch

645
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,224
Selling to eBay

646
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,528
So these callers are not great

647
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,600
Alex has another caller who's

648
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,368
Hey man

649
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,184
I got another idea about what we do about crime

650
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,976
You know America

651
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,024
The most technologically-advanced

652
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,560
First Nation on the planet

653
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,584
Engaged

654
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,632
Barbarian Savage

655
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,168
You know like

656
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,192
I figured

657
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:10,752
Criminal

658
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,080
Amenities

659
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:14,848
For whatever

660
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,384
Put them on the island

661
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,224
You know

662
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,576
Where

663
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,120
What

664
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:40,704
Haha I was with this guy until he got the island idea

665
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,240
I think

666
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,544
We should send all of our criminals

667
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,080
Around the world

668
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,872
21 Island perhaps

669
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:52,736
The continent even a big island huge island

670
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,272
And I'm sure it'll never come back

671
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,040
No

672
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,368
Feel like this guy had some points

673
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:01,184
That's like we have a barbaric system in place

674
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,464
Kratom listening

675
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,864
People should be given due process and that makes guilty before being punished

676
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,448
Here's what I think we should

677
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,776
Restart the state of Georgia

678
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:21,664
I feel like that clip is a really good towel that Alex isn't coming in with any real position that has an app

679
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,200
Application in the real world

680
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:27,040
Because in the modern-day the idea of creating a penal colony is stupid

681
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,368
If he just wants people to call in to discuss how they would like

682
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:33,184
To punish criminals I guess that's fine

683
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,488
Is not a productive use of time

684
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:39,840
Seem like everybody's having a little bit of a fantasy likes here's how I would punish

685
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:43,168
Criminal

686
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,984
What I would do is I would fill their room with

687
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,800
Cupcakes and then cover their hands in plastic bags

688
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,872
The mouth real wide

689
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,664
Cupcake everyday

690
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,712
Female that's interesting

691
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:58,272
Thai soft rock song.

692
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:02,624
This color does not have an idea that it is

693
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,440
Is your approach criminal justice

694
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,208
This one wouldn't

695
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,024
It only have the power

696
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,912
And wicked and I

697
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,240
Prison

698
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,008
All that Doug

699
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,032
Create a situation

700
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,128
McGrath

701
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:26,688
I put non-violent people in prison

702
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,016
Exactly

703
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:35,136
I too feel like there are too many people in prison but I strongly disagree with his entire conversation

704
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:40,000
This is the unhinged position that would not stand up to the smallest amount of scrutiny

705
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:46,144
So if I were talking to this guy is a guy who is taking calls on subject

706
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,008
I have a couple questions that I would start off with

707
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:55,616
I think the death penalty should be for everything

708
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,384
Well

709
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,664
Where's the lion

710
00:34:59,456 --> 00:34:59,968
But you got to kill him

711
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:03,808
Apparently

712
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,600
So you're not for that okay

713
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,928
Offense would qualify someone for the state

714
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,952
To commit

715
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,232
All violent crime

716
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,024
So okay

717
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,048
Interesting

718
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,840
Like what about

719
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
Assault

720
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,376
Like what if

721
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,424
I just came up to you and I punched you

722
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,192
Wow you got it

723
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,776
I don't know man

724
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,848
I feel I feel the hamster be chopped off

725
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,616
For property theft

726
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:33,760
If we're going to be brutal not have the power to do anything except

727
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:41,440
I don't know this is a completely untenable

728
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,488
Way to organize Society

729
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:50,400
If you think that white-collar criminals have it easy now imagine how they would do in that call my God

730
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,704
It is death or nothing

731
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,496
I guess maybe this collar

732
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,544
Has an unstated position

733
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,312
About

734
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:02,176
What states comes your criminal justice system

735
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:08,576
But the federal government can just kill or Alex would have to disagree with that cuz he doesn't think

736
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:13,440
Federal government should be able to kill what about a Hunger Game scenario if we're going to get bad

737
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,744
I just have the federal government with the right to

738
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,536
Kill or zero kill

739
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:24,192
I say we may have a have some fun with it this is the problem with people who think they can improve Society with their terrible ideas they don't have

740
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,496
What the government

741
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:32,896
Kill people know making a show about

742
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,920
Alright alright

743
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:37,760
I would like to know what this person thinks about fines

744
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:43,136
I would imagine this person has received a great many finds in his day

745
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:52,096
I think that these conversations are so stupid you can't be in my office anymore sir this is $100

746
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:58,496
I'm listening to this Alex's articulating his opposition to the death penalty

747
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,264
And

748
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,360
Drugs way he is

749
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,640
Idiotic

750
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,920
Are completely stupid

751
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,968
Absolutely absolutely insane

752
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,784
Somebody gets another caller and this lady

753
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,320
I don't know what to

754
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,368
I can't make heads or tails of what she's talk

755
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,904
I think I can

756
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,440
It's just a long story

757
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,232
Long story about

758
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,512
From what I can

759
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:22,048
Until the details of it

760
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,096
That there was some police

761
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,632
It showed up at her house

762
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,424
Because she has

763
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,800
Some acres of land and there's maybe something suspicious going on on some of Acres of the land

764
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:33,824
Lychee

765
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,872
Allow other people to use

766
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,176
And they wanted to look into what was going on

767
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,968
And so she let them in

768
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,272
And they said thank you for letting us look around

769
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,552
And this is a giant

770
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,832
Conspiracy of salt store

771
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,624
She's under attack okay

772
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,672
Escalated quickly

773
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,208
Turns into Alex

774
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:54,816
Like this

775
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,912
Well you know they were real nice

776
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:01,472
Nice again we appreciate your you know

777
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:05,056
Your cooperation out

778
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,336
I told the children all the

779
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,896
Your homeschool my children

780
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,760
See my children read better

781
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,064
The front

782
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,392
Well

783
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,680
That's a little bit of an extreme response to the story that this person is telling him

784
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,216
Like a cheetah

785
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:39,360
70 acres of land her husband passed away and she does say that she allows people to use like

786
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,128
6:30

787
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,152
Acres of it

788
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:46,016
Sure and there's not really a good sense that he has an idea what's going on

789
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:52,160
Enforcement showed up wanted to look around like I said cuz they had reason to believe there was something suspicious

790
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,440
They didn't find anything

791
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,232
Cooperation

792
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,768
And now we've done this

793
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:03,168
I fully understand standing up for your rights and if his lady a chosen to let the police look around or told them to come back with a warrant

794
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,984
I think either is an appropriate choice to make and her situation

795
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:11,360
It's one thing to be mindful of your rights and protect them it's another thing to do with Alex's doing

796
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,384
Where he's turning

797
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:18,016
Trying to take some very benign details this collar is giving him and escalate the story at the hospital's keeping

798
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,320
Kidnapped your kid

799
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,136
This is a sick person acting out it is audio

800
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,928
Even back in 2003

801
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,488
UCF career but

802
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,792
Pretty clear this behavior is still part of Alex

803
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:32,096
The psyche even backup back at this point

804
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,632
Yeah

805
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:40,032
That's that's great that's a great way to calm someone down his just had a bit of a scary experience not used to having

806
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,312
Cops show up at their place

807
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:45,152
You know that to have some things off of like

808
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:51,040
Hey DCFS is following you and they're going to steal your kids at any moment I want to call me down

809
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:55,904
Steal your land apparently because this color also brings out

810
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,976
That one of the police that showed up new her husband

811
00:39:59,232 --> 00:39:59,744
Your late

812
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,328
Alex takes

813
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:07,424
This to be like oh he knew you had lamp

814
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,192
Of course

815
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:14,592
There's no indication

816
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:17,152
Pretty women and honestly she's lucky she survive

817
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,576
They come out the only way that you know that they're the law

818
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,880
Because I have the shiny badge

819
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,888
I'm walking to the house

820
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,680
Your head off

821
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,496
Marijuana

822
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:49,920
He would not take a 911

823
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:54,272
Tyranny type I mean

824
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,320
What you trying to do

825
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,952
They have a 90% wake up on that day

826
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,000
Howard's power

827
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:10,656
So apparently the police were look at the squat on this land or

828
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,936
I don't know

829
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:12,704
Various

830
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,984
Stream turn

831
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,032
He takes a lot of time

832
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,056
30 gallon

833
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,104
Give this lady a really good time

834
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:23,456
It All Leads

835
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:26,272
Inevitably exactly where it's supposed to go

836
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,880
God bless you on to Alyssa

837
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,160
You don't know how many

838
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,696
People out here you woke up

839
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,768
I give your tapes away

840
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:53,151
The only solution

841
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,687
Everything bottled

842
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,735
To promoting Alex's cell

843
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:03,135
See that takes me back that takes that's good old-fashioned religion is what the lady at right now

844
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:07,231
Listening to that man you being part of them and you giving them the spirit of God and then at the end of it

845
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:09,023
My friend what you need to do is

846
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,815
Evangelize

847
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:16,191
What you pay for your sins you can hear Alex sweater

848
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,727
Cycle

849
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,519
We need 100 tapes out of you

850
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:24,895
It comes back

851
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:25,919
Exciting

852
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,991
Now go

853
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:32,831
Appreciate

854
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,111
Joining me on

855
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:34,879
Short notice

856
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,903
Friend of mine

857
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:44,095
Does water sponsored by the US distributor of black Berkey water filters

858
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,471
I'm afraid that I just don't think it's going to get much better than

859
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,239
The soap guy

860
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,775
No it's just not

861
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:54,079
No I have not yet heard another guest

862
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:54,847
2

863
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,431
He's so clearly abusing alochol

864
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,479
Just forcing him to

865
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,503
Set up

866
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,783
The limericks

867
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,623
Marty Schechter

868
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,391
Is

869
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,183
Just

870
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:15,583
Just exist as beautiful as an awful person

871
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:20,191
In terms of somebody who has bullied their way onto Alex's show with money

872
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:24,543
Forced him to broadcast limericks

873
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:25,823
Freddie Gray

874
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:32,991
But this is not Limerick level but it is still pretty funny that this is what's going on in Alex's

875
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,551
And it's anime

876
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,007
1

877
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,151
And

878
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,199
Great deal

879
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:06,271
Oh my god of Howard fell over

880
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,575
What kind of

881
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:12,415
Used car salesman

882
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:15,487
We got a pallet fell over so therefore

883
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:18,815
I thought that was pretty amazing

884
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,863
I was thrilled

885
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,911
Hey it fell off the back of a

886
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,471
Food Truck Sale you walk up you take it your give

887
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,775

Eu's

891
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:46,719
You probably wouldn't even be able to tell if he's fell off a pallet might actually suspected we just have too many

892
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:54,399
I can't believe you got so lucky that you got the one Goodwin off the broken

893
00:44:54,655 --> 00:45:00,799
Palatable

894
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,823
Goodbye

895
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,127
Do the 29th

896
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:06,431
Haha and Alex

897
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,759
Not to himself has another gas

898
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,783
Episode of the DTs

899
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,551
Beginning of the show

900
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,343
Another guess coming on

901
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:17,695
Georgia

902
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,471
But now

903
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,431
Literally

904
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,295
Andover Andover

905
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,575
We're again and we got to go

906
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,231
Biscuit wants

00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:03,263
Seat belts click it or ticket is about getting cars to armories to ransack

908
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:06,847
Weird stretch of time for us

909
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:12,479
Specifically so much seatbelt related melodrama happening

910
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:16,063
Yeah it is weird it is weird it's another sign of my witchcraft

911
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,903
In the present-day Alex was going down to McAllen Texas

912
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:20,671
Doing the

913
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,463
Seatbelt snitch

914
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:24,255
Sleepmelts

915
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:30,655
Add a little bit of hilarity that these things are

916
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:35,263
Bananas to I don't spoil anything for you

917
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,543
But this

918
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,567
Caller doesn't

919
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,591
Actually

920
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:39,871
Have much to say

921
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:48,831
This next clip gets into a little bit murky

922
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,647
A good bit of explanation that I need to

923
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,671
Attract

924
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:53,439
On this one

925
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,743
Alex starts talking

926
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:57,023
Confused

927
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,327
It took a while to sort of disentangle

928
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,607
Some of these these threads

929
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,423
Talking about

930
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:07,263
Yesterday so I went and got the

931
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,967
Remind people

932
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,503
I can remind

933
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,487
Security

934
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,023
Report where

935
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:35,167
Of the third world

936
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:37,983
Free birth control

937
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,735
And my friend

938
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:52,063
Amazing here's the headline Brazil Washington

939
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,647
Million sterilized

940
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:13,823
Night

941
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,807
Journal

942
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:34,559
Directly off

943
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:38,143
Library of Congress

944
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:38,911
Infowars

945
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:44,287
So just listening to this I started with a little bit of confusion

946
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:48,895
Because he's talking about a report out of Brazil we have this report

947
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,175
Does he have

948
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,455
Is that report it

949
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,223
South

950
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,247
What is the

951
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:55,551
Port makes sense to me

952
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,575
Because he's

953
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,623
He claims he's read this thing he's posting it it's

954
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:01,183
The 30-page report of population and Homeland

955
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:01,951
Security

956
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,231
Okay so

957
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:05,023
I'm starting to put the pieces together

958
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:11,423
There's no such report that was not a report out of Brazil that something else this is just National

959
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,447
Security report

960
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:13,983
I know what he's talk

961
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:14,751
Talking about it this

962
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,543
It's not doesn't match what he say

963
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,591
Therefore he's referring to his National

964
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,871
Security study memoranda

965
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:22,175
200 from December 1974

966
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:28,063
The subtitle of the report is quote implications of worldwide population growth for US security and overseas interests

967
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,343
The problem is that

968
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,647
123 pages long not 30

969
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:32,671
I don't know what

970
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,207
He's talking about maybe some

971
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:36,511
Report about that report

972
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:42,911
Yeah and you would say like all maybe he only read 30 pages everybody didn't read 2 pages of the 30 pages that

973
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,215
He didn't read as124 page

974
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,263
Yeah

975
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,287
Know what

976
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:52,639
The specific report you talk about it but I do know that underneath it

977
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,175
Is this nssm

978
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,199
200

979
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,735
And we've talked about it in the past

980
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:00,575
Particularly in the end game coverage in South what to give a brief recap of it

981
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,879
This is not a plan to sterilize the world

982
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:07,231
That's a fake version of the document that Alex's imagine because it's really

983
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:10,303
About providing foreign aid in the form of healthcare and reproductive

984
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,351
Assistance to people in less developed countries

985
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,631
And Alex is

986
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:14,655
Super again

987
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,983
He's smart enough to know that he would look like an a******

988
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:22,591
We spent his time passionately yelling about how evil it is to provide Healthcare to people in developing countries

989
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:28,223
So what he does attack policies and proposals to do just that by pretending that they're actually plans to kill everyone

990
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:30,271
And he's a hero for telling you about the evil

991
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:36,159
If you actually go read nssm 200 after having only heard Alex yell about it

992
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:41,279
One of the things you'll be surprised by how much of the document is not about providing reproductive option

993
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,559
The people in the developing world

994
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,327
At all

995
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,607
In reality

996
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:47,679
About the implications of the post-world war population growth

997
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,959
That's been seen around the world

998
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:53,055
And how it could impact the general stability of the world mostly As Seen through the prism

999
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,079
Of US enter

1000
00:50:55,103 --> 00:51:00,223
Even as it relates to fertility the document place is equal importance on programs aimed at quote

1001
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:03,551
Improve Healthcare nutrition to reduce child mortality

1002
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:06,623
Education improve social status for women

1003
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:08,415
Increase female employment

1004
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:14,559
Improved old age security and assistance for the rural poor as it does on issues surrounding birth

1005
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:21,215
The word sterilization is used to time so the document in the same paragraph when it's listed as one of these short-term

1006
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:23,775
Consider available to provide improve fertility control

1007
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:25,567
For people in the developing world

1008
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:30,687
This is a list of options like oral contraception IUD and even teaching ovulation

1009
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:31,967
Prediction and the Rhythm

1010
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:34,527
But yeah and sterilization in this context

1011
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:35,551
They've been used

1012
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,319
Is things like

1013
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:38,367
Tubal ligation or vasectomy

1014
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:41,951
That's the thing

1015
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:44,511
Sterilization is a word that's a bit load

1016
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,583
On the one hand course they're pressured sterilization

1017
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:52,703
Can is definitely hugely an ethical and unacceptable and there is a history of it in the world

1018
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:54,239
And I'm not minimizing

1019
00:51:54,495 --> 00:52:00,383
On the other hand there's a long history of people using voluntary sterilization as a method

1020
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,175
Control in Brazil is a place with a

1021
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,455
An interesting history on that

1022
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:06,271
There's a much larger picture here in a bigger

1023
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,807
Your story to unpack then what Alex

1024
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,575
Does doing

1025
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:14,463
He's pitching a made-up version of this document from the seventies combining it with a recent headline he's read for Brazil

1026
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,743
And declaring his work done

1027
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,791
In reality he's done nothing

1028
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:20,607
And he's covering up with actually going on under the surface

1029
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:27,263
The actual news headline here that he has is about an investigation in Brazil into the history of sterilization

1030
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,799
Which was said to have been prompted

1031
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:31,615
By reports about nssm 200

1032
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,639
In Brazilian Outlet

1033
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,431
Instead of talking about the

1034
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,199
Details of

1035
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:37,503
Brazilian sterilizations

1036
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,551
Actual news stories about

1037
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:41,343
I was just rattles off his normal talk

1038
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,879
Talking points about the memo and he passed

1039
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:43,647
Himself on the back

1040
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:46,463
That was unsatisfying for me as a listener

1041
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:49,023
So I decided to look a little bit deeper into the

1042
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,095
A little background on the situation that Alex

1043
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:55,167
Important to understand

1044
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,191
Tree in Brazil

1045
00:52:56,703 --> 00:53:00,799
As discussed by Jose Alves professor of the national school of

1046
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:02,079
Physical sciences

1047
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,359
Anthony Brazilian

1048
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,663
To geography and statistics title quote

1049
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:08,223
The context of family planning in Brazil

1050
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:12,575
From the early days there was a moratorium on any sort of birth control

1051
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:19,487
Federal decree 2029 one from 1932 quote establish that doctors are forbidden from indulging

1052
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,279
In any practice whose aim is to

1053
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,559
Prevent contraception

1054
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:23,839
Terminate gestation

1055
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:30,239
In 1941 was passed making it a crime to even advertise processes or substances that we meant to

1056
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,007
Acreage

1057
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:31,775
Active choice

1058
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:34,335
As you can probably imagine this didn't stop

1059
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,103
Republic

1060
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,639
Control options

1061
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:43,295
Navigating a 1965 a group called family well-being Civil Society started providing some Family Planning services

1062
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,855
Though they were unable to meet demand and

1063
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:46,623
Even if they could

1064
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:50,719
The ability to provide things like oral contraception was nearly impossible

1065
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,487
In the context of

1066
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,255
Brazil's laws

1067
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,303
The country was playing from

1068
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,071
Behind

1069
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,119
And it didn't help that in nineteen

1070
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,935
64 Brazil is the locality us supported coup

1071
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:02,495
That led to the installation of a military dictatorship

1072
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,287
The last until 1985

1073
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,335
Over the course of that. Opinions

1074
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:09,407
Begin to soften on Family Planning with it becoming Seymour's at

1075
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,943
Matter of individual rights

1076
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:11,711
Some health decision

1077
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:13,503
By the time

1078
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:17,087
That the real progress was being made on the issue of Reproductive Rights

1079
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:21,951
There were already a ton of people in Brazil opted for sterilization is a means of birth

1080
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:24,767
And many of them were women who already had kids

1081
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,303
It's and didn't want more

1082
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,583
That predates

1083
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,607
The nssm

1084
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:31,167
200 Shiloh that Alex is talking about show

1085
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,727
What are the primary drivers I've been able to

1086
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,775
How to find a identified

1087
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:38,335
Is contributing to a high number of sterilizations in the country

1088
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:41,151
That's due to. Just after the end of the military did

1089
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:46,783
I have the country went through the process of democratization what are the moves that was made with the

1090
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,063
Decentralize the medical C

1091
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:51,647
So there would be more local control and responsibility for

1092
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,927
For the providing of healthcare

1093
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,487
This was a decision to cut it

1094
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:56,255
Into Direction

1095
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:58,303
Particularly in higher poverty less

1096
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,583
Developed areas of the country

1097
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:02,655
As explained in an article from the journal population

1098
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,679
Development review

1099
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,447
From March 2000

1100
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,215
M4

1101
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:05,983
Quote

1102
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:09,055
Well efforts to improve and decentralized the administration

1103
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:11,615
The Public Health Care System undoubtedly led to

1104
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:13,663
Number of larger municipalities

1105
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:16,479
It is possible that decentralisation actually fueled

1106
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,503
Clientelism

1107
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:21,599
In smaller in 4 minutes paleti's by providing an additional source of assets

1108
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,879
To be used for political

1109
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:23,647
Purposes

1110
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:27,999
Decentralisation resulted in a two-tiered system in which the better-off segment

1111
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,023
The population Ogden

1112
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:29,791
Good for private

1113
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:30,815
Managed Health Care

1114
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,351
While low-income groups were left

1115
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,887
Depend on public services

1116
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,679
Of uneven or poor quality

1117
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:39,775
In which preventive medicine as well as contraception had long been undervalued

1118
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:44,383
He was in this context as politics and Healthcare provision became deeply entangled

1119
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:49,247
And the demand for contraception Rose Among low-income groups with few alternative options for birth control

1120
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:51,295
It's sterilization acquired importance in

1121
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,319
The Client List

1122
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,087
Exchange

1123
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:54,623
Of medical care for vote

1124
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:58,207
This paper interviewed many doctors politicians and

1125
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,487
And 281 women

1126
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:01,535
In from the Northeast region of the country

1127
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,863
Undergone sterilization to understand the Dynamics that we're at play

1128
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:05,887
From the paper

1129
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:06,655
Quote

1130
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:08,703
Considering all are sterilized responded

1131
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:12,287
It's 71% debate said that they took the initiative of ask

1132
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,055
Imprint surgery

1133
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,615
About 22% reported that the position it's a

1134
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,639
Suggested procedure

1135
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,175
Ray provided a medical in

1136
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:18,943
Indication for

1137
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:23,551
People want reproductive Healthcare that that they just didn't have access

1138
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,599
One doctor they spoke with

1139
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,391
Explain the prevalence of sterilization

1140
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,671
The reason

1141
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,231
One of them is that there's a shortage of other option

1142
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:37,119
Even if something like the pill was available it's only available quote on an irregular basis

1143
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:38,911
Prevents

1144
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:44,799
In this climate where there is demand for birth control and no access to it

1145
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,079
People who are in positions

1146
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,359
To provide some access

1147
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,127
Pop up

1148
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,455
The authors of the paper talk to another surgeon to explain quote

1149
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:54,271
In the region there are a lot of Physicians involved in Polish

1150
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:55,807
The mayor is a physician

1151
00:56:56,063 --> 00:57:00,671
The ex-mayor to the ex State Deputy elected by the region is a hospital owner in position

1152
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:04,767
Therefore they either perform the operation themselves or they ask a friend

1153
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,583
All these mares are friends of physician

1154
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:10,911
Essentially the way it would work is that because

1155
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,935
The state

1156
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:12,959
Reimbursed

1157
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:13,983
The doctor for performing

1158
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,007
Tubal ligation

1159
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:18,079
They would do it in conjunction with another procedure application

1160
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:20,127
Can't request in order to gain the bureaucracy

1161
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:26,527
Of the 281 women they spoke to 159 had personally asked the politician

1162
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,575
For a favor to get a tubal ligation

1163
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,623
And 100 said they quote

1164
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,927
Turn the favor by voting for them

1165
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:35,487
78 of those 100 even quote

1166
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,047
Tried to obtain additional votes for their benefactor

1167
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,095
It's a compelling

1168
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:42,655
Snapshot here this mutually beneficial yet

1169
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:44,447
Inherently exploitative system

1170
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:49,823
That arose out of the inability of people to access reliable self-directed reproductive Healthcare

1171
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,127
It's always so fascinating to me how I can

1172
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,407
I can get curious about a sub

1173
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,687
Alex is talking about

1174
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:56,223
Scratch the surface a little bit

1175
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:59,807
And find the exact solution to it is the thing that he opposes the most

1176
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:02,111
Wild

1177
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:09,023
Nothing that I'm saying is meant to minimize or pretend that eugenic applications of sterilization have not been used many times

1178
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,559
That's absolutely true

1179
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:13,119
Of course there's a wider story that exist

1180
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,655
Austin terms of Brazilian history

1181
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,679
Then Alex Karras

1182
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:17,471
To even be curious about

1183
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:22,335
The headline news reporting on at is about this investigation in Brazil and it's nothing new

1184
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:25,151
A parliamentary Commission of inquiry was open

1185
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:28,479
The 1967 to explore accusations of mass sterilization

1186
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:29,759
And another was launched

1187
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:30,783
The 1983

1188
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:37,695
There's a third open in 1991 quote to examine the spread of female sterilization in Brazil and identify persons

1189
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,463
Organization

1190
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,487
Responsible for AIDS

1191
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:40,255
Miscues

1192
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,047
This was followed by a national

1193
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,863
Congress investigation in 1992

1194
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,399
That was to examine quote

1195
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:50,239
The possible racist motivations behind the provision of sterilization

1196
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:52,799
The role of international agencies in interest

1197
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:55,359
The availability of alternative birth control method

1198
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,639
Let's do low-income women

1199
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:59,455
Andy politically-motivated use of tubal ligation

1200
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:02,271
The result was that quote in its final report

1201
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,319
The Congressional CPI Echo device

1202
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,111
The state's investigation by noting

1203
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,647
The pervasive poverty

1204
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,695
And the lack of reproductive Health Services

1205
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,975
Contributed to women's depends

1206
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:11,999
Sterilization

1207
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,535
Haley birth control method

1208
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:14,559
Shocking

1209
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:15,327
No one

1210
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,119
Not really

1211
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,911
This is been a matter of

1212
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:22,495
It's widely discussed and it's something that has been investigated

1213
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:24,287
And talked about in terms of Brazil

1214
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,311
For many years

1215
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:28,127
And I'm fairly certain that Alex doesn't even know about these

1216
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:29,663
These previous investigation

1217
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:30,943
He just think

1218
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:34,783
But recently in Brazil someone found nssm 200

1219
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,063
And like the whole thing's

1220
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,367
Blowing up an exploding now which is just

1221
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,135
Dumb

1222
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:44,255
Alex provides his audience with a dumb butt easy-to-understand story that leads them to accepting

1223
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:45,023
Bad position

1224
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:49,375
If you're opposed to sterilization being used as a birth control method then

1225
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:55,263
Waging a crusade against the widespread access to Alternative birth control methods is exactly the wrong way to do it

1226
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,799
Or

1227
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,591
You could have

1228
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:01,407
Draconian Crackdown and remove all rights from women

1229
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:08,319
There are two ways to go yeah there are two ways to go I'm not saying that one is better than the other

1230
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:13,183
Yeah and I found really difficult was that like

1231
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,207
I

1232
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:16,255
Don't know

1233
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:19,071
Like obviously I would never say

1234
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:19,839
That

1235
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:22,399
The use of sterilization or

1236
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,423
Tubal ligation

1237
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:26,239
That wasn't

1238
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,543
It wasn't as widely

1239
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:31,615
Yeah it discussed in the sources that I was able to find

1240
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,919
I wouldn't ever

1241
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:36,479
Pretend to be naive enough to think that there was a

1242
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,503
Any abuse

1243
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:41,855
No even the system that that that one paper that I found

1244
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:45,183
Discussing the clientelism aspect of it.

1245
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:45,951
Poor

1246
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:47,231
Less-developed areas

1247
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:50,815
Like that is intrinsically exploitative

1248
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:53,375
Is f***** up never happened like this

1249
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:55,167
If everyone had a

1250
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,447
Exactly

1251
01:00:57,471 --> 01:01:02,079
Aunt Angie what is available to be offered as an unfair Exchange

1252
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,359
Of course

1253
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,383
I wouldn't

1254
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:05,663
Bat

1255
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,687
That there aren't in

1256
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:08,735
Instances of also

1257
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:09,503
Abuse

1258
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:12,831
It's people

1259
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:13,599
It's just

1260
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:17,183
The stories that you hear about

1261
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:19,231
Sterilization campaigns

1262
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:21,023
Being used as methods of

1263
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,815
Of genocide are eugenics

1264
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:26,143
Or what Alex wants you to think every single birthday

1265
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:26,911
Control

1266
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,447
Executive ever has been

1267
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:33,055
And that's unfair because I think it's a disservice to the campaigns that have happened

1268
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:34,591
Yeah

1269
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:35,871
No

1270
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,175
It's

1271
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,479
It is it is

1272
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:42,527
Typical Pharrell

1273
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,063
Simply because

1274
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,087
You can't

1275
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,135
Before any kind of birth can

1276
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:50,719
You you just can't like there's no way for Alex

1277
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:56,351
Text to square being like okay it's okay for sterilizations if there's no other available birth

1278
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,119
Control method

1279
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:00,703
So it always has to be wrapped up in something else

1280
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:01,471
Being

1281
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:02,239
A murder

1282
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:04,543
That's the only way you can talk about

1283
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,335
Birth control through his eyes

1284
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:12,735
Politics don't allow for you to be able to dictate what someone can do with their own body like if you say

1285
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:14,015
Play I want that person

1286
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,807
Things a woman they do

1287
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:23,231
It can't ever be someone's

1288
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,767
Rational choice

1289
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:27,071
To engage in a birth

1290
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:27,839
Control

1291
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:30,399
I could always has to be some sort of a conspiracy where you at

1292
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:37,055
Intuit cuz if it is 1 time a rational Choice then that means that there are other people who can make that same rational choice in the

1293
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:41,407
Then all the sudden there are a lot of things that you have to reconnect your license maybe that's a ration

1294
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,175
Call Joyce 2

1295
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:45,503
Until it becomes reasonable to assume that some forms of birth control

1296
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:49,855
Are rational actors and then your whole argument about how everybody's trying to kill you

1297
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,903
Is kind of a god

1298
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:52,671
It hurts

1299
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:53,695
So this

1300
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:56,255
This conversation is

1301
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,279
About birth

1302
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,583
That's about

1303
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,375
Reproductive

1304
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,399
Brights and how

1305
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:05,983
But Alex takes this story about Brazil

1306
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:06,751
You can

1307
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,031
Season pivot it

1308
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:11,871
Because he doesn't know really what anything is about me has a certain amount of talk

1309
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:12,639
3 points

1310
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,943
Any makes it about vaccines

1311
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,223
Because

1312
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:20,575
He also believes that they're going to sterilize the third world through putting Secret

1313
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:22,367
Put stuff in vaccines and stuff

1314
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:26,719
And so he just takes the story and makes it about that because it works

1315
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,119
People wonder why the mail

1316
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:39,775
Thousand Island

1317
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:41,311
The come out years after

1318
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,919
Dissipated report

1319
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,343
Who don't use drugs

1320
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,439
Europe

1321
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:00,511
Percent

1322
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:15,103
Third world

1323
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:32,511
Do G

1324
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:37,119
It is still about vaccines that he's yelling over and Children's Museum

1325
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:40,191
Has anybody getting to White

1326
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:40,959
Fear there

1327
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:41,983
Quite a bit

1328
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:47,359
Yes we will grandkids I have not heard of any new grandkids

1329
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:53,759
It's now I mean technically in the past two years I have had three combined nieces and

1330
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:56,831
Nephews appear into this world

1331
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,111
But

1332
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:04,511
Who's grandchildren look stupid stupid

1333
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,303
Stupid

1334
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,351
I don't know I I don't want to

1335
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:10,143
Speak too much

1336
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:10,911
About like

1337
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:12,447
Not believing a lie

1338
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,983
I feel like I do it too much

1339
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:18,079
I wonder I wonder if these people that he knows

1340
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,871
You can't have kids are made up

1341
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,151
4

1342
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:24,735
The lieutenant colonel's he talks about all the time

1343
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:25,759
Country made up

1344
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:29,343
So I got to tell my I got to tell my family to start back

1345
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,111
Connecting their kids

1346
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:34,975
I want him to stay at that babe you know how some people are like all I wish they could stay this age forever

1347
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:35,743
Guys

1348
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:37,023
Covid vaccine

1349
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:40,351
Now three years old forever

1350
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,399
I ate your Nutella

1351
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:44,703
Terrifying moment

1352
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:45,983
Oh no

1353
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:48,799
I said that Alex mix things up

1354
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,591
After I forgot

1355
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,415
Infowars.com

1356
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:18,751
Out of

1357
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,823
Now is the time

1358
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,639
For America

1359
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:27,967
We could not wait any longer

1360
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:32,575
Certainly can't wait eighteen more years

1361
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:38,975
Got to be done so I'm sorry I'm sorry that I

1362
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:42,047
You've got a good case for libel

1363
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:42,815
Probably

1364
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:45,631
So here's something that Alex is making out

1365
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,087
Only

1366
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,207
Only a few

1367
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:16,863
What

1368
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:32,479
Alright escalated three levels very quickly

1369
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:35,807
You thought it was doctor's bulshit military industrial complex

1370
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:36,831
Chirp

1371
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:39,647
No you thought it was real Terry dustrial complex

1372
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:41,951
300 people know the real truth

1373
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:42,975
About vaccines

1374
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:49,375
What's that you Pikachu 300 people know it's 300

1375
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:51,679
Literal Nazi

1376
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:55,007
I just also like to see this in

1377
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:57,823
Turtle relationship with Alex

1378
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,383
Complaining whatever and calling him a Nazi

1379
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:04,479
Because everybody not to the Past

1380
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:06,015
Everybody

1381
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,551
Seatbelt through problem

1382
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:09,599
Well that's because they are

1383
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:10,879
That's alright

1384
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:14,975
His history has borne out that you can't get much more seriously in the present

1385
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:15,999
It seems like it

1386
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:23,423
As we discussed on pretty much every 2003 episode

1387
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:25,727
What are things I'm most interested in

1388
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:30,335
Is trying to figure out if Alex believes he's fighting the literal Christian devil

1389
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,895
I'm still not sure I'll vote

1390
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,455
This gets me a little closer

1391
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,447
Believe

1392
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:02,591
And so close to the I got to quit

1393
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:04,639
It can be described

1394
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:11,039
Titov hell forces

1395
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:12,063
Quite there

1396
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,855
And even though he said Massive Attack

1397
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:20,255
The song is named the angel not devil so we can maybe

1398
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:25,887
Also teardrop

1399
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,447
Yep yep there was that one theme song from

1400
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:38,175
What was the did they do the entire soundtrack for a Jet Li movie where he was a

1401
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:44,575
He's a dog that he was Jet Li was captured by a British gangster

1402
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:49,183
Dollar Tree

1403
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:51,743
Oh they're on the smash soundtrack by friend

1404
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:55,327
Don't you dare say they're not even if they're not they are

1405
01:09:55,839 --> 01:10:01,983
Spiritually snatch soundtrack to talk about seatbelt

1406
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,567
Stuff ending up in ransacking at the Armory but

1407
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:06,847
We're about to go to

1408
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,015
The whole nine yards

1409
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,391
911

1410
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,415
Enduring

1411
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:24,767
Guard Armory

1412
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:34,239
That sucks

1413
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,519
But it's also like

1414
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:36,799
Alright

1415
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,383
There's no passion behind it and hopefully early pay

1416
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:42,943
Programming or whatever it's clearly an ad

1417
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:46,015
I don't I don't think that unethical

1418
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:46,783
It's a little bit

1419
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:47,807
Disjointed

1420
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,087
Somewhat

1421
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:51,903
Whatever it's at how you would

1422
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:52,671
Expect ads

1423
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:53,439
To work

1424
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:57,791
In a radio show even though it is more like

1425
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:00,863
Here's a topic we're going to get into before we get to that

1426
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:02,655
I want to talk to you about a sponsor

1427
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:05,983
Like I'm playing that because that's not how he does it

1428
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,775
Bellator * 8

1429
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:14,431
So eroded TV show where they would cut in with a

1430
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:20,831
Actual actor from the show me like we're having a grand time watching this thing first let me tell you about

1431
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:22,367
Thompson's

1432
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:25,183
Yeah I also think that Alex's sales pictures of

1433
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:26,207
A little underwhelming

1434
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:36,959
They have

1435
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:41,311
This thing

1436
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,423
Capri catalog

1437
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:12,031
It doesn't feel like you feel like someone who's super familiar with

1438
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,567
Super X

1439
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:18,687
I like whatever you're doing it ad rated the middle of it

1440
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,479
You get mad that you have to

1441
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:23,295
Continue doing

1442
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:27,647
100 Pages catalog

1443
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:31,743
Guy calls in or this gas

Cuz this guy might as well be a f****** call her p**** is a gas

1445
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:37,631
Either

1446
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:38,399
Handsome

Experience with the click it or ticket

1448

Campaign

1449
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,215
I guess

1450
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:43,263
That takes you to the armory

1451
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:46,591
I don't know if this guy actually

1452
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:47,359
He did

1453
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:49,151
What I would imagine that would be hard

1454
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:49,919
So

1455
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:55,039
Who's listening to the details of this guy story everything I can tell you

1456
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:55,807
There was just

1457
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:56,575
Like a traffic

1458
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:57,599
Stop sure

1459
01:12:58,623 --> 01:12:59,903
He didn't have to stop

1460
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,439
But other people did

1461
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:02,207
Okay

1462
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:04,255
Alex makes it a little bit Ray

1463
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:07,071
We were allowed to pass through

1464
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:09,375
Although we drove very very slowly after

1465
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:12,959
Stop

1466
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:17,055
They stopped the Volvo with a very old

1467
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:22,431
Chloe passed out

1468
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,719
Emmanuel

1469
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:46,495
Ground

1470
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:59,807
That Middle America was a little tell a little America

1471
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:02,111
Middle America

1472
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:03,391
Eclipse

1473
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:05,695
Is about a minute-long and it begins

1474
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:09,535
With this guy who's the caller saying that he went right through the checkpoint

1475
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:13,631
I don't I didn't hear the part where you said I was wearing a giant turbine

1476
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,679
Well I mean bats

1477
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:17,727
That's assumed with all of

1478
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:24,127
The avelle conversation just because if you are driving through Austin you know the only way to avoid the conflict

1479
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:26,431
Turbine this guy's not in Austin

1480
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:28,735
To be fair alright he's in Alabama

1481
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:30,527
He's in Alabama

1482
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:35,135
Traditionally I have not seen turbines treated well in Alabama

1483
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:42,303
Thermador click it or ticket Alabama

1484
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:45,631
This interview is

1485
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:47,423
The definition of

1486
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:48,959
Why is this happening yeah

1487
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:51,775
I don't know you went to a checkpoint you saw

1488
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:52,799
Couple of people

1489
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:53,823
People's over

1490
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,871
Adele

1491
01:14:56,127 --> 01:15:02,271
Look I have a small percentage chance of receiving a ticket so Alex is going to turn this into a vest

1492
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:04,063
Rachel conspiracy to destroy White

1493
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:05,855
Basically

1494
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:11,231
Another story that Alex is trying to make people scared about to do with fingerprints

1495
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:13,535
Scans being used for school lunches

1496
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:15,327
We'll talk about that a tiny bit

1497
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:17,119
After he

1498
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:18,655
Pretends to be very emotional

1499
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,271
Imagine the movie

1500
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:41,439
And now there are dust

1501
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:49,119
Call home

1502
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:58,079
Grocery store

1503
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:00,639
New York

1504
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:03,967
You want to fight

1505
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,855
Wow

1506
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:12,671
The only way to solve these problems

1507
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:14,463
Sparta promote Alex's

1508
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:19,071
Product I just seems almost too easy

1509
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:23,167
Too easy to defeat the global it all put all roads lead to that bottleneck

1510
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:24,959
The solution

1511
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:27,007
Is free publicity for Infowars

1512
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:28,799
It's really convenient for him

1513
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:32,383
The story about the the fingerprint this wasn't mandatory

1514
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:39,039
Students could choose to use a PIN number instead of their fingerprint if they wanted to and from a 2005 article about this

1515
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:39,807
Graham quotes

1516
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:42,111
About 4% of students have chosen that up

1517
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:44,671
They're right they can choose that they want

1518
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:49,023
Apparently this is a really good system for school lunches for a couple of reasons

1519
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:52,863
The first is that it streamlines overcrowded school lunch line

1520
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:53,887
Which is a problem

1521
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:55,167
And in May

1522
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:56,191
Overcrowded schools

1523
01:16:56,447 --> 01:17:02,591
The second is that by making the transaction to uniform in appearance you completely eliminate the stigma that many kids

1524
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:03,871
Fila Theron launch assist

1525
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:04,639
Program

1526
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:09,759
I haven't been in school in a while but when I was I do remember that the kids got free lunch got picked on

1527
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:10,783
For being poor

1528
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:15,391
And that system that you have their eliminates that possibility which I think is a really good thing

1529
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:19,231
Yeah it's a shity system where you just by being born or made fun

1530
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:22,815
In terms of privacy issues there definitely something

1531
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:25,375
But they were discussed in the positives outweigh the

1532
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:27,679
The concerns and the concerns were addressed

1533
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:29,727
A copy of the students fingerprint is

1534
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:33,823
Connected to a unique identifier but the stored data isn't the actual finger

1535
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:39,455
Also quote parents who do not want their child fingerprinted May obtain an opt-out form

1536
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:41,503
Upground of this

1537
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:43,295
I don't know I just don't

1538
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:44,319
Yeah

1539
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:45,855
I don't know why

1540
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:46,879
This is

1541
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:52,255
The most pressing issue in the world to me can never be can you imagine

1542
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,535
Making a

1543
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:56,351
Sci-fi film in the seventies and thinking

1544
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:59,423
Oh they'll use their fingerprints to get lunches

1545
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,191
What's that smell

1546
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:01,215
Things to make

1547
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:04,287
If every time I use my f****** credit card I tap it against

1548
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:05,823
Nothing and it references

1549
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:11,967
Ridiculous amount of information about me in an instant and then comes back and they know it.

1550
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:12,991
No one cares

1551
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:15,295
The notion of

1552
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:17,343
Creating a database

1553
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,623
Of children's

1554
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:19,391
Fingerprint

1555
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:22,207
Is a little bit

1556
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:22,975
F***** up

1557
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:25,279
Sure and that's not what they were doing

1558
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:29,119
And I'm secondary relieved it was all so f***** up the idea

1559
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,655
Like this is a concern that I think

1560
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:31,423
Is very

1561
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,191
It is

1562
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:35,519
If you keep that all on file that seems like something someone could hack

1563
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:37,311
Totally

1564
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:39,615
My concern is also addressed and not storing the

1565
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,383
Fingerprint

1566
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:41,407
I bet

1567
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:43,967
Storing is like a numerical identifier

1568
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:45,247
Affect

1569
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,063
It's not like

1570
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:49,855
These concerns weren't something that

1571
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:51,135
The people who put this

1572
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:52,159
System

1573
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:53,695
The place

1574
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:54,975
Didn't think about

1575
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:55,743
Yeah

1576
01:18:55,999 --> 01:19:02,143
Yeah it does seem like all-too-often many of the complaints that Alex brings towards any kind of system Arthur

1577
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:03,423
Things that you could just

1578
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,447
Address well

1579
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:06,495
Instead of being like Walter Mitty

1580
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:08,543
Flaws in the system they're just like

1581
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:09,567
Bugs

1582
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:10,591
Broken workout

1583
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:12,127
The real complain

1584
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:16,735
But he has or the ones that are based in reality are things that people are aware of

1585
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:19,295
And other people are conversing about in

1586
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:23,903
Reasonable rational towns reality

1587
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,951
The things that are nonsense

1588
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:28,255
But he's yelling about are all just things too

1589
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:32,607
The appeals to the emotions of the audience in order to bring them closer to that bottleneck

1590
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:35,935
Gets them to making 100 copies of his movie Cheese's

1591
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:37,983
Have you got to do it man or else

1592
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:48,223
Epr

1593
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:12,287
Get in the fight by reproducing how has to give to people as free promotion

1594
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:13,311
Or it's over

1595
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,360
Just awful

1596
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:17,920
A man for an initial investment of $50

1597
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:19,456
Just $2 a day

1598
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:20,992
You can make

1599
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:21,760
Sure

1600
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:22,784
That Alex Jones

1601
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,576
Will be richer than you can imagine

1602
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:25,600
Can you

1603
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:27,392
Can you just open your heart

1604
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:31,232
This sales pitch is not compelling can you change it save in America

1605
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:35,584
It's going to wherever you don't

1606
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,888
Make this $2 a day Sacra

1607
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:40,704
Click it or ticket

1608
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,008
Soldiers oh my God

1609
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:49,408
Rip your children away from you how you come to a snugglers high-schoolers with submachine

1610
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:54,528
Guns in Greg uniform

1611
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:55,552
It's

1612
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:56,320
Chaos

1613
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:58,624
For just $2 a day though

1614
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,928
What does talk a little bit about 9/11

1615
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:06,560
Stuff during this. But not anyway they like I feel like we're going to go ahead and cover this now

1616
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:09,632
But what's really fascinating

1617
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:12,448
Is listening to how his tone is so different

1618
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,984
From the present

1619
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:15,776
Wendy's ask Direct

1620
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:16,544
Questions like

1621
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,592
Like what happened with 911 now to be like

1622
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:20,128
You know what I don't know

1623
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:24,224
2003

1624
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:28,576
I know everything I know now he made a movie about

1625
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:31,136
Multiple multiple movies

1626
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:36,768
I know everything

1627
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:37,536
Look we got a

1628
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,328
Dead to rights we have all the proof

1629
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:47,008
Yeah I think I kind of forgot it is interesting that he's easy to place where it's like

1630
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:52,384
Somehow he existed in space where we've learned Less in the intervening time

1631
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,920
Broke when he started

1632
01:21:54,176 --> 01:22:00,320
Somehow forgotten about what should be the most important thing that for him to under

1633
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:01,600
Stand inside and out

1634
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:03,648
Your entire career is based off of

1635
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:04,416
This

1636
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:06,464
Thing I find myself

1637
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,512
Every now and again remembering

1638
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:09,792
King bed in the present day

1639
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:11,584
He doesn't answer direct questions

1640
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,656
It gets really funny

1641
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:16,960
Things that makes this very tolerable

1642
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:18,496
Another thing

1643
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:19,264
What's that mean

1644
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,056
Xmas tolerable Jordan

1645
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:23,616
The caller that you're excited we have connect

1646
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:24,896
The fuk down

1647
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:31,296
Control

1648
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:32,320
I was recently

1649
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:34,112
Surrounded by the military

1650
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:37,952
Bonsai

1651
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:40,256
I'm raising

1652
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,280
I was lured away from

1653
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:44,864
Chargers

1654
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,888
Why was there

1655
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,192
Tigers on my Cropper

1656
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:49,984
While I was there

1657
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,008
The military

1658
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:54,336
Skating

1659
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:57,664
The military were high

1660
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,944
High-fiving each other

1661
01:22:59,200 --> 01:22:59,712
And laughing

1662
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:05,600
No

1663
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:10,976
Okay

1664
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:17,376
Are you are you telling me that all that happened is we just missed out on Tiger King by 20

1665
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:23,776
Years because nobody would listen to Alexander show is that what's really going on isn't this is not Joe exotic

1666
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:26,080
Yeah but I was like

1667
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:28,128
Holyshit

1668
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:30,944
You can't get calls like this

1669
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,992
Home regular shows

1670
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:38,368
You can go to have a crazy show cuz you're not get this call

1671
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,392
From Howard Stern

1672
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:44,768
And if you did to be an actor

1673
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:45,792
About this that I just

1674
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:47,840
Couldn't resist getting to the bottom of

1675
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:51,168
I was like I've already spent a bit of time preparing this episode

1676
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:54,240
This is towards the end of May 29th July

1677
01:23:54,752 --> 01:24:00,384
Bucket starting over I don't care

1678
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,688
Here's the color on Alex's show

1679
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:04,736
Who had a Siberian tiger

1680
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:07,808
Taken away from una raid hahaha

1681
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:13,952
That's got to be in some newspaper somewhere right red alert

1682
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:17,536
I had absolutely no idea where to go with this but

1683
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:18,560
I use some Clues

1684
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:20,608
I was able to find something that look promising

1685
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:27,264
Listcawler says that he is in Minnesota and honestly how many Siberian tiger seizures could there possibly be in Minnesota

1686
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,056
Every year I don't know

1687
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:30,336
I found an article in

1688
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:36,736
Albert Lea Tribune from January 2003 about a raid on a house where female baby tiger was taken quote

1689
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:39,040
Because the owners did not have a permit

1690
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:40,320
For possessing the wild animal

1691
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:43,136
This seems like a wiener

1692
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:43,904
It seems close

1693
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:44,672
It sounded right

1694
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:50,816
Problem though is that the owner of this tiger is a seventeen-year-old kid who said that his fifteen-year-old sister is

1695
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:51,584
That's the owner

1696
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:56,448
I don't know I don't know much but I don't believe this color is 17

1697
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:59,520
Then I read this little nugget in the Tribune article

1698
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:00,288
Quote

1699
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:04,896
Peter also emphasized the past record of the child's father who is also lived in the house

1700
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:09,248
Sing it indicates the families inability to provide appropriate care for the Tiger

1701
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:15,904
The father was barred from having a pet by the court in October 2001 as a penalty for cruelty to animals

1702
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:20,256
However the child said his father is not living at the residence anymore

1703
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:23,072
I'm intentionally not using these people's names because

1704
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:25,376
Was as I was getting into this I have no idea if

1705
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:26,656
If they are the people who were

1706
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:28,704
Call the doctor

1707
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:35,104
How many raids resulted in the confiscation of a baby tiger went down to the first few months of 2003 in Minnesota

1708
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,152
I can't imagine that the numbers higher than one

1709
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:37,920
And

1710
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:41,248
Now we know that this is a family business

1711
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:46,112
I found a follow-up article that include some other bizarre details

1712
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:49,440
Apparently that whole thing the tiger seizure was set in motion

1713
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:50,720
Because the child quote head

1714
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:53,536
Scratches and B Martin was falling asleep in class

1715
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:55,328
When asked what was up

1716
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,352
Quote tool.

1717
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:58,912
Teacher that he lived with a tiger and it smelled bad

1718
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:06,592
Police searched the house and found a malnourished 35lb tiger cub as well as a bunch of urine and feces

1719
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:10,176
Porcine I was completely obsessed with the story by this point

1720
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:11,456
So I had to keep looking around

1721
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:17,856
Yeah I've if this was the story that this person who's calling into Alex's show I can match the story to the

1722
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:18,624
Caller

1723
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:22,208
Hey was very excited yeah yeah I can see I can see it's palpable

1724
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,072
Put up by Peta of all tiger cub related incidents in the United

1725
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:28,608
Midstates and guess what

1726
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:32,448
This was not the tiger case that prompted this call to Alex's show

1727
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:34,240
Wow I was able to find Grant

1728
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:36,288
This caller on the list from PETA

1729
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:39,360
So that means in the first five months of 2003

1730
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:42,688
There were two tiger cub incidents in Minnesota

1731
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,224
What are the f****** odds

1732
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:47,808
To be fair though I do want to make this clear the guy who's keeping

1733
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:50,880
The tiger cub at home with his kid the story we just talked about

1734
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:53,184
Did by his tiger from this caller

1735
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:55,488
So there is a connection

1736
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,256
I

1737
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:58,048
New

1738
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:01,376
That there had to be some kind of connection

1739
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:04,704
You had to know there's a

1740
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,472
That's just

1741
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:07,520
Awful guys name brand

1742
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:09,824
And he ran a business called tiger Zone

1743
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,360
And he's also pretty full of s***

1744
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:13,152
About others didn't make any news outlets

1745
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:18,016
The reason he's in trouble here is that in March 2003 one of his Tigers quote

1746
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:22,368
B a sixteen-year-old girl in Grafton b a pregnant woman on the wrist

1747
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:29,792
Tiger zone is a place where people could come and look at the product animals

1748
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:31,584
Reports of people being attacked by his cats

1749
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:34,656
The past but people have been reluctant to press charges until the sentence

1750
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:36,960
Would you like to the downfall of tigers own

1751
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:39,520
And a police search of Grant's home where they found some

1752
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:43,616
This would not be the end of Grant trying to hurt people of tigers

1753
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:46,432
In 2005 he was arrested after a woman whose

1754
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:50,016
Employee cleaning up after some of the Tigers was attacked and seriously wounded

1755
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,088
Anyway this guy's lying to Alex about the circle

1756
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:54,624
Stances of his run-in with the police

1757
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:55,648
And yes

1758
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:57,440
Stewart you brought up Tiger King

1759
01:27:57,696 --> 01:28:03,584
After the success of that documentary Grant's nephew tried to kick-start a documentary up about this whole thing but it apparently didn't

1760
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,352
Takeoff

1761
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:06,144
But also in the kickstarter it says

1762
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,192
This is not just because tiger can't happen

1763
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:14,592
Yeah I did say it sounds like that's exactly what you would say if it was just because Tiger King happened I think that there is probably

1764
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:16,128
Interesting story to what

1765
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:17,152
Done with this guy

1766
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:20,736
The trailer for his documentary

1767
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:22,016
There's probably some

1768
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:24,320
Experiences of people who are involved

1769
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:27,904
That are worth hearing about like

1770
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:32,000
I don't know if it's This Guy's daughter or who

1771
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:34,048
In the dark in the trailer giving

1772
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:36,864
Currently about how hard it was to watch

1773
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,168
We will take away these tigers

1774
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:41,984
You know like that she knew and cared about

1775
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:44,032
As friends or pets

1776
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:46,080
And how they work

1777
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:47,104
Treating a very harsh

1778
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,128
Sweet I think

1779
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:50,432
Valuable thing to hear about

1780
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:51,456
Help people

1781
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:52,992
I don't know

1782
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:55,296
But this guy is not

1783
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,368
Bye.

1784
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:00,928
Where will the military looking for bombs

1785
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,744
Took his tiger cub

1786
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:04,768
Anyway

1787
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:10,144
I would say that the fact that he's sold the tiger to this person who was keeping it in their house

1788
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,960
And the tiger was peeing and shiting in the house

1789
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:15,776
And recklessly around this child

1790
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:16,800
It means

1791
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:17,568
He's not

1792
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:19,104
Necessarily

1793
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:21,152
Due diligence

1794
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:22,176
Invading

1795
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:23,968
Who is able to

1796
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:24,736
To adopt

1797
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:29,088
Yeah that's a red flag

1798
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,672
Along with the multiple people who were attacked by

1799
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:36,000
Saint all kinds of s*** the red flag I mean just just like

1800
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:37,792
Pte exam

1801
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:40,352
Exotic animal zoo

1802
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:42,400
Is a the biggest red flag I can think of

1803
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:43,424
I don't know if that's

1804
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:44,704
Actually the case

1805
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:48,544
I mean I can understand why you think a lot of times it is

1806
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:52,128
But I don't want to stigmatize people who do actually take

1807
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:52,896
Take care of

1808
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:54,688
Animals

1809
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:56,736
Yeah but a lot of times in order to make

1810
01:29:56,992 --> 01:30:00,064
Enough money to provide care for some of these animals

1811
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,856
You may need to like

1812
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:04,928
Have people will be able to come look at them

1813
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:08,768
Because there are people who do that responsibly and within

1814
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:09,792
In the parameters of

1815
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,072
Not

1816
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:12,096
The nuts

1817
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:18,496
Grete and I would say that it's probably more than the others I would say there more people who do it responsibly then

1818
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:19,264
Irresponsible

1819
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:20,544
At the same time

1820
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:21,568
Still reply

1821
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:29,248
And it's not even like I think it's evil or malicious or anything it's just like

1822
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:35,648
There should always be somebody there should always be a neutral third-party Observer on the ground at all time

1823
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:40,768
I'm being like

1824
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:42,560
It's one of those Industries those where it's

1825
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:43,584
You can't even have

1826
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:46,656
Like that but any self-reporting is just not pause

1827
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:51,264
Our regulations needs to be better

1828
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,568
Reasons of human safety and

1829
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:55,872
The welfare of the albums that sells

1830
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:57,920
What that guy was doing to that f****** tiger

1831
01:30:58,432 --> 01:30:59,200
Randy's kid

1832
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:01,248
Justice f****** disgusting

1833
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:07,648
And again just to be totally clear that is not the color although the guide itself

1834
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:08,416
Animal

1835
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:09,696
You know that

1836
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:15,072
You're implicated a tiny bit your not being like if you're f****** selling a tiger in

1837
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:16,096
Minnesota

1838
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:17,120
You should

1839
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:20,448
Do a lot of background work on who are you selling this

1840
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:22,496
Possibly take care of

1841
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:25,568
It's a goddamn

1842
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:28,896
Are they a person who's going to put the Tiger in their

1843
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:31,968
So you don't get a tiger

1844
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:37,088
Excited about the story

1845
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:39,136
Snow

1846
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:41,952
Media coverage of it or whatever

1847
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:45,792
He thinks like I got a fresh lead here on time

1848
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:49,120
Government abuse what's going on

1849
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:54,240
Guy tells his story or his version of it and Alex just accept it unquestioningly

1850
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,032
This is

1851
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:57,312
Kind of bad

1852
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:02,944
Activist

1853
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:04,224
Open

1854
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,504
They have to

1855
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:08,320
Graft

1856
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,184
Industrial lighting

1857
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:14,464
5 * on the

1858
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:19,072
Grabber

1859
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:20,096
Yes

1860
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:26,240
So yeah

1861
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,824
16 year old who got attacked by what

1862
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:30,592
Cats

1863
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:32,640
Just lied

1864
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:39,296
Yep yep she lied in court five times and in writing three times so the story was exactly this

1865
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:41,600
The same every time and that's how you know she's lying

1866
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,904
Well I mean like a

1867
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:46,208
This is

1868
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:48,000
An interesting wave

1869
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:49,280
To present the story to Alice

1870
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:50,048
What's Jones

1871
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:52,352
Alex should not just

1872
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:55,680
Except immediately all their lying about what happened

1873
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:56,704
Cuz maybe

1874
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,776
Someone got attacked by a lion

1875
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:02,080
I just

1876
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:07,712
Unquestionably accepting this guy's version of the story only serves to use them as a prop

1877
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:11,040
To push your the government's out-of-control in one take your tigers

1878
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:12,320
Yeah I heard of which is

1879
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:15,648
Silly and there's a bit of a credibility gap

1880
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,184
There's a bit of a credit credit

1881
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,768
I think also there's a Justin

1882
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:22,048
Issue with

1883
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:23,840
I know that it

1884
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:25,888
It's 2003 and Alex isn't as

1885
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:27,936
You know grosser figure

1886
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:30,752
In the public Consciousness as he is now at this point

1887
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:32,288
But this guy

1888
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:33,568
Soffit

1889
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:35,872
Call Alex and talk about this story

1890
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:37,408
And that that's an indicator

1891
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:40,992
Yeah that tells you what kind of reaction he's looking for it the very least

1892
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:47,392
Yeah or where he would go to Astoria positive spin on this story

1893
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:49,440
Because it won't be anybody legitimate

1894
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:52,512
Got to get those tigers

1895
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:54,560
Fun little

1896
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:55,584
Path of

1897
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,352
To figure out like a

1898
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:57,888
I had

1899
01:33:58,144 --> 01:34:01,728
So many walls I ran into trying to sort out what happened here

1900
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:04,032
And the issue is like

1901
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,080
There were too many

1902
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:07,872
Kernels of information I'd like

1903
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:12,736
There's no possible way I can't figure out who this guy is

1904
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:15,040
Look at how this has to be

1905
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:17,344
And there it happened four times that's

1906
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,672
Not possible that's not possible

1907
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:25,024
So weird like there's not other there are other years where multiple

1908
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,304
Instances of

1909
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:29,120
Tiger into the Cabin Inn

1910
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:32,960
Minnesota America has the most

1911
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:37,056
Concentrated number of tigers just because of private ownership but

1912
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:38,336
Not not

1913
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,896
Felt like a Minnesota thing

1914
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:44,224
Writes like I'm looking over this list and like in 2000

1915
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,528
Clear 2000s from PETA

1916
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:48,064
There were two incidents

1917
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,344
Regarding

1918
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,136
Tigers in

1919
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:52,672
Natural Bridge Virginia

1920
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:53,696
But that's

1921
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:57,024
Because they both happened at the same Zoo

1922
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:00,352
That makes sense

1923
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:02,144
It's so nuts

1924
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,424
But there's two different

1925
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:04,960
Separate

1926
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:07,520
Stories in Minnesota

1927
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:09,568
I mean granted I guess the fact that he sold it makes them

1928
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:11,104
I'm connected stories right

1929
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:18,016
I mean you know but that it does make sense if you've got a disreputable Tigers who operate

1930
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:20,064
Who is willing to sell car

1931
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:25,952
You are going to find out you have more than one incident about tigers it in your region

1932
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:26,720
Very soon

1933
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:28,000
That is that is

1934
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:29,792
Probably a truism

1935
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:34,656
So Alex complains about that how you'll be arrested for pissant Stuff

1936
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:36,448
Like in Germany

1937
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:39,008
Yeah if you don't open your mouth at the dentist

1938
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:41,824
Your parents a rest of the public

1939
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:44,128
And then Alex said something really f***** up

1940
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:53,088
Ohio

1941
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:55,136
Five-year-old

1942
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:01,536
A what

1943
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:02,304
Tell what

1944
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:05,632
A what

1945
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:08,448
Yeah what is that caught me a bit off guard

1946
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:14,848
For what purpose

1947
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:16,384
To whom

1948
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:18,944
Also

1949
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:23,808
Even leaving aside whatever the reality of the story is a articulating it

1950
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:30,976
Silence says a h plus

1951
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:33,280
Interview with a guy named Michael Hagan

1952
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:35,840
And I don't know who this guy is

1953
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:42,240
A book that I can't find even by Googling the name of the book don't know how to spell is

1954
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:44,544
Last name that's not great

1955
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:48,896
Could be anyway number of different yelling

1956
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:49,920
Eh

1957
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:53,760
And

1958
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:56,832
I tried to figure out just like what the bottom line about him was

1959
01:36:57,088 --> 01:37:00,416
Was but I wasn't really that interested so I don't really mind that I did

1960
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:05,536
Figure it out because he's just kind of a guy with the standard newworldorder tough

1961
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:09,120
Just kind of someone is playing a game of boring ping-pong with Alex

1962
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:10,144
Hitting the ball back in

1963
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:13,728
Until I find it fitting

1964
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:18,080
That he didn't get enough traction from being on Alex's show.

1965
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:20,896
To penetrate the Consciousness to the point where he's even Google it

1966
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:24,992
So it makes more sense for him to definitely not even penetrate onto our show

1967
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:31,648
And I think that I probably would ignore his appearance cuz it's really boring until they end up taking calls

1968
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:34,720
Now you're talkin

1969
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:35,744
Go well

1970
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:48,544
I fell for handling the mutual funds

1971
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:53,152
I took your advice

1972
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:55,200

Hello

2002
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:39,136
I listen to your show I know I know that you said

2003
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:39,904
Come on now

2004
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:44,000
Nice try I've been you been lying to me for 9 years I have several

2005
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:46,816
Dollars worth of gold to prove it

2006
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:51,424
Don't let them talk too much more it just heard a bigger

2007
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:53,728
About gold a little bit

2008
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:57,056
And address the question more like once

2009
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:58,080
She is gone

2010
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:06,016
Maybe I was a little bit if you look at

2011
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:08,064
Know whatever

2012
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:16,512
Fun I like I like to stick around if you're going to have a have a little conversation

2013
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:17,792
Take another call

2014
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:31,616
Protecting mr. hege as you did from the last caller was Noble of you

2015
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:34,176
Bartow we read his book

2016
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:36,736
Department of Syracuse University

2017
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:40,832
Syracuse New York

2018
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:43,648
Hagar's book and used it as a reference

2019
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:55,680
Oh that's a one-two punch that they were not expecting

2020
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:59,776
Another caller

2021
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:03,616
Do you like Alexa

2022
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:10,272
F*** you I was going to be at 4

2023
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:12,576
Go f*** himself

2024
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:18,976
So I wanted to play more of this collar but there isn't much of it because it's just

2025
01:41:19,488 --> 01:41:20,512
It just deteriorates

2026
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:22,048
Into yelling

2027
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:22,816
Yeah

2028
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:26,656
Just yells over and doesn't allow any points to be made

2029
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:30,240
Creates a false version of the things that he saying in order to be like

2030
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:32,800
How do you know what that guy was saying Pat nuts

2031
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:35,104
Guy was nuts

2032
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:35,872
Baby

2033
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:37,920
Just maybe

2034
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:40,224
Still being very

2035
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,248
Nice

2036
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:43,296
To Michael haga in this interview

2037
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:45,344
But maybe

2038
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:47,904
Some of that negative response

2039
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:50,976
I had something to do with why we don't know who you could have some

2040
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:52,512
Something to do with that

2041
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:53,792
Maybe the audience

2042
01:41:54,304 --> 01:42:00,448
Not thrilled with the idea this guy being on and Alex will take note of that I'm not come back on

2043
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:01,984
As much

2044
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:06,848
In the future, I also honestly if I were Alex I wouldn't have them on and not because

2045
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:08,128
Just

2046
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:10,944
Strictly from the negative reaction but like

2047
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:14,784
He isn't bringing much else to the table shake you don't get from

2048
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:21,952
What Alex's or anybody else he could have on the Federal Reserve is bad

2049
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:25,024
My God I can't get a hundred other people to say that

2050
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:28,096
The benefit of having him on is

2051
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:28,864
Is kind of

2052
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:30,400
Dwarfed by clearly

2053
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:31,680
The negative phone calls

2054
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:33,984
I thought that was pretty fun

2055
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:36,032
Selfie

2056
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:36,800
The 29th

2057
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:37,824
Just being this like

2058
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,360
Pylon Michael Hagan

2059
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:40,640
And a Colorado

2060
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:47,040
This f****** tiger taken away all good watch fun what a good day good day and he doesn't think it is

2061
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:48,832
You but it's a great day

2062
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:50,368
Can't like

2063
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:51,904
You can't prepare

2064
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:53,440
For what you're going to get

2065
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:56,256
Alex Jones in 2003 like a box

2066
01:42:56,512 --> 01:42:58,560
Chocolate

2067
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:02,400
That is so vital I would almost imagine like if I was

2068
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:05,216
Planning a show where I knew Alex

2069
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:06,752
Was going to have a gold guy on

2070
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:08,544
I would have a giant

2071
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,848
Button with an x on it for if Annie

2072
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:11,616
Econ professor

2073
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:14,688
Just like I button I could run to press

2074
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:20,832
Technical difficulties just a thin line just I agree with you but

2075
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:27,232
Trump Michelangelo's presentation of himself he's not like a super gold guy he's not one of those guys

2076
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:31,840
Do the like a lot of Alex's other

2077
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:33,632
Buddy

2078
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:35,168
Apparently

2079
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:36,192
Had some

2080
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:37,984
Opinions about gold over there

2081
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:39,264
It's unclear

2082
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:42,080
Didn't let that one call or speak his peace

2083
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:44,384
He's fully and I think if they had I'd have a better sense of

2084
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:50,784
Or is this guy was googleable at all he was invested in the

2085
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:54,880
Dial when I was up high and the guy was like it's going to collapse right just put it all into gold

2086
01:43:55,136 --> 01:44:01,280
Gold going to Skyrocket up to $3,000 an ounce or whatever it is and then you'll be a billionaire in the guy was like

2087
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:07,936
I was at 11,000 dickhole yeah a little bit

2088
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:10,240
But it didn't move nearly as much as

2089
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:13,568
That's the sense that I got for sure

2090
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,360
Seem like

2091
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:16,128
The kind of thing

2092
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:17,920
Things that people in the right wing

2093
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:19,456
Space specially

2094
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:20,736
It happens to him a lot

2095
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:24,320
Like Alex in the Nigerian princes

2096
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:27,392
Right-wingers and gold scams are always

2097
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:29,696
They walk hand-in-hand oh yeah

2098
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:30,976
So

2099
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:32,256
We've come to the end of this

2100
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:33,536
Adventure in 2000

2101
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:35,072
3 +

2102
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:36,864
Some of that stuff

2103
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:43,264
But I also think it's very valuable to recognize these little glimpses where Alex speaks a little bit more about his

2104
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,544
Positions

2105
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,824
That we kind of

2106
01:44:46,848 --> 01:44:48,640
Got the sense were admirable

2107
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:53,760
Like his opposition to the death penalty a preference for drug legalization

2108
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:57,088
These things are things that you can agree with

2109
01:44:57,344 --> 01:44:57,856
I guess

2110
01:44:58,112 --> 01:44:58,624
In terms of like

2111
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:00,416
The end result of them

2112
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:01,184
Sure

2113
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,976
You can't agree with how you get

2114
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:06,048
Yeah because you can't agree with how you get there you are

2115
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:08,352
Actually can't agree on the end result

2116
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:09,888
Because for me

2117
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:13,728
I think the end result of opposition to death penalty

2118
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:16,032
Execution

2119
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:17,056
Opposition

2120
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:18,080
Intuit.

2121
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:19,616
For Alex

2122
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:20,896
Clearly that is not

2123
01:45:21,408 --> 01:45:22,432
Because

2124
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:23,712
You can see

2125
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:25,504
But his opposition is based in

2126
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:26,272
I distrust

2127
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:27,040
Cast of

2128
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:28,576
Some people who are running

2129
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:29,600
In the federal government

2130
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:32,928
Damn if those circumstances changed and he is now

2131
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:34,464
Totally fine

2132
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:35,232
With a

2133
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:36,768
Excuses

2134
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:37,536
State-level

2135
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:39,840
There isn't actually agreement

2136
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:41,888
He is for all intents and purposes

2137
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:44,704
Ipro death penalty person

2138
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:45,728
Just to get some

2139
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:48,032
Doesn't like bull sharks

2140
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:49,056
Yeah

2141
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:50,848
I mean the the thing that gets

2142
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:53,408
Me about that though is that it's like

2143
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:55,968
Because he's so malicious

2144
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:58,016
And so

2145
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:00,832
I expose fungible

2146
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:01,600
Anon

2147
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:02,880
On just about anything

2148
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:06,208
Like no matter what it is you agree with him on

2149
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:07,232
She doesn't

2150
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:08,512
Care about anything

2151
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:10,560
Other than

2152
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:12,352
Finding a way to

2153
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:14,656
Give himself and do white men more

2154
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:17,216
So even if you were you can't like

2155
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:20,288
Agree with him on an issue and then

2156
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:24,896
Come together or even work together or or anything towards that because if he's given

2157
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:25,664
Eniac

2158
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:28,224
He's going to take whatever access he's given

2159
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:29,504
And funnel it towards

2160
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,296
The point of a white male

2161
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:36,416
So even if you can talk

2162
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:37,184
They have about

2163
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,720
Because he's only issue

2164
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:40,768
Beyond all the take

2165
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:42,816
Sun on the news of the day

2166
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:46,144
Is like the end result of all of this should be white men running

2167
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:47,424
Be specific

2168
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:52,544
Yeah and I'll even get that like from other the other issues that he ends up covering

2169
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,312
During this

2170
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:56,384
X Equis complaining about these click it or ticket thing

2171
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:01,248
Yeah yeah yeah

2172
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:07,392
Why is talking about immigration

2173
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:10,720
Is it is concerned about immigration rules like they're going to

2174
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:14,816
All of your jobs are going to be

2175
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:15,840
You're going to make lassi

2176
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:17,376
All of it does

2177
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:21,984
There's ghost towns in Germany that they're bringing immigrants into to run like

2178
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:25,056
They're even said they'll replace it you know you're it's like Cheese's

2179
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:26,592
Christ we get it

2180
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:27,616
You're awake Nash

2181
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:28,896
All all

2182
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:30,432
