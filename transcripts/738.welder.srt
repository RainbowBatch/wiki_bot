00:00:18,612 --> 00:00:20,482
Thank you, Knowledgebite.com.

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,552
It's time to pray.

3
00:00:21,657 --> 00:00:23,592
I have great respect for knowledge.

4
00:00:23,652 --> 00:00:24,052
Fight.

5
00:00:24,145 --> 00:00:25,102
Knowledge Fight.

6
00:00:25,195 --> 00:00:27,457
I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys.

7
00:00:27,535 --> 00:00:27,897
Shang.

8
00:00:27,942 --> 00:00:29,032
We are the bad guys.

9
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:29,877
Knowledge.

10
00:00:30,057 --> 00:00:31,167
Dan and George.

11
00:00:31,227 --> 00:00:32,600
Knowledge Fight.

12
00:00:35,737 --> 00:00:36,800
Need money.

13
00:00:55,687 --> 00:00:59,227
Knowledge.com, I love you.

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,247
Hey, everybody.

15
00:01:00,355 --> 00:01:01,297
Welcome back knowledge, friend.

16
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:01,602
I'm Dan.

17
00:01:01,632 --> 00:01:02,082
I'm Jordan.

18
00:01:02,097 --> 00:01:06,942
We're a couple of dudes like to sit around, worship with the altar of Celine and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

19
00:01:07,002 --> 00:01:08,272
Oh, indeed we are.

20
00:01:08,305 --> 00:01:08,682
Dan.

21
00:01:08,772 --> 00:01:09,177
Jordan.

22
00:01:09,207 --> 00:01:10,627
Dan, Jordan, quick question for you.

23
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:16,962
What's up? What's your bright spot today, buddy? My bright spot today, Jordan, is we have reached the end of sneak weekend.

24
00:01:17,112 --> 00:01:17,825
Yes.

25
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:19,775
It's been long.

26
00:01:21,037 --> 00:01:21,800
Yeah.

27
00:01:22,612 --> 00:01:29,150
I'm thrilled that we had an opportunity to sit down and talk to Mark, please.

28
00:01:29,737 --> 00:01:35,182
I think there's an argument that could be made that we could have put that all out on Monday or something.

29
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:35,677
Sure.

30
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:41,225
I just feel like things are coming so fast that we just got to keep moving.

31
00:01:41,812 --> 00:01:44,067
The trial, the end of it, the verdict.

32
00:01:44,202 --> 00:01:49,582
If we drag that out too long, we're going to end up still responding to it a month from now.

33
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:49,987
Yeah.

34
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:57,922
Generally speaking, I feel like most of our decisions over the past six years could have been argumented that they were not the right one.

35
00:01:57,955 --> 00:01:58,747
And yet here we are.

36
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,872
So let's write it out.

37
00:01:59,905 --> 00:02:01,942
It's debatable that we shouldn't be doing this.

38
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,237
I say let it ride.

39
00:02:03,312 --> 00:02:04,672
That's where I'm at.

40
00:02:04,855 --> 00:02:05,377
Yeah.

41
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,642
So I'm glad that sneak weekend was received well by the folks.

42
00:02:09,702 --> 00:02:11,987
Appreciate all the very positive comments.

43
00:02:12,337 --> 00:02:18,757
Overall, I have some other fun stuff that's going on that I can't really talk about right now.

44
00:02:18,835 --> 00:02:25,100
I've seen a couple of great tweets, mostly memes, with animals in them.

45
00:02:26,137 --> 00:02:29,197
I can't remember any of them specifically, but I remember, hey, that was fun.

46
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:29,422
Yeah.

47
00:02:29,455 --> 00:02:30,102
This is an info.

48
00:02:30,132 --> 00:02:32,617
Whereas you're not going to talk about a meme for the next 5 hours.

49
00:02:32,665 --> 00:02:35,082
It doesn't prove anything, just that it was a cute anime.

50
00:02:35,097 --> 00:02:35,987
It was cute.

51
00:02:36,637 --> 00:02:38,622
I guess it's kind of vague, but that's my bright spot.

52
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:44,225
Sort of a combination gestalt, as Alex might say.

53
00:02:44,737 --> 00:02:48,832
I was coming in here thinking very similarly as to what my bright spot was.

54
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:57,792
That kind of just a bit of an achievement, like an accomplishment, but at the same time unlocked.

55
00:02:57,852 --> 00:02:58,117
Yeah.

56
00:02:58,165 --> 00:02:59,825
It's just like we did it.

57
00:03:01,837 --> 00:03:02,332
Yeah.

58
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,207
And now we get to keep doing stuff.

59
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:04,722
Indeed.

60
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:11,892
And so today, what I thought would be fun or something would be nice is to take a little bit of a trip off the beaten path.

61
00:03:11,952 --> 00:03:12,682
Good call.

62
00:03:12,835 --> 00:03:26,647
And instead of doing some of the things that we tend to do, like wacky Wednesday stuff or going to the past, I thought what we would do is talk about Alex Jones appearing as a guest on Stephen Crowder's show.

63
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:27,942
Louder with crowder.

64
00:03:28,002 --> 00:03:28,777
Oh, my God.

65
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,762
So that is we're going to be covering today.

66
00:03:31,825 --> 00:03:32,332
Oh, boy.

67
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,247
Just after he got hit with that billion.

68
00:03:35,442 --> 00:03:36,937
It's right after it is.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,967
So he knows that there's a billion on his head.

70
00:03:40,015 --> 00:03:42,082
This is damage control time.

71
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,442
Right.

72
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:50,397
And one of the reasons that I chose to do this was you see how Alex responds on his show, and it's pretty duragur.

73
00:03:50,517 --> 00:03:53,242
It's going to be the same thing over and over again.

74
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,792
It's going to be very repetitive.

75
00:03:54,852 --> 00:03:56,997
We've heard him say that he didn't do anything on purpose.

76
00:03:57,042 --> 00:04:09,387
And their name maybe there will be some slight variations, some interesting blow ups and what have you, but I wanted to see what it looks like when he's on a different platform trying to preach to a different audience.

77
00:04:09,462 --> 00:04:11,462
Are we going to get a life? Very fragile.

78
00:04:12,262 --> 00:04:13,647
He might be drunk.

79
00:04:13,692 --> 00:04:14,837
There's no apples.

80
00:04:15,937 --> 00:04:19,857
So we'll get down to business on this Jordan, but first, let's say hello to somebody wonk.

81
00:04:19,872 --> 00:04:20,572
Oh, that's a great idea.

82
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:22,177
So first, Mike Best, thank you so much.

83
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,367
You're now a policy wonk.

84
00:04:23,427 --> 00:04:25,627
I'm a policy wonk, thank you very much.

85
00:04:25,795 --> 00:04:33,777
Next, the ghost of Enyo, Morocconi, who's tired of hearing Alex Hugh's ecstasy of gold from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly coming out of ad breaks.

86
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:34,252
Thank you so much.

87
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,407
You're an alpoly walk.

88
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:36,472
I'm a policy walk.

89
00:04:36,505 --> 00:04:37,402
Thank you very much.

90
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:39,567
Boogie was a ghost that's Halloween season.

91
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:41,517
That's very specific ghost.

92
00:04:41,652 --> 00:04:42,807
Next wilford Snipple.

93
00:04:42,822 --> 00:04:44,277
Snabble of the Brooklyn gripple.

94
00:04:44,307 --> 00:04:45,192
Pipples Esquire.

95
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:45,727
Thank you so much.

96
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:46,182
You're an owl.

97
00:04:46,197 --> 00:04:46,917
Policy wonk.

98
00:04:46,977 --> 00:04:47,952
I'm a policy wonk.

99
00:04:47,982 --> 00:04:48,757
Thank you very much.

100
00:04:48,835 --> 00:04:49,572
As a lawyer.

101
00:04:49,617 --> 00:04:50,002
Yeah.

102
00:04:50,095 --> 00:04:51,787
Next, I am not a Russian agent.

103
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:52,527
Svetlana.

104
00:04:52,557 --> 00:04:53,077
Thank you so much.

105
00:04:53,095 --> 00:04:54,177
You're an alpoly wonk.

106
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:55,227
I'm a policy wonk.

107
00:04:55,257 --> 00:04:56,377
Thank you very much.

108
00:04:56,545 --> 00:04:59,197
And Eva, not Ava, thank you so much.

109
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,537
You're an alpoly wonk.

110
00:05:00,612 --> 00:05:01,677
I'm a policy wonk.

111
00:05:01,707 --> 00:05:02,862
Thank you very much, Eva.

112
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:04,807
I'm still not convinced I pronounced it right.

113
00:05:04,885 --> 00:05:09,582
Well, also, we got a technocrat in the mixture, so thank you so much to Hexacult.

114
00:05:09,672 --> 00:05:11,562
You are now a technocrat.

115
00:05:11,637 --> 00:05:12,822
I'm a policy wonk.

116
00:05:12,867 --> 00:05:16,122
I have risen above my enemies.

117
00:05:16,242 --> 00:05:17,632
I might quit tomorrow, actually.

118
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,772
I'm just going to take a little break.

119
00:05:18,805 --> 00:05:29,392
You down a little breaky for me, and then we're going to come back and I'm going to start the show over.

120
00:05:29,515 --> 00:05:30,297
I'm the devil.

121
00:05:30,342 --> 00:05:31,850
I got to be taking over there.

122
00:05:33,487 --> 00:05:35,677
Fuck you, fuck you.

123
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:43,992
I got plenty of words for you, but at the end of the day, fuck you in your new world order, and fuck the horse you rode in on and all your shit.

124
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:46,107
Maybe today's been almost broadcast.

125
00:05:46,272 --> 00:05:48,800
Maybe I'll just be gone a month, maybe five years.

126
00:05:49,612 --> 00:05:53,150
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow and you never see me again.

127
00:05:53,662 --> 00:05:55,642
That's really what I want to do.

128
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,667
I never want to come back here again.

129
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:04,325
I apologize to the crew and the listeners yesterday that I was legitimately having breakdowns on air.

130
00:06:04,837 --> 00:06:07,747
I'll be better tomorrow, please.

131
00:06:07,855 --> 00:06:08,412
Damn.

132
00:06:08,487 --> 00:06:15,327
So I never really wanted to cover Stephen crowder, and we won't generally, but Alex was on his show to whine about the Connecticut verdict.

133
00:06:15,357 --> 00:06:27,667
So I felt like it was important for us to see how Alex was dealing with that whole situation when he's in a new environment, in force broadcasts are primarily for the initiated, whereas something like going on Crowder is hopefully Roping in new people for him.

134
00:06:27,715 --> 00:06:28,102
Right.

135
00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:32,317
Of course, it would be better if he could go on Rogan, but that doesn't seem like it's happening.

136
00:06:32,365 --> 00:06:34,507
So Crowder is going to have to do for now.

137
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,592
I've not sat down to watch a full episode of Crowder before his dumb show.

138
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,542
Louder with crowder.

139
00:06:40,602 --> 00:06:41,137
Yeah.

140
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,622
I don't even know about that name.

141
00:06:42,655 --> 00:06:43,987
I think that's a dumb name.

142
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,062
I have heard louder with crowder.

143
00:06:46,137 --> 00:06:47,847
We've said the name Steven Crowder.

144
00:06:47,892 --> 00:06:50,932
I still have no idea who he is, and I refuse to find out.

145
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,042
It infuriates me every time somebody says louder with crowder.

146
00:06:54,102 --> 00:06:59,317
But, I mean, is it like he yells more than other people? Because I don't think that's I don't know.

147
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,277
I don't like it.

148
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,537
They just picked a word that rhymes with crowder.

149
00:07:03,262 --> 00:07:03,927
With Crowder.

150
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:05,047
And he could have eaten stuff.

151
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,472
It would have been the same idea.

152
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:11,687
Yeah, he doesn't wear, like, more flamboyant outfits, like colorful loud suits.

153
00:07:12,862 --> 00:07:13,925
I don't know.

154
00:07:14,887 --> 00:07:16,012
I think it's a bad name.

155
00:07:16,075 --> 00:07:20,572
See, what you do is you go way too far with it.

156
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:27,202
You know, you go rowdier with Crowdier, you go an extra step that makes everybody really uncomfortable, and that's the way you do it.

157
00:07:27,295 --> 00:07:34,362
I was thinking, like, if I had a show where I did favors for people, I could say pleasing with Freezing.

158
00:07:34,437 --> 00:07:34,977
With Freezing.

159
00:07:35,007 --> 00:07:35,152
Yeah.

160
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:35,962
That would be okay.

161
00:07:36,025 --> 00:07:37,342
I'm mad that I got there.

162
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:44,547
But if we call this show that, it wouldn't make sense, or if I tried to overthrow a government, I could be Treason with Freezing.

163
00:07:44,592 --> 00:07:44,797
Sure.

164
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,287
But this show again, that name wouldn't work.

165
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,337
If I had a travel show, it could be Romes with Homes.

166
00:07:50,412 --> 00:07:51,052
Definitely.

167
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,697
Or a bookshow tomes with homes.

168
00:07:53,742 --> 00:07:54,727
OOH, that's a good one.

169
00:07:54,745 --> 00:07:56,212
Yeah, I think I should have that show.

170
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:56,947
Yeah.

171
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,282
See, these work.

172
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,822
Yes, these make sense because they would be about the thing that they are.

173
00:08:01,855 --> 00:08:04,762
It's good when a rhyme fits right.

174
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:06,147
It's silly when it's forced.

175
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:13,357
When I don't understand what Louder With Crowder means, he should have to be regularly a decibel level above other shows.

176
00:08:13,435 --> 00:08:14,652
Yours, I demand.

177
00:08:14,757 --> 00:08:15,517
Louder than him.

178
00:08:15,565 --> 00:08:16,562
I demand.

179
00:08:17,437 --> 00:08:22,182
So there's one thing that immediately jumped out to me watching the show, and that was that the show is very dumb.

180
00:08:22,272 --> 00:08:24,057
Like, it's transparently dumb.

181
00:08:24,147 --> 00:08:27,612
Arguments are based on false points, and the humor is painful.

182
00:08:27,762 --> 00:08:32,307
The thing you have to realize when you watch this is that it's kind of supposed to be dumb.

183
00:08:32,397 --> 00:08:37,617
The audience of the show is, as Steven Crowder has tweeted about before it's.

184
00:08:37,677 --> 00:08:40,617
At least half of the audience is under 16.

185
00:08:40,752 --> 00:08:48,427
So this show with children, and I haven't been able to confirm that figure in any way, but he said it, and I have no reason to doubt it.

186
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,392
He has the analytics.

187
00:08:49,452 --> 00:08:51,742
Can you do that? I guess you can.

188
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,742
I feel like this is as bad as smoking.

189
00:08:53,802 --> 00:08:58,092
Like pushing right wing bullshit to children is as bad as advertising for smoking.

190
00:08:58,152 --> 00:09:02,442
To be fair, half of the audience is between 17 and 18.

191
00:09:02,577 --> 00:09:03,097
I don't know.

192
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:03,322
Great.

193
00:09:03,355 --> 00:09:04,627
There might be some adults in that.

194
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:05,047
Okay.

195
00:09:05,155 --> 00:09:11,202
One of the reasons I've avoided doing too much about Crowder up till this point is that he has a lot of his content behind paywalls.

196
00:09:11,307 --> 00:09:21,967
For instance, the last time Alex was on for his weird performatively masculine cigar club session, the first part of it was public, but then the rest of it that you'd actually want to watch is not.

197
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:28,475
We may be coming to a point where I stop over respecting these dingdongs intellectual property, but I don't think I'm quite there yet.

198
00:09:28,912 --> 00:09:30,912
Steven crowder is repugnant.

199
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:44,637
He's a horrible person, and his career has been a shameful series of horrible embarrassments that he's been able to parlay into having a very successful YouTube talk show that appeals to kids with sophomoric racist jokes and sophomoric anti LGBTQ jokes.

200
00:09:44,787 --> 00:09:50,622
I don't want to do too deep a dive on his trajectory, but here's a summation of his career path.

201
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:50,962
Okay.

202
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:52,497
He tried to be a standup comedian.

203
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:53,377
Buddy sucked at it.

204
00:09:53,395 --> 00:09:55,662
So a right wing educator.

205
00:09:55,737 --> 00:10:01,467
Griffith catching the attention of Fox News when he got punched in the face by a union protester who he was harassing.

206
00:10:01,527 --> 00:10:01,927
Great.

207
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:14,367
This rose his stature, and he began making his own content, most notably a segment called Change My Mind, where he would show up at a college campus and sit at a table waiting for college students on their way to class to join him for a spirited debate.

208
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:15,367
That's that guy.

209
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,837
He's the meme of the guy with the shit.

210
00:10:19,237 --> 00:10:20,182
Oh, my God.

211
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,187
Fuck that guy.

212
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:21,652
Yeah.

213
00:10:21,745 --> 00:10:27,667
The college student was, of course, unprepared and probably late for class, and Steve could edit the videos however he wanted.

214
00:10:27,715 --> 00:10:29,227
So the series was a big hit.

215
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:37,627
It kind of falls into the same vein as Mark Dyson's Man on the street segments, where he bothers drunk people on the boardwalk and then tries to make a political point out of it.

216
00:10:37,795 --> 00:10:49,597
As his profile has grown, stephen has made a habit out of being a pile of shit, doing half cooked segments based on deeply racist and anti LGBTQ talking points that are easily debunkable and not persuasive at all.

217
00:10:49,705 --> 00:10:52,625
Well, they're not persuasive at all to adults, I should say.

218
00:10:53,062 --> 00:10:58,122
They all might be very convincing to a child who are naturally his target.

219
00:10:58,167 --> 00:10:59,587
See, but that's the problem.

220
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:04,432
We understand that's the problem with the problem, because we know about it because of the smoking thing.

221
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,577
It's illegal to smoke.

222
00:11:05,607 --> 00:11:07,372
It's illegal to advertise for children.

223
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,812
We got to figure this shit out.

224
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:17,097
In essence, his show is about taking extreme rightwing views and dangerous rightwing ideologues and laundering them so they can be enjoyed and accepted by high schoolers.

225
00:11:17,217 --> 00:11:17,632
Basically.

226
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,567
I think he's one of the worst folks in this space.

227
00:11:19,615 --> 00:11:22,992
But also, I don't know what our show can really add to that conversation.

228
00:11:23,127 --> 00:11:28,387
If YouTube cared at all about the safety of the children and teens who use the platform, he would have been kicked off long ago.

229
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,117
And that's really, I think, probably the solution here.

230
00:11:31,165 --> 00:11:32,872
If they want to do something about it.

231
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:40,400
He can't really do that much damage if he's just limited to being on Glenn Beck's Blaze network or his own thing, fine.

232
00:11:41,362 --> 00:11:43,132
Limit his reach quite a bit.

233
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,397
Make it more difficult for kids to find it.

234
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,707
It's so weird.

235
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:51,177
That's like having a Hannah Montana show where they take the Montana part really literally.

236
00:11:51,207 --> 00:11:52,632
And she's a white nationalist.

237
00:11:52,722 --> 00:11:53,742
She's got a compound.

238
00:11:53,802 --> 00:11:54,725
Yeah, exactly.

239
00:11:55,387 --> 00:11:56,607
Hannah Montana.

240
00:11:56,697 --> 00:12:04,162
And here, kids, first I'm going to transfer her into pop star, and then we're going to find out exactly how the great replacement theory really works.

241
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:06,312
Kids, with this happy song.

242
00:12:06,387 --> 00:12:09,787
Yeah, I mean, like he's had Stefan Molyneux on.

243
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,257
Okay, well, then there we go.

244
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:16,792
To give you some idea of the people he's laundering, is Alex on at least multiple times.

245
00:12:16,915 --> 00:12:20,827
I don't have a full guest list for him, but you don't really need one at certain point.

246
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,327
Noted.

247
00:12:21,357 --> 00:12:24,312
Hilarious white nationalist Stefan Maldineu.

248
00:12:24,387 --> 00:12:25,212
That's generous.

249
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:25,882
Yeah.

250
00:12:26,035 --> 00:12:30,717
Anyway, in the aftermath of the Connecticut verdict, alex went on to discuss the situation with Steven.

251
00:12:30,777 --> 00:12:33,657
And here we are to give you some sense of the scene.

252
00:12:33,747 --> 00:12:38,527
Stephen is sitting in his studio at a desk with two louder with crowder mugs on it.

253
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,947
He sells mugs and he has this thing called the Mug Club.

254
00:12:40,992 --> 00:12:43,092
So this is a very important piece of the tableau.

255
00:12:43,152 --> 00:12:43,672
Oh, my God.

256
00:12:43,705 --> 00:12:47,647
He's also wearing one of his own shirts because you always got to be pushing that merch, man.

257
00:12:47,755 --> 00:12:50,517
Always be selling don't wear your own shirt.

258
00:12:50,577 --> 00:12:54,777
And he's wearing an overtheshoulder holster, so you know that he loves guns.

259
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:59,667
I'm sorry, what? Yeah, he's wearing a holster like he's a police chief.

260
00:12:59,802 --> 00:13:01,752
Where in the world is Carmen? San Diego.

261
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:06,142
You got to know that he's strapped and ready in case a duel breaks out during the show.

262
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:07,707
Listen up, gum shoes.

263
00:13:07,797 --> 00:13:10,612
Also, there's another gun on the desk, so it's pretty.

264
00:13:10,675 --> 00:13:12,567
What a fucking more pretty ridiculous.

265
00:13:12,627 --> 00:13:13,782
Those are not loaded.

266
00:13:13,872 --> 00:13:15,297
What's? Pathetic.

267
00:13:15,492 --> 00:13:20,187
It might be projecting a little bit too much strength in bravado for me to take that at all seriously.

268
00:13:20,262 --> 00:13:28,222
Indiana Jones alex is on towards the end of the show, but this whole episode is more or less about rationalizing Alex's verdict and complaining about it.

269
00:13:28,255 --> 00:13:31,167
And it's titled exclusive Interview with Alex Jones.

270
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,302
This means war.

271
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,682
Exclamation point.

272
00:13:33,835 --> 00:13:37,867
So to get a sense of the temperature, I wanted to start at the beginning and see the tone we're working with.

273
00:13:37,915 --> 00:13:41,992
Although you will find out that I did not end up sticking to that.

274
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,667
Yeah, good call.

275
00:13:42,715 --> 00:13:43,867
Skipped ahead to a while.

276
00:13:43,915 --> 00:13:45,502
It showed up at a certain point.

277
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,812
I was like, this show's so dumb.

278
00:13:46,887 --> 00:13:49,837
Listen, if you say failed comedian, I'm not interested.

279
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,950
And that's why I don't listen to our show.

280
00:13:52,537 --> 00:13:57,802
So here's where we start off, and I think that this is some load of shit to start.

281
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:02,525
Hey, if I sound windy, it's because I've been running around here, we've been testing, making sure that everything works.

282
00:14:03,637 --> 00:14:09,627
Look, Alex Jones on the show today, and I would appreciate look, I know that many of you have different opinions.

283
00:14:09,657 --> 00:14:11,707
Let me just give you a little bit of a rundown here.

284
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,950
I was not an Alex Jones fan for a very long time.

285
00:14:16,687 --> 00:14:21,950
I made it known I had criticized him here on this show, and I still have criticisms of them.

286
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,822
But we're at a point right now, and we'll be talking about this today.

287
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:33,892
We'll be showing you a montage of the end zone dance from not only the elites in Hollywood, not only the elites in media, but the elites in government.

288
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:38,977
Government officials actually championing this silencing real quick.

289
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:45,757
This is like a clip of Jimmy Kimmel making a joke and the government officials are jensaki tweeted something.

290
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:50,917
She's not even the press secretary anymore, and Alex made a big target out of her for a while.

291
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:59,797
I would not be surprised if she received quite a bit of harassment that probably wouldn't be legally actionable since she's a public figure, all that.

292
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:05,727
But yeah, they're making a bit of a professional, maybe a little bit more personal of speech.

293
00:15:05,757 --> 00:15:07,672
And that is absolutely what it is.

294
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:12,592
Regardless of where you line up, there's an inflection point right now in this country.

295
00:15:12,715 --> 00:15:19,452
And the reason that we're having Alex Jones on and we've had him on is because I hate seeing people being bullied.

296
00:15:19,557 --> 00:15:21,822
This couldn't be further from the truth.

297
00:15:21,942 --> 00:15:28,302
Steven loves a good bit of bullying, and he actually leads bullying campaigns sometimes, like he did in the case of Carlos Maza.

298
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:31,467
Also, Alex isn't being bullied, he's the bully.

299
00:15:31,527 --> 00:15:34,732
And Steven's trying to launder that reality to his audience of children.

300
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,427
So they think that Alex is the victim here.

301
00:15:36,445 --> 00:15:37,947
And I think that's shameful.

302
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:42,447
Also, Steven is saying that he has criticisms of Alex, and I think he's a coward.

303
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:43,797
List your criticisms.

304
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:44,182
Yeah.

305
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,012
What are they? Yes to his face.

306
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:46,612
Try that.

307
00:15:46,675 --> 00:15:46,897
Yeah.

308
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,950
See if you get an answer on any of them.

309
00:15:49,312 --> 00:15:55,887
The rest of the things that you like about him, see how long those survive after you give him one small criticism.

310
00:15:55,962 --> 00:16:00,457
Well, I think that Alex would probably dodge and stuff because he needs someone like Stephen now.

311
00:16:00,535 --> 00:16:04,137
He has like five plus million subscribers on YouTube.

312
00:16:04,212 --> 00:16:04,867
Really? Yeah.

313
00:16:04,915 --> 00:16:08,937
So Alex needs that kind of a platform because he's not going to get it from Rogen.

314
00:16:09,012 --> 00:16:09,650
Right.

315
00:16:10,087 --> 00:16:17,047
And there aren't a whole lot of other options that Alex has in terms of who is going to be a giant platform for me to go on.

316
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,587
Right.

317
00:16:17,725 --> 00:16:20,322
I have to go start talking to Twitch Streamers.

318
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:20,862
Jesus.

319
00:16:20,937 --> 00:16:21,397
Yeah.

320
00:16:21,505 --> 00:16:22,912
Hassan have me on.

321
00:16:22,975 --> 00:16:23,887
He's going to have to.

322
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,325
That's where he's going to be.

323
00:16:25,987 --> 00:16:32,272
So I think that he could get away with voicing some of these criticisms to Alex, whatever they might be.

324
00:16:32,305 --> 00:16:32,497
Sure.

325
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:39,327
But he wouldn't get any response that's meaningful or any resolution of these, of course, or even recognition of these criticisms.

326
00:16:39,357 --> 00:16:40,197
No, they'd be a dodge.

327
00:16:40,242 --> 00:17:01,567
I think that it would be far more meaningful for him to express what his misgivings are and what his criticisms are of Alex to the audience in a neutral environment where they could take those criticisms in and then decide, like, is that something I'm actually really concerned about too? Well, one of my criticisms maybe it's he lies all the time.

328
00:17:01,615 --> 00:17:02,825
That could be an issue.

329
00:17:03,187 --> 00:17:23,032
Well, if one of your criticisms prior to an interview is my interview subject is an inveterate and almost pathological liar, perhaps he will take those answers that he gives in the interview with a different grain of salt as opposed to if you didn't tell them that at all.

330
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:23,662
Right.

331
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:29,932
And I was thinking one of his sort of criticisms of Alex might be that he barely thinks that Muslims are human.

332
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:30,667
That's an issue.

333
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:33,697
But I think that Stephen's audience wouldn't have as much of a problem with that.

334
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:34,732
No, they'd be still.

335
00:17:34,885 --> 00:17:44,002
So, you know, he tries to frame the interview in a particular way and obviously it's that Alex didn't know.

336
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,725
He didn't do that much wrong.

337
00:17:46,312 --> 00:17:54,500
When you have someone like Alex Jones who if you've watched his career and I do consider him a friend now I will say this on a personal level, he's been around.

338
00:17:55,162 --> 00:17:57,967
From what I know of him, he's a good man, a flawed man.

339
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,347
He's talked about it here on air.

340
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:01,177
To me it's refreshing when he's on air.

341
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:07,242
He was on air Nash Wednesday and said, maybe I drink a little too much and he'll tell you about his flaws.

342
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:24,607
But for a man who speaks publicly for hours on end and then misspeaks or gets something wrong and then apologizes and then is punished anyway and then the government jumps in.

343
00:18:24,685 --> 00:18:25,102
People.

344
00:18:25,195 --> 00:18:26,667
I guess former press secretary.

345
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:30,142
But current members of the government and entities who are backed by the government.

346
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,332
Be it banks.

347
00:18:31,497 --> 00:18:37,297
Be it big tech organizations deciding to put you in stocks in the town square.

348
00:18:37,405 --> 00:18:42,547
The message is really loud with crowd and I hope that you're hearing it.

349
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:53,842
If you make a mistake, not only is there a double standard which will talk about if you have a belief that other people find to be offensive and of course at the sliding scale, we know that we've gone further and further down the trail here.

350
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,317
Look behind you, there's a slippery slope.

351
00:18:55,377 --> 00:18:56,017
Shut up.

352
00:18:56,065 --> 00:18:59,150
Can you apologize? Shut the fuck up.

353
00:18:59,737 --> 00:19:00,987
They only get worse.

354
00:19:01,062 --> 00:19:08,257
What? I mean, then the left why is it left or right? They made it left or right.

355
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:09,162
This is tough.

356
00:19:09,237 --> 00:19:11,142
This is fucking horrendous.

357
00:19:11,277 --> 00:19:15,112
What just happened? People watch this shit? I guess so.

358
00:19:15,175 --> 00:19:16,027
Oh my God.

359
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:21,612
What is wrong with me? Why is it why am I the weirdo here? That is horrendous.

360
00:19:21,687 --> 00:19:22,747
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

361
00:19:22,855 --> 00:19:26,592
But what he's doing here is a clear attempt to set the parameters of the conversations.

362
00:19:26,727 --> 00:19:30,517
It's just being taken as gospel that Alex misspoke or got some things wrong.

363
00:19:30,565 --> 00:19:32,617
He apologized and he's been punished anyway.

364
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,467
That's what all the episode will be in response to.

365
00:19:35,515 --> 00:19:37,917
And because of that it's going to be meaningless.

366
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:44,092
If the basis and the foundation that you're building your house on is sand, you're not going to have a good house.

367
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,812
Yeah, it's not going to be a house that I'm even going to inspect.

368
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:49,587
I mean, because it's going to collapse.

369
00:19:49,662 --> 00:19:53,712
Also, this stuff is already a little overdramatic.

370
00:19:53,787 --> 00:19:54,425
Yeah.

371
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:55,642
A little while.

372
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:02,092
Dramatic on Crowder's part to put you in the stock if you disagree with them.

373
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:14,962
Here's the problem, okay? I feel like the stocks would have been a more effective response to Alex then what is happening right now if we had actually been like at the very beginning, like, hey, you've done fucked up.

374
00:20:15,025 --> 00:20:16,152
You misspoke.

375
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,887
And maybe that's what happened.

376
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,422
Maybe you misspoke, but guess what? You fucked up.

377
00:20:20,455 --> 00:20:27,192
So you go in the stocks for a week and then everybody hits you with tomatoes and shit and then we'll see if it's a misspeaking.

378
00:20:27,252 --> 00:20:28,400
If you do it again.

379
00:20:28,837 --> 00:20:32,497
Can I request that the tomatoes be soaked in booze? Yes you may.

380
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:32,677
OK.

381
00:20:32,695 --> 00:20:33,427
Yes you may.

382
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,722
That's just a consideration.

383
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:38,312
That's a consideration for all of our stocks clients.

384
00:20:39,337 --> 00:20:42,687
So again, more setting the table.

385
00:20:42,762 --> 00:20:43,177
Sure.

386
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,757
I don't care if you agree with Alex Jones or not.

387
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,150
It doesn't matter.

388
00:20:47,962 --> 00:20:57,512
And by the way, this is so clear, it's so obvious that that's a big reason that the court said you cannot argue that this is political persecution.

389
00:20:58,537 --> 00:21:07,077
Do you understand? That was the trial was predicated, wasn't even allowed to argue that because it didn't provide additional finances.

390
00:21:07,107 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm not saying mistakes weren't made across the board, but I hope that all of you understand.

391
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,302
So look, Steven made a bit of a mistake there.

392
00:21:14,395 --> 00:21:24,042
He says, quote, I'm not saying that mistakes weren't made across the board, which tells me very clearly that he understands that actions Alex and his lawyers made during the discovery process led to the default.

393
00:21:24,102 --> 00:21:28,672
Now, I'm against consequences as a principle, right? Yeah.

394
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:37,257
Stevens just trying to hand wave that away and encourage this adolescent audience from giving any validity to people who would tell them that the default was very much earned.

395
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:45,792
He's basically doing PR work for Alex and it's ridiculous if you have the awareness that mistakes were made on both sides.

396
00:21:45,852 --> 00:21:50,542
Hey, let's talk about what those mistakes were that Alex made because it's going to be a mountain of them.

397
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:55,992
It's going to be enough to very clearly justify a default judgment.

398
00:21:56,052 --> 00:21:57,697
Yeah, I mean, it is.

399
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:05,772
We talked about it with Liz just a little bit, but that idea of, like, when Alex is in the courtroom, not allowed to do Alex shit.

400
00:22:05,967 --> 00:22:09,062
People aren't convinced by Alex shit.

401
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:13,447
It's because of the priming, like, crowder is priming people.

402
00:22:13,555 --> 00:22:17,797
If you just talk to Alex Cold totally, it would not you be like, oh, fuck you.

403
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,402
You need to lose a billion dollars.

404
00:22:19,495 --> 00:22:20,937
Just a basic conversation.

405
00:22:21,012 --> 00:22:26,012
Just like, what the fuck is this guy talking about? What are you doing? Why are you bringing up Hillary? Leave me alone.

406
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:30,222
Or even like, these people are so young who are watching Steven.

407
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:31,632
They might be like who's? Hilary.

408
00:22:31,722 --> 00:22:38,802
What is happening? So Steve has some interesting thoughts about the idea of debanking.

409
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:55,522
You are at a point in this country where you are paying taxes to fund the theft of food from the mouth of your kids, all under the guise of a First Amendment, only protects the government stopping you from saying something.

410
00:22:55,705 --> 00:22:56,452
That's all it does.

411
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,387
It prevents the government from stopping you.

412
00:22:58,525 --> 00:23:07,262
OK, by that same token, shouldn't JP Morgan, shouldn't JP Chase, whatever their abbreviation is, these things are all these giant conglomerates.

413
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:10,302
If they're backed by our tax dollars, they're guaranteed.

414
00:23:10,332 --> 00:23:30,412
If they received hundreds of billions of dollars, and if you adjust for inflation the last few months, hundreds of treasury dollars in taxpayer dollars, are they allowed to deny you your fundamental constitutional rights? What point do we separate private business from government? I don't even know what the point is here.

415
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:35,612
And I think the only way that this argument actually works is if Stephen is advocating nationalizing.

416
00:23:36,037 --> 00:23:42,125
What are you doing? Yeah, I know that he's not, because that's some straight up lemon judge, obviously.

417
00:23:43,612 --> 00:23:44,967
You fucking moron.

418
00:23:45,027 --> 00:24:05,797
I don't know if, like, the banking industry taking government money means that they're bound by all the rules the government entities are, but if we were to nationalize the banks, then you'd have a good argument here that they should have to follow the same guidelines of the yeah, he doesn't get that at all.

419
00:24:05,905 --> 00:24:11,877
Like, zero awareness of what he's actually advocating for is he's such a piece of shit.

420
00:24:11,907 --> 00:24:13,897
He's gone through to the other side.

421
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:19,252
He's like, See, the problem with cancel culture is we need to nationalize the banking system.

422
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:34,787
Is that what he's trying to say? I think that if you take this thought a little bit further, you also start to understand how dumb, like, his version of it is, which is like, I guess it's that if they take tax dollars, then they're bound by those rules.

423
00:24:35,287 --> 00:24:54,037
What about people who are on Social Security? Do they have to follow all the government's guidelines? What do you do? Or what about farmers who take subsidies? Do you want everybody who takes any kind of thing from the government to now be beholden to all the same rules, because then we get into a really weird place.

424
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:54,725
Right.

425
00:24:55,087 --> 00:25:06,232
I think what we're seeing is what happens to people when they're allowed to speak by themselves with no disagreement, and they aren't capable of disagreeing with themselves.

426
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:12,747
Do you know what I mean? Like, when I have a thought that's that dumb, another part of my brain will be like, don't say that out loud.

427
00:25:12,867 --> 00:25:17,077
And then I'll be like, Why shouldn't I say that out loud? And it'll have a really good point, and I'll be like, Good call.

428
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,222
And then you say it out loud.

429
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:19,207
Yeah, well, obviously.

430
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:21,650
But I do it as a funny voice and I'll be fine.

431
00:25:22,012 --> 00:25:23,797
But he doesn't have that.

432
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,532
He doesn't have it.

433
00:25:24,535 --> 00:25:25,572
And he just talks by himself.

434
00:25:25,617 --> 00:25:28,257
So nobody's like, Stop it, that's dumb.

435
00:25:28,347 --> 00:25:35,332
Well, the first thing that happens when you're in that kind of a predicament is you start to wear shoulder holsters for no reason.

436
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,350
Oh, my God.

437
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:41,182
And then the second thing that happens is yeah, I really still can't believe that.

438
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:45,672
I understand that you're describing something that has to be real, but I'm seeing it as a cartoon.

439
00:25:45,717 --> 00:25:46,767
No, it is cartoonish.

440
00:25:46,827 --> 00:25:48,232
Okay, good.

441
00:25:48,385 --> 00:25:50,472
So he has two co hosts.

442
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,552
I don't know their names.

443
00:25:51,582 --> 00:25:53,422
I don't remember them because I don't care.

444
00:25:53,605 --> 00:25:57,762
And they have a little bit of a wrap.

445
00:25:57,912 --> 00:26:01,162
They sit down and they really work out some of the issues.

446
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,692
They talk about the big issue.

447
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,497
You are setting me up for disaster.

448
00:26:04,542 --> 00:26:07,267
Well, I don't know if you know this, but the Parkland trial has been going.

449
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:07,837
My God.

450
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,525
No.

451
00:26:09,037 --> 00:26:09,502
All right.

452
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,142
By the way, they're doing the Parkland shooting.

453
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,777
They reached a verdict that they're going to announce.

454
00:26:12,807 --> 00:26:19,337
Isn't it just guilty and fry them? I mean, I thought this was a pretty closed let me know when we have the broadcast, Vegas.

455
00:26:19,837 --> 00:26:21,437
When I know the guy is dead.

456
00:26:21,862 --> 00:26:24,447
Maybe some facts about maybe about Sutherland Springs.

457
00:26:24,492 --> 00:26:26,332
Fifth deadliest in American history.

458
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:34,692
Okay, so I guess they just want death penalty, which is I mean, they're pretty anti government as a whole, but I guess they want death penalty.

459
00:26:34,752 --> 00:26:39,897
And I guess they also don't want due process because they just want you to be found guilty and then death penalty.

460
00:26:40,092 --> 00:26:48,277
Has anybody ever stopped to think about what these people would do if they could write the Constitution again? It would be a mess.

461
00:26:48,370 --> 00:27:02,842
Can you imagine? What do they think government does? Is the first question that I have to nothing but kill you and everything? And also I want them to be able to kill me, but as long as I'm the only person who can decide, right.

462
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:06,875
Why is that always the underpinning of no taxes? Exactly.

463
00:27:07,237 --> 00:27:10,912
I want the government to not exist and also to kill people I don't like.

464
00:27:10,975 --> 00:27:11,332
Yes.

465
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:15,007
One of the things that I think is really funny, too, is that Stephen realizes midsense, that the.

466
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:15,477
Las Vegas.

467
00:27:15,507 --> 00:27:16,407
Shooter is dead.

468
00:27:16,497 --> 00:27:20,967
And for what it's worth, the perpetrator of the Sutherland Spring shooting is also dead.

469
00:27:21,102 --> 00:27:24,027
There is plenty of information available about both of these events.

470
00:27:24,057 --> 00:27:28,852
If Steven would like to take the time to read, I would explain things to him.

471
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:32,272
If he brought up specific points, I would be happy to get into it.

472
00:27:32,305 --> 00:27:36,742
But he just says the names of these shootings and then pretends there's a cover up.

473
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:40,100
So I got nothing to be useless show.

474
00:27:40,462 --> 00:27:40,912
Okay.

475
00:27:40,975 --> 00:27:41,787
Teleporter.

476
00:27:41,862 --> 00:27:42,682
Give it to me.

477
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,487
And I just tackle people whenever they say dumb shit.

478
00:27:48,037 --> 00:27:49,272
I'm not a superhero.

479
00:27:49,317 --> 00:27:50,707
I don't solve problems.

480
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:57,502
I will just show up immediately after Steven Crowder says something insane like that, tackle him, and then teleport away.

481
00:27:57,595 --> 00:28:00,112
And I feel like that's a worthy, noble cause.

482
00:28:00,175 --> 00:28:03,487
Well, I mean, you'll get arrested for assault, but that trial teleport away.

483
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:06,702
That trial would be really interesting because I delegate.

484
00:28:06,882 --> 00:28:09,682
Well, even if you didn't, right.

485
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,477
The prosecution would have to deal with the fact that you teleported.

486
00:28:12,507 --> 00:28:13,850
Yeah, that would be an issue.

487
00:28:14,212 --> 00:28:17,122
You would have to discuss the mechanism of you teleporting away.

488
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:19,187
And I'd be like, Ah, that doesn't exist.

489
00:28:19,537 --> 00:28:20,750
Teleport away.

490
00:28:21,187 --> 00:28:22,647
Reasonable doubt.

491
00:28:22,842 --> 00:28:29,167
So they are apparently doing some shows, some live shows, and there's a plug for one.

492
00:28:29,215 --> 00:28:31,792
And this is where I kind of lost my interest in this show as a whole.

493
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,450
Yeah.

494
00:28:33,037 --> 00:28:35,502
Tell me if you think this feels a little bit racist.

495
00:28:35,532 --> 00:28:36,202
Here we go.

496
00:28:36,295 --> 00:28:39,717
And then not Baltimore December 3, because we couldn't find a venue in DC.

497
00:28:39,777 --> 00:28:41,442
Sorry, you have to go to the Shill.

498
00:28:41,577 --> 00:28:42,522
That is Baltimore.

499
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:45,357
But, hey, at least it's not Haiti or DC.

500
00:28:45,522 --> 00:28:46,812
Yeah, or DC.

501
00:28:46,962 --> 00:28:48,492
Now, Baltimore is worse than DC.

502
00:28:48,552 --> 00:28:50,862
Is it? It's DC without any of the charms.

503
00:28:51,012 --> 00:28:52,625
Well, I mean, the people.

504
00:28:53,137 --> 00:28:53,767
Sure.

505
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,382
And you can go to Yikes.

506
00:28:56,547 --> 00:28:58,025
It doesn't feel good.

507
00:28:58,462 --> 00:29:20,000
What do you think these three dudes associate with Haiti, Baltimore, and DC? What do you think is there, like, when they open their mind's eye to see the things that they associate with Baltimore, DC, and Haiti? Yeah, it's a little and when he says it's the people.

508
00:29:20,437 --> 00:29:21,200
Yeah.

509
00:29:22,462 --> 00:29:23,272
Come on.

510
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:23,892
Quiet.

511
00:29:23,952 --> 00:29:24,592
Quiet part.

512
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,867
That's the quiet part.

513
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,202
I wrote the book on it.

514
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,172
But, hey, they're jokes.

515
00:29:29,217 --> 00:29:29,697
They're joking.

516
00:29:29,742 --> 00:29:31,337
They're going on a comedy tour.

517
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:38,362
So Alex shows up, and he's a pro mr.

518
00:29:38,425 --> 00:29:38,847
Jones.

519
00:29:38,892 --> 00:29:40,632
Okay, I see that smirk.

520
00:29:40,647 --> 00:29:45,177
What were you saying? Was that a dirty joke? No, I said, I'm really jealous of that shirt.

521
00:29:45,207 --> 00:29:46,812
I'm going to rip it off, make my own coffee.

522
00:29:46,887 --> 00:29:49,327
Well, I thought come on now.

523
00:29:49,345 --> 00:29:52,332
Well, then I want you to cool a shirt.

524
00:29:52,422 --> 00:29:54,007
That is the coolest shirt I've seen.

525
00:29:54,085 --> 00:29:55,100
Yes, absolutely.

526
00:29:55,762 --> 00:30:06,847
But no, but what you're talking about is absolutely true, and I'd love to give everybody the inside baseball, what really happened with the case, how it's the precedent setter and where it's going, because Alex 1 second.

527
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,077
Alex.

528
00:30:07,107 --> 00:30:08,142
Because I want to give you the floor.

529
00:30:08,202 --> 00:30:08,692
Okay.

530
00:30:08,815 --> 00:30:11,692
Alex is trying to steamroll him, which is great.

531
00:30:11,815 --> 00:30:17,592
And then the second thing that's awesome is right when he comes out the gate, Alex flatters.

532
00:30:17,652 --> 00:30:19,317
Steven was like, that's a great shirt.

533
00:30:19,377 --> 00:30:23,762
But then also establishes himself as an Alpha by saying, I'm going to steal your shirt.

534
00:30:24,637 --> 00:30:25,637
Dominance.

535
00:30:26,512 --> 00:30:27,192
Dominance.

536
00:30:27,252 --> 00:30:27,742
Move.

537
00:30:27,865 --> 00:30:32,602
Dad tries to steamroll him, and Steve would have to be like, Hold on, now, hold on.

538
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,762
I think he's supposed to be a host here.

539
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:47,472
It is interesting the way he both tries to acknowledge that he's not going to win the steamroll competition and at the same time try and establish dominance on his own show by saying, I'm going to let you steamroll me, Alex.

540
00:30:47,517 --> 00:30:48,125
Right.

541
00:30:49,612 --> 00:30:54,807
No one can win a steamrolling competition against the bullhorn trainer.

542
00:30:54,972 --> 00:30:57,657
That is Alex Jones, bullhorn expert.

543
00:30:57,822 --> 00:31:03,772
So, Steven, the reason that he wants to pretend to be a host in some ways is because he knows who Alex is.

544
00:31:03,805 --> 00:31:14,137
He knows how he communicates, and he also knows that without guidance, alex is going to say just whatever the fuck he wants, and it's not going to be a useful interview for him.

545
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:20,182
And he's going to do the thing that he's trying to tell people right now that he has apologized for.

546
00:31:20,335 --> 00:31:21,950
He's going to defame those.

547
00:31:22,612 --> 00:31:24,142
You don't know if he is or not.

548
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:24,942
There's a danger.

549
00:31:25,002 --> 00:31:25,402
Yeah.

550
00:31:25,495 --> 00:31:27,537
It's very close to being an inevitability.

551
00:31:27,612 --> 00:31:30,042
You want to have some guide ray rules.

552
00:31:30,102 --> 00:31:30,412
Right.

553
00:31:30,475 --> 00:31:32,902
And that's kind of what Steven is trying to do.

554
00:31:32,995 --> 00:31:42,425
And so I want to leave this right now because I think this is pivotal, and we've done several multi hour long shows, but for some reason, this gets lost, and I want you to correct me if I have this wrong.

555
00:31:43,387 --> 00:31:53,017
So, in 2017, as an example, because the narrative is Sandy Hook, you torment to the parents, you call them out by name, and you continually harass them.

556
00:31:53,065 --> 00:31:55,057
From what I understand, and I have some quotes here in front of me.

557
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,707
I want you to tell me if I'm misquoting you.

558
00:31:56,785 --> 00:31:58,992
You admitted you were wrong, and you apologize.

559
00:31:59,052 --> 00:32:01,672
And I think that's key because I still want to go after you anyway.

560
00:32:01,705 --> 00:32:04,222
So, 2017, you talked about epiphany he had on Father's Day.

561
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:13,752
You said, Forgive me on Father's Day, I want to reach out to the parents of the slain children at the horrible tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut, and give you my sincere condolences.

562
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:17,302
You said that, right? Yes.

563
00:32:17,395 --> 00:32:17,602
Okay.

564
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:31,617
You also said, I'd also like to reach out to any of the parents who lost a child at Newtown to invite them to contact me to open a dialogue, because I think it's really essential we do that instead of letting the mainstream media misrepresent things and really try and drive this nation apart.

565
00:32:31,677 --> 00:32:34,792
You said that right before they sued me.

566
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,172
Yes, before they sued you.

567
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:48,852
And then in 2019, in deposition, he said, and I myself have almost like a form of psychosis in the past where I basically thought everything was staged, even though I've now learned a lot of times things aren't staged.

568
00:32:48,882 --> 00:32:51,177
And I'm not saying this to embarrass you, Alice.

569
00:32:51,207 --> 00:32:58,347
I'm saying it because you were clear and that you had a change of heart or you believed that you were wrong or you believed you made a mistake, which I think is admirable.

570
00:32:58,392 --> 00:33:02,667
And I think the fact that they want to browbeat you after that is what is so scary.

571
00:33:02,802 --> 00:33:18,052
Steven sure does seem to be ignoring the fact that in Alex's video that was titled his Final Statement on Sandy Hook, he literally said, quote, if children were lost in Sandy Hook, my heart goes out to each and every one of those parents and the people who say they're parents that I see on the news.

572
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:25,687
The only problem is I've seen a lot of soap operas, and I've seen actors before, and I know when I'm watching a movie and when I'm watching something real.

573
00:33:25,825 --> 00:33:28,002
That was in late 2016.

574
00:33:28,182 --> 00:33:33,457
Alex only said the things that Stevens reading because of the Meghan Kelly interview that was about to come out.

575
00:33:33,535 --> 00:33:37,627
Alex knew was going to come out around Father's Day, and Neil Heslin was going to be interviewed in it.

576
00:33:37,645 --> 00:33:39,927
So he was trying to get ahead of any controversy.

577
00:33:40,032 --> 00:33:47,427
He was also still repeating the basic conspiracy theories about the shooting at this point, just holding back some things that he thought could be legally actionable.

578
00:33:47,607 --> 00:34:01,947
Stevens also ignoring that after this point, owen Schreueer did his video about how Neil Hesling couldn't have held his son after the shooting, and Alex reported on that, which in many ways, really does undo any good will that he might want to pretend he has from his feigned apology.

579
00:34:02,142 --> 00:34:10,422
Stevens also ignoring that in October 2017, Alex said, quote, it's as phony as a three dollar bill with CNN doing fake newscasts and blue screens.

580
00:34:10,542 --> 00:34:20,000
Stevens also ignoring that Alex has said that he thinks Sandy Hook probably was fake at least twice on air while the trials have been ongoing, including once in the last two weeks.

581
00:34:20,512 --> 00:34:27,517
It's all good and fun to create these straw man versions of what Alex actually did and the reason he's facing consequences, but it's not real.

582
00:34:27,715 --> 00:34:32,292
Steven knows it's not real, but Alex's existence is pretty helpful for his brand.

583
00:34:32,352 --> 00:34:42,157
So we pretend this, and the people who are watching Stephen's show probably don't have any interest in debunking this nonsense that he's feeding them.

584
00:34:42,235 --> 00:34:56,247
Yeah, if you're going to bring up the deposition and you're going to quote Alex from the deposition, that deposition convinces me that Alex is guilty of all the things well, he's not quoting the deposition.

585
00:34:56,292 --> 00:35:07,182
He's quoting, like, an article about it, probably because that psychosis thing was something that a lot of media outlets as a pull out for the deposition.

586
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:11,292
He's not actually aware of anything that was discussed in the deposition.

587
00:35:11,352 --> 00:35:21,777
All right, that makes sense, right? Because, again, I can never prove this, but I think that there's a vested interest in being willfully ignorant among a lot of people like Stephen.

588
00:35:21,882 --> 00:35:37,162
Because if he had to cope with or cope's the wrong word, if he had to accept publicly that he was aware of the depositions and the things that were in it, he would then be responsible for rationalizing and justifying those things.

589
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,572
And he couldn't do that.

590
00:35:38,605 --> 00:35:38,887
No.

591
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:41,317
He would have to be like, well, I would be fucked up real bad.

592
00:35:41,365 --> 00:35:42,192
You're a piece of shit.

593
00:35:42,252 --> 00:35:42,875
Yeah.

594
00:35:43,462 --> 00:35:59,872
No, it is fascinating because these fucking pieces of shit who are trying to avoid defending Alex or avoid wading into having to defend Alex's actual behavior, if they were on the jury, they'd be like, yeah, this guy's got a fucking go.

595
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:12,950
You know? Like, without the ability to avoid acknowledging what is actually happening, without the ability to deny it when you are forced to look it directly into the eye every day for five fucking weeks.

596
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,947
Yeah, I know what he did.

597
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:19,767
And I think that's one of the reasons why I think Bobby Barnes is such an asshole is because he knows.

598
00:36:19,827 --> 00:36:22,077
He knows he was in one of the depositions.

599
00:36:22,107 --> 00:36:24,057
At least he was the lawyer.

600
00:36:24,147 --> 00:36:25,572
He knows all this shit.

601
00:36:25,692 --> 00:36:27,027
He's still pretending.

602
00:36:27,132 --> 00:36:29,407
Oh, I don't understand why any of this is happening.

603
00:36:29,485 --> 00:36:33,717
It's all just kangaroos and railroad tracks or whatever the fuck.

604
00:36:33,777 --> 00:36:36,732
There is no deniability from Barnes whatsoever.

605
00:36:36,822 --> 00:36:51,312
Because honestly, Barnes was probably looking at that billion dollar judgment and going, man, I wish I had been a competent enough lawyer for them to hire me so I could have sued Alex Jones for a fucking billion dollars because he was going to lose.

606
00:36:51,387 --> 00:36:59,952
Or even I wish that I could be a competent enough lawyer to have stayed Alex's lawyer to the point where I lose a billion dollar verdict.

607
00:37:00,057 --> 00:37:05,257
Because then I could get so much attention all over the place, lying about everything.

608
00:37:05,335 --> 00:37:06,777
You star bobby Barnes.

609
00:37:06,882 --> 00:37:12,192
Anyway, Alex is allowed to tell his version of events, and what do you know? It's all bullshit.

610
00:37:12,327 --> 00:37:13,447
Here's what really happened.

611
00:37:13,555 --> 00:37:14,227
Here's what really happened.

612
00:37:14,245 --> 00:37:16,627
I can give you the latest information, where they're going with it.

613
00:37:16,795 --> 00:37:19,175
Everybody, thank you, sir.

614
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,017
OK.

615
00:37:20,065 --> 00:37:20,917
Sandy Hook happens.

616
00:37:20,965 --> 00:37:22,237
It's a huge political event.

617
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,572
Obama has him in the White House.

618
00:37:23,605 --> 00:37:24,292
It's going on.

619
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,892
I think maybe somebody helped the kid kill these kids.

620
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:29,802
The whole story is bizarre.

621
00:37:29,982 --> 00:37:41,892
And then about a year after it, all these professors and people that sound incredible come out and school safety experts and said that they thought it was just completely staged.

622
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:48,657
How big things like Operation Northwoods that talked about staging attacks on school kids that didn't exist as a pretext for war with Cuba and Russia.

623
00:37:48,747 --> 00:37:51,327
So I said, yeah, a lot of stuff has been staged.

624
00:37:51,357 --> 00:38:03,042
Maybe this is so I did four or five programs from 2000, and I guess 1314 question, maybe that it was staged.

625
00:38:03,102 --> 00:38:04,092
There's a load of shit.

626
00:38:04,152 --> 00:38:07,927
Alex was saying that he thought it might be fake on the day of the shooting on his show.

627
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:15,967
James Tracy, the professor that he's talking about, was first on Infowars on January 18, 2013, not year later, not years later.

628
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:18,142
Wolfgang Halbig didn't show up until later.

629
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:18,967
That is fair.

630
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:24,522
And he's the school safety officer that Alex is referencing, but Alex is completely ignoring Steve Patenic.

631
00:38:24,642 --> 00:38:34,862
Steve was coming on Alex's show saying, no one died at the school on March 2013 when he was pretending to be a reporter on the scene in the DMZ.

632
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:41,247
Alex's timeline is all screwed up because he's just conveying his wellrehearsed selfdefense version of events.

633
00:38:41,367 --> 00:38:44,752
Stephen is a shitty interviewer, and he has no interest in calling Alex out.

634
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:50,887
So this timeline will stand and be presented to his giant, impressionable audience as gospel, and it's just not true.

635
00:38:50,950 --> 00:39:00,957
If he had any interest in pursuing the truth, he would have familiarized himself with these things and pointed out the many points at which Alex's story diverges from reality.

636
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:05,452
I mean, I would have stopped him right there and been like, Wait, stop.

637
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:17,152
Who helped him? Who helped him kill all those kids? Did you just say right now that you still think no, I think he was saying that at the time.

638
00:39:17,245 --> 00:39:17,862
Immediately.

639
00:39:17,937 --> 00:39:19,417
That was what his suspicion was.

640
00:39:19,465 --> 00:39:19,807
Okay.

641
00:39:19,885 --> 00:39:23,677
Yeah, I think he was saying in, like, December 2012, that's where his mind is.

642
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:23,947
All right.

643
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:27,575
Because that's not how I read what he was saying.

644
00:39:28,087 --> 00:39:31,492
The problem was he started by saying, I'll give you the latest news.

645
00:39:31,615 --> 00:39:38,667
No, he said, I will tell you what happened and get to the latest thing and what's going on, what they're planning.

646
00:39:38,727 --> 00:39:39,067
All right.

647
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:48,022
I feel like he just did it again, but I could have poor sentence structure, or he could yeah, it's a little bit up in the air.

648
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:53,825
I've listened to this, and I'm pretty confident that this is all got you okay.

649
00:39:54,412 --> 00:39:57,247
But yeah, look, it was all Hillary, man.

650
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:05,022
Hillary and the Democrats start running this false news campaign during 2016 campaign that I'm Trump's brain.

651
00:40:05,067 --> 00:40:07,567
They look look at this flamboyant wild guy.

652
00:40:07,765 --> 00:40:08,832
He's a populist.

653
00:40:08,922 --> 00:40:10,597
He's got a lot of people supporting Trump.

654
00:40:10,705 --> 00:40:12,042
Let's make him a liability.

655
00:40:12,177 --> 00:40:20,247
Let's take the worst stuff he said out of context and run tens of millions of TV ads against Trump using Alex Jones, saying he's Trump's brain.

656
00:40:20,367 --> 00:40:26,772
And one thing just to make really clear, is just, again, for the YouTube gods, you understand how this is Alex.

657
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:28,792
That's why I'm saying I'm saying it didn't happen again.

658
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:38,262
No, but they'll say that you were saying because you saw this, and there were other people, there were other professors, there were other conspiracy theorists, some of whom turned out to not be credible, and then you didn't have them on your show anymore.

659
00:40:38,337 --> 00:40:40,332
You did say, Maybe this is staged.

660
00:40:40,422 --> 00:40:44,757
And just again, to be clear, you afterwards said, no, it was not staged.

661
00:40:44,847 --> 00:40:45,727
I was wrong.

662
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:46,752
There's a load of shit.

663
00:40:46,782 --> 00:40:51,997
And honestly, I think if they needed to find the worst stuff Alex has said, this is definitely up there.

664
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:55,342
But they could have come up with a much broader campaign for Hillary to use.

665
00:40:55,465 --> 00:41:02,097
Throw in some of his dehumanizing racism, his violent misogyny and homophobia, his incitement of violence towards Muslims.

666
00:41:02,217 --> 00:41:07,432
Alex has got a deep bench of horrible things hillary could have attacked if that was the game that she was trying to play.

667
00:41:07,585 --> 00:41:12,132
Also, Stephen knows damn well that Alex didn't think that maybe the shooting was staged.

668
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:15,477
Alex literally said multiple times that the shooting was totally fake.

669
00:41:15,507 --> 00:41:18,297
With actors, Stephen is softening that reality.

670
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:22,542
So it's easier for his audience to give Alex a pass and rationalize his actions.

671
00:41:22,677 --> 00:41:25,137
He's selling his audience on Alex.

672
00:41:25,287 --> 00:41:30,137
It's a concerted effort and it's done by obscuring reality.

673
00:41:30,787 --> 00:41:36,682
I just don't understand it because it's just a bad idea.

674
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:47,877
I feel like the right move here, if you're a piece of shit like Crowder or one of these other guys, is to fucking stab Alex in the back and then carve up his audience.

675
00:41:47,982 --> 00:41:52,562
Like, I don't understand why you're even trying this bullshit.

676
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,377
You don't have any loyalty to him.

677
00:41:56,395 --> 00:41:58,027
He doesn't have any loyalty to you.

678
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:06,037
I think that Stephen probably thinks that there is a way that this can raise his own profile, maybe get some of Alex's audience to him.

679
00:42:06,175 --> 00:42:18,157
But it's a fool's errand because Alex's audience, anybody who is susceptible to maybe being interested in Crowder, listens to Alex already.

680
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:26,172
Listens to graduates, right? The rest of the folks are like, oldtimers who live in Shacks, Montana, and listen on shortwaves.

681
00:42:26,292 --> 00:42:30,397
They're not going to like your dumb, childish comedy show.

682
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:31,312
Stupid, yes.

683
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:32,392
But I don't know.

684
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:43,117
I think I just meant as like an ecosystem, you know, not necessarily just Crowder, but like the whole shebang, like Shapiro and Jack and all of them.

685
00:42:43,165 --> 00:43:05,007
If Crowder were smart, what he would maybe try to do is insinuate himself even more with Alex and get involved with the infrastructure part of band video and that kind of thing, and try and use it as a reinforcing misinformation sort of YouTube.

686
00:43:05,172 --> 00:43:11,947
Because as it stands now, there's a shallow depth of anything interesting on there.

687
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,792
There's plenty of content that's true.

688
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,862
There's infowars stuff and there's a load of bullshit.

689
00:43:17,437 --> 00:43:26,992
Steven is like, I don't think it's in his best interest necessarily to be hooked with Glenn Beck with The Blaze stuff, but maybe there's some good money there.

690
00:43:27,115 --> 00:43:37,557
But in terms of, like, if you want some of Alex's audience and that stuff and he wants to create, like, more of a space, that would be the thing you'd do, maybe, and then try and rope in some of the other weirdos.

691
00:43:37,647 --> 00:43:38,212
Sure.

692
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:39,277
But actually, hold on.

693
00:43:39,295 --> 00:43:41,225
I just don't think that's very forward looking.

694
00:43:42,187 --> 00:43:49,267
I think that's saying that we're going to be in a similar place in three years that we are right now, and I don't think that's even close to possible.

695
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:54,747
Well, I guess I maybe don't agree with myself either, because I was talking about like, Gavin McGinnis.

696
00:43:54,792 --> 00:43:57,052
He has a sensor TV or whatever.

697
00:43:57,145 --> 00:43:57,577
Right.

698
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:59,527
And there's not a lot going on there.

699
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,072
Maybe never mind.

700
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:04,107
I was going to say he could go and like, try and help build up cozy.

701
00:44:04,197 --> 00:44:06,672
Nick Hunter is a service, but Nick Huntes doesn't want crowder.

702
00:44:06,717 --> 00:44:06,922
No.

703
00:44:06,955 --> 00:44:08,137
Absolutely not.

704
00:44:08,275 --> 00:44:08,887
No.

705
00:44:09,025 --> 00:44:11,047
Quentas probably thinks crowder stuff.

706
00:44:11,155 --> 00:44:12,275
Yeah, definitely.

707
00:44:13,987 --> 00:44:14,437
Yeah.

708
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,425
I don't know.

709
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:21,125
Why are we always trying to give them assistance? It can't help it.

710
00:44:21,787 --> 00:44:26,612
I think this is all stupid, but Alex just is like an out and outlier.

711
00:44:26,962 --> 00:44:28,707
But it's important to understand this timeline.

712
00:44:28,797 --> 00:44:29,450
Yeah.

713
00:44:30,937 --> 00:44:36,592
For over a year and a half, from 2015 to 2016, we checked the record.

714
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,422
I never talked about it one time, and I told the crew, this is a car, baby, it's a set up.

715
00:44:41,455 --> 00:44:42,967
I don't want to ever discuss it again.

716
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:44,392
I think it's still doing it.

717
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:53,797
We started seeing that some of the folks that were claiming it was stage had gone even crazier, and we're now deregulating and showing that indeed, they put out things that were wrong.

718
00:44:53,905 --> 00:44:55,747
So I was not the Sandy Hook guy.

719
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:56,772
Didn't put me on the map.

720
00:44:56,817 --> 00:44:57,997
I barely ever covered it.

721
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:02,202
But Hillary blows it up, makes it a cause celebr for Democrats.

722
00:45:02,307 --> 00:45:07,522
They use it to bring back all the gun control and now attacks on free speech and to attack Trump.

723
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,327
And so then Trump wins.

724
00:45:09,432 --> 00:45:12,442
They go even crazier, and they start attacking me.

725
00:45:12,565 --> 00:45:20,142
So if this is all an elaborate plot, hillary launched to attack Trump and then Trump won, it seems like it really wouldn't do anything to continue attacking Alex.

726
00:45:20,277 --> 00:45:24,517
The goal would have been to use Alex's toxicity to sway the electorate away from Trump.

727
00:45:24,565 --> 00:45:28,017
And once Trump is won, that's about it in terms of voters.

728
00:45:28,152 --> 00:45:29,272
Just doesn't make sense.

729
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:33,642
Unless you're just desperate to defend yourself using bullshit fantasy world nonsense.

730
00:45:33,702 --> 00:45:34,237
Yeah.

731
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:39,547
Also, Alex didn't stop talking about Sandy Hook during those time frames that he had his staff go look things up.

732
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:40,167
No shit.

733
00:45:40,227 --> 00:45:44,922
Consider this clip from August 26, 2015, squarely in the window.

734
00:45:44,967 --> 00:45:46,597
He's claiming he never brought it up.

735
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:47,182
Oh, yeah.

736
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:50,525
In my opinion, something really stinks about this entire situation.

737
00:45:51,937 --> 00:45:58,462
I can't even really think of a mass shooting, quote, unquote, or a high profile shooting like this.

738
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:02,272
That didn't seem like there was something more going on.

739
00:46:02,455 --> 00:46:05,667
Well, there's been some of them that we caught red handed being staged.

740
00:46:05,727 --> 00:46:06,222
Sirhan.

741
00:46:06,267 --> 00:46:08,967
Sirhan, with RFK.

742
00:46:09,102 --> 00:46:13,782
The situation a few years ago with the Aurora shooting, I mean, those were staged.

743
00:46:13,872 --> 00:46:14,992
We caught them.

744
00:46:15,115 --> 00:46:16,717
We know exactly what they did.

745
00:46:16,765 --> 00:46:17,987
It's unbelievable.

746
00:46:18,337 --> 00:46:21,742
And then you look at Sandy Hook, it just isn't real.

747
00:46:21,865 --> 00:46:27,162
I don't know what specifically happened, but the official story is a fairy tale.

748
00:46:27,237 --> 00:46:29,347
I mean, Jack of the Beanstalk isn't real.

749
00:46:29,455 --> 00:46:31,132
Santa Claus isn't real.

750
00:46:31,285 --> 00:46:36,287
And that is a giant theater operation complete with blue screens.

751
00:46:36,637 --> 00:46:44,975
And now even Rob Dew's uncle, who's a Navy Seal, retired FBI, works for a big company.

752
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:49,712
We have a reporter up there, and it's like, that's Rob Doo's uncle.

753
00:46:50,587 --> 00:46:52,447
And he's like, yeah, it doesn't add up.

754
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,127
Something's going to see anything like this.

755
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:55,197
There's no paperwork.

756
00:46:55,242 --> 00:46:56,287
They're covering something up.

757
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:56,947
I can't talk.

758
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,100
I got to get out of here.

759
00:46:59,437 --> 00:47:01,552
That's how Twilight Zone this has got.

760
00:47:01,645 --> 00:47:04,550
There's a reporter there was that there was Dan Buddy, by the way.

761
00:47:04,912 --> 00:47:05,512
So, yeah.

762
00:47:05,575 --> 00:47:06,597
Go fuck yourself, Alex.

763
00:47:06,642 --> 00:47:06,892
Yeah.

764
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:11,082
Add to that that Alex didn't stop talking to the people who promoted the crisis actor's shit.

765
00:47:11,172 --> 00:47:18,117
Steve Patentic was a guest in Tokyo, and Alex got into a fight about Steve pushing QAnon on shit during the aftermath of the 2020 election.

766
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:21,147
Alex is a liar, and these are easily demonstrable lies.

767
00:47:21,192 --> 00:47:29,472
If Steven cared at all to protect his audience from a fraud, he has a responsibility to them, and he's completely neglecting that, which is shameful.

768
00:47:29,592 --> 00:47:35,872
And here's what I actually think about when you're talking about, like, why not just carve up Alex's audience? Sure.

769
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:40,957
I think that for someone like Stephen, there's probably an interest in preserving Alex, if you can.

770
00:47:41,035 --> 00:47:41,272
Sure.

771
00:47:41,305 --> 00:47:43,957
And that is because he is worse than you.

772
00:47:44,035 --> 00:47:44,887
Yeah, that's fair.

773
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:48,882
Presumably he's worse than you, if only because you're still on YouTube.

774
00:47:48,972 --> 00:47:49,672
Sure.

775
00:47:49,855 --> 00:47:50,647
Right.

776
00:47:50,830 --> 00:48:03,487
So as long as Alex is there, a lot of people will think there's a bigger issue than Stephen Crowder, in the same way that you hear people, even Tucker, say, like, my great replacement theory isn't crazy.

777
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:04,632
It's not Alex Jones.

778
00:48:04,647 --> 00:48:05,217
Shit.

779
00:48:05,352 --> 00:48:08,842
Alex can exist as that I'm not him example.

780
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:14,727
But if you were to go away entirely, then they want to try and repair their broken shield.

781
00:48:14,832 --> 00:48:18,577
Yeah, I think that's probably a way to look at it.

782
00:48:18,745 --> 00:48:22,325
So Alex, he's corrected himself a lot.

783
00:48:22,762 --> 00:48:25,222
He hasn't, but Steve is going to let him say it.

784
00:48:25,255 --> 00:48:29,322
Okay, so he issued dozens of corrections, dozens of apologies.

785
00:48:29,367 --> 00:48:30,922
You just mentioned one of them there.

786
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:36,402
And then they sue me in 2018, and then they do all this discovery.

787
00:48:36,432 --> 00:48:38,827
We give them all the emails, all the text messages and everything.

788
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,872
There's no evidence we made money on Sandy Hook.

789
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:44,052
There's no evidence I premeditatedly got it wrong on purpose.

790
00:48:44,157 --> 00:48:50,167
And so both Democrat connected judges, one of the pose a Republican, but she's like George W.

791
00:48:50,215 --> 00:48:50,817
Bush.

792
00:48:50,952 --> 00:48:58,417
They default me, saying I lost Alex for a second.

793
00:48:58,465 --> 00:49:02,172
Alex, this is clearly the globalist.

794
00:49:02,217 --> 00:49:03,737
He's told I'm guilty.

795
00:49:04,237 --> 00:49:05,802
The jury is told I'm guilty.

796
00:49:05,907 --> 00:49:10,687
I'm not allowed in a five week trial in Connecticut to defend myself.

797
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:14,772
The judge actually says, you can't say you're innocent, you can't say you're bankrupt.

798
00:49:14,967 --> 00:49:16,787
All that's just shit.

799
00:49:18,037 --> 00:49:20,587
But there is no push back.

800
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:23,497
There is no discussion of what these things are.

801
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:24,442
There's no reason to.

802
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:25,100
Yeah.

803
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:28,567
So Crowder wants to know real.

804
00:49:28,615 --> 00:49:40,647
Seriously, did you use these people's names? Did you ever call the parents out by name on air and said that they were their children? Like, call them out by name, on air only? Robbie Parker.

805
00:49:40,767 --> 00:49:41,450
Okay.

806
00:49:43,012 --> 00:49:46,302
And I did not say that he staged it or it was fake.

807
00:49:46,332 --> 00:49:50,257
I said, people think this clip was like 30 million views on YouTube or more.

808
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,402
It was a viral clip.

809
00:49:51,432 --> 00:49:53,982
People say, this guy looks fake.

810
00:49:54,147 --> 00:49:58,132
And so I said, yeah, it does look like acting to me, but he's under stress, whatever.

811
00:49:58,210 --> 00:49:59,302
That's not true.

812
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:04,412
And Heslin's name was set on infowars posner.

813
00:50:05,137 --> 00:50:09,942
And also, intentional infliction of emotional distress doesn't require you say people's names.

814
00:50:10,002 --> 00:50:23,467
These people are constantly screaming about how some people should die because they changed their pronouns, and yet somehow they're going to try and pretend that pronouns cannot refer to people.

815
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:27,627
Right? You have to say their name like a magic spell.

816
00:50:27,732 --> 00:50:32,547
You have to sew it in to your fucking piece of paper with silver thread.

817
00:50:32,592 --> 00:50:33,472
Dan, obviously.

818
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:41,947
Otherwise it's not defamation, right? And when you say, like, the families if you're one of the members of one of the families, you can't consider yourself part of that group.

819
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:43,687
No, you have to be referred to.

820
00:50:43,825 --> 00:50:44,947
That's how words work.

821
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:45,697
You can't do it.

822
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:46,147
No.

823
00:50:46,255 --> 00:50:46,857
Damn.

824
00:50:46,947 --> 00:50:55,317
So Alex tries to explain and Stephen really wants him to explain this because it's kind of an important point that he fully complied with discovery.

825
00:50:55,452 --> 00:51:00,822
Well, I do have a question that's important here because people will say, well, the reason you weren't allowed to defend yourself is it was a default judgment.

826
00:51:00,867 --> 00:51:05,307
And they say, because you didn't provide the evidence that was requested in discovery.

827
00:51:05,397 --> 00:51:10,077
Give me very specifics, not just all you did provide, and hand over a lot of evidence.

828
00:51:10,107 --> 00:51:16,647
What did you hand over? Because they did have financials they did have certainly in the Texas trial, they did have access to financials.

829
00:51:16,692 --> 00:51:18,972
They did have access to certain traffic metrics.

830
00:51:19,017 --> 00:51:26,217
When I was watching the trial, they would say, well, actually, they didn't hand over, for example, the Alexa reporting as opposed to the Google Analytics reporting.

831
00:51:26,277 --> 00:51:30,502
What kind of evidence, when you're asked to hand over, just give me some examples of what you did hand over.

832
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:34,447
Did you hand over financial documents as it related to the company? Yes.

833
00:51:34,555 --> 00:51:43,572
Did you hand over documents as it related to different traffic and revenue streams to some degree or another? To an extreme degree.

834
00:51:43,617 --> 00:51:48,487
The most ever given over in a civil defamation trial, many lawyers estimate steven, let me be 100% clear.

835
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:54,592
So what are they saying you didn't provide, is my point, because this is something a lot of people accurate information, unfortunately, on the right alex, this is important.

836
00:51:54,715 --> 00:51:57,472
I'm just saying this because people will try and take this out of cop.

837
00:51:57,505 --> 00:52:00,492
People on the right will say, well, then you guess you should comply during discovery.

838
00:52:00,627 --> 00:52:11,317
What? Pardon me? What in the fuck are they claiming you didn't provide so that you were not allowed to defend yourself? All right, let me answer that question.

839
00:52:11,365 --> 00:52:14,837
And I want to get into people saying, oh, this is just for Alex Jones.

840
00:52:16,987 --> 00:52:29,457
In Texas, they claimed that because we did so much discovery and they would have each person that they were deposing give them more discovery.

841
00:52:29,622 --> 00:52:39,252
So they'd say, out of the 200,000 emails you gave us in Texas, in one of Discovery batches you gave us, there was one extra email that wasn't in this batch.

842
00:52:39,357 --> 00:52:41,052
Little weird gotcha games.

843
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:47,022
And then in Connecticut, the judge kept saying, Give me the Google Analytics.

844
00:52:47,067 --> 00:52:49,152
Well, we hardly ever even use Google Analytics.

845
00:52:49,182 --> 00:52:50,857
Hardly ever even looked at it.

846
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:58,057
So he explained to the judge, Ma'am, it's a search box for the backend of Google, and a lot of you have to pay for it.

847
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:59,092
We've never paid for it.

848
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,277
We've barely ever used it.

849
00:53:00,295 --> 00:53:08,527
But we searched for Google Analytics and found one writer and one other person in the group that had looked at Google Analytics and said, oh, look how much traffic we're getting a few times.

850
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:13,262
So we gave them what we had in our system about Google Analytics.

851
00:53:13,687 --> 00:53:14,547
Take Alexa.

852
00:53:14,592 --> 00:53:15,427
Same thing.

853
00:53:15,595 --> 00:53:17,762
They said, Give us the alexa.

854
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:20,707
Well, Stephen, I want you to give me the Google.

855
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:28,192
And then I say you say, okay, what, do you want me to search in Google? No, sir, give me the Google.

856
00:53:28,315 --> 00:53:29,525
Give me the Google.

857
00:53:30,487 --> 00:53:39,042
Also, some of those instances of Google Analytics like, look how much traffic we're getting from this Sandy Hook article.

858
00:53:39,177 --> 00:53:41,332
So maybe Alex shouldn't use that as an example.

859
00:53:41,485 --> 00:53:48,852
If Stephen really wanted to be prepared to ask this question and respond appropriately to Alex's answer, he should have read the order for the default judgment.

860
00:53:48,957 --> 00:53:50,422
It spells everything out.

861
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:54,142
There were requests for production that Alex never even responded to.

862
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:57,552
There were requests to produce people for depositions that were ignored.

863
00:53:57,657 --> 00:54:03,117
Alex repeatedly sent completely unprepared people to depositions as corporate representatives.

864
00:54:03,177 --> 00:54:04,812
And that's just the surface.

865
00:54:04,962 --> 00:54:17,217
Alex did turn over big batches of documents, but he had a habit of doing that just before hearings about his failure to turn over documents so he could avoid consequences while overwhelming the plaintiffs with tons of unrelated shit.

866
00:54:17,352 --> 00:54:23,317
Even these tranches weren't satisfactory to what he was obligated to turn over, though, and it didn't really help him.

867
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:28,617
Yeah, in the judgment, they even discussed how they tried to resolve the problem through fines and sanctions.

868
00:54:28,677 --> 00:54:32,287
But it was clear that it had no effect on Alex's abuse of the discovery process.

869
00:54:32,425 --> 00:54:35,997
He has too much money to be impacted by whatever fines the court could impose.

870
00:54:36,042 --> 00:54:37,312
So it was a dead end.

871
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:40,407
Steven doesn't care about the reality here or the truth.

872
00:54:40,497 --> 00:54:47,062
He's just asking questions to allow Alex to give his boilerplate rehearsed answer and make it look like Stephen was asking tough questions.

873
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,907
This is a charade that is meant to exonerate Alex.

874
00:54:50,997 --> 00:54:52,542
In the eyes of Steven's audience.

875
00:54:52,602 --> 00:54:52,867
Yeah.

876
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:54,162
It is not an interview.

877
00:54:54,237 --> 00:55:01,452
It's so hard because the truth of it is like, that all of him being like, I'm not allowed to say I'm innocent.

878
00:55:01,482 --> 00:55:03,127
I'm not allowed to say I'm all this stuff.

879
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:05,322
And it's like, that's your fault.

880
00:55:05,442 --> 00:55:12,672
And the reason that you weren't allowed to say it is because if you did, sooner or later, you would have to go to jail.

881
00:55:12,792 --> 00:55:16,325
We're being nice to you by keeping you.

882
00:55:16,687 --> 00:55:19,767
This is like you going bowling with rails.

883
00:55:19,827 --> 00:55:24,717
That's the point here, is because you are going to be a gutter ball and then go to jail.

884
00:55:24,852 --> 00:55:26,587
We're saving your life, man.

885
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:26,917
Right.

886
00:55:26,965 --> 00:55:34,162
And if you had practiced bowling in this metaphor, you wouldn't be fucking Rails, right? Yeah, exactly.

887
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,352
This fully works, but it's close enough.

888
00:55:36,445 --> 00:55:40,250
So Stephen has lost control of this, of course.

889
00:55:40,612 --> 00:55:41,797
Completely taken over.

890
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:42,022
Yeah.

891
00:55:42,055 --> 00:55:42,727
Sounds good.

892
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:49,497
Now the Secretary of State of Texas is talking about we may have to go after Alex Jones because he caused threats on election officials.

893
00:55:49,542 --> 00:55:50,562
They have no statements.

894
00:55:50,637 --> 00:55:52,122
They don't have me saying be violent.

895
00:55:52,167 --> 00:56:01,077
I didn't even probably ever even talk about the Texas election other than saying I don't think that to was as close as he said he was to Ted Cruz.

896
00:56:01,182 --> 00:56:06,657
So this is the absolute next level garbage and propaganda.

897
00:56:06,672 --> 00:56:07,557
In fact, overhead shot.

898
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:08,722
I want to show people this.

899
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:10,782
Texas Secretary of State Alex Jones.

900
00:56:10,797 --> 00:56:13,447
Unleash hell on our election, people.

901
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:15,222
That's the hill.

902
00:56:15,342 --> 00:56:16,582
Here's another one.

903
00:56:16,735 --> 00:56:21,352
Republican Texas Election chief Blast Nuts peddling 2020 Conspiracy Theory Zooms on.

904
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:22,017
Alex jones.

905
00:56:22,077 --> 00:56:23,842
So just like they're suing everybody.

906
00:56:23,965 --> 00:56:25,342
Alex is just doing his show.

907
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:25,552
Yeah.

908
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:26,952
I'm waiting for him to do an episode.

909
00:56:26,982 --> 00:56:27,262
Yeah.

910
00:56:27,325 --> 00:56:30,277
When is he going to do it? He's calling for overhead show.

911
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:32,952
Is he going to do it? This is ridiculous.

912
00:56:32,982 --> 00:56:33,927
That is insane.

913
00:56:34,032 --> 00:56:35,962
Yeah, Steve lost a tire control.

914
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:37,537
This is just the Alex Jones show.

915
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,175
This is absolutely infowars right now.

916
00:56:40,537 --> 00:56:41,877
That is so funny.

917
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:43,542
Also, we've got these coins.

918
00:56:43,677 --> 00:56:45,042
We got these fucking coins.

919
00:56:45,102 --> 00:56:45,867
Buy these coins.

920
00:56:45,927 --> 00:56:47,322
No, he's on the six coin.

921
00:56:47,442 --> 00:56:49,112
No longer a fundraiser.

922
00:56:49,462 --> 00:56:52,562
So Alex believes that this is overkill.

923
00:56:52,912 --> 00:56:57,777
And then Steven has some harsh words for these so called brave conservatives.

924
00:56:57,882 --> 00:56:58,902
This is all overkill.

925
00:56:58,932 --> 00:57:01,452
It's just the left having a temporary tantrum.

926
00:57:01,557 --> 00:57:07,692
They want to scare everybody else to get a bunch of other lawyers to file lawsuits to come after all the conservatives and all the nationalists and all the Patriots.

927
00:57:07,752 --> 00:57:16,017
And I really appreciate you letting me get that out there, because it's so frustrating to be kind of only have my show that has a big audience, but it's compartmentalized because of censorship.

928
00:57:16,077 --> 00:57:17,397
It's very hard to actually get the truth.

929
00:57:17,442 --> 00:57:18,402
No, it's not just censorship.

930
00:57:18,432 --> 00:57:19,827
I understand it's not just censorship.

931
00:57:19,857 --> 00:57:20,912
It's cowardice.

932
00:57:21,712 --> 00:57:28,177
You and I have had conversations, obviously, off air, where I would say I wouldn't say call to the Nap, but I've said, I don't agree with this.

933
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:28,792
I don't like that.

934
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:33,657
Remember I told you, I remember early on the show saying, I don't like that you sometimes stir up in fighting with conservatives.

935
00:57:33,672 --> 00:57:35,437
I remember you saying, you know what? I used to do that more.

936
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,527
And I decided the left is a more important enemy.

937
00:57:37,557 --> 00:57:39,027
We've had very strong disagreements.

938
00:57:39,132 --> 00:57:49,357
I felt compelled to have you on because some of the biggest figures in our movement who, by the way, agreed with all of some of your quote unquote conspiracy theories that I thought were incorrect, they didn't have you on.

939
00:57:49,435 --> 00:57:51,792
It is censorship and it's cowardice.

940
00:57:51,852 --> 00:57:55,992
Let me translate what Stephen saying there about the infighting among conservatives.

941
00:57:56,127 --> 00:57:58,562
Alex, I work for Glenn Beck.

942
00:57:58,987 --> 00:58:01,062
Stop being mech.

943
00:58:01,212 --> 00:58:08,752
Also, Stephen, you have to understand a lot of those other conservative outlets are really busy running damage control for Tucker's Kanye West interview at the moment.

944
00:58:08,845 --> 00:58:12,967
A lot of them just don't have the juice to throw Alex into the mix and try and deal with that.

945
00:58:13,015 --> 00:58:20,787
We can't be both protecting against the rapid antisemitism in our party and protecting against Alex.

946
00:58:20,937 --> 00:58:23,977
Both antisemitism and more.

947
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:26,302
It is weird that Alex hasn't been on Rogen, though.

948
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:32,082
Like, I wonder if Joe watched some of the trial and realized that Alex lied to his face about what he said about Sandy Hook.

949
00:58:32,172 --> 00:58:37,657
That would be fun if Joe started to get the picture that Alex is using him and see what develops from there.

950
00:58:37,735 --> 00:58:38,377
Yes.

951
00:58:38,545 --> 00:58:40,807
I'm not optimistic that's going to happen.

952
00:58:40,885 --> 00:58:50,257
Yes, if Joe watched the trial, it would be really hard to come away from it thinking that Alex did not lie to your fucking face.

953
00:58:50,335 --> 00:58:50,527
Yeah.

954
00:58:50,545 --> 00:58:53,450
But you still gotta realize he's a fun guy.

955
00:58:53,887 --> 00:58:55,422
He's really funny.

956
00:58:55,617 --> 00:59:16,512
Do you know what this reminds me of? This reminds me so much of walking into a Dunkin Donuts around whatever, and there's two old guys sitting in that way right inside the door so you can see them through the window and they're arguing about a parking ticket.

957
00:59:16,587 --> 00:59:19,312
And he's like, man, I didn't park there.

958
00:59:19,375 --> 00:59:20,152
I'm telling you.

959
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:21,552
And you know the guy's lying.

960
00:59:21,582 --> 00:59:27,282
I'm walking in there trying to buy coffee for 2 seconds and I want to turn around and be like, dude, just pay the parking ticket.

961
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:28,242
You're a fucking liar.

962
00:59:28,302 --> 00:59:30,697
Obviously you did the thing.

963
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,097
And the other guy's like, yeah, you're totally right, man.

964
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:34,925
They shouldn't be able to do that.

965
00:59:35,362 --> 00:59:36,837
One of those guys is Rogen.

966
00:59:36,912 --> 00:59:37,687
Yeah, okay.

967
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:38,017
Yeah.

968
00:59:38,065 --> 00:59:38,767
Just making sure.

969
00:59:38,815 --> 00:59:41,272
No, I think I'm talking about crowder and Alex right now.

970
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:41,782
Okay.

971
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:42,142
Yeah.

972
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:45,882
Who's Rogan? Is he the donut? Rogan would be a delicious donut.

973
00:59:45,972 --> 00:59:49,197
So we got a question for Alex, although he'd be a little bit stringy.

974
00:59:49,242 --> 00:59:49,837
Yeah, probably.

975
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:50,527
Yeah.

976
00:59:50,695 --> 00:59:52,412
And full of raw meat.

977
00:59:53,737 --> 00:59:58,002
So, Alex, we got to find out if he's scared.

978
00:59:58,182 --> 01:00:00,962
Let me ask you, Alex, really point blank.

979
01:00:01,387 --> 01:00:03,027
I know you talk about appeals.

980
01:00:03,207 --> 01:00:11,752
How scared are you right now? I am way more scared about the direction the country is going in that they admit this is a formula for everybody.

981
01:00:11,845 --> 01:00:20,077
I mean, while the right wing laughs some of them, and says, oh, it's just Alex Jones, they're on every channel saying, we're coming after everybody now with this model.

982
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:25,857
And they've even got the Republican Secretary of State in Texas saying we want to come after Republicans.

983
01:00:25,947 --> 01:00:27,612
That question election fraud.

984
01:00:27,687 --> 01:00:28,297
Give me a break.

985
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:37,702
So you have the rhinos, the neocons, the rabid left, allied together against the populist uprising of nationalist Americans who are peacefully trying to take our country back.

986
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,832
So I'm way more concerned about nuclear war.

987
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:41,877
I'm way more concerned about financial collapse.

988
01:00:41,907 --> 01:00:43,637
I mean, here's a good point, Steven.

989
01:00:44,287 --> 01:00:53,037
Quite frankly, the way inflation is going and the way it accelerates towards YMar Republic of Zimbabwe, in ten years, there's such inflation.

990
01:00:53,112 --> 01:00:57,800
A billion dollars will be like $1,000 at the current rate we're at here.

991
01:00:59,512 --> 01:01:00,962
No, I'm not scared.

992
01:01:01,312 --> 01:01:03,662
I am disgusted.

993
01:01:04,087 --> 01:01:07,912
And I really feel proud of myself because I've told the truth about this.

994
01:01:07,975 --> 01:01:09,202
I've said that I was wrong.

995
01:01:09,295 --> 01:01:21,837
They have created this whole synthetic identity for me, this straw man, and then they sat there and had to lie to a jury and suppress the truth and tell him I was guilty and rigged this kangaroo court so I myself can hold my head tall.

996
01:01:21,912 --> 01:01:29,577
But I am, in general, very concerned for my children, for the country in the future because of the rapid acceleration into total and complete corruption.

997
01:01:29,682 --> 01:01:33,500
Wow, that's quite an answer to are you scared? Yes.

998
01:01:34,837 --> 01:01:36,127
I don't want to go with yes.

999
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:46,297
I feel like from some of the numbers that I was seeing, the inflation is starting to turn around, and I don't know if we're going to end up in a Weimar Germany situation.

1000
01:01:46,405 --> 01:01:47,075
Right.

1001
01:01:48,112 --> 01:01:50,067
We're not going to go Zimbabwe, baby.

1002
01:01:50,127 --> 01:01:50,750
Right.

1003
01:01:51,262 --> 01:02:02,547
I mean, if I've read everything correctly, I feel like there's a difference between radical, out of control inflation and all of these businesses being like, oh, they're talking about inflation.

1004
01:02:02,592 --> 01:02:04,482
We can charge an extra $2.

1005
01:02:04,647 --> 01:02:09,177
Yes, some of this is a little bit hard to disaggregate from each other, some of these forces.

1006
01:02:09,282 --> 01:02:09,997
Yeah.

1007
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:13,462
But yeah, I don't think that's the path we're heading on.

1008
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:18,297
And also, I think that nuclear war was supposed to have already started by now, based on Alex's projection.

1009
01:02:18,342 --> 01:02:19,732
Oh, we've been dead for a while.

1010
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:20,317
Yeah.

1011
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:25,677
So I guess he should probably be more concerned about his own personal matters.

1012
01:02:25,782 --> 01:02:26,847
They seem pretty severe.

1013
01:02:26,892 --> 01:02:27,097
Yeah.

1014
01:02:27,130 --> 01:02:30,942
That billion in ten years is still going to be an albatross over your neck, buddy.

1015
01:02:31,002 --> 01:02:38,782
So one of the co hosts asks Alex a very important question, and that is, what's up with the appeal? How is that going to work? Right.

1016
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:45,882
And you'll notice over the course of the maybe next three clips that Alex can't answer specifics.

1017
01:02:46,047 --> 01:02:46,372
Yeah.

1018
01:02:46,405 --> 01:02:48,777
So you said earlier that this is going to be overturned.

1019
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:50,532
Why do you think that it will be overturned.

1020
01:02:50,547 --> 01:02:59,152
Not that you just have kind of this faith in that that's going to happen, but what are you guys arguing, if you can reveal that to us on how it's going to be overturned? Well, that's an excellent question.

1021
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:03,522
I have talked to dozens of very well known constitutional lawyers.

1022
01:03:03,642 --> 01:03:17,302
I can tell you, Norpat is a very well known, successful lawyer around the country, current and former judges in Connecticut and in New York, federal and state, that say this is the most insane craziness they've ever seen.

1023
01:03:17,395 --> 01:03:27,127
All right, so your lawyer who lost this case for you is talking to other people, allegedly, and reporting to you secondhand, that this shit is crazy.

1024
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:27,817
Sounds true.

1025
01:03:27,865 --> 01:03:30,607
And this is how you're going to win the appeal? Yeah.

1026
01:03:30,685 --> 01:03:38,707
Okay, so there's no grounds given for what the appeal, what the argument is, why they merit an appeal other than come on.

1027
01:03:38,785 --> 01:03:39,712
Yeah, come on.

1028
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,777
That's an issue.

1029
01:03:40,945 --> 01:03:43,702
If your appeal is based on that's just too big.

1030
01:03:43,795 --> 01:03:48,562
Alex, like Legit seems to believe that if he can just pay for the appeal, he will magically win.

1031
01:03:48,625 --> 01:03:49,027
Oh.

1032
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:56,247
Either America is gone and completely done, or in Texas and in Connecticut, if I have the money for the appeals.

1033
01:03:56,292 --> 01:04:15,117
That's why they want to bankrupt us right now, because they are so scared that if there's any justice left at the Texas or the Connecticut Supreme Court or the US Supreme Court, they've got to overturn this because the deep state, the ambulance chaser brigade, are openly saying they're coming after everyone with this, just like when I got sick.

1034
01:04:15,177 --> 01:04:24,397
So you're saying that you think the people in the appeals court will see the gravity of it? Is that what you're saying? Why you believe it'll be overturned? I don't know.

1035
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:26,062
The fix is in that high.

1036
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,097
Oh, I see.

1037
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:34,392
So soros can control all the district attorneys in America and all the judges and everything, but you can't penetrate the appeals court.

1038
01:04:34,527 --> 01:04:39,962
Also, the US Supreme Court is entirely blackmailed by Chinese spies.

1039
01:04:40,687 --> 01:04:42,357
Oh, no, the appeals court.

1040
01:04:42,372 --> 01:04:43,597
The fix isn't in that high.

1041
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:45,262
The one that's insanely done.

1042
01:04:45,325 --> 01:04:50,397
Everything I hope today would do is also definitely run by the Chinese billionaires.

1043
01:04:50,517 --> 01:04:51,442
Yeah, this is fun.

1044
01:04:51,490 --> 01:04:59,002
I mean, it's just Alex trying to be like, yeah, you should still give me money because I'm going to find a way to launder it during the appeals process.

1045
01:04:59,095 --> 01:05:15,142
Yeah, I mean, the problem is for Alex is that in a very real way, this is an Apolitical case for lawyers and judges and everything because they all have a vested interest in this being at least the bottom.

1046
01:05:15,265 --> 01:05:27,832
You know, like all of them would prefer to have firm guardrails so we don't have to go through, like, another this judges waited three years to default judgment because we just have never seen this shit before.

1047
01:05:27,985 --> 01:05:33,787
So it helps if we have a baseline here of like, guess what? Here's a person who's done this shit before.

1048
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:37,462
Here's what we've done before, and now we don't have to do this again.

1049
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,407
It would be nice.

1050
01:05:38,485 --> 01:05:39,127
Yeah.

1051
01:05:39,295 --> 01:05:43,212
I mean, it is fitting that this is Alex's sort of path.

1052
01:05:43,287 --> 01:05:54,472
And as much as Trump taught us so much about how much of the government is not codified, how much of it is based on just like, we all agree this is how humans it's a good idea to do this, right? Yeah.

1053
01:05:54,505 --> 01:05:55,692
We all think this is a smart.

1054
01:05:55,752 --> 01:06:00,757
These norms that we've thought of protected us and kept things in line aren't really real.

1055
01:06:00,835 --> 01:06:01,117
Right.

1056
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:03,967
And Alex is kind of revealing some of the similar stuff.

1057
01:06:04,015 --> 01:06:07,507
With the legal system, you could just not do stuff.

1058
01:06:07,585 --> 01:06:17,542
It is unfortunate that it's like, oh, man, we've accidentally created a system geared towards giving narcissistic psychopaths a lot of money and power.

1059
01:06:17,665 --> 01:06:22,447
If they have the nerve and the shamelessness and the shamelessness, they can do whatever the fuck they want.

1060
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,075
Yeah.

1061
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:30,597
So Alex continues to ramble about his nonanswer, about how this appeal is going to work, and then he forgets what question he's answering.

1062
01:06:30,717 --> 01:06:33,327
But I know that okay, they've got their ton of flesh.

1063
01:06:33,357 --> 01:06:34,432
They've demonized me.

1064
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:35,952
They brought back up Sandy Hook.

1065
01:06:35,982 --> 01:06:37,512
They've made a bunch of money for their charities.

1066
01:06:37,587 --> 01:06:39,612
They got $73 million from Remington.

1067
01:06:39,687 --> 01:06:42,477
Yeah, those bad people made a bunch of money for their chairs.

1068
01:06:42,507 --> 01:06:42,832
Okay.

1069
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:45,202
And now nobody knows who Adam Lands is to kill the kids.

1070
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:46,587
They only know Alice Jones.

1071
01:06:46,737 --> 01:06:49,947
And so I'm sorry, what was the question? Steven apologize.

1072
01:06:49,992 --> 01:06:51,487
No, I think you answered the question.

1073
01:06:51,550 --> 01:07:01,850
Well, I think Gerald really wants to know why do you believe it will be overturned? Do you think it's because he wanted to make an example of you? And then when it comes down to the actual constitutional law, it won't hold water? Is that why? Absolutely.

1074
01:07:03,487 --> 01:07:05,797
They have to or the country is over.

1075
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:13,357
I mean, you have to understand, when I say Kager report, when I say show trial, I mean, this has never before been done a default when you don't even show up.

1076
01:07:13,435 --> 01:07:14,750
We gave them everything.

1077
01:07:15,562 --> 01:07:21,492
It's fun the way that Steven's interview style seems to be like, alex is just rambling.

1078
01:07:21,627 --> 01:07:27,322
I'll try and answer this question for him and see if he can just say yes to my suggested answer.

1079
01:07:27,355 --> 01:07:30,187
And Alex does, and then starts rambling some more.

1080
01:07:30,325 --> 01:07:37,377
It is fun that if you're Steven Crowder, you started the show by being like, you weren't even allowed to make your defense.

1081
01:07:37,482 --> 01:07:40,822
And then at the end of the show, you have to be like, oh, no, that makes sense.

1082
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:41,467
Yeah.

1083
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:42,472
You shouldn't have been.

1084
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:43,677
Your defense is terrible.

1085
01:07:43,707 --> 01:07:44,392
There isn't one.

1086
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:44,692
Yeah.

1087
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:48,622
And you're just not going to be able to answer yes or no question to save your life.

1088
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:49,467
Literally.

1089
01:07:49,602 --> 01:07:51,487
Literally to save your life.

1090
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:52,992
Your fucking defense is Hillary.

1091
01:07:53,052 --> 01:07:53,722
Yeah.

1092
01:07:53,905 --> 01:07:55,025
Go away.

1093
01:07:55,837 --> 01:08:00,627
So Alex starts rambling about money and gets into his divorce.

1094
01:08:00,657 --> 01:08:02,562
For some reason, this is weird.

1095
01:08:02,712 --> 01:08:05,647
They said he made $61 million last year.

1096
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:08,842
Our gross was $61 million.

1097
01:08:08,965 --> 01:08:12,892
I paid myself $200,000 last year.

1098
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:14,517
It's all in the bankruptcy court.

1099
01:08:14,577 --> 01:08:15,247
They know it.

1100
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,297
They know it's true.

1101
01:08:16,405 --> 01:08:21,262
Was there a year that I paid myself $12 million? Absolutely.

1102
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:25,147
The year of the divorce with my ex wife six years ago.

1103
01:08:25,255 --> 01:08:26,877
Thank God it was a trump error.

1104
01:08:26,907 --> 01:08:30,457
For the first time ever, we had all this extra money right when she divorced me.

1105
01:08:30,535 --> 01:08:31,822
It goes through the process.

1106
01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:39,082
And the court made me pay her close to $10 million to, quote, buy her out of the company, because I've been married to her for 13 years.

1107
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:44,377
So the one year, God came through the one year, because usually I make about a million, $2 million a year.

1108
01:08:44,395 --> 01:08:48,847
But honestly, my audience and after all the bills and stuff and legal crap, it's gone, of course.

1109
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:49,297
Okay.

1110
01:08:49,405 --> 01:08:50,525
I don't do it for money.

1111
01:08:50,962 --> 01:08:51,967
So wait, hold on.

1112
01:08:52,015 --> 01:08:53,092
I got to pause there for a second.

1113
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:58,657
Yeah, he had a 400% pay increase that year.

1114
01:08:58,735 --> 01:08:59,537
Magically.

1115
01:09:00,037 --> 01:09:01,192
Okay, that makes sense.

1116
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:01,767
So weird.

1117
01:09:01,827 --> 01:09:02,450
Yeah.

1118
01:09:02,887 --> 01:09:06,972
The one year I made $12 million, god came through magically.

1119
01:09:07,017 --> 01:09:09,877
The money came in to then buy my ex wife out of the company.

1120
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:14,977
So, again, they think I want to say something here.

1121
01:09:14,995 --> 01:09:30,877
This is important, because I see you, and we all struggle with this, right? Where you're saying because I know that people think that sounds like a lot of money, and it's sad that you even have to say, no, you don't do this just for the money, but you absolutely deserve to earn a living if you have millions of people who are listening in the amount of work that you put into it.

1122
01:09:30,895 --> 01:09:31,477
I understand it.

1123
01:09:31,495 --> 01:09:32,752
This is what I do here as well.

1124
01:09:32,845 --> 01:09:42,277
Conservatives are the only ones, surprisingly, the people who support free enterprise, where we feel like, because our audience is largely working class, you must say, look, don't get mad at me because I make this money, because it's huge.

1125
01:09:42,295 --> 01:09:50,667
In between one year making 12 million and a several hundred million dollar judgment, you know who makes 12 million every single year? Colbert Fallon.

1126
01:09:50,727 --> 01:09:51,612
No one cares.

1127
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:54,987
So I can explain that dynamic a little better than Stephen.

1128
01:09:55,137 --> 01:09:59,517
He and Alex do this song and dance because they know that they're fucking over their audience.

1129
01:09:59,652 --> 01:10:03,112
They have to rationalize the money they make because it's an insane amount.

1130
01:10:03,175 --> 01:10:09,652
And they earn it by exploiting their audience's fear and anger and monetizing that while putting vulnerable people in harm's way.

1131
01:10:09,745 --> 01:10:13,887
And they do no work and they sell garbage.

1132
01:10:13,962 --> 01:10:15,972
Yeah, absolute garbage.

1133
01:10:16,092 --> 01:10:18,522
Steven did no preparation for this interview.

1134
01:10:18,567 --> 01:10:21,192
He has no idea of the subject that he's even covering.

1135
01:10:21,252 --> 01:10:24,927
There's no work that goes into this other than riffing dumb jokes.

1136
01:10:25,032 --> 01:10:26,637
They know that they don't do shit.

1137
01:10:26,712 --> 01:10:30,352
And whether it's conscious or not, that's another question about whether or not.

1138
01:10:30,370 --> 01:10:32,107
That's why they have to rationalize this.

1139
01:10:32,185 --> 01:10:39,447
But they have to pretend not to care about money, or else they run the risk of being way too obvious about how they sell things, and then before you know it, they're just a racist.

1140
01:10:39,492 --> 01:10:44,017
QVC Fowler and Colbert make money, but I'm not sure how much.

1141
01:10:44,065 --> 01:10:48,622
But they don't get on their show every night and try to rationalize it, because they actually put on a show.

1142
01:10:48,730 --> 01:10:53,067
They're entertainers doing a job, not just complaining about how they're so persecuted.

1143
01:10:53,202 --> 01:10:55,632
And this has nothing to do with political alignment.

1144
01:10:55,722 --> 01:11:06,352
Do you think Jeff Foxworthy or Larry the Cable Guy or Ron White has to rationalize that they make millions of dollars? They don't, because their talent makes it obvious why they make that much money.

1145
01:11:06,445 --> 01:11:09,217
For con men like Alex and Stephen, it's different.

1146
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:10,972
And that's why they do have to do this.

1147
01:11:11,005 --> 01:11:14,947
Like, oh, hey, look, it's $100 million that I make, but it's no big deal.

1148
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:15,832
It's actually nothing.

1149
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:16,327
Yes.

1150
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:24,297
No, they're thieves having to justify why thievery is okay, well, they're thieving doing sort of legal fees.

1151
01:11:24,417 --> 01:11:25,377
Legal thieves.

1152
01:11:25,482 --> 01:11:26,150
Yeah.

1153
01:11:26,812 --> 01:11:28,927
And I understand that you have to explain why.

1154
01:11:28,945 --> 01:11:31,947
You have to rationalize or it gets confusing and suspicious.

1155
01:11:31,992 --> 01:11:32,422
Right.

1156
01:11:32,530 --> 01:12:02,225
I think the thing that has stuck with me maybe most well, no, there are a few things that really stuck with me during the Texas trial, but one of them that I will never forget is when Owen was on the stand and he was being questioned about NPR, and he was like, you know, they're a nonprofit, right? And Owen just said, but they still get paid, don't they? They don't understand the idea of not doing something for money.

1157
01:12:03,337 --> 01:12:11,937
Sure, I understand we're a nonprofit, but this is what actual not money is when you're just there doing your job and you're surviving.

1158
01:12:12,087 --> 01:12:24,747
And not to jump too far from what you're saying, but, like, Owen and Alex and other people in depositions have been very clear about, like, we don't really do any preparation, because if they admitted that they did work, it would show malice.

1159
01:12:24,792 --> 01:12:27,050
It would really make it look hard.

1160
01:12:28,087 --> 01:12:29,067
They don't do shit.

1161
01:12:29,127 --> 01:12:29,392
Yeah.

1162
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:33,112
Anyway, Alex wants to go to the documents, and this is about how hard he works.

1163
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:35,302
And this is the most important point I'm going to make here.

1164
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:40,775
And I got a few documents I can show people that are really important that tie us all together.

1165
01:12:41,737 --> 01:12:44,992
This is a major project for six years.

1166
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,252
Two years before they stood me.

1167
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:47,557
And then now the last four.

1168
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:50,842
With literally hundreds of articles a week.

1169
01:12:50,965 --> 01:12:52,512
Sometimes thousands.

1170
01:12:52,662 --> 01:12:57,222
Every major news channel from HBO to PBS to Fox.

1171
01:12:57,267 --> 01:13:04,282
Even attacking me over Sandy Hook and building it up into this giant controversy when I was not the Sandy Hook man.

1172
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:09,097
To set the precedent with the Alex Jones precedent to shut everybody else down.

1173
01:13:09,130 --> 01:13:16,787
Now, let's talk about this being the biggest defamation judgment in US history by an order of at least ten magnitude.

1174
01:13:17,137 --> 01:13:18,907
If I can have an overhead shot here.

1175
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:24,667
Damn, I wish the survivors of Epstein received 965,000,000.

1176
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:25,297
Exactly.

1177
01:13:25,405 --> 01:13:25,897
Good point.

1178
01:13:25,930 --> 01:13:27,887
On Twitter, Eliza.

1179
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:30,582
He just read a tweet from Eliza.

1180
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:32,697
He just read a tweet from Eliza.

1181
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:32,992
Yes.

1182
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,512
Overhead shop for this tweet.

1183
01:13:34,587 --> 01:13:35,137
Wow.

1184
01:13:35,275 --> 01:13:35,975
Yes.

1185
01:13:36,337 --> 01:13:37,782
And Twitter sucks.

1186
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:38,212
Sure.

1187
01:13:38,275 --> 01:13:38,767
Yes.

1188
01:13:38,890 --> 01:13:39,547
Also, hey.

1189
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:39,727
Yeah.

1190
01:13:39,745 --> 01:13:43,717
Epstein's victims should be compensated, but that doesn't have anything to do with you.

1191
01:13:43,765 --> 01:13:44,592
It's unfortunate.

1192
01:13:44,652 --> 01:13:46,807
You also should pay out that billion dollars.

1193
01:13:46,885 --> 01:13:48,725
Yeah, I mean, I agree.

1194
01:13:49,162 --> 01:13:51,967
We both agree this is not a zero game.

1195
01:13:52,015 --> 01:13:56,007
Unrelated, but I agree he also has money that should go elsewhere.

1196
01:13:56,097 --> 01:14:00,597
Do both of you have money when you should have zero money? Good call, Eliza.

1197
01:14:00,642 --> 01:14:02,442
Yeah, I like that, Eliza.

1198
01:14:02,577 --> 01:14:03,277
Good work.

1199
01:14:03,370 --> 01:14:14,112
So they end the episode with a Q and A session, and it's actually only three questions formally, but they take questions for people in Stephen Carter's mug club.

1200
01:14:14,187 --> 01:14:14,647
Sure.

1201
01:14:14,755 --> 01:14:15,697
And here's the first one.

1202
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:16,567
OK, yeah.

1203
01:14:16,615 --> 01:14:18,277
Mug club viewer Jerry has a question for you.

1204
01:14:18,295 --> 01:14:24,200
Alex, what do you feel was an appropriate penalty for what you said? Nothing.

1205
01:14:25,687 --> 01:14:33,282
It's better that ten guilty men go free than one innocent man be prosecuted.

1206
01:14:33,372 --> 01:14:35,397
Here's why Alex is the worst.

1207
01:14:35,592 --> 01:14:38,232
Saying nothing is so dumb.

1208
01:14:38,322 --> 01:14:40,687
He should have said, you pay for my meals for life.

1209
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:41,052
Totally.

1210
01:14:41,082 --> 01:14:42,502
Do a Socrates something.

1211
01:14:42,595 --> 01:14:43,387
Come on, man.

1212
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:44,647
Elevate this.

1213
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:46,025
Bring it on.

1214
01:14:46,987 --> 01:14:51,972
What the fuck is wrong with you? It's a rare opportunity that you can actually pull a Socrates.

1215
01:14:52,017 --> 01:14:52,312
Yes.

1216
01:14:52,375 --> 01:14:56,857
You are going to die and you will not be remembered unless you pull something.

1217
01:14:56,935 --> 01:14:57,682
Great, man.

1218
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:58,972
You got to do it.

1219
01:14:59,155 --> 01:15:00,697
They got rid of my due process.

1220
01:15:00,805 --> 01:15:02,337
The judge found me guilty.

1221
01:15:02,412 --> 01:15:03,547
They lied about it all.

1222
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:04,672
They hyped up what I said.

1223
01:15:04,705 --> 01:15:05,752
They exaggerated it.

1224
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:07,167
I never said people, their houses.

1225
01:15:07,227 --> 01:15:08,112
It's a lie.

1226
01:15:08,187 --> 01:15:14,247
They're setting a precedent to steal your rights, not just your rights to listen to what you want to listen to and make your own decisions.

1227
01:15:14,292 --> 01:15:17,362
They're literally setting this up to come after the general public.

1228
01:15:17,425 --> 01:15:28,927
An FBI agent that I never saw, never covered, never said his name until he sued me, he admitted on the stand was given $90 million because some people on the Internet thought it didn't happen.

1229
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:31,412
I should be no consequence.

1230
01:15:32,062 --> 01:15:33,512
Slap me off the hook.

1231
01:15:34,012 --> 01:15:41,825
I do appreciate the more I think about it, the more I appreciate the ten guilty men should be free instead of what is like.

1232
01:15:42,487 --> 01:15:44,762
That's not a defense in a trial.

1233
01:15:45,412 --> 01:15:48,607
You can't be like, oh, listen, Your Honor, I did it.

1234
01:15:48,685 --> 01:15:54,877
But can we know everyone did what they did? It's a good idea to let me go free.

1235
01:15:55,045 --> 01:15:57,732
Otherwise you might put that man in jail.

1236
01:15:57,822 --> 01:16:04,972
No, he's saying that he's the innocent man who shouldn't be persecuted, not one of the guilty people who goes free.

1237
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:09,187
I feel like the implication there, he didn't intend the right way.

1238
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:18,957
Well, maybe he's thinking he's the innocent man, but in this situation, he really comes off sounding like he's the one of the ten guilty, but also he should do a Socrates.

1239
01:16:19,122 --> 01:16:23,022
Anyway, there's a problem with the crowder identifies.

1240
01:16:23,067 --> 01:16:23,272
Yeah.

1241
01:16:23,305 --> 01:16:26,292
And that is that hey, this is a lawsuit for defamation.

1242
01:16:26,352 --> 01:16:26,917
There is that.

1243
01:16:26,965 --> 01:16:27,772
We're against it.

1244
01:16:27,805 --> 01:16:27,997
Yes.

1245
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:30,762
But then there's some other lawsuits that you filed.

1246
01:16:30,912 --> 01:16:32,842
Well, sure, Alex did.

1247
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:34,312
Yeah, that doesn't come up.

1248
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:39,987
But other ones, like the Covington Catholic, and we do support these shit.

1249
01:16:40,062 --> 01:16:41,542
I need to talk about this.

1250
01:16:41,665 --> 01:16:57,837
And also, it's important you'll get a lot of people on the left saying, oh, the right has a double standard, because what about Nick Sandman and CNN? What about Kyle written house? They said his name the President of the United States had an advertisement, had an ad that went out that associated Kyle Written house specifically with white supremacy.

1251
01:16:57,912 --> 01:17:00,667
They said Nick Sandman was mocking somebody.

1252
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:03,267
This poor Native American nathan Phillips.

1253
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:06,222
As I prefer my Native Americans to be called Nathan Phillips.

1254
01:17:06,267 --> 01:17:09,642
They said, yeah, he was mocking Nathan Phillips, and he was stirring up the crowd.

1255
01:17:09,702 --> 01:17:14,682
They did call out these people by name, and these people had to hire security, and these people had to go into hiding.

1256
01:17:14,772 --> 01:17:15,817
There is a difference.

1257
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:17,152
You did not do that.

1258
01:17:17,170 --> 01:17:18,357
And they did it repeatedly.

1259
01:17:18,447 --> 01:17:20,302
They did it all day and all night.

1260
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:28,267
Not to mention what preceded Cowritten house was the media drumming up actual hatred and that's right.

1261
01:17:28,315 --> 01:17:31,522
And they never showed any evidence I sent people to harass people or anything.

1262
01:17:31,555 --> 01:17:33,832
Of course, it was always what somebody else did.

1263
01:17:33,985 --> 01:17:40,262
So Alex is absolutely lying about there being no proof that he sent to people to Newtown, and that led to harassment.

1264
01:17:40,762 --> 01:17:41,967
Complete horseshit.

1265
01:17:42,027 --> 01:17:42,517
Absolutely.

1266
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:54,577
Also, I guess if Stephen wants to be such a stickler about saying people's names, which isn't necessary to prove intentional infliction of emotional distress, then he should support Alex paying Robbie Parker $120,000,000.

1267
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:55,057
Yeah.

1268
01:17:55,135 --> 01:18:04,632
Because Alex did say his name repeatedly and repeatedly mocked a video of him about to give his memorial to his daughter.

1269
01:18:04,722 --> 01:18:15,117
Or is there a double standard if crowder is going to put those as his benchmarks for when a case is acceptable? Well, we've reached those benchmarks.

1270
01:18:15,177 --> 01:18:15,800
Sure.

1271
01:18:18,112 --> 01:18:18,862
20 million.

1272
01:18:18,925 --> 01:18:19,192
Yeah.

1273
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:24,652
I mean, if you want to say for some if that's your argument, that it's like, you have to say the name.

1274
01:18:24,745 --> 01:18:26,022
Well, we've reached that benchmark.

1275
01:18:26,067 --> 01:18:26,317
Right.

1276
01:18:26,365 --> 01:18:29,082
If your benchmark is somebody has to go into hiding.

1277
01:18:29,172 --> 01:18:30,222
They went into hiding.

1278
01:18:30,267 --> 01:18:30,472
Yeah.

1279
01:18:30,505 --> 01:18:32,542
So guess what? We're done here.

1280
01:18:32,590 --> 01:18:35,317
I strongly disagree with the point the crowd was making.

1281
01:18:35,365 --> 01:18:35,887
He's wrong.

1282
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:36,262
Yes.

1283
01:18:36,325 --> 01:18:41,647
But based on his own perception, he should be like, all right, Alex, you don't owe 900 million.

1284
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:42,202
You owe 120,000,000.

1285
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:46,302
And if that was his perspective, I would think that would be hilarious.

1286
01:18:46,332 --> 01:18:48,275
It would be very funny to me.

1287
01:18:48,787 --> 01:18:53,992
Unfortunately, there's no way for me to be intellectually consistent and not be on your team.

1288
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:58,762
I literally spiritually, physically in this world.

1289
01:18:58,825 --> 01:19:06,147
If I have any intellectual curiosity, I can but I have to say that you owe $120,000,000 for Robbie Parker.

1290
01:19:06,192 --> 01:19:07,252
I have to, yeah.

1291
01:19:07,345 --> 01:19:10,642
So what's the next question of this Q and A? Okay.

1292
01:19:10,690 --> 01:19:11,352
Michael Burger.

1293
01:19:11,382 --> 01:19:17,825
Taylor Kohler wants to know, if people only knew one true thing about you, Alex, among all these lies, what would it be? That was going to be my last question.

1294
01:19:18,412 --> 01:19:19,087
Who.

1295
01:19:19,225 --> 01:19:20,887
I mean, look, I'm a real person.

1296
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:22,072
I've got a lot of information.

1297
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:25,402
Sometimes I'm a little bit obnoxious because I'm trying to get through it all, like, here today.

1298
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:30,177
And I really appreciate steaming the Caribbean so gracious so I can have a place to tell the truth.

1299
01:19:30,207 --> 01:19:32,902
And I appreciate your courage because you do get attacked for having me on.

1300
01:19:32,995 --> 01:19:35,497
And just this is our rights being taken.

1301
01:19:35,605 --> 01:19:37,137
This is a Hollywood production.

1302
01:19:37,212 --> 01:19:38,647
I'm not saying Sandy Hook didn't happen.

1303
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:45,037
I'm saying the production of what I supposedly did and how big it became and this huge event.

1304
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:46,507
I'm not the Sandy Hook guy.

1305
01:19:46,585 --> 01:19:51,502
I'm the guy that wrote the number one best selling book in the world for the world.

1306
01:19:51,595 --> 01:19:56,442
That's why the globalists hate me, is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.

1307
01:19:56,502 --> 01:20:03,427
I'm exposing groups like PayPal that are back, by the way, saying, if we don't like what you say, we're going to find you $2,500.

1308
01:20:03,595 --> 01:20:06,552
I'm opposing their authoritarianism.

1309
01:20:06,657 --> 01:20:07,527
I'm a populist.

1310
01:20:07,557 --> 01:20:08,632
I'm a champion of the people.

1311
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:15,577
And folks can actually hear the real Alex Jones@infowars.com infowars.com show or bandout video.

1312
01:20:15,670 --> 01:20:17,197
Go see the real life show.

1313
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:18,237
Go see the archives.

1314
01:20:18,312 --> 01:20:19,392
Go see the guests.

1315
01:20:19,452 --> 01:20:26,667
Go find out what I'm actually saying instead of little bitty twisted, edited excerpts that the corporate media puts out to understand the globalists.

1316
01:20:26,727 --> 01:20:29,952
See, infowars is the flag they want to capture.

1317
01:20:29,982 --> 01:20:39,397
They're more obsessed with it than anything else out there right now, because when the globalists tune in, they get scared, because I know what I'm talking about when it comes to the mechanics of the new world order.

1318
01:20:39,505 --> 01:20:43,677
So it's interesting how Alex's one true thing contains multiple lies.

1319
01:20:43,857 --> 01:20:44,857
That's pretty amazing.

1320
01:20:44,935 --> 01:20:45,922
Very weird about that.

1321
01:20:45,955 --> 01:20:58,787
I guess if you boil that down, his one true thing about himself that you need to know is that he's amazing and he's so strong and right and smart that everything bad that happens to him is just the globalist attacking him with fake stories because he's so strong and right and smart.

1322
01:20:59,137 --> 01:20:59,887
It's cool.

1323
01:20:59,950 --> 01:21:00,217
Yeah.

1324
01:21:00,265 --> 01:21:03,662
That's a good thing to end on for Alexander.

1325
01:21:05,662 --> 01:21:10,897
What else is there to say? He's going out saying, like, I'm the best writer in the world.

1326
01:21:10,930 --> 01:21:12,442
I'm the best talker in the world.

1327
01:21:12,490 --> 01:21:16,492
I'm the most powerful man in the world, because the most powerful people are coming after me.

1328
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:16,792
Right.

1329
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:18,142
Like, Jesus, man.

1330
01:21:18,190 --> 01:21:20,217
The devil doesn't come up, by the way, in this interview.

1331
01:21:20,277 --> 01:21:23,362
It's so weird because he seems really central to the plot line.

1332
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:23,887
Yes.

1333
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:27,882
Also, Alex's book has fallen to 322 on the Amazon charts.

1334
01:21:27,972 --> 01:21:28,537
So close.

1335
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,367
It's weird how they don't stay at number.

1336
01:21:30,415 --> 01:21:33,292
One just because you keep saying it and it wasn't ever at number one.

1337
01:21:33,340 --> 01:21:34,147
Now there is that.

1338
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:35,302
That's a problem too.

1339
01:21:35,395 --> 01:21:39,097
So actually there's another question and that's Steven has a question.

1340
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:39,967
Final question.

1341
01:21:40,015 --> 01:21:42,362
Then we're going to go to Mug club and take some more chats.

1342
01:21:43,087 --> 01:21:47,827
What's the next step? What are you doing here next, alex, game plan.

1343
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,400
Well, that's a really great question.

1344
01:21:50,437 --> 01:21:52,012
My biggest enemy is myself.

1345
01:21:52,150 --> 01:21:53,922
I am absolutely exhausted.

1346
01:21:53,967 --> 01:21:55,852
I'm burnt out, I drink too much.

1347
01:21:56,020 --> 01:21:57,697
I haven't smoked in 14 years.

1348
01:21:57,730 --> 01:21:59,750
Under the stress, I took up smoking again.

1349
01:22:01,087 --> 01:22:03,222
Going out and watching comedy and hang out with Joe Rogan.

1350
01:22:03,267 --> 01:22:05,002
There's a lot of cigarettes smoking going on.

1351
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:07,262
Yeah, I don't think that's cigarette smoke.

1352
01:22:07,912 --> 01:22:11,632
No, I've done a little bit of the marijuana smoke too, but I smoke a lot of it.

1353
01:22:11,710 --> 01:22:13,402
I smoke pot like once a month or something.

1354
01:22:13,495 --> 01:22:15,687
Usually I'm at a comedy club or go see a movie.

1355
01:22:15,837 --> 01:22:18,427
Every time I hang out with Joey, he smokes a pot.

1356
01:22:18,595 --> 01:22:20,257
But sometimes I guess twice a week.

1357
01:22:20,335 --> 01:22:21,552
I don't think I would Joe that much lately.

1358
01:22:21,582 --> 01:22:22,152
I've been too busy.

1359
01:22:22,182 --> 01:22:25,257
But some days we went on it like twice a week and get stoned.

1360
01:22:25,272 --> 01:22:27,472
But a little bit of fun stuff there.

1361
01:22:27,505 --> 01:22:33,582
But long story short, he's just doing it to test the potency because Soros has weaponized marijuana.

1362
01:22:33,672 --> 01:22:35,082
Soros weaponized marijuana.

1363
01:22:35,097 --> 01:22:39,372
Alex is smoking sometimes two times a week just for fun to hang out with his buddy.

1364
01:22:39,417 --> 01:22:41,512
Seems like he's maybe not too worried about that.

1365
01:22:41,575 --> 01:22:42,532
Maybe it's not real odd.

1366
01:22:42,535 --> 01:22:43,522
Maybe that's not a real thing.

1367
01:22:43,555 --> 01:22:48,622
It's real odd how it's so important and then it's here and you just forget about it.

1368
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:50,767
It's the most important fight in the world.

1369
01:22:50,815 --> 01:22:54,125
We have to fight against the globalist potency of drugs in there.

1370
01:22:55,162 --> 01:22:56,452
I get high all the time.

1371
01:22:56,470 --> 01:23:00,050
I really don't think smoking cigarettes is going to be good for him.

1372
01:23:00,862 --> 01:23:01,792
That's not good.

1373
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:02,797
Yeah, I wouldn't do it.

1374
01:23:02,830 --> 01:23:06,172
Maybe that's what the Torn Larynx act was.

1375
01:23:06,355 --> 01:23:08,317
He was outside burning one.

1376
01:23:08,365 --> 01:23:10,237
Yeah, could be.

1377
01:23:10,375 --> 01:23:14,137
So Steven does want a question, though, about what's next.

1378
01:23:14,275 --> 01:23:21,247
Yeah, when he said long story short, I wanted to throw up because that was a short story that's been very long.

1379
01:23:21,355 --> 01:23:27,787
So what's next? Stephen basically just has to pull teeth to get that out of him.

1380
01:23:27,925 --> 01:23:30,507
Some days we went on it like twice a week and gets stoned.

1381
01:23:30,522 --> 01:23:32,722
But a little bit of fun stuff there.

1382
01:23:32,755 --> 01:23:38,987
But long story short, game plan, Alex, that's your hobbies.

1383
01:23:40,012 --> 01:23:40,857
Anyways.

1384
01:23:40,947 --> 01:23:46,677
Well, it's a little bit of a name drop to all the trendy liberals that think they're trendy and think they're cool and love the police.

1385
01:23:46,707 --> 01:23:47,622
They hate free speech.

1386
01:23:47,667 --> 01:23:48,822
I'm the real rebel.

1387
01:23:48,942 --> 01:23:50,247
Infowars is the vanguard.

1388
01:23:50,292 --> 01:23:51,552
So is Steven Crowder.

1389
01:23:51,657 --> 01:23:52,722
We are the rebels.

1390
01:23:52,767 --> 01:23:53,727
We are the outlaws.

1391
01:23:53,757 --> 01:23:55,672
We are 1776.

1392
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:58,072
We are the counterculture, not them.

1393
01:23:58,105 --> 01:23:59,197
And they can't stand that.

1394
01:23:59,230 --> 01:24:00,457
And so that's what all people know.

1395
01:24:00,535 --> 01:24:01,602
We are the counterculture.

1396
01:24:01,632 --> 01:24:03,147
Stephen crowder is the counterculture.

1397
01:24:03,192 --> 01:24:12,832
The listeners and viewers of these shows that support independent media are the future of not just America, but the world that people can find out what all the stinks about@infowars.com.

1398
01:24:12,910 --> 01:24:15,547
So it sounds to me like what you're saying your next step is.

1399
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:23,872
And Alex, you know I have a lot of love for you, but sometimes it's tough to get you to answer your question, I think you need to get some rest is what you're saying.

1400
01:24:23,905 --> 01:24:26,900
Right? Your game plan is some rest, recoup and come back.

1401
01:24:29,287 --> 01:24:32,277
Listen, I'm more ADHD when I'm totally exhausted.

1402
01:24:32,307 --> 01:24:35,837
So I've done interviews and I was up till 01:00 in the morning and I apologize.

1403
01:24:36,262 --> 01:24:37,552
My brain's gone right now.

1404
01:24:37,570 --> 01:24:40,792
So, yes, I realize this is what's coming next.

1405
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:43,282
I realize they want to take me out of the game.

1406
01:24:43,435 --> 01:24:47,982
And I realize that I'm never going to quit now because they want to silence me, because this is a battle of wills.

1407
01:24:47,997 --> 01:24:54,427
I know it's the right thing to do, but I also understand that if I take myself out of the game by being fried or burnt out, they win.

1408
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:58,612
So I am going to, in the next few months, do something I never do.

1409
01:24:58,675 --> 01:25:03,447
I'm going to take off a week, a month, starting at the end of this month, november and December.

1410
01:25:03,492 --> 01:25:04,917
I may take off two weeks in December.

1411
01:25:04,977 --> 01:25:07,837
I want my listeners to understand why I've got to do it, because I've got to rest.

1412
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:13,422
I've got to stop drinking, I've got to stop smoking, I got to go to church to recharge my batteries.

1413
01:25:13,467 --> 01:25:16,422
I've got to take my daughter camping.

1414
01:25:16,467 --> 01:25:21,012
I've got to go camping and shooting with my son and my other daughters.

1415
01:25:21,087 --> 01:25:29,150
And so if you're asking what's happening, I'm going to recharge my batteries, get back to family, get back to God, and come back in 2023 harder than ever.

1416
01:25:29,512 --> 01:25:30,732
This is bullshit.

1417
01:25:30,822 --> 01:25:35,022
I think he probably will take a week off in November and December for Thanksgiving and Christmas.

1418
01:25:35,067 --> 01:25:38,637
Yeah, it's not going to stick.

1419
01:25:38,712 --> 01:25:42,067
Also, like, we're supposed to be right on the cusp of nuclear war.

1420
01:25:42,115 --> 01:25:42,892
Yeah, I know.

1421
01:25:47,137 --> 01:25:47,857
focus.

1422
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:48,367
Yeah.

1423
01:25:48,415 --> 01:25:49,192
Just do your job.

1424
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:52,627
Tell me what the tell me what's in your world.

1425
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:57,232
You know who doesn't freak out like this? Other people who do daily shows.

1426
01:25:57,310 --> 01:25:59,975
Yeah, like, this is him.

1427
01:26:01,462 --> 01:26:02,862
Just be healthier.

1428
01:26:03,012 --> 01:26:06,877
Stop acting like this and grow up.

1429
01:26:06,970 --> 01:26:08,017
That's the other thing, too.

1430
01:26:08,065 --> 01:26:12,067
Like, I don't know, maybe I'm not cool and I've never really been that cool fair.

1431
01:26:12,115 --> 01:26:18,177
But I find it pathetic to hear, like, 40 year olds talking about counterculture.

1432
01:26:18,207 --> 01:26:19,147
Yeah, I know.

1433
01:26:19,330 --> 01:26:35,002
I don't know what it is, but like, as I've gotten older, the interest in whether or not something is culture, counterculture or any of that stuff, it kind of becomes something that maybe has a little bit of like an artistic interest to me.

1434
01:26:35,095 --> 01:26:38,677
Something that's like a subversive piece of music or art, maybe.

1435
01:26:38,845 --> 01:26:40,717
But like, I don't know.

1436
01:26:40,765 --> 01:26:46,487
A lot of the aesthetic trappings and a lot of that stuff, I think, is a little bit for the youth.

1437
01:26:47,362 --> 01:26:49,762
You can't be a rebel and have $100 million.

1438
01:26:49,825 --> 01:26:52,057
First off, that's not how that works.

1439
01:26:52,135 --> 01:26:56,272
Fugazi wasn't cool and also had $100 million.

1440
01:26:56,380 --> 01:27:00,287
They were playing in the basement of a dilapidated church.

1441
01:27:01,087 --> 01:27:03,162
They weren't doing Green Day stadiums.

1442
01:27:03,237 --> 01:27:07,302
Green Day cannot be a rebel and fucking do Madison Square Garden.

1443
01:27:07,332 --> 01:27:08,317
That's not how that works.

1444
01:27:08,365 --> 01:27:11,787
You kind of lose the ability to have credibility as counterculture.

1445
01:27:11,862 --> 01:27:16,042
You have to sign, like, a 40 page contract to do a show.

1446
01:27:16,165 --> 01:27:17,427
You're not a rebel.

1447
01:27:17,532 --> 01:27:18,682
That's not how that works.

1448
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:27,162
When you have a CNN level studio that you're broadcasting from, it's kind of tough to make that argument.

1449
01:27:27,312 --> 01:27:31,372
A condemned building comedy show is a rebellious comedy show.

1450
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:32,697
Beyond counterculture.

1451
01:27:32,742 --> 01:27:33,397
Fuck off.

1452
01:27:33,505 --> 01:27:36,642
It's a space where counterculturalism can really thrive.

1453
01:27:36,702 --> 01:27:37,192
Yeah, absolutely.

1454
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:40,797
It might still be an incredibly mainstream show in a big totally.

1455
01:27:40,842 --> 01:27:43,087
That is very possible for that to happen.

1456
01:27:43,225 --> 01:27:51,072
But you're not going to see something that's wildly subversive at, like, the Laugh Factory or I know it's soft at Zanies.

1457
01:27:51,117 --> 01:27:51,412
Yes.

1458
01:27:51,475 --> 01:27:52,407
I don't want to poke.

1459
01:27:52,497 --> 01:27:57,807
Listen, hey, man, I was a countercultural icon when I MC Zanies.

1460
01:27:57,897 --> 01:27:59,000
Right? Yeah.

1461
01:28:00,337 --> 01:28:01,747
I get what Alex was saying.

1462
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:07,412
And again, maybe I'm a square, but I cared a lot more about that when I was 19.

1463
01:28:08,512 --> 01:28:18,702
That whole idea of, like, selling out or anything along those lines, who cares? Barry Gordon isn't around anymore.

1464
01:28:18,732 --> 01:28:20,272
You're going to sell out or whatever.

1465
01:28:20,455 --> 01:28:41,142
But it is disgusting to think that if you and I right now, we're at any point in time, like, listen, man, as we sit here in our fucking hoodies and ten issues, like, we're the true rebels and not going outside, the rebels who are fucking hermits.

1466
01:28:41,277 --> 01:28:42,592
No, that's not how it works.

1467
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:43,312
No, no.

1468
01:28:43,375 --> 01:28:53,367
I sit in a fairly comfortable apartment having overdo to do the dishes surrounded by buttons, and I am neither culture nor counterculture.

1469
01:28:53,427 --> 01:28:54,725
We don't even have room.

1470
01:28:56,212 --> 01:28:57,247
That's just how it works.

1471
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:01,777
Basically, instead of, like, forcing yourself to get rest or whatever the fuck you're talking about.

1472
01:29:01,795 --> 01:29:02,767
Alex, grow up.

1473
01:29:02,815 --> 01:29:03,742
Grow up.

1474
01:29:03,940 --> 01:29:11,677
Anyway, Steven touches on an interesting question, and that is, why aren't you on Rogen? But you know what? You just mentioned something.

1475
01:29:19,312 --> 01:29:21,532
joe told me was on.

1476
01:29:21,535 --> 01:29:26,977
The show was two years ago, and it was one of the biggest shows he ever did with who was on the show? I haven't heard that.

1477
01:29:26,995 --> 01:29:28,617
It was a great comedian, really funny.

1478
01:29:28,752 --> 01:29:31,927
Tim, Dylan and Joe's like, yeah, we have a couple of months.

1479
01:29:31,945 --> 01:29:33,022
A couple of months, couple of months.

1480
01:29:33,130 --> 01:29:36,352
And then it's pretty obvious what's going on.

1481
01:29:36,445 --> 01:29:39,262
Just a little too much heat for Joe to have me on, which is fine.

1482
01:29:39,325 --> 01:29:40,752
He had courage about the vaccines.

1483
01:29:40,782 --> 01:29:42,252
He had courage about censorship.

1484
01:29:42,357 --> 01:29:46,182
He's been criticizing the power structure, but he's not as hardcore as Steven Crowder.

1485
01:29:46,197 --> 01:29:52,025
And and I'll just say it, but at least the overall defense free speech, and I just don't think Joe can handle it.

1486
01:29:52,912 --> 01:29:56,457
Yeah, what is it going to take for Joe to just be like, I'm done with this shit.

1487
01:29:56,472 --> 01:30:01,972
What is it going to take? I'm done with your fucking malign me for not promoting you.

1488
01:30:02,005 --> 01:30:03,372
Yes, he's a piece of shit.

1489
01:30:03,417 --> 01:30:08,217
Whenever you don't give him enough attention, he winds and tells you you're a piece of shit.

1490
01:30:08,277 --> 01:30:08,902
Fuck off.

1491
01:30:08,995 --> 01:30:09,292
Yes.

1492
01:30:09,340 --> 01:30:11,127
And granted, this isn't sneaky snake.

1493
01:30:11,157 --> 01:30:12,177
I'm going to gut them like a pig.

1494
01:30:12,207 --> 01:30:13,177
We should talk about his case.

1495
01:30:13,195 --> 01:30:15,897
Not quite that, but this is still kind of insulting.

1496
01:30:15,942 --> 01:30:17,107
And it's on a different show.

1497
01:30:17,185 --> 01:30:19,342
It's on a different show? Yes.

1498
01:30:19,390 --> 01:30:25,462
And he's saying, essentially, hey, listen, Joe's got some courage, but that man is a coward at heart compared to you.

1499
01:30:25,525 --> 01:30:25,972
Exactly.

1500
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:30,262
You're the guy who's in a fucking sit outside of college.

1501
01:30:30,325 --> 01:30:35,752
Meme? I see you wearing that shoulder holster and I think there's a man.

1502
01:30:35,845 --> 01:30:36,487
Oh, man.

1503
01:30:36,550 --> 01:30:40,182
I think that the Maltese Falcon is around the corner.

1504
01:30:40,272 --> 01:30:43,267
So Alex isn't worried, though, like, about Rogan not having him on.

1505
01:30:43,315 --> 01:30:44,362
It's totally cool.

1506
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:49,987
We're out of dinner about a month ago last time I hung out with him, and it's just pet peeve not to bring it up.

1507
01:30:50,050 --> 01:30:53,917
And I just said, man, it really helped me with this upcoming court case because the whole media is against me.

1508
01:30:53,965 --> 01:30:55,597
If I could get on there and explain things.

1509
01:30:55,705 --> 01:31:00,382
He just said, Alex, there's too much craziness going on.

1510
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:01,402
Let's just get through this.

1511
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:02,047
We'll talk about it later.

1512
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:03,307
So I'm not really worried about it.

1513
01:31:03,385 --> 01:31:05,437
Obviously, I'm the big interview he'd want.

1514
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:07,787
He even said, listen, you're like nuclear weapons.

1515
01:31:09,262 --> 01:31:11,032
It's a big deal to have you on.

1516
01:31:11,185 --> 01:31:12,622
But I'm not worried about it.

1517
01:31:12,655 --> 01:31:14,537
It's really a question for Joe.

1518
01:31:15,337 --> 01:31:17,767
I'm just asking because you talk about how you're hanging out with them.

1519
01:31:17,815 --> 01:31:20,662
Not only if not him, he has a bunch of friends who could have you on.

1520
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:22,337
He has a whole podcast network.

1521
01:31:22,687 --> 01:31:24,262
Tim Dylan could have you on.

1522
01:31:24,325 --> 01:31:25,372
Dick was just me.

1523
01:31:25,405 --> 01:31:30,177
I'd love to grow it eventually with other people and be able to throw more support behind folks.

1524
01:31:30,207 --> 01:31:37,252
But right now, let me say it on the current scale, steven Crowder is a ten, alex Jones is a ten, and Joe Robinson eight.

1525
01:31:37,345 --> 01:31:40,957
And I'll take an eight all day over our enemies that are in a zero, of course.

1526
01:31:41,035 --> 01:31:45,322
And so I'm nothing but thankful to Joe for all the heat he's taken having me on.

1527
01:31:45,505 --> 01:31:46,717
No, you're more than that.

1528
01:31:46,765 --> 01:31:48,277
You're also insulting it.

1529
01:31:48,295 --> 01:31:51,425
You know what? That's how to give out the inside baseball numbers work.

1530
01:31:51,862 --> 01:31:53,122
But I'm just going to leave it at this.

1531
01:31:53,155 --> 01:31:55,187
I'll tell you off there if you want, but it's private.

1532
01:31:55,687 --> 01:31:58,175
The very same people trying to silence me.

1533
01:31:59,812 --> 01:32:04,627
I'm not going to get into it on here, but there's been some real harassment of Joe and stuff that's going on.

1534
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:05,077
I know.

1535
01:32:05,095 --> 01:32:06,652
Yes, I know that's happened with him.

1536
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:11,182
And I'm on that list as well, so I know we all deal with it.

1537
01:32:11,335 --> 01:32:11,842
Oh, man.

1538
01:32:11,890 --> 01:32:17,392
Joe's getting threatened about having Alex on, and guess what? So Stephen but Stephen doesn't care cause he's a ten.

1539
01:32:17,515 --> 01:32:18,575
He's a ten.

1540
01:32:21,562 --> 01:32:23,067
What a bunch of losers.

1541
01:32:23,127 --> 01:32:23,667
Yep.

1542
01:32:23,802 --> 01:32:24,417
Yep.

1543
01:32:24,552 --> 01:32:25,287
It's tough.

1544
01:32:25,362 --> 01:32:29,232
It's tough to watch a show like this and not really feel sad.

1545
01:32:29,322 --> 01:32:31,712
Yes, this is sad.

1546
01:32:33,412 --> 01:32:34,762
It's not good either.

1547
01:32:34,825 --> 01:32:41,797
Like, I would understand if something had like, an ethos that I disagreed with, a lot of points that I didn't agree with.

1548
01:32:41,905 --> 01:32:59,302
But if Stephen Crowder was like, he had a spark of real funny in him, or if there was an interesting angle and delivery on stuff, if his co hosts were worth a damn as sidekicks, I would say I disagree with this.

1549
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:00,117
I think it sucks.

1550
01:33:00,177 --> 01:33:04,962
But they're doing a show this just as bad from all angles.

1551
01:33:05,112 --> 01:33:05,887
Really bad.

1552
01:33:05,950 --> 01:33:10,467
Yeah, man, that is just so sad.

1553
01:33:10,602 --> 01:33:11,877
It's so sad.

1554
01:33:11,982 --> 01:33:18,397
All of you are adult men talking about how great you are to children.

1555
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:20,187
That's better than Rogue.

1556
01:33:20,262 --> 01:33:21,207
That is gross.

1557
01:33:21,297 --> 01:33:23,892
I'm so much more of a big, strong boy than Rogan.

1558
01:33:23,952 --> 01:33:26,407
I have all the courage in the world.

1559
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:32,862
So at the end here, this is the last clip we've got because I got to go to mug club, which is the, like, behind the paywall segment.

1560
01:33:32,937 --> 01:33:38,697
And Alex is like, you know who's a rebel? A guy with a mug club at a paywall and a cigar club.

1561
01:33:38,742 --> 01:33:40,692
What a rebel? The true rebels.

1562
01:33:40,752 --> 01:33:46,357
Right? And Alex is talking at the end about how he has to go to do his own show.

1563
01:33:46,435 --> 01:33:48,592
So he wasn't going to be on that for very long.

1564
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:50,617
So I don't really care about what's behind the pay wall.

1565
01:33:50,665 --> 01:33:51,142
Right.

1566
01:33:51,265 --> 01:33:55,882
But before they leave, alex tries to troll the media into covering him.

1567
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:57,462
This is really sad.

1568
01:33:57,537 --> 01:34:00,082
OK, this is an information war.

1569
01:34:00,235 --> 01:34:02,397
It appears to be flooding you with funding.

1570
01:34:02,442 --> 01:34:07,262
You're one of the only professional people doing top flight comedy and analysis.

1571
01:34:07,612 --> 01:34:11,877
It's better than the production on, like, these late shows that giant budgets, 20 times your budget.

1572
01:34:11,907 --> 01:34:15,312
People should flood you with support and more importantly, word of mouth.

1573
01:34:15,387 --> 01:34:22,872
Because unless the real currency we all want is to override the censors and to win the infowars, absolutely everybody should support Steven Crowder.

1574
01:34:22,917 --> 01:34:30,125
Who's got the 500 pound testicles? Well, Joe's only got joe's only got 400 pound ones.

1575
01:34:31,387 --> 01:34:32,997
I admire Joe's balls.

1576
01:34:33,042 --> 01:34:35,247
Okay, stephen, yours are bigger.

1577
01:34:35,367 --> 01:34:37,182
Bigger and even more juicy.

1578
01:34:37,272 --> 01:34:39,427
Well, gosh, you did say you've been drinking too much.

1579
01:34:39,445 --> 01:34:42,822
And part of that has to do with the fact that I have the under the cabinet microwave.

1580
01:34:42,867 --> 01:34:47,322
I've learned my lesson, all right? No, I made a gay joke so it goes viral.

1581
01:34:47,367 --> 01:34:49,182
Stephen, that's funny.

1582
01:34:49,272 --> 01:34:50,817
You said you have to recharge your batteries.

1583
01:34:50,877 --> 01:34:53,162
Alex Jones is a robotic homosexual.

1584
01:34:53,662 --> 01:34:57,662
All right, look, alex Jones talks about Stephen Crowder's juicy ball.

1585
01:35:01,687 --> 01:35:02,172
Gosh.

1586
01:35:02,217 --> 01:35:02,512
Yeah.

1587
01:35:02,575 --> 01:35:17,632
When do I get my 900 million? For what? This is funny to them, but when Alex has to tell his balls joke and then say it's funny, that's a bad sign.

1588
01:35:17,710 --> 01:35:18,412
That's not good.

1589
01:35:18,475 --> 01:35:20,742
No, I didn't know it was a joke.

1590
01:35:20,877 --> 01:35:22,927
My get or done back when I did stand up.

1591
01:35:22,945 --> 01:35:24,725
Was it's funny? Yeah.

1592
01:35:25,237 --> 01:35:28,100
After every joke, I would say it's less now.

1593
01:35:33,262 --> 01:35:39,427
I think things are less effective when you say, like, hey, I'm doing this so the media will report on it.

1594
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:41,217
That's fun and sad.

1595
01:35:41,352 --> 01:35:46,347
But also the thing that makes it funny is that both of them are huge homophobes.

1596
01:35:46,467 --> 01:35:49,187
Both of them are like violently.

1597
01:35:49,537 --> 01:36:02,482
Is that what's funny is that they can dip into the into their they make a joke of talking about Stephen's balls because it is gay to them and they hate gay people.

1598
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,202
Right.

1599
01:36:03,370 --> 01:36:12,222
But I mean, they know that we've just spent too much time with I don't know what people who aren't funny really find funny.

1600
01:36:12,342 --> 01:36:17,287
It's funny to them because they're engaging in a form of homophobia, right.

1601
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:21,942
And to them, from the target or being hurt by homophobia.

1602
01:36:22,077 --> 01:36:23,617
So it is quite funny to them.

1603
01:36:23,665 --> 01:36:23,872
Right.

1604
01:36:23,905 --> 01:36:25,902
To them, it's a transgressive concept.

1605
01:36:25,932 --> 01:36:30,777
And so the idea of someone saying that would blow their fucking minds into laughter.

1606
01:36:30,882 --> 01:36:32,842
I get that, but I don't get it.

1607
01:36:32,890 --> 01:36:33,802
I don't get it.

1608
01:36:33,895 --> 01:36:36,532
They're the real rebels, man.

1609
01:36:36,610 --> 01:36:49,242
I think that this would have been just a ways, maybe quite a ways below, like Andrew Dice Clay in the 80s in terms of being something that's like rebellious.

1610
01:36:49,302 --> 01:36:53,697
I mean, I'm an elitist comedy, but I'm a comedian.

1611
01:36:53,817 --> 01:36:55,552
That's what you're supposed to be.

1612
01:36:55,720 --> 01:37:02,317
But I can still laugh at things that are sophomoric but you just have to be good.

1613
01:37:02,515 --> 01:37:10,947
There has to be cleverness, there has to be direction, there has to be intent or thought behind it or, you know, something along those lines.

1614
01:37:11,067 --> 01:37:23,397
I get what you're saying, but I think that from a construction standpoint, the joke is the media reports on this interview as Alex likes Stephens juicy Balls.

1615
01:37:23,517 --> 01:37:35,242
Right? The amusing image is the news running that headline, right? But the real joke is that the news isn't going to cover this at all, just interview at all.

1616
01:37:35,290 --> 01:37:45,292
I mean, you guys are the joke, right? It's imagining the ways in which you are tricking the media into a troll headline that doesn't come to play.

1617
01:37:45,415 --> 01:37:48,187
It is very funny to listen to these guys.

1618
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:52,522
Imagine how they are outsmarting the media.

1619
01:37:52,705 --> 01:37:54,342
Yeah, that's very funny.

1620
01:37:54,402 --> 01:37:59,497
Well, it's all in their game of being the best.

1621
01:37:59,605 --> 01:38:00,142
Yeah.

1622
01:38:00,265 --> 01:38:02,082
So this sucked.

1623
01:38:02,247 --> 01:38:04,317
I don't want to listen to anymore stephen Crowder.

1624
01:38:04,377 --> 01:38:04,912
Never again.

1625
01:38:04,975 --> 01:38:06,387
This is brutal.

1626
01:38:06,537 --> 01:38:16,687
But one of the things that I found very interesting was that there is probably not that much difference between how he presents himself here and on his show in terms of this stuff.

1627
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:22,122
I think part of that is because he clearly felt the ability to steamroll Stephen.

1628
01:38:22,317 --> 01:38:24,177
He even throws to two clips.

1629
01:38:24,282 --> 01:38:25,492
That was not hard.

1630
01:38:25,615 --> 01:38:26,167
Yes.

1631
01:38:26,290 --> 01:38:30,607
So I think there is a sense that, like, all right, I'm just going to do my show on his show.

1632
01:38:30,685 --> 01:38:31,192
Yeah.

1633
01:38:31,315 --> 01:38:32,617
He can't handle me.

1634
01:38:32,665 --> 01:38:33,622
No, he's got no chance.

1635
01:38:33,655 --> 01:38:35,002
I'll just be able to do that.

1636
01:38:35,020 --> 01:38:39,127
Then I'll call him a ten or Rogan's an eight and I'll compliment his balls be fine.

1637
01:38:39,220 --> 01:38:39,877
Yeah.

1638
01:38:40,045 --> 01:38:47,262
It is like kicking a choir boy and then patting him on the head, being like, you did such a great job getting kicked.

1639
01:38:47,412 --> 01:38:48,307
That was bad.

1640
01:38:48,385 --> 01:38:48,622
Yeah.

1641
01:38:48,655 --> 01:38:52,752
But there really isn't a ton of message discrepancy.

1642
01:38:52,857 --> 01:38:56,127
It is just kind of like, I've been wronged.

1643
01:38:56,232 --> 01:38:58,152
I didn't get a trial, blah, blah, blah.

1644
01:38:58,182 --> 01:38:59,182
They're coming for you.

1645
01:38:59,260 --> 01:38:59,900
Yeah.

1646
01:39:00,337 --> 01:39:13,775
Explain to me how a man can insist that he is both apologized and taken responsibility for his behavior and yet still be like, well, the family should get nothing.

1647
01:39:15,412 --> 01:39:16,662
That's a question for Alex.

1648
01:39:16,737 --> 01:39:18,937
And the mug club did not ask that.

1649
01:39:19,075 --> 01:39:20,047
We don't know the answer.

1650
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:20,547
That's surprised.

1651
01:39:20,592 --> 01:39:22,377
The mug club does not do a lot of follow ups.

1652
01:39:22,407 --> 01:39:23,137
That's what I've heard.

1653
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:24,447
That's what I've heard of Stephen.

1654
01:39:24,492 --> 01:39:31,102
And that's another reason why he can have message discipline and stay with the same thing he says on infowars is because Steven's not going to ask him.

1655
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:32,842
I'm fucking barely even talk.

1656
01:39:32,890 --> 01:39:34,767
It's in no way a hostile environment.

1657
01:39:34,827 --> 01:39:35,137
Yes.

1658
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:39,927
I would say that Rogan is a more confrontational interviewer than Steve.

1659
01:39:39,957 --> 01:39:40,550
Yeah.

1660
01:39:41,212 --> 01:39:44,167
Just because he'd be, like, to say something funnier about that.

1661
01:39:44,215 --> 01:39:44,917
Yeah.

1662
01:39:45,115 --> 01:39:51,927
Steven did the same thing that Greenwald did, which is, like, tried to offer answers to questions he was asking Alex.

1663
01:39:52,032 --> 01:39:54,517
This would be a good answer if you want to just take this.

1664
01:39:54,565 --> 01:39:55,175
Yeah.

1665
01:39:55,837 --> 01:39:59,077
He was massaging Alex's shoulders while he's doing it.

1666
01:39:59,245 --> 01:40:03,207
He was participating in being interviewed while interviewing.

1667
01:40:03,372 --> 01:40:05,967
Just said because he thought it would be a better interview, I imagine.

1668
01:40:06,027 --> 01:40:06,382
Probably.

1669
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:06,742
Yeah.

1670
01:40:06,790 --> 01:40:10,162
Anyway, we'll be back, Jordan, but until then, we have a website.

1671
01:40:10,225 --> 01:40:11,017
Indeed we do.

1672
01:40:11,065 --> 01:40:12,142
It's knowledgefight.com.

1673
01:40:12,190 --> 01:40:12,802
Yeah.

1674
01:40:12,970 --> 01:40:13,707
We are on Twitter.

1675
01:40:13,722 --> 01:40:16,717
Is that knowledge underscore fight? I saw you tweet today.

1676
01:40:16,915 --> 01:40:18,817
Listen, it showed up.

1677
01:40:18,865 --> 01:40:21,657
The algorithm knows that I fucking hate Glenn Greenwald.

1678
01:40:21,672 --> 01:40:24,432
So it shows me Glenn Greenwald, and then I get so mad.

1679
01:40:24,522 --> 01:40:25,647
But I'm not on Twitter.

1680
01:40:25,692 --> 01:40:26,212
He's back.

1681
01:40:26,275 --> 01:40:27,200
He's not.

1682
01:40:27,562 --> 01:40:28,477
All right, we'll be back.

1683
01:40:28,495 --> 01:40:29,547
But until then, I'm Leo.

1684
01:40:29,592 --> 01:40:30,072
I'm Leo.

1685
01:40:30,117 --> 01:40:31,002
I'm DCI SCARC.

1686
01:40:31,032 --> 01:40:33,207
I'm wilford snippet snapped of the gripple PIBBLE.

1687
01:40:33,297 --> 01:40:35,532
And now here comes the sex robots.

1688
01:40:35,622 --> 01:40:37,102
Andy and Sansa, you're on the air.

1689
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:40,272
Thanks for holding, Alex.

1690
01:40:40,317 --> 01:40:41,277
I'm a first time caller.

1691
01:40:41,307 --> 01:40:42,072
I'm a huge fan.

1692
01:40:42,117 --> 01:40:42,892
I love your work.

1693
01:40:42,940 --> 01:40:43,275
I love you.
