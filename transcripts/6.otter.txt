Alex Jones  00:00
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air. Thanks for holding. Well, Alex, I'm a first time caller. I'm a huge fan. I love your work.

Dan  00:08
Hey, everybody, welcome back to knowledge fight. I'm Dan Jordan. Today we take another adventure down into the land of Alex Jones and his insanity. I watch too much Info Wars, and I have no fucking clue what he's on about and I will do my best to explain what's going on in the world. Let's hope to you.

Jordan  00:27
Well, it's going on in the world is going on in the imaginary world who maybe a better way of describing it the world of Jones. Yes. As it were The World According to Garp. Yeah, I've been

Dan  00:39
wrestling with a few things. All right. Today's episode is going to involve the 14 hour live broadcast that Infowars did, which everyone can agree is excessive,

Jordan  00:50
that there's no way anybody watched more than a half hour of it. Right.

Dan  00:55
I think a lot of people watched a bunch of it. That's crazy. I know that I was checking it out. periodically. Yeah.

Jordan  01:02
Did they have like the live viewers on it?

Dan  01:04
Yeah, it points it was in the 1000s. You know, it fluctuated as much as all these things do. Pretty much every year me and Matt Riggs get together and watch podcast Athan, right. Charity of Marathon show salutely. And you know, you see the number go up and down. And that's just you know, people don't have time for this bullshit. Yeah.

Jordan  01:23
long as things people drop in, drop out. A lot of people donate. You're watching a

Dan  01:27
long time though. I myself, I'm not super thrilled to admit this. I could really only make it through a couple hours of it before I had to like retreat to the safe waters. Oh,

Jordan  01:38
how are you? How are you not super thrilled that you made it through a couple hours? Well, because the hours I would have gotten through maybe 45 minutes if I was really focused on something else.

Dan  01:50
Oh, the hours that I made it through the reason I'm not excited about it. Were hours where Paul Joseph Watson was hosting PJ WP JW. Who hates SJW now hates him. And then David Knight.

Jordan  02:00
We're like, who's the most boring?

Dan  02:02
He's a smug prick. Yeah, it was a Santa beard.

Jordan  02:05
How is how is our girl Leah and McAdoo Leanne McAdoo

Dan  02:09
was fine. She was fine. Most of what I watched her do was interview a guy about how Russia is okay. That was a big narrative they kept spinning was like they talked way too much about Russia. Like

Jordan  02:23
they have to establish because the whole because for so long, all of Alex Jones Show was Russian baiting, basically. So now they have to establish that Russia is okay. Yeah, in order to justify pretending that none of the past 20 years have happened. Yeah.

Dan  02:41
And actually, one of the things I was going to do is because this inauguration, 14 hour broadcast is so unwieldy and so on almost impossible to cover. Yeah. I wanted to think, like, maybe we could do a special episode. And so I went back and listened to the 911 episode that he did. And it's shockingly boring. Really? Yeah, it's bizarrely it's just like I told you, so that was most of what it was. And he you do have to give him credit. He did. Like in the in the y2k episode, he, the blind squirrel and the crazy occasional night. He totally nailed it. Well, but to be fair, it's called out Osama bin Laden, too, but it's very easy to predict that 911 would happen and bin Laden would take responsibility, given that he'd already attacked the World Trade Center. Yes. That he wants to do it again. Yeah,

Jordan  03:30
yeah. So like, that did state loudly on the record? In the white chambers? Yeah. In the in the a look, they're putting this out there. You're not reading it, but Osama is gonna attack.

Dan  03:44
Yeah. So it's, I have a lot of theories about what happened during the inauguration. To get to get back to that, because that is what we're going to cover. Yes. And

Jordan  03:57
the the great nightmare that began on the Inauguration Day.

Dan  04:02
Well, I the Women's March just happened when we're recording this as the day after. And all that was fucking awesome. Yeah, millions of people taking to the streets. They

Jordan  04:11
were saying about 3.3 million across the country, which is an entire 1% of our population was like, fuck this dude.

Dan  04:19
And that seems low like 1%. But you have to factor in like babies, elderly.

Jordan  04:26
And even even if you go just by voting population, that's a full two and a half percent. Yeah. That is a huge part of the electorate

Dan  04:34
and the largest protest in American history. Absolutely. But what's gonna end up happening?

Jordan  04:39
It's countrywide. It's not because that's always the narrative of like, no, the heartland is real America. Yeah, country wide from fucking Kansas City. There were 1000s of women showing a heart of Texas. Yeah, yeah. Occupied Texas. Even unoccupied. Yeah, no, it was amazing

Dan  04:58
and around the world, even And I saw pictures of protests are taking place in an Erica. Yeah, that's backed up all

Jordan  05:04
seven continents there are people protesting

Dan  05:06
but we don't have feedback of what he is going to say about this and the narrative that's going to be spun. But I guarantee it. What's going to happen is he's going to conflate that with the people breaking Starbucks Windows Yeah, of the night before. It's going to be every fucking time it's going to be this wasn't a protest. It was riots, bla bla bla, bla bla, which is, I mean, we'll deal with that when we get to it. I'm having a disjointed opening because I don't know how to

Jordan  05:32
thing. Everything is overwhelming. Right now. You ever hear the whiplash of the worst day? Compared to one of the most amazing days I've ever seen? Like, I've been so hopeless and then seeing all of those women show the fuck up and like, and that's the other thing in DC. No arrests. There were 500

Dan  05:54
people were Yeah, they're like 300. But

Jordan  05:57
the Women's March Yeah. 500,000 people walking down the street zero arrests. All peaceful cops

Dan  06:04
high fiving. Yeah, yeah,

Jordan  06:05
there's no right. There's no narrative you can spin other than these are full on protesters.

Dan  06:11
Oh, there will be and we'll get to it eventually. Yeah, but fuck them. I want to start I guess here's how I'm gonna start this. I have a theory that Alex was only on the broadcast for a couple hours and just vague check ins with him. Because he was on a bender.

Jordan  06:28
Full on.

Dan  06:29
I think Alex was real drunk throughout most of inauguration weekend. Yeah. And

Jordan  06:34
well, he did go to the deplorable right? Where I'm assuming they all got shit faced.

Dan  06:40
And here I want to start with a clip of him right before the deplorable. That sort of introduces my thesis that he was very dry. He

Jordan  06:48
was he was out of out of his gourd. Yeah.

Dan  06:52
Keep in mind, he was scheduled to speak at the deplorable and this is before it

Alex Jones  06:57
will want to take over with freedom. Oh, he's drunk. Alright. So here's how it works. All the dumbasses walk around or big trench coats, that type of stuff on the earth.

Dan  07:09
So he also, I should give a point of clarification there. He always talks about the people in Washington as being in big trench coats. It's like,

Jordan  07:19
that's some spy work right there that's on spy versus spy kind of stack trench

Dan  07:23
coats and Fedora is walking around like you on the place. 1950s He goes on to get to the point where I'm absolutely positive, he's drunk.

Alex Jones  07:32
You're gonna have to actually deal with reality now. So infowars.com forward slash of live feeds. We got to go to the four ball now.

Jordan  07:41
I can't even say all of the words. I'm already

Alex Jones  07:44
late to speak. So we're gonna get on to that right now. I'm gonna sneak off and pass on some. We're gonna get to the age of fake bullshit is over. Sure. The return of man is here. Not good. Get ready. Just kind of run your ass. Oh 1776

Jordan  08:08
Wait, 3076 bail? No, no,

Dan  08:11
somebody else. 1776 for the side and he was like 1776 baby.

Jordan  08:18
Like, I gotta go find a tree to pass on our I don't know. Um, that's a dry like, he's slurring his words. Yeah, that is a drunk, man.

Dan  08:27
Absolutely. I have some more clips. I'm gonna play that further. make the argument that he has wasted no,

Jordan  08:32
he's wasted because he's trying to act. He's trying to sound like he's not wasted. Yeah, he's trying to sound professional.

Dan  08:39
And there's one point I didn't actually isolate this clip because I got lost in the 14 hours. But there's a point where he's like, screaming about how he's not drunk. Which I texted you about. It was like, that's exactly what he drunk people drunk is thing you can do. I've been a doorman at bars. Yeah, every single person who gets thrown out? Yeah, I'm not drunk. You're drunk.

Jordan  08:57
I'm not drunk. Are you accusing me of having too much to drink? I had a sip.

Dan  09:04
So here's my here's my thesis that may be developed over the course of this episode. Okay. It's a three prong thesis. All right. The first is that Alex was wasted through most of the weekend and that's why they kept him off air and had David Knight hosting most of their coverage for the 14 hours. All right,

Jordan  09:21
we got that one. That's pretty well established. David

Dan  09:23
Knight back in studio Leann McAdoo, also in studio Paul Joseph Watson lives in London. So he wasn't he just Skypes in and stuff like that. All right, Alex and Owen Shroyer and Rob do. We're on the ground? Rob do of course is the cameraman who sometimes gets on camera and yeah, is not great yet. Oh, also, they had shots because there's like cameras on top of cameras. It's a Communist Chinese restaurant. Yeah. And you could smell they

Jordan  09:53
have cameras that are videotaping people videotaping people. Yes. To prove that there is yeah

Dan  09:59
Rob. Do his elaborate camera setup. He has one of those things, the stabilizers Yeah. But what's attached to it is two iPhones. They don't even have cameras, they have iPhones that they're using with a boom mic.

Jordan  10:13
You know, the the cameras on the iPhones aren't that bad? No, I agree. I mean, there there's there's some good stuff. I'm not advertising for iPhones.

Dan  10:21
No, but you'd think a professional operation would have cameras as opposed to what I have. Well,

Jordan  10:26
we've already established their money stream is very

Dan  10:29
suspect. tenuous. Yeah. So my first thesis is that that Alex was drunk and they kept him off air for a large portion of it, which kind of makes it boring. Because we want Alex we don't want

Jordan  10:39
these other word drunk on broadcasts the whole time or 10 hours. That would be the best thing I've ever seen. I wouldn't have turned it off. No, that would be the most compelling situation to watch. So my specially because you know, he would fall in and out of sleep at least once or twice. Oh, yeah. He's pissing on a tree.

Dan  10:55
And he's drunk before the ball. Imagine after amazing. Actually, I think I have a clip from after. Okay. But the second prong of my thesis, do you have the speech? Which speech

Jordan  11:11
at the at the deplorable? No, that was oh, God, that was that must have been

Dan  11:15
incredible. I think that's behind closed doors. Shit, like Hillary at Goldman Sachs. Yeah. But the second prong of my thesis is that he wasn't really welcomed there at the inauguration. Oh, that Trump didn't even really invite him. He went to this deplorable, which was a secondary thing. It's like, if you go to like, Wrestlemania, there's wrestle con, then yeah, you go to like, some big event. There's a secondary event. Yeah, he was invited to deplorable. But there's a video and it's not really good for audio. So I didn't put it on in our collection. There's a video of him getting thrown out of the inauguration. No, there's a video of cops taking him out of a big crowd past a barrier.

Jordan  11:55
That is and he's going to spin it as far as on safety. Of course.

Dan  11:58
Oh, sure. Too many, too many people were coming at me the globalists. Yep. So

Jordan  12:03
there's a were afraid of me, you know, telling the truth. All of the clips

Dan  12:06
that he posted, all the interviews are him just somewhere on the street, surrounded by like 10 or 20 people. Okay, so all of the clips are places that you don't need access to get to. I have no evidence that he's actually anywhere important. That is amazing. So my secondary thesis merged with my first one is that this is all sort of an elaborate charade about his access that he has. Yeah. And he knows it. And he's cracking under the pressure.

Jordan  12:33
And he's not in the actual inauguration. really fucks him up, because he feels like he is taking credit for his carry in the water. Exactly. Yeah. And then all of a sudden to be betrayed like that, which we all saw coming. Every single and he wants to

Dan  12:54
burn. You're, like sort of weirdo. People. You're functionaries who are a liability. You got to burn them.

Jordan  13:02
Well, and this is the first time he's ever been stepped on on the way to the top because he's never had well, he's no one's ever allowed him. Exactly. Yeah. Nobody's he's never had anybody to step on him because nobody likes him or wants him anywhere. No. And then all of a sudden, he he did some he did some groundwork and it's like, now I gotta kick you to the curb. Yeah, I that must be a horrifying now. I kind of feel bad for him. I don't. Okay, good point,

Dan  13:28
I hope just on the last episode, he's very evil. Yeah, it's not so good. Fuck him. So I think that what's happening is that Trump has led him along in a big way. Yeah. And now it's gotten to a point where it's like, look, I'm actually president now. Yeah, I can't have you at the gala are going to cause a scene like

Jordan  13:45
he's led on all of his supporters like the day of like, the first thing he signed was like, middle class people need to pay more interest on their mortgage.

Dan  13:54
So it wasn't a part of any No,

Jordan  13:56
zero part of that. Yeah, all of his supporters are like, it's time for the middle class to really take over and then the first thing he does is go do we're gonna need you to spend more money and they're like, What the fuck

Dan  14:07
yeah, it's gonna be really shocking, like the waves of awareness that start by

Jordan  14:12
you. You tried to tell people just like He is lying to you, but just like he's lied to everyone. Yep.

Dan  14:20
But no, it's fake news, media, fake news. So if you, let's just get into it. There's one clip that I think is sort of coherent enough of it, and it's after the inauguration speech, and sort of a breakdown. It's sort of a, like a, let's, that's, let's fuckin take this apart piece by piece. Okay, the inauguration speech, and I don't think he does a really great job of it. But here is the beginning of the clip where he introduces his thesis, okay, about what Trump's inauguration speech was all about. Oh, boy.

Alex Jones  14:57
First off, let me just check it out. breath here and break down what just happened here today? Undoubtedly. This was providence. This was American destiny being re invoked. This was Trump declaring the birthright of this Republican George Washington talked about a

Jordan  15:15
little bit dog whistling. birthright means birth white.

Dan  15:19
Yep. That is that is straight up code. Oh, yeah. You know that every white supremacist got super thrilled. Yeah, to hear that sort of thing. Oh, yeah. But I, this is actually going to get into the third prong of my thesis. And that is that what we're witnessing is Alex Jones sort of being in charge of a move towards the accuracy, a Christian theocracy. Okay. And you're gonna see this sort of be established throughout this, this clip, right? And it's, if you pair it with him being a drunk on the streets, it's pretty funny. But if you take it just have like, Oh, this is the stated objective. It's incredibly scary. Okay. So get ready to get a little bit scared, and a little bit funny.

Alex Jones  16:03
And that Providence that started back in 1776. He invoked it, it was so historical, and I knew they were going to invoke it just came into my mind. And I knew even though he hasn't given the speech, I haven't talked to Trump about this. I knew what was about to happen. And I said, I got a tweet, that they're going to re invoke the birthright, I could just feel it, because that's really what this is. And then the media was asking me it was New York Times, it seems like they said, you talked to Trump. And how'd you know he was at a speech? Nobody else did? And I said, No, this is Americana. You understand? We're reading the same book. It's the same spirit. So I will tell them when I'm talking to Trump, the spirit of America, can you feel it rising? Trump feels it, he knows it. He loves it. And he wants to serve the people and empower the people to have America be incredibly welcome again, and empower the globe.

Jordan  16:55
That coming in and away from the microphone is definitely its pro. He wants to empower and power it.

Dan  17:01
I don't think he's drunk in this clip, but I think he's probably hungover. Yeah, but or maybe not. Maybe all of his weirdo supplements are actually hangover cures. Maybe that's the secret all along. That could have been the secret if you're hung over take Super Male Vitality, vitality, boom, right back to if it is, I gotta order. So most

Jordan  17:19
telling thing that he said was I haven't talked to Trump about it.

Dan  17:24
No, no. He said, I have. Oh, no. He said, I have wheat, not the tweet. No,

Jordan  17:29
I swear to God. He said he hasn't talked to Trump about

Dan  17:31
it. No, no, no, no. Okay. The tweet and the Providence ideas he didn't talk to Trump about, but what he has talked to him about is the spirit of America rising.

Jordan  17:41
Up Play that again, okay, because I swear, because the media is the media as the speech.

Alex Jones  17:47
I haven't talked to Trump about having talked to Trump about it, what was about to happen? And I said, I've got a tweet, that they're going to re invoke the birthright, I can just feel it, because that's really what this is. And then the media was asking me if the New York Times had seen the tweet, they said, you talked to Trump, and how'd you know he was at a speech nobody else did? And I said, No, this is Americana. You understand? We're reading the same book. It's the same spirit. So I will tell them when I'm talking about Trump, the spirit of America, can you feel it rising?

Dan  18:15
So he says that too, though, like at the end, he said he will talk

Jordan  18:19
to them or he will talk to Trump. I'm telling you, okay, what he is saying is one the media asked him they did not know. And two, he didn't talk to Trump, but there's a mind meld there. Yeah, so he is trying to, he's trying to consider himself part of that. When it's very clear that Trump is cutting off communication there. Yeah, it's

Dan  18:44
like a, like an axe who's starting to move away from you? Yeah, you're like, No, I gave them all their great ideas. Yeah, we're on page. Yeah. Who are you protesting a little too much.

Jordan  18:55
Exactly. No, he he is afraid that he has lost all of that connection to Trump. Because if he loses that connection, then the non existent media questions become even more non existent. Somehow, even in his own imagination, he will have to admit the media isn't talking to me anymore because I'm not a player anymore.

Dan  19:19
Yeah, all I've got is these these weird dudes who come on my show? No, like he does have a roster like a cadre of weirdos who do come on his show pretty regularly. Who we're all just like, on exactly the same page as him.

Jordan  19:36
One of us yeah, there's one of us. Google guy go Google guy got one of us.

Jordan  19:43
And we're reference to the 1920s movie freaks. Yeah.

Dan  19:47
And miraculously all the people who come on and shares opinions Skype in from rooms or bedrooms that look empty rooms. Yeah. So anyway, I think you nailed

Jordan  19:59
their moms are like The pizza rolls are done. Shut up, mom and you knock your ration

Dan  20:04
Mommy, I'm talking to Alex. So you rightfully hit the nail on the head that Alex and Trump have some sort of communication, possibly it's waning. Alex has some things to say about that.

Alex Jones  20:17
The message we heard in the speech has been my message for over a decade. Longer than that, but this is Americanism versus globalism. So Trump isn't reading from my sheet of music. It's the sheet of music. That's reality. And that's why it's so similar. When I say on the show, don't you hear Trump say later? Okay. And yes, Trump, obviously the host of the show, he told me, but let's just move past all that.

Dan  20:40
Of course he does. I like that. That's his classic move to let's move that. Yeah. Just move past that. Yeah. No, he listens to the show. President. Listen to my show. He's told me but to be fair, that's not a lie.

Jordan  20:50
I don't think it's a lie either.

Dan  20:52
When he was on when Trump was on Alex's show, said he was a listener. Yeah. And he said, he said that Alex's record has been spectacular. Yeah. Like his his history of

Jordan  21:03
other. The other thing. The other thing that I think is really scary is I don't think he's that much wrong about Trump giving his message. No, like Trump is pulling from that. Yep, that kind of playbook there, which is the most frightening thing.

Dan  21:19
But that's, that's, again, why I think it's important to do a show like this is you we have to illuminate the things that are being said, on this source that our now President actually believes. Yeah, he really does. And I've said this over and over again at various states of intoxication. When I'm talking to friends, I really sincerely think that people who haven't at all dwelled in weird parts of the Internet are about to be very surprised. Yeah, by what happens because some of our leaders and some of their advisors are beholden to or incredulous, have really batty dumb conspiracy ship. And the consequences of that could be staggering.

Jordan  21:59
Well, and it's also because of that isolation, where they're in their own world that just reinforces itself. There's that constant feedback loop of edits, especially like with Alex Jones, where he says something Yep. infowars.com Infowars. Then one of his crazy colors, also says it and then he cites one of those crazy colors as being people are talking about this, ya know, this whole like, big circle of people.

Dan  22:28
It's not literally alive, but it's spiritually alive. Exactly. So, you know, the inauguration went off. You know, there were a lot of people there. Yeah. Oh, tons. There were also a lot of very important people there. Maybe people who were presidents in the past, maybe

Jordan  22:42
people who are Rich's bowls, yeah.

Alex Jones  22:45
We're here. This is a giant victory for humanity. It is massive and looking at Michelle Obama, on the Jumbotron know, when they were singing the Star Spangled Banner, Obama with that arrogance smug feeling that he's better than everybody looked like he was dying in a fake smile. Michelle was frowning the entire time because these are called members who were put in power by the globalist so that they can help destroy the country and divide the nation. They are absolutely evil and what poor people not to have a future. It's why he goes to Africa says you can't have cars or air conditioning here. It was because he is literally there to hurt poor people across the board. And they needed that face, though as their cover to carry it out. Donald Trump right now is making hundreds of phone calls a day trying to get jobs into Detroit, trying to get jobs into Atlanta.

Dan  23:37
So,

Jordan  23:38
what I Well one, my fear there was we were going into a real racist place

Dan  23:44
or a transphobic. Exactly. That was tending.

Jordan  23:48
Yeah.

Dan  23:50
Yeah. mushing you showed a little bit of restraint.

Jordan  23:53
Did I was yeah, that calmed my fears a little bit. I can see that in your fanny went to Africa, which was not good,

Dan  24:01
which I think it's time to fully deal with this. I actually went and pulled the clip from Obama's speech that he gave that keeps being referenced by Alex about how black people and poor people in foreign countries can't have cars. Right. And please enjoy this clip, literally from Obama's speech that has been misrepresented repeatedly.

Jordan  24:19
I am so refreshed to hear Obama,

Unknown Speaker  24:22
Africa, we're gonna all have to work together to find ways in which collectively, we reduce carbon. But we make sure that there's some differentiation so that countries that are very wealthy are expected to do more. And countries that are still developing, you know, obviously, they shouldn't be resigned to poverty simply because, you know, the West in Europe and America got there first. That wouldn't be fair, but everybody He's gonna have to do something, everybody's gonna have to make some important choices here. And, you know, I expect that it's going to be your generation that helps lead this because if we don't, it's going to be your generation that suffers the most. Ultimately, if you think about all the youth that everybody's mentioned, here in Africa, if everybody's raising living standards to the point where everybody's got a car, and everybody's got air conditioning, everybody's got a big house. Well, the planet will boil over, unless we find new ways of producing energy.

Dan  25:35
So that's the clip that

Jordan  25:36
so that's the exact opposite of what he's insinuating it to be.

Dan  25:40
Absolutely. And that's the that's proof positive of Alex Jones not being interested in the truth and being just a complete liar. Oh, yeah, you build a fan narrative.

Jordan  25:49
You're gonna miss that voice. You're gonna miss that Obama voice so bad. We'll be around. I love it. You know, there's there's so many criticisms I have about Obama, especially regarding drone warfare, crazy torture, on so many, you know, so many prisoners of political means, and not even not even, you know, the lower prison, he released Chelsea Manning, which is great, which is the rest thing. Yeah. But there's still problems like, god dammit, if he wasn't trying so fucking hard to make the best decision available to him at every time. And

Dan  26:27
you could hear it even in that clip him like, in a minute of audio, he's able to lay out a problem. show both sides of it, and say where the considerations are. Yeah, we have a problem with carbon consumption, and it's causing global issues.

Jordan  26:44
And it's not your fault. No, it's ours. It's all together to it. Yeah,

Dan  26:50
absolutely. No, it at the time? Of course not. But we've gotten to this place now, where if everybody used carbon emissions, stuff like it like we do, right, we would be totally fucked.

Jordan  27:00
But if we are, if we roll back all equally, you're still the ones most fucked? Yeah. And that's his entire point. We're trying to do more of our part because we did more of the damage.

Dan  27:13
Yes. And within that clip, he even clearly says, you know, we have to find a way to not resign you to poverty, and not completely destroyed the societies that we have built already. Absolutely. So

Jordan  27:26
it's like, do you mean, the thing that makes sense? It's the

Dan  27:29
literal opposite of what Alex says. He's saying, yeah, it's fucking insanity.

Jordan  27:34
It's he that yeah, just saying that Obama hates poor people, or that Trump is trying to bring jobs back whenever Obama brought all the jobs back tons. Like he did that with the auto bailout. Whenever it was so close to all of those places just being like, well, GM is gone. Yeah. Like it was very close to that. And at no point in time, does anybody ever give him the credit of being the guy who forced that shit through right

Dan  28:04
and against principles? To some extent? Absolutely. Well, the end result of me not doing this is more important to my principles than saying, like, let's not bail out these businesses that made bad decisions,

Jordan  28:17
which is why that That's right. An adult? Yeah. Where are where are the adults?

Jordan  28:24
I don't know, where do they go? freezin

Dan  28:27
tell you, they're not an occupied text. They're not there. So here's another another fun clip, to get to this is a little meandering towards the middle and end. But it starts with an awesome lie. And I'd like to remind you that statistically, I can confirm for you that 6% of Alex Jones's audience is under the age of 18. Correct. Keep that in mind as this clip starts.

Alex Jones  28:50
The amount of young people, the amount of teenagers that are listeners, this is indicative of the huge, incredible awakening that is happening on a planetary scale, not just here. So make no mistake, this revolution against globalism, this revolution against globalism is something that belongs to the people and Trump said that this revolution is about you. You are what empowers it, you are the future. And we're gonna get out of your way and let you have your destiny. Have your dreams and we understand America special in that destiny, and that as America goes, the rest of the world goes. Washington envisioned all of this in his farewell address. He saw this not in Providence in a vision. And now it's all come true. The enemy knew that. That's why they always invoke the occult invoke, don't talk about God, wait, right. I'm talking about providence. Don't say, you know, America is great and all this stuff, to demoralize us not to have this birthright. It's when they teach you in school, how horrible you know, the idea of American providence and manifest destiny. And all of this is and talk about the problems and crimes associated. There's problems and crimes associated with any humans or any movement, but overall the greater Destiny could have Beat tyranny worldwide and to stop a great evil in the future, and I believe it's gonna be this republic in the future that defeats the entire world government anti human eugenics anti human technocracy system. So

Dan  30:13
it's an anti human eugenics based technocracy system, but that's almost like a Philip K Dick.

Jordan  30:21
What is a human eugenics? technocracy? Is the saying that we're going to turn well, one we've already established Chimera as a real be right. And we're gonna turn people into computers. It's the

Dan  30:36
singularity my friend.

Jordan  30:37
I mean, that's common, no matter what we do. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  30:40
that's how we already have cyborg. So

Jordan  30:42
we're gonna, we're gonna go with the gray goo theory.

Dan  30:45
Well, the the eugenics part is basically just, that's about abortion and Planned Parenthood. Yeah, the technocracy I believe is about the singularity and the our growing reliance on a surveillance state. And so like, that's like, which is a legitimate fear, you want to complain about that we can talk? You know, that's, that's fine. I don't know what the I guess the anti human part is just he thinks that they are Satanic and hate people.

Jordan  31:09
Yeah, he goes, he goes with the religion. Do you okay, here's where we're gonna. Here's where we're gonna get into another thing right there. Um, is there any Christian principle he adheres to other than saying he's

Dan  31:24
a Christian? Ah, he, I mean, it's because he lies

Jordan  31:27
all the time. So we got that commandment. That's one of the big ones. That's one of the big ones. Perhaps the biggest one,

Dan  31:35
he doesn't honor his father because he claims that he did things he didn't do, clearly. Okay, lies about his dad's battlefield.

Jordan  31:42
What happened to his mother? No. Is he the first like Jesus to come from his dad's but it's a chimera. He's a chimera,

Jordan  31:52
or a clone could be he could be a clone should?

Jordan  31:55
That's that's a possibility.

Dan  31:57
I don't I don't actually know too much about his mom. I feel like it might be important to do research about I think, I think leave her alone. If she wants to be left his family that isn't invoked by him. I have no interest in knowing about because it seems like sort of not fair game. Right. His his son, to the extent that he is an Info Wars reporter is fair game. But at the same time, I don't want to make fun of him because he's a kid. He's a kid. His dad is fair game, because he is. He's brought up a ton and makes a weird toothpaste decision. Has

Jordan  32:27
his dad ever been on the show? No, I

Dan  32:28
don't know. I don't think so. Okay, but also, this is an announcement that needs to be made. I don't have a clip of this. But the Infowars on the last episode, when we found out that they're selling body armor, I predicted that they're gonna start selling guns. And now they have started selling gun parts.

Jordan  32:44
God that's fucking

Dan  32:48
they announced on the 14 hour broadcast that they're selling ar 15 lowers which is the central piece of an AR 15 which is the gun that is most commonly used in mass shooting, which is really problematic.

Jordan  33:02
I I'm kind of anti human right now after

Dan  33:07
I'm pro anti the choices we keep making technocracy

Jordan  33:10
is probably better than a gun based economy like, I don't know, man,

Dan  33:17
a bunch of crazy, paranoid religious folks with guns.

Jordan  33:22
It is. It is hard to make the argument that humans are a net positive for the

Dan  33:28
earth at this point. Yeah.

Jordan  33:30
Or even a net positive for each other.

Dan  33:33
Yeah. I mean, you know, there's, there's always exceptions to rules. And there's some great people out there, but yeah, most of them seem pretty shitty. Yeah. That last clip, I think, illustrated one of the problems that I had with editing this up and getting these clips ready. And that is that this speech is about 12 minutes of uninterrupted talking, wow, doesn't stop for a breath for like 10 minutes. And he's just it's verbal, jazz. Yes. scatting. And I don't know

Jordan  34:02
where there can't there can't be a through line to that because even in that little clip, there was barely a little consistency in message there. Oh, it is

Dan  34:10
sort of like we beat the globalists. Yeah.

Jordan  34:14
And it was like, does he does he not? You know, we committed like a lot of genocide. Does he like not like the genocide

Dan  34:26
get this that was the globalists that did that.

Jordan  34:28
God there's just that they

Dan  34:32
have never done that kind of thing. But the

Jordan  34:34
Patriots that he likes from Texas, tried to kill all the Mexicans like I love the Remember the Alamo as like, we're defending ourselves when it's like no, you want to take all their stuff.

Dan  34:48
Remember parts of the Alamo? Yeah. That's really what the message is. So this next clip it I don't remember exactly where it goes, but it's more bebop and and scatting. Having to do with the new world order

Alex Jones  35:02
did everything in the world orders done has been decided to bring this country down because they can't have a big free, open, wealthy nation state with a big fat middle class, upwardly mobile people inside this impoverished anti human world government system or establishing the American system is too much competition for them. They admit that in the white papers, the British government 200 years ago wrote, they couldn't compete with the American system. And again, the British now are throwing off globalism, they're throwing off these winners. So this is an incredible time to be alive. It is an amazing time to be alive. And it is quite frankly, so humbling and stunning. The fact that we go through these crowds of people, and people of every race, color, creed are all just humans with red blood. This is breaking the will of the media that's trying to

Dan  35:47
you pan around that audience, by the way, and there's like, I bet it's all white, I would say 98%. We do get some interviews a little bit later in these clips, he manages to find the one black guy whose

Jordan  35:59
god that tokenism as like a representative idea is so disappointing.

Dan  36:04
He interviews two people later and one of them is a black guy who I think is a preacher. And the other is an incredibly angry Indian dude. Awesome. That's a tease.

Jordan  36:15
Was it actually Dinesh D'Souza?

Dan  36:19
I think he's under house arrest. He's fucking

Jordan  36:20
nuts. Yeah. No, but here's the thing. And what he said that is, is actually true, which is that the fat middle class has been taken away. There's no upward mobility at this point. Yeah. And his reasoning for it is so wrong. Like the people who have taken it away are the ones who are in control of the White House and the Congress right now. And eventually the Supreme Court.

Dan  36:50
Yeah. I mean, it's it's people who are in business who have done this.

Jordan  36:53
Yeah. Who did it on purpose for it like those people drive me insane? Because it's like, you have a billion dollars. And you're using all this wealth and influence to turn that billion dollars into $2 billion,

Dan  37:06
or 1.2 billion. You have? No,

Jordan  37:09
you have no reason to do any of this other than this weird, sociopathic, greedy, like mental illness.

Dan  37:16
I think what it is, is that people who are really rich now a lot of them are super jealous of old money. There's no money and old money and I think that people believe this is a kind of an assumption on my part. I'm not I don't have any facts to back this up. But I know that new money is kind of scoffed at as opposed to the people who are like the Rockefellers like Trump. Carnegie Trump is very scoffed at Yeah, and I think that these billionaire folk, they're like if we amass enough money, next generation will be old money. Yeah, there's an idea that they could become the new old money right? Well, and

Jordan  37:51
I do think that there is kind of some of that happening right now where I'm sure upward mobility I'm sure they look down on those Silicon Valley billionaires are like birds. Yeah. Oh, you guys don't even what are you still gonna wear a fucking hoodie? nouveau riche asshole. Yeah,

Dan  38:09
you can't show up without an eye. Yeah.

Jordan  38:13
Without an ascot. So this clip is the one true rule of knowledge. Right, ladies and gentlemen, we're wearing as we are always Ascot knit up. So here we go.

Alex Jones  38:22
Create racial division, and trying to say that if you're not a white person, you can't you know, have godlike private property or future you don't have the American birthright, you don't have a future of wealth. That's your enemy. That's racist. This is a cult programming to make people poor and make them the slaves of the globalist who all over the world will play different groups off against each other, which Ukraine, they'll play Catholic off against Orthodox, or it's a country in Africa, they'll play the Christians off against the, you know, the Animus of the Muslims or vice versa. It's all divide and conquer because the elite are destroying nation states and trying to make us poor.

Jordan  38:59
That's true. Cool. That's 100% True. Well,

Jordan  39:03
I think he's absolutely right there. I mean, it's not the globalist, although, I mean, if we're gonna use globalist as a blanket term, but, you know, just going by post reconstruction, reconstruction aerosol How do you get wealthy people to stay wealthy and the poor people to stay poor have

Dan  39:21
two groups of poor people fight with each other? Exactly. Yeah.

Jordan  39:24
I mean, that it's such an old perfect strategy that always worked

Dan  39:28
well. This is again one of those points where whenever Alex is talking bullshit we kind of have to stop and say like when you got a good point

Jordan  39:35
he's that's a perfectly good point. I wish it wasn't directed at an imaginary enemy.

Dan  39:40
Well, that's the thing is like you have a good point we agree with your diagnosis, but we don't agree with your idea of how to treat it or what caused it. Yeah, you're describing a problem but everything else around it is wackadoo Yeah, the and wackadoo

Jordan  39:56
How did we not come up with that before I probably seven F So those are six episodes or whatever.

Dan  40:02
I can't even keep track of how many we've done Lian. wackadoo. But I want to jump straight into this next clip because it kind of, you're gonna lose a little bit of respect for him.

Jordan  40:10
Oh, no, whatever

Dan  40:11
he built

Jordan  40:11
Island hates it. Yeah, I mean, he did. He did a couple of good jobs in a row.

Dan  40:16
Yeah, but he's gonna Yeah, here we go. Here

Alex Jones  40:18
we go. So America died. Basically, in the last few years. It was a globalist program bushes and Clintons behind it with criminal elements of the intelligence agencies. But America isn't just a person, I'm sure a person doesn't get resurrected, Jesus or Lazarus. But a country can come back from the dead. And America began to come back from the dead in the last few months, and now has come back to life. The Phoenix is coming up right now. And how powerful that Phoenix is how incredible that destiny is. He's up to us. We are what breathes life into the spirit into us. And the enemy knows everything's energy. You see, forget all the religious books and all the preachers are there to control the paradigm. They that the enemy wants to destroy our spirit make us feel weak, so we don't take our birthright and destiny. We're taking the destiny in our hands. We're breathing life into it. And those devil worshippers up there the enemy devil worshiper, Obama devil worshippers. Well, now these are devil worshippers, well, not a worshiper, they want people they want to be number one, they don't like see you they see the white paper. Okay, what somebody that wants prosperity and Renaissance, they want wealth, a cornucopia. They're not jealous of somebody who's got a big house or good looking wife, or vice versa, as long as you. For me, I think your success is great. These people are devil worshipers. And what happened today was the the chief executive invited God back in and said the doors open. And instead of the people, the doors open now to you. If you want this birthright, if you want goodness, we've all got to be good. We've got to come together. And we've got to whether you're black, hire white people, if you're white, or blue, whatever the only issues that we stand for and what we believe in and transcend all the control.

Jordan  42:10
Did Trump say no? No, I don't think he did. I don't think he I don't think he asked people to come together. He definitely didn't invoke God or providence.

Dan  42:21
I think he did a little bit did he gave his overtures towards Jesus because all of

Jordan  42:25
the all of the like, I couldn't I could not listen to any of it away without vomiting. Like I just couldn't do it. No way. But I did see a couple of those, like, the list of words that have never been said in an inauguration carnage. Yeah. Yeah, there was no message of hope. And yes, we can there was pure, like, this country is turning into a monstrous nightmare. Gonna

Dan  42:51
die. Yeah. Which is I mean, I hate another point. We

Jordan  42:55
all agree. We can all agree on that. Yeah. We're all different reasons. But yeah, there. Well, I

Dan  43:00
think that we, you know, we talk about confirmation bias a bunch on the show. Yeah. And I think it is one of those things that, you know, there are other logical fallacies you can be beholden to. And one of them is actually, I think it is still just confirmation bias, you believe whatever you want to believe. Yeah. And you read into things, whatever you want to read into them. And so if you hear Trump go up there and vaguely mentioned religion up like he's brought God pain,

Jordan  43:24
yeah, that was the main part of his speech, because he said a little bit about it. Well, it's

Dan  43:28
the same thing with this. We have to say radical Islam, right? Like that idea that like

Jordan  43:33
or digital Dropbox.

Dan  43:39
But like the premise that, like, we have to say it or else we can't tackle it is such bullshit. Yeah, like the idea that we have to use these precise words. So if someone does say radical Islam, all of a sudden, it becomes code for oh, they believe everything, I believe.

Jordan  43:55
Well, and then the argument for Trump only briefly mentioning it is like, he can't say it directly. Otherwise people will No,

Dan  44:03
no, do. Did you see that speech? I think it was at the CIA meeting that he had. He said, No, no, no, it was it was it was one of the previous speeches that he gave. He was like, we're gonna take down radical Islam. You have to say it, folks. You just have to say the words. You're buying

Jordan  44:19
into that? Yeah. Yeah. You're also did didn't did Alex Jones just say it's all energy? Oh, yeah. He just said it's all energy going full hippie. He went, Yeah, he left he left to the Christian train. And was just like, hey, man, Guy is real. The spirit of the earth. Have you guys ever seen Have you guys ever played Final Fantasy seven? You remember when the bubble and up yeah, that's guy.

Dan  44:45
Now I know that we making a hard sales pitch on this body armor. One of the things I should tell you is it will align your chakra it will get your Kundalini rising.

Jordan  44:58
Have you seen the past I kneel gland on people who are wearing these. Well, that is insane the Third Eye awakens, but

Dan  45:06
that's why he sells the water filtration devices because you know the fluoride in the water calcifies your pineal gland. Yeah, that makes perfect sense. I'm actually not 100% Sure That's bullshit. But Alex has never said that. Yeah, that might just be something I read on some weird hippie webs. Yeah,

Jordan  45:21
I'm not I'm not too worried about crystals.

Dan  45:24
So that at this point, Alex gets into a little bit of a straw man attack about Russia, which is kind of fun. To give you some sort of a little bit of a setup to this. Maxine Waters was being interviewed on TV, who's Maxine Waters, she's a Democratic House member, okay, I believe

Jordan  45:42
that otherwise I'm, you know, never gonna make the right phone call. She

Dan  45:45
gives bad interviews, is the problem. So she when she's on TV, she will often say things in ways that are really easy to attack. So she becomes like, sort of a lightning rod for Republican attacks. She ends up being attacked a ton, and which is why

Jordan  46:01
she's invited back onto those shows because it's going to create that dumb drama. Yeah.

Dan  46:05
And the most recently she was talking about how if, if it comes out that the Russians were consulting with Trump about his campaign, and how to frame things like saying that Hillary is crooked, and saying that she's sick, yeah, then these should be impeachable offenses.

Jordan  46:24
Is that technically treason? I feel like anytime. Even in the Constitution, it says if there's a foreign agent that influences the election,

Dan  46:34
I don't think that's specifically in the definition of treason.

Jordan  46:38
That's a good point.

Dan  46:40
They very specifically define what it is. I don't think it may actually be I think he might have committed other treasons. But I don't think this one is better treason, but it's an impeachable offense. Absolutely. Absolutely. an impeachment her the way she was setting it up, and it's very clear, if you go watch the clip, is if we find out that this is the case, then that is an impeachable, it

Jordan  47:01
is a perfectly logical statement to say, but the way she under all the method of logic,

Dan  47:07
but what she should have said, I agree, because I studied tons of logic, formal logic in college. Yeah, I understand exactly how a B, C, modus ponens works

Jordan  47:15
at the University of Missouri. dairy program. Yeah.

Dan  47:19
Veterinary logics. Yeah. So,

Jordan  47:23
if this dog is old, then we fuckin cooler.

Dan  47:26
The problem is that she instead of saying, if we find that he was consulting with Russia, then we have to act on that. Yes. She used specific examples, like if the crooked Hillary came from them. And that's where you open yourself up to attack. Yeah, cuz if we know the tricks that Alex plays, yeah, he hears that. And he's like, Oh, Maxine Waters is accusing Russia of coming up with crooked Hillary, which isn't true, right. It's he even has played the clip on the show and then attacked it and been like, that's not what she said. It's insane. That's bananas. Yeah. So here, he goes off on that a little bit, and commits an incredible straw man fallacy arguing, arguing against an argument that no one has made.

Jordan  48:06
Oh, wonderful.

Alex Jones  48:08
The media push way too hard with all the race garbage. Now they're saying he's a Russian spy. Now. They're saying they've got communicate with him and the Russians. And literally now he tells he is not just Maxine Waters, this New York Times now says that Putin actually told him, Hillary was crooked. That's right, America, you can't have your own ideas. You can't have a strong leader. The Russians are the reason Trump got elected, and everything comes from the Russians. Everybody knows that's BS, nothing against the Russians, but we hit the Russians out. You don't come up with that. That'd be that smart cut with crooked Hillary. Like that. You're

Jordan  48:48
right. I agree.

Dan  48:51
You do hear a lot of claps and that's I think they're overthinking it. Because there's like, how many people are there? I would say a liberal estimate would be like 75.

Jordan  49:03
How would you how, what would a proctored estimate be a proctored

Dan  49:06
estimate? Since that's me, I would estimate it at like 75. Okay, but I'm being generous. It could have been lower. It's not a thick crowd. It's maybe like three deep in terms, but there are people circling him kind of, you know, he's in the round. He's like, he's doing Shakespeare in the round hole circling him, like sharks, like,

Jordan  49:27
like an atom, like he's the nucleus of this weird Adam of insanity. Has the New York Times said any of what he said?

Dan  49:34
I don't think so. Okay, I don't know. Because I look, I don't have LexisNexis I'm not going to show LexisNexis I'm not gonna be able to try and like search through all of their articles and see like, oh, do they talk about Russians and crooked Hillary, but I know that I know what Maxine Waters said. And he's misrepresenting that so it has to be the case that he's also lying right times.

Jordan  49:55
Now, here is here is the next the next question. There is I've also got I love nothing against the Russians, you know, like, all right, but that's that's a little bit that's a little bit right on the cusp there. Yeah.

Dan  50:07
Showing a little bit of your hand. Yeah. Now.

Jordan  50:11
I think it's clear that Russia did influence the election in some fashion. Yes. To what extent? I don't know. It's debatable. Exactly. And now and it's

Dan  50:22
debatable what means what you know, like, yeah, terms of like, what legitimate effect certain things they did have. I think it's almost undeniable at this point that they were in contact with Trump. I think they were operatives are illegal. Yeah. And multiple people who are very closely connected with Trump are literally under investigation. Yeah. And well, that thing about like they have they say they have communiques. They do. Yeah. Yeah.

Jordan  50:50
Well, and if you're, if you're the CIA, or the NSA, and you have the information potentially necessary to unlock like, undeniably impeach Trump, yeah. How can you not release that?

Dan  51:05
I think you'd have to wait until he was actually inaugurated. So we might see some of that happen. You think we'll see that tomorrow? Well, because if it happened before he was inaugurated, we'd enter a Constitutional Court,

Jordan  51:16
there would be a whole Yeah. Do we have another election? Do

Dan  51:19
we knew President? Obama President? Yeah, exactly.

Jordan  51:22
And where is it the Speaker of the House since we don't have a president or a vice? Paul Ryan?

Dan  51:28
So like, let's kill us. At the end of the day, you kill me first, you enter a bigger crisis necessarily than you need. Whereas like if if it is true, that they have this evidence that he's compromised? Yeah, maybe they do. Maybe they don't. I don't know. What are they doing next? Tell he's in office and then deal with it through the channels we already have.

Jordan  51:49
Here's my next question. Is there any benefit for the GOP to not impeach Trump? Like it seems like if you're in the GOP, you got the absolute best case scenario, in that you have an easily impeachable, uncontrollable idiot, as your president with a vice president, who is everything you actually want in the president. Yeah. And that he hates women. He doesn't hate women, but he wants them to never have control over their own bodies. Right, right. That's not hate. Yeah, no,

Dan  52:20
it's in his mouth. Yeah, I

Jordan  52:21
would never say that. Well, I

Dan  52:23
think what you're getting to is like the idea of Is there anything to gain by not doing it? Yeah. You're sort of touching on the same thing that Trump and Alex Jones have? Yeah. It's like Alex has outlived his usefulness to Trump.

Jordan  52:34
And Trump has outlived his usefulness to the GOP. Now, the

Dan  52:38
only issue with that is that Trump does have a sizable fan base of weirdos. Yes. But but so if you are the GOP, and you sign off on this impeachment proceeding,

Jordan  52:50
then in two years, your elections are done.

Dan  52:52
Everybody doesn't show up for you. Everything swings, either to like these weird fringe libertarian sides. Yeah. Or Democrats. Yeah. And then you've completely lost all of your political power. Yeah. So I think they that's the usefulness he has in that, like, there's a threat to going against him. But there's no upside. Other than avoiding that threat. Yeah.

Jordan  53:14
Which, and if you if you if you can even put together like a base understanding of what they're going to do in the next two years. How can you possibly imagine that they're going to maintain their majority in the House and the Senate? I

Dan  53:30
think it'd be impossible, based on those marks. Yeah, exactly. Because it's gonna get worse.

Jordan  53:35
And if we're, if we're talking about those kinds of turnouts, then that could be the the like, now, we're not talking about a 48% voter turnout. Now, we're talking about some real shit.

Dan  53:47
Yeah. And I also think that it's important that a lot of other countries have the ability to vote no confidence in your leaders. Yes. So like, if you have a prime minister or president, they're doing a shit job. People can just introduce measures to be like, let's vote on whether he should get out. Yeah. And we don't have that.

Jordan  54:05
Now. We have to we have to full on criminalize it. And we really should

Dan  54:09
introduce that ability to vote no confidence, because if we have that now, he'd be gone.

Jordan  54:15
Yeah. But then there's also that that kind of separation of powers element, wherein if you have a congress, like the one we have now that it's completely controlled by one by one party, imagine we're in a different situation where it's all Democrats and a Republican president, right? So you go with a vote of no confidence and all of a sudden the Democrats control everything, or one party controls everything,

Dan  54:42
but the vote of no confidence isn't done by the people in the Senate. It's done by like a general election vote.

Jordan  54:48
In what countries? I'm not sure if that's I'm fairly certain that's not how that works in I mean, in the UK, which is the other like main political system that I follow. I believe

Dan  54:58
in Canada. It's that way I'm not sure but maybe I'm concocting something that doesn't exist, but it should exist. It should exist. Yeah. Hey, you know what time it is?

Jordan  55:08
What time is it? It's time to pray. It's time to pray. You know,

Dan  55:11
my favorite thing in the world is Alex tried to pray and also know he prays again. And also my second favorite thing is him fake crying has both Oh, yes.

Alex Jones  55:20
So let's just history happening right now in this clip this network break and David Knight and crew can pop in whenever they want here, but I'm gonna go get settled down at an office and just take a shower or something and just get on my knees and pray to God. I'll be honest with you, I want to get in a room by myself and hit my knees and start crying. Because

Jordan  55:36
Oh, there it is. It's It's so good. Oh,

Alex Jones  55:40
he was gonna strike back. We got to be watching them. We got to be ready. But we know who they are. We know their plan was and I gotta say it. It's been Infowars it's been Infowars and you the people and our analysis.

Jordan  55:52
You hear somebody say bullshit.

Dan  55:54
Oh, yeah. And that's what kicked him out of his fake crime. Yeah, that's what got him to be like, oh, oh, crabs turning. That's my favorite thing in the world. He is so over the top and obvious with the

Jordan  56:06
the thing he least wants to do is get into a room by himself at this point. Oh, yeah. Rob nudes. If he doesn't get that attention, then he's really going to spiral into into a depression. Right? Yeah.

Dan  56:18
Rob do follow him around everywhere. Yeah, yeah. on suicide watch.

Jordan  56:22
I don't know if he's on suicide watch so much as it is like he is finally doing some introspecting that he has not had to do. In a long, long time.

Dan  56:31
I kind of imagined it being like Rob do is falling around taking the bottle of wild turkey from him. That's that's kind of how I picture it like No, dude, you gotta get back on the air. Come on. Oh, he's on like babysitting patrol. Alright, sad, I believe. Yeah. Here's a clip. I owe this. This starts right after that when I wanted to keep that one separate, though, because the fake crying is great.

Jordan  56:54
The fake crying is such bullshit. Here. He goes into

Dan  56:57
explain who is part of the info war.

Alex Jones  57:00
And our analysis has led the way as the blueprint battle plan to blow the hell out of them. I'll tell you people, when we take credit, I'm a humble person, but we need to take credit to know what's working Infowars and our guests and myself and you the listeners, the eyes and ears on the ground and Matt Drudge and all of us together are the info or we are the blueprint and the operating system that just kicked the new owners out It's America to supercharge common COMM And our spirit structures 1000 to one and our presidents even got the name Trump. So get ready

Jordan  57:50
Yuck, yeah. That's brutal.

Dan  57:53
He's very humble, though. I will say that.

Jordan  57:55
I don't think there's been an episode we've done where he is not insisted on how humble he is. Yeah,

Dan  58:01
well, I mean, it's that old adage is like of all of my great attributes. My humility stands. First of them all, you know, it's

Jordan  58:08
the most humble person in the history of the world.

Dan  58:11
Yeah, it's like you go in for a job interview. What are your strengths? Well, maybe I'm too good. Maybe I'm too good to be able

Jordan  58:16
just too much of a hard worker.

Dan  58:19
So now at this point, in his ramble out in front of these 60 to 70 people who are overly miked someone who may be from another press organization comes in to ask him a question

Jordan  58:33
who may be who might be, are we going to commit to the

Dan  58:36
he is, but I, you know, I don't want to I don't tip my hat about who he is. Because it's maybe a little bit of cross marketing. Oh,

Alex Jones  58:46
Bless you. Bless you. It's okay to love freedom. We're not just getting hyped up by Trump and then feeling good. We have the tools. We have the means we have the history. We got the pedigree, we got it all. Everybody here is America. And we and as long as you see the globalist bring people in, turn them against America, we're able to bring a lot of people in what's not getting brainwashed as soon as they get here. It's incredible time to be alive. Go ahead, sir.

Jordan  59:14
I'm with Breitbart. What do you think, really laid the woodtone

Alex Jones  59:18
he laid the word to him, but he empowered the people and let them know you are this revolution.

Dan  59:24
Yep. Breitbart, taking a question from Breitbart. And the question was, did Trump really lay the wood to him? What?

Jordan  59:32
That's a great that's a post game question to like a. That's like a football game question. Absolutely. You you really took it to him this game. How do you how do you I just want to thank God for giving us a president named Trump. Yeah, his name is Trump. Yeah. 1000 to one which wasn't he

Dan  59:49
laid it all out there on the Dyess. He really left it left it in, you know, the speaker's hands.

Jordan  59:54
Yeah. I just want to thank God for giving me the

Dan  1:00:00
Yeah, fucking Braveheart Christ comes right by Yeah.

Jordan  1:00:03
Well, you know, the chief strategist of the White House should have a say in who asks questions

Dan  1:00:07
to Alex Jones when he's maybe drunk on the street. So he allows Breitbart guy to ask him a couple questions that are all like really, like softball or meatballs. He was knocked out of the park. Drop his great Chuck Schumer sucks. Yeah, those sorts of things. Here's something What's your favorite Sunday? The one anyone when I go to church? Are you talking ice cream? I don't eat that anymore. Because I take supplements. Supplement, we have Super Male ice cream vitality,

Jordan  1:00:36
God I would eat that I

Dan  1:00:38
would do I bet that's delicious green that gives you a boner. So here's another question about the spirituality that's going on also from the Breitbart reporter.

Jordan  1:00:48
He was a very spiritual speech, unlike a lot of the rally speeches,

Alex Jones  1:00:52
and I tweeted, I said he's going to invoke the Providence he's going to invoke the covenant. And he did it. Because that's the key. Listen, I don't even be that much of a religious person till I got deeper in and study these people. They all understand that they have to get God out. Not let us feel empowered, not let us know about America's destiny, not teach what George Washington said they need to kill that narrative. Because from their atheist or globalist of you from psychological view, it gives us a culture that unifies us, so they've been killing our culture. And then they've been bringing in this alien culture of everybody hating each other and fighting with each other and trying to bring us down. But then while they suck, and SAP our energy, so the second phase of slavery just fell today, humans are trying to progress into the future. So they call themselves the progressive. They're the opposite. They're not the progressive, regressive, they're regressive. That's what the Jacobin party was about. And that's what the Democrats were called, was the Jacobin, or French Revolution party, they wanted to regress everything, and basically set up their own new tyranny. What you're seeing here is the real Renaissance. And what you're seeing here is the real 1776.

Jordan  1:01:58
George Washington quotes guard against the imposters of pretended patriotism in interest, George Washington, quote, If the freedom of speech is taken away, then dumb and silent, we may be led, like sheep to the slaughter. interesting quote. Yeah. Let's see.

Dan  1:02:19
In the last week or so Alex has also been up on this like I think he has a word a day calendar, where today's word is Providence

Jordan  1:02:26
arbitrary power is most easily established on the ruins of liberty abused to licentiousness.

Dan  1:02:32
That's, that's bingo. Yeah.

Jordan  1:02:35
Strange. How that on I hate it when people don't teach what Jordan? I really do.

Dan  1:02:41
But this is George Washington. 2.0. Ah,

Jordan  1:02:43
I didn't consider

Dan  1:02:44
that. Yeah. So he also in His Word, a day calendar. He's got Providence, Providence birthright loves Rhode Island. And then also, the other one is Jacobin. He has been talking about the Jacobin party for like, the last few days, the French Revolutions. Yeah, yeah.

Jordan  1:02:58
Does he know how that worked out? In the end? Nope. Does he have any idea what happened next? Does he know about the terror?

Dan  1:03:06
But you know what he doesn't? You don't he doesn't know. He doesn't know about that stuff. But what he does know is that no one else does. The people listening don't know. No, they have no idea and Jacobin sounds like a sort of, you know, the sounds like Lutheran kind of it has that religious field too. As a religious field. Yes. You can talk about the Maccabees and stuff like that. No one knows what you're referring to. You can talk about like, and that's why a lot of these pseudo religious people who scream talk about like the Book of Enoch. Yeah. Agnostic shit. Yeah, they've never read this stuff. They don't actually know what these things say. But they know that the people they're talking to don't eat right. And this the same thing with the Jacobin stuff to guys where the Democrats come from? God, not really. Nope. So do you have any information you'd like to share with our listeners about the Jacobins?

Jordan  1:03:54
Um, as far as that goes, the timeline of the French Revolution begins with a good idea. And ends with a lot of people getting their heads chopped off who maybe didn't have a common, okay. And then it further ends with I don't know, an autocratic dictator. And these people hearing based on a war like society,

Dan  1:04:17
these people who had their heads cut off were the Jacobins. Yes. Yeah. So regressive

Jordan  1:04:23
strange how that works. Yeah, strange.

Dan  1:04:25
So at this point, an African American shows up a mighty African American. I say mighty because he's got a great hat on, I'll say, looks great.

Jordan  1:04:36
What kind of hat bowler? No, like,

Dan  1:04:38
just like a gentleman's hat. Describe it. You'd I got a madman kind of. Oh, that's nice. And this guy

Jordan  1:04:44
you see wearing a vest as well, because that's the way you wear that

Dan  1:04:48
as I recall. He's got a full suit on. Oh, and a nice coat. That's awesome. Hey, looks great. And Alex says as much at the beginning. Still on here?

Alex Jones  1:04:59
Yes, sir. God bless you. You might as well get on tape radio Fabrice fella. All right. What's your name? Sir? morphin Marshall McGill, we'll talk about your takeover. Hey,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:09
you know what, today was the beginning of something new. We've been waiting for this for a long time. And, you know, one thing I saw the day was that our president is putting back America first. We've been compromising. We've been putting everybody else. Second, we didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings. We were politically correct. And today, our president says America has nothing wrong with any other country putting themselves first. But we're going to put ourselves first. And we're going to focus on building our inner cities, we're gonna focus on building our rural areas where we're gonna be focusing on education. Most of all, what I got today was that I president says, we don't put God first try it. And the Bible says that your righteousness exalts a nation, and sin brings it down. That's it, he brought the tower back, here you go, we can't do anything without God. And when we put God first, nothing would be impossible for us. So the most important thing it is today, and of all the different agendas and so forth was putting God first. And if we seek God first, everything else will be added to it. So I'm encouraged today, that we're starting over. And I'm encouraged today that we're putting God first. And

Dan  1:06:15
so one of the things that I think is really fascinating is when your team says something about God, it's like, oh, this is a sign that God is coming back. But when the opposite side says something about God's like, and he's a secret Muslim, yeah. And he's falsely pretending to use the word of God as a weapon. Well,

Jordan  1:06:31
the brilliance of the Bible is that you can kind of say, whatever the fuck you want, I'm sure especially if it's everything like even even in the even in what is it the Old Testament where it says, The devil can quote the Bible as well. Like, it's all just I don't think there's any reference of the devil in the Bible. Well, it's it's not necessarily the devil, but evil. Yeah.

Dan  1:06:54
But also, the like, this is the thing that always drives me up a fucking wall. Is that if you, Fiat Fiat. People who, like our religious refuse to acknowledge that one of the big parts of Jesus is that he undid the Old Covenant. Yes, the old covenant that is in the Old Testament is null and void.

Jordan  1:07:20
Well, because it was his friends genuinely had that conversation where they're like, maybe we should just get rid of the Old Testament.

Dan  1:07:28
It's there. It's important as maybe a historical document

Jordan  1:07:31
it is one of the great like, what is like a Philip K Dick, alternate history? What if we got rid of the Old Testament in

Dan  1:07:39
the High Castle, but only the New Testament? Yeah,

Jordan  1:07:42
God, that would be like the, you know, there's no utopia coming out of that. But I do think the world is a much better place if an eye for an eye is replaced by turning the other cheek.

Dan  1:07:52
Yeah, if you only use the teachings of Jesus, you are in a better state. There's

Jordan  1:07:58
the four gospels you're in a much better state like the the letters, the the epistles are all fucking

Dan  1:08:04
horrifying. That's because Paul was a crazy dude. Yeah, Timothy was a dick. But even taking those letters in

Jordan  1:08:12
if he was a dick, is my my review of the Bible on Amazon. I give a one star because Timothy was a debt.

Dan  1:08:19
If you take all those people who were really involved with building the early church, think about who those people would be nowadays. They would be crazy people. Yeah, they were crazy cult members who wanted power, probably. And they built the system where and they could they could get some power, which was within this burgeoning church.

Jordan  1:08:39
Yeah, I agree. They were they were like, That's the The interesting thing about that is, it was the reverse of most cults were good people are the ones being taken advantage by the cult leader. And in this circumstance, it is kind of like, they were taking advantage of the fact that Jesus was preached like love, which everybody is on board with, which might be why it was so effective. Yeah. Well, and also why it was so dangerous. Why they had to kill that guy is because he was he was like, hey, maybe this maybe this whole patriarchy with a, you know,

Dan  1:09:16
kill him. Yeah. But also there's, there's some indications if you if you go into it and look through historical records and stuff like that, there's a decent chance that they might have gotten their records confused. Yeah. And that the Jesus who was the rabbi wasn't actually ever crucified. It was another guy named Jesus, and that there was actually a

Jordan  1:09:34
guy named Hey, Soos. He's a really weird coincidence he doing? I don't know. I don't know he was an illegal immigrant that much. I go to Jerusalem.

Dan  1:09:43
We can't say this for certainty or prove it. But there are a lot of experts who believe that there were two Jesus's historically and they've been conflated into one.

Jordan  1:09:51
Yeah, well, and also the Jesus. The whole miracle story is the same one that Mithras has. Sure you know, like the whole thing. is just a mishmash and a hodgepodge of all these other religions Co Op.

Dan  1:10:03
But if you take a lot of the teachings, you take all the sort of miracles and stuff out of it you just take the teachings like the

Jordan  1:10:09
TJ Jefferson did. What Thomas Jefferson had a Bible where he removed all of the miraculous magical

Dan  1:10:15
the Yeah, the why a novel. Yeah.

Jordan  1:10:20
You take that out the Hunger Games portions, yeah.

Dan  1:10:24
Okay, so this interview goes on a little bit more, and it gets more and more religious as it goes,

Alex Jones  1:10:28
I want to warn the elite to kill Trump. The spirit is gives us if we get shame. It's already been opened up and it's already rising. And they're not going to stop it all over the world countries are trying to get out from under the globalist, the globalist are very, very evil, and they're gonna sit there and worry government, the Bible tells us about these are evil people.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:46
We live in the last days, we're living in perilous times. And the Bible says that the kingdom of the heavens suffered by us and the vows taken by force, we can no longer be passive, we can no longer sit back and watch our country. Go to hell, we can't do that we got to stand up for what is right. And we got to take our positions as men and women of God, not just for us, but we're going to be judged by what happened to the generations behind us. So it's imperative that your wish there were different, right? And we're gonna have differences, we're gonna have disagreements, we're not going to always go together on everything. But the most important thing that we can do is agree to disagree. And then he's seek the higher position of that particular principle or whatever we're debating.

Jordan  1:11:35
That seems to go against Alex Jones, the whole

Unknown Speaker  1:11:37
thing, that today, America has taken a step. And you know what, it's not just America but there are countries all around the world has been waiting on us to do this. But Bible says in Romans eight he says that the creation they moan and groan waiting on America is

Jordan  1:11:52
just showing off his Bible now.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:55
Yeah, there are people out there waiting for America to take it stand again. And they like in the Bible. But this divisiveness is black this white, that this just this this all this stuff is just political. It's just me because we don't wrestle against flesh and blood. But I believe that today we're on the right track. But we're on the right track.

Alex Jones  1:12:15
Have you ever felt the Spirit stronger than it? No, no, you know,

Dan  1:12:18
so I wow, that's sad. But also I want to say a couple things.

Jordan  1:12:22
That's really sad that he's never felt the spirits stronger than that day that day. Yeah. That seems to go against all of the

Dan  1:12:30
spirit. Yeah, the spirits really fucking up.

Jordan  1:12:32
Yeah, this spirit really shouldn't be dependent on the president. Right?

Dan  1:12:36
I would think not. But he says the couple of things that I think are sort of in opposition with himself. He said a saying that we should agree to disagree about stuff and look for the higher principle. It's like, just taking those words. I agree that there's some value in that. But you can't do that when the other side is religiously based.

Jordan  1:12:56
Well, and he can't do that. The thing that, you know, you saw where that one, white supremacist got punched in the face. Richard Spencer, yeah. And people are like, oh, you know, that's the violence of the protesters. But there's that like, he was literal Nazi. He's a literal Nazi. Can't we punch Nazis?

Dan  1:13:16
He's advocating that genocide,

Jordan  1:13:19
most American thing you can do is punch Nazis, right?

Dan  1:13:22
I've two thoughts about it. And I think they're both equally valid. Okay. One was that it was amazingly cathartic. And I can't lie. I watched that clip like 1515 times. Yeah, but I also see the bad optics of it. I see that like, it's just because you disagree with someone, even if you disagree with them intensely. It doesn't mean you should assault them. I don't think that person did anything wrong, but I probably wouldn't have done it myself. No, I wouldn't want to

Jordan  1:13:50
know I would I would probably well, no, but I'm not. I'm not a violent dude by nature. But then again, it is like he's a Nazi. Yep, there's no defense for Nazis. Now there is a defense for Nazis being allowed to or Nazis not being put in prison for espousing their dumb belief. Sure. That is, that is freedom of speech. You cannot be taken apart by the government. Yeah, but have you get punched in the face for being a Nazi?

Dan  1:14:22
I'm cool with that. Kind of comes with the territory because

Jordan  1:14:25
because how many times have I don't know Nazis or white supremacist? Just fucking straight up murdered? Everybody I'm bummed out about

Dan  1:14:35
Yeah. So this guy he keeps getting here's,

Jordan  1:14:38
here's one thing that what I wanted to talk about from the first clip right before the the last one that we played in whenever he was talking about, it's time for America to put themselves first. Yeah. He said it's okay if everybody else puts themselves first, because America is going to do that for themselves. Like that is the single Most we're all going to fight a war thing you can possibly say,

Dan  1:15:04
Well, if we all put ourselves first, exactly how do you ever have international competition?

Jordan  1:15:07
You do not put humans first. Yeah. Like, then you're, you're literally going when you come up against the other country that puts themselves first in any conflict. Now, there's always a zero sum game. Always, always, even though that's gonna wind up being more damaging to both parties.

Dan  1:15:30
Well, I think that the nobility of sacrifice has kind of been lost on people like this, you know, the idea of like, look, we can all play actually, if they would just sit down and look at the prisoner's dilemma. I think they might actually be able to realize

Jordan  1:15:46
their entire concept, would they wish they could fall apart? They couldn't understand the prisoner's dilemma, I guarantee that they would have no concept but

Dan  1:15:54
just the idea that sometimes collaboration is the best possible outcome right even though you individually would get more by turning your back on your partner, right? It's it's it's insane to me that people don't aren't able to have these abstract thoughts of like, we can all do better together if we work together, although it doesn't appear that way. Some horseshit anyway is the this interviewed some horseshit? This interview goes on and this is the last clip from this interview because I think Alex interrupts him and incredibly rude way. Oh, no, I think is really funny.

Jordan  1:16:26
I wonder if it's, nevermind. We'll get to we'll get to why I have an issue with him interrupting this specific

Dan  1:16:32
person. But to be fair in this whole time, he hasn't really. I think it's because he's put

Jordan  1:16:37
a lot of restraint into that bottle of wild turkey there. Yeah.

Dan  1:16:41
I watched the rabbi speak. I watched a call of white speak. I watched it. Kept that, but the power was strong. The power was Trump. Oh, that might even be sacrilegious. Oh, boy. Yeah,

Jordan  1:16:56
that's I Well, he's already said that it doesn't matter about religion. We're all energy.

Dan  1:17:00
That's true. So at this point, I want to take a little bit of a break from the literal chronology here and play a little clip of Alex being drunk cuz it's we need a little fun right about now. All right, so here's a drunk Alex screaming on the street after the deplorable

Jordan  1:17:27
nobody understood a goddamn word.

Dan  1:17:30
He said something about the Republic. I'm a fucking lush a lot of the time whenever I go for it. I don't think I've ever been like this level of drunk. Yeah, but you know, because it's booze mixed with Super Male Vitality. Exactly. The creates this weird. I hate to call it a demon. But like mania,

Jordan  1:17:53
I think what that I think a big part of that Super Male Vitality stuff is probably testosterone. Oh, sure. And testosterone. Yeah, if you don't have control over testosterone, that's what you fucking sound like.

Jordan  1:18:06
Yeah, all the time.

Dan  1:18:07
I'll never be more glad that I probably have low tea than when I watch him. Yeah, right. I'm super passive by nature. But it's like, well, the reverse would be way worse.

Jordan  1:18:17
Yeah. Well, and that's why it always it always boggles my mind, whenever that's never mentioned. And like all of the things that we glorify high testosterone for it's never come with like, Oh, and by the way, this is also the thing where it's like, you're super violent, you know? Yeah. Like, I don't know. Pick your sport. Any of them. Yeah, hockey. Why is Why is fighting still allowed in hockey? Because we all have to get out some kind of sublimated testosterone bullshit. Well, actually,

Dan  1:18:47
Alex talked about this on a recent show. Oh, of course, he did that. sports in general, are created by the powers that be in order to mimic warfare to take away our male energy.

Jordan  1:19:00
I mean, if it weren't for the created by a nonsense thing, that's kind of what sports are for like also, the reason that we don't have gladiators killing each other is because we have fucking football. But you also we watch people kill each other slowly.

Dan  1:19:15
You also said that Hitler was responsible for popularizing the Olympics, which I'm not sure if that's true,

Jordan  1:19:21
that is not strictly true. But the 1936 Olympics were the ones where the entire world stood like stood at attention for

Dan  1:19:31
there's a big reason for that. I can't think of any big reports. I can't think of any big reasons at the time anyway, take the mic away from her mouth because he's not done yelling. Oh, boy.

Alex Jones  1:19:41
Shadow 76 will commence again. This is just the info war. Imagine you get the physical fight with us. It's over. No, I understand that. I know you do now, don't you? We haven't taken the gloves off. And if you want to keep pushing Come with the economy Chinese everybody else. We're gonna blow your ass off the map. All the secret weapons ain't in the control you anymore, are they? They're now in the hands of George Washington. 2.0. So I know why you're shaking in fear.

Dan  1:20:14
That is a drunk man is a drunk man.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:17
I know why you're shaking in fear.

Dan  1:20:20
He also if you watch the video, he looks waisted. His like, he's got like, is he wearing a suit? Yeah, but it's the ties tie as well. Buttoned.

Jordan  1:20:30
He's just like, he's the guy at the wedding who's waiting to fuck somebody and it's not happening.

Dan  1:20:35
Honestly, it looks like he's out on Bourbon Street. That's really the vibe that the video has. And it's like maybe six people standing around him and he's just yelling at your music and just yelling at a camera. Like it's he's doing a wrestling promo. Yeah,

Jordan  1:20:50
it's that's exactly what that sounded like. Hey,

Dan  1:20:52
globalists, you know, you don't have the secret weapons anymore. Yeah, what secret? What was their secret? Oh,

Jordan  1:21:00
that's a good point.

Jordan  1:21:00
Yeah, we don't tell them. Yeah.

Jordan  1:21:02
I mean, he knows about him

Dan  1:21:03
well, because some color told him about him. So this one is a nice this is in between his two interviews that he does on the street. Again, this whole thing is supposed to be a breakdown of the speech. And it seems to just be turning into church.

Jordan  1:21:18
Or at least a long rambling nonsense. Yeah. Stream of Consciousness consciousness.

Dan  1:21:25
Yeah. So here's, here's, I don't really understand, based on my labeling of clips, I

Jordan  1:21:31
mean, a lot like Virginia Woolf is what I'm trying to say. This one is called gotta

Dan  1:21:34
be humble. I'm not sure. I'm not entirely sure. I

Jordan  1:21:37
gotta be humble.

Dan  1:21:38
I gotta, I gotta label these. That

Jordan  1:21:40
is his. That is his first track on his gospel album.

Alex Jones  1:21:44
Yep. And ladies and gentlemen, David knight in the rest of great crew are there in studio, I'm going to talk to a few more people that are on the street, and then I'm gonna go get a little bite to eat. And then I'm going to be back on I really need to focus, write some notes. I'm gonna go on a tree. Because this is a very special time.

Dan  1:22:00
I have to go back just for a sec. Okay, because it's worth it.

Alex Jones  1:22:04
Very humble. Because this is a very special time. I missed it again.

Jordan  1:22:08
He said very humble didn't No,

Dan  1:22:09
no, no, you got to see how he phrases it. Okay, funny. All right.

Alex Jones  1:22:13
I'll just be very humble. Very special times is

Jordan  1:22:17
a professional outfit.

Dan  1:22:19
I missed it again. But he says I need to go grab a bite to eat, put on some clothes and gotta take some notes got to be real humble. Like, what are you talking about?

Jordan  1:22:27
That's a great, that's a great checklist like to do list on his wall like,

Dan  1:22:32
well, it also shows a little bit of insight into his mind that like Be humble is on his checklist. It's like, Yeah, he does as opposed to something that is internalized.

Jordan  1:22:41
Which, which I don't necessarily, I don't necessarily find fault with that. Because I don't think it is like a an internal thing to be humble. Right? Like it does. It's not.

Dan  1:22:51
I'm 5050 on it. Yeah, you

Jordan  1:22:53
think so? Yeah. I feel like a lot of the virtues aren't really inborn. I think there's my thoughts.

Dan  1:22:58
I think there's work to be done. But if you generally do the work, it becomes second nature. Well, yeah. So it means he's either. So humility, deficient that he has to work on it real hard every day, or it's new. It's a new practice for him. I would actually go with the former. Yeah, probably. He

Jordan  1:23:18
seems like the most humility deficient person. It's like his entire radio show is self aggrandizing. How he gets everything. 100% Correct. It's true all the time. Like that whole that whole? Like, how did you know? How did you know you didn't talk to Trump? Because we're on the same page? Yeah, that's where I'm always correct. So of course, Americana, yeah, of course, somebody who's always correct is following my playbook too. Yeah. Like that's self aggrandizement to a ridiculous extent. Well, then what

Dan  1:23:49
you just expressed is literally what he says about why he's right all the time. It's like, no, no, I understand. I have the globalists playbook. Yeah, I'm not predicting things based on like, just random predictions.

Jordan  1:24:03
So there's no way that the guy who predicted concentration camps would just be randomly predicting things. Yeah.

Dan  1:24:09
So the globalist playbook. He's very humble. And this clip goes on for a little bit where he says some wacky, Lian wackadoo bullshit.

Alex Jones  1:24:19
The evil that was getting ready to unfold, he thought things were already evil. They were about to launch the full evil, total takeover the media arresting, torturing us. I mean, the whole nine yards torturing. And it was so horrible that even the intelligence agencies just said, we just did this. We can do this. This is crazy. It's like a comic book of evil. I mean, it's just so it's so evil. You see movies, you read history books, both fiction and nonfiction. You think things like this can't see it happen? And we saw God trying to get three llamas in this morning pass Homeland Security. And it's like, we take photos out there. No, believe it. I'm gonna put those up later. It's like, the llama or something. I mean, it's just so much. My point is crazy stuffs going on Rogers John shows up in a huge top hat. He's been poisoned by polonium. We're living in crazy times.

Dan  1:25:05
So the end of that was was insanity. Yeah, people were sneaking llamas in he said Obama's a llama, I think is what he said. No, he said someone's gonna put a bomb in a llama

Jordan  1:25:19
Oh God, a llama bomb would be the best day of my life. Yeah, that would be insane. But like just having somebody on the news say and there was a there was a bomb bomb. There is a bomb and a llama or I can't say that without laughing bomb and a llama. Yeah, like, well,

Dan  1:25:37
there's definitely better mechanisms to get a bomb somewhere. There are funnier mechanisms to get a bomb somewhere. Now I have to ask you this

Jordan  1:25:46
other than like a traditional, like giant cartoon bomb where it's the big circle with a giant thing on a Rube Goldberg machine? Yeah. Getting from the Middle East to the United States.

Dan  1:25:56
You just flip a checker over? Yeah, exactly. Over Yeah. So let me ask you this. Jordan, if you were to put a bomb in a llama, would you Where would you implant it? Or would you make the llama eat the bomb?

Jordan  1:26:07
Ooh, that's a good question. I don't think you're gonna get the llama to eat the bomb. No, but I think there's a funny visual. I think there's too many potential complications with the surgery. If you're gonna make I'm gonna go with a bomb depository.

Dan  1:26:20
Okay, if you're gonna make it eat it. You should go goat instead of llama because that's true.

Jordan  1:26:24
Those guys Yeah, but the way that they will digest it is they're going to explode immediately.

Dan  1:26:29
Right? Right.

Jordan  1:26:30
You gotta use a lava. I think that's what we've established right here. If you're gonna bomb something, you bomb a lava dig?

Dan  1:26:38
So you cut open the belly of the llama you put the bomb in right so it up hastily. Yes. Because you can't have a bomb just sitting inside this llama.

Jordan  1:26:47
Do we know with proper veterinary experience to successfully llama bomb someone? This is the best best conspiracy theories. Dr. Wallach Dr. Wallach false flag Infowars the whole time.

Dan  1:27:03
So I should be clear. I think Alex was saying that as a joke. Like, I don't think he I don't think he actually was saying there was a bomb and a llama.

Jordan  1:27:10
I think. I don't think that part but he did say he was gonna put up pictures of the llamas I might have I

Dan  1:27:15
haven't scoured his site. I don't know. But also the Roger Stone shows up in a top hat. He's been poisoned with polonium. Like fuck off

Jordan  1:27:23
is the top hat like the Mad Hatter situation where That's where

Dan  1:27:28
what Roger Stone is a notorious fancy dresser. I don't know if you know that.

Jordan  1:27:31
I did not know that about.

Dan  1:27:33
He's a little bit of a fancy man. I would say he's a glamour puss. It's possible to say he's notorious for that. And he does wear silly hats a lot. But also I was like, I wanted to try and like figure out what the fuck was going on with a polonium? See if there were any mainstream any possible any sources that were reputable at all? There? Aren't. There's just a bunch of blogs? Of course not. But accidentally in my research, I learned that Roger Stone has been banned from CNN and NBC. And the reason is kind of fun. Okay. He says it's because he supports Trump and because, you know, he's too conservative and he knows the truth, right? The reality is that over a period of time, he was caught calling various media personalities who worked for CNN and MSNBC. Quote, an arrogant No at all Negro a stupid negro. No fat Negro bad a professional negro. Stop

Jordan  1:28:33
it a man Dingo. No, no, that was real bad.

Dan  1:28:37
He referred to some as quota hires.

Jordan  1:28:39
Does he know what a Mandingo is?

Dan  1:28:41
That's a big dick guy, right? Um, specifically one big dick guy in porno. No, I

Jordan  1:28:45
mean, historically.

Dan  1:28:48
I don't think I think he does. And that's why he's using the term that's very not good. Also, he referred to I would assume it was Rachel Maddow. But I don't know it doesn't specifically say who he was talking about. He's called someone the muffed diver. So that's pretty

Jordan  1:29:01
good. I'm way happier with muffed diver than I am with me, man, or fat

Dan  1:29:05
negro. Now, so yeah, he called people who worked for those stations. Yeah, there's a good chance he is a homosexual.

Jordan  1:29:14
I just showed freezin some pictures of Roger Stone shirtless, looking like he's at Mardi Gras in Brazil. But to be fair, was a woman looking it was a woman licking him. Otherwise, he is a snappy dresser. He's confirmed that through various sources, some perhaps at NBC.

Dan  1:29:32
You consulted a professional?

Jordan  1:29:35
I did not Don't say that. I

Dan  1:29:38
know it's so awful. It's the worst and it's like a Why do you got to censor conservatives? Why you gotta Why do you got to kick us off the air? It's like it's not your conservative. It's that you say shit like that. Hey, yeah, you will not be welcome on our show. If you talk like that.

Jordan  1:29:50
Look, hey, do you want to cut the budget and maybe bounce it? That's okay. Do not go racist. Yeah, but also here's the other thing. thing about that though, is if you do say it's because you're a conservative, okay, then you are conflating that racism with conservative thought.

Dan  1:30:09
Oh, that's interesting. So if you're I don't think you would even catch that

Jordan  1:30:14
no he would have no idea that that's what's going on there but if you're going to get kicked off for saying racist shit and then say it's because you're a conservative that's that we're bad at that we're in those are those are you know the same thing you know,

Dan  1:30:26
that's called my friend one is part of the other that's called the classical syllogism. That is let's that is dead to rights. Conservatism is racist. Yes. Yeah. According to Rogers recording. But yeah, he's a glamour puss looks great. Wears top hats around looks

Jordan  1:30:42
great. He was good without a shirt with an older man. He doesn't look good with

Dan  1:30:46
100% Wasn't poisoned with polonium now, there's no possible way. No fucking possible way. The only images that he's released that prove it. It just looks like he has it. Yeah. Like it looks like he has a little bit of a pockmarked face.

Jordan  1:31:00
Well, I looked up a media I claim about that, where they were like Roger, Roger Stone claimed that he was poisoned by polonium, which was the famously used to poison the KGB agent Putin talked about and they they very, like, even more damning for them, is not going on a polemic. But just then going immediately to, and Roger Stone claims that he's debunking things in his new book, right? And you're like, that is the sweetest little fuck you there. It's all where's the little twist of like? He's claiming something that's so easily debunked double. And also, he's plugging his we're gonna debunk shit book.

Dan  1:31:44
Well, it also came out the other day that he's under federal investigation. Oh, really? Yeah. I wonder what for being in touch with WikiLeaks and the Russians during the campaign. Odd how that happened. But because he wasn't like an official Trump campaign person, it might be okay. For now.

Jordan  1:32:02
If you are President Trump, yeah. With the capability to stop that investigation.

Dan  1:32:10
Man, the amount of things gonna happen, the amount of political capital that would cost would be so tough. We're we're

Jordan  1:32:16
past political capital. Yeah, there is no more political capital period. Oh, they control the entire government. And Trump is a fucking lunatic. Right. But why wouldn't even

Dan  1:32:25
like minority in Congress, if pushed too far, and with millions of people on the street could shut down the government a lot. Ted Cruz, like it?

Jordan  1:32:33
That's a good question. It

Dan  1:32:34
could be done, but it would be extreme. But see, and that's I think if he squashed these investigations into his friends, yeah. I think that it might be

Jordan  1:32:42
a tipping point, that would be an impeachable, that would be the most impeachable it would be cut and dry. Yeah, that you wouldn't have to. And if you didn't, then why are we having America anymore? Yeah.

Dan  1:32:52
If you're going to like squash investigations that are that are concurrent and running and have been for about Manafort about Roger Stone about Carter Page. Yeah, then you are essentially admitting that whatever they're investigating is guilty. Yeah. Yeah.

Jordan  1:33:10
Right. That's the that is America today, buddy. yesterday with the Women's March. We were like, I've genuinely not felt hope like that in such a long time. Today. It's still back to

Dan  1:33:23
but I encourage you to look up a picture of Roger Stone in a silly top hat because it's kind of fun.

Jordan  1:33:28
I encourage you to look up a picture of Roger Stone shirtless, yeah, that is also fun. So it was a very Trumpy or no Putin me in jest.

Dan  1:33:37
I think I think Alex does too now. Really? Yeah, he's been he did a supplement test on himself over the last month Christ over the month of December and into January he is like I don't fuck him I'm not gonna play any of this but he's like guy so I used to be really in shape and then I you know started doing all this work too much at the radio I put on 100 pounds then I started taking the supplements and I just lost so much weight then you know the election got going and you know, I keep my supplements on a lazy susan on the table. And someone that's that's not good. Someone took away the Lazy Susan I keep my Molly on a lazy susan on the table. Basically, he blamed someone moving his Lazy Susan with him stopping taking supplements. Yeah, that makes sense. Like I gained a bunch of weight so I'm gonna do this test on myself over the next month. I'm gonna take them like crazy. And he doesn't he he loses like nine pounds or something like that. Who cares? But he shows so many pictures of himself shirtless. In these ads.

Jordan  1:34:35
What is it with those

Dan  1:34:36
terrible chestnuts? Yeah, crazy. It looks gross. So he's out on the streets.

Jordan  1:34:41
That's a that's a low blow from us. Physical appearance is not what we're here about.

Dan  1:34:47
I mean, barrel chest isn't a negative thing. That's true.

Jordan  1:34:50
You did say it looks gross though.

Dan  1:34:51
That's a personal opinion. Listen, that's

Jordan  1:34:56
that's one of our Lian maca don'ts. Oh, this spot gasifiers I

Dan  1:35:00
agree with you. I don't want to body shame him. But I will say this. He couldn't hit could not get it. All right. So he's back out on the streets here. It's the same clip just a little bit later after yelling about how you got to be humble. And Roger Stone has been poisoned with polonium, you finds an Indian gentleman with a mogga hat on a make America great hat. All right. And this guy is fucking angry. Oh, boy.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:28
Nice. Nice to be here and nice to see you. And my name is Philip Thomas. I'm a naturalized American citizen. I lived in many parts of the world. I lived in Muslim countries. And I know how human rights are being violated. You know, and people, people of other religions are treated like dirt. And this country is a great country for the past eight years, we had a nightmare with Obama. And that nightmares? Oh, what today? Yeah, as that younger brother, the African American brothers said, a lot of quotation again from the Bible. You read Daniel, chapter two, you will find God is the installer. And God is the remover of kings. Today God had installed Mr. Trump as the president of this

Alex Jones  1:36:11
country. That's right. We voted but nothing the enemy could do work in alternate against it was problems. Yeah, I can't cover the Providence I've experienced.

Dan  1:36:19
What was what was that? You really?

Jordan  1:36:22
Kings kings kings. Yeah. That's kings. That's bad often probably don't want to use kings in this situation and say

Dan  1:36:32
that they're responsible. Like they're there because of God's will. Yeah, it's also a really scary Oh, do

Jordan  1:36:39
you mean that whole? Like, let's make no laws regarding the practice of religion?

Dan  1:36:43
Well, I mean, no one's saying that anyone can or can't practice whatever religion they want. But this is a Christian country and God put King trumpet.

Jordan  1:36:52
Kings kings, kings,

Dan  1:36:55
what else you got?

Jordan  1:36:56
Um, I do. I do. Like how he not okay. Like you're choosing your words care. I'm trying here. Because he was very, very clear. About his name being Philip Thomas. Yeah. Now, that was a chosen name. And he's a naturalized citizens exact somewhere else. Exactly. He has chosen that name. Which is that? Yeah, that I respect completely sure. And there is a certain amount of nobody is more fervent about the American dream than immigrants. Absolutely. Because that's the whole reason you came here. You know, because that's the that's the ideal there.

Dan  1:37:37
Also, if I was gonna change my name, if I was a naturalized citizen, what

Jordan  1:37:39
would you change it to Dutch? Dutch freezing.

Dan  1:37:43
Maybe I haven't figured out the last name yet. But Dutch would be my first Have you changed

Jordan  1:37:46
it to Dutch Patel. This dude would Hey. Sorry, I interrupted you. Um, so yeah. So we've got the Kings there. I agree with him on the human rights violations? Sure. I absolutely do. I would like him to follow up with more why he's unhappy with the past eight years of

Dan  1:38:04
why it was a nightmare. Why? Yeah, it was a human rights nightmare

Jordan  1:38:08
like that. That's, well, that's a really interesting thing that I would want to have a full conversation with, because he

Dan  1:38:15
doesn't explain we're left to grapple with it. And if his argument is that it's a human rights nightmare, because of like the drone killings.

Jordan  1:38:22
There's definitely there's definitely a conversation to have on that. Yeah,

Dan  1:38:25
absolutely. But I don't think that's what he's talking about. I think that would be given a lot of credit. I think it's more brainwashing. Yeah.

Jordan  1:38:33
I'm very much gonna go with that's not what he was talking about. Right. So now here's, here's the next here's the thing that gets to me about that narrative, or that that brainwashing? Can you point to any specific thing? That's not made up? Where Obama has infringed upon? Any kind of rights?

Dan  1:38:55
Yes. In their mentality? Yes.

Jordan  1:38:57
Okay. Are we talking about purely gay equality?

Jordan  1:39:02
Basically? Yeah,

Jordan  1:39:03
that's really what they're going with, right?

Dan  1:39:05
The idea that people would have to recognize these gay marriages, when it's against their religion to believe in gay marriage, or that would be probably the way they would pronounce

Jordan  1:39:14
it. Is that doo doo?

Dan  1:39:17
Why does this cake shop have to make a gay cake? Right?

Jordan  1:39:21
I mean, who cares? And yeah, yeah, sorry. gives a fuck sorry.

Dan  1:39:26
Make a cake. More don't or don't Yeah,

Jordan  1:39:28
they'll go somewhere else. Yeah,

Dan  1:39:29
don't but also also know that a lot of people aren't gonna like that. Yeah. The blowback putting up

Jordan  1:39:35
a sign saying, you know, no gays allowed Yeah, but again,

Dan  1:39:40
it gives a fuck but that's the argument that comes down to like, what the free market literally is, if you want to do that, you know, the, the people who are super like libertarian on the free market side will make the argument that like, yeah, if someone puts up a no black sign at their restaurant, then they're gonna go out of business because everyone hates it. Yeah. And that sounds good in theory, but if you look at what happened with Chick fil A,

Jordan  1:40:04
it doesn't work that way didn't fucking bother them at all.

Dan  1:40:07
In fact, the Republicans rallied around it. The Christian conservatives were like, we're gonna go to Chick fil A and make a big deal out of how we're going to it to support them for hating gay people. Yeah. So like, No, there aren't enough bigots in the world that will celebrate that decision. Yeah, that it kind of will keep them in business.

Jordan  1:40:24
And then but but even then, it's not as though he forced anyone to do anything other than the same thing that the government is there for, which is in the eyes of our law. That is the case. If you don't want to acknowledge that the government cannot arrest you for it. Unless you are working for the government. They're like a judge or the clerk, the clerk that famously Yeah. For her to deny those licenses. is illegal. Yeah. Because that's a purely law issue. Yeah. If you work at a fucking cake shop, you don't have to acknowledge that they're getting married. You're just making a fucking cake. Sure. Sure. Sure. Like nobody put those people in jail for it. And I don't think because that's illegal

Dan  1:41:16
with any understanding of God to like, and I don't want to get off on like, God as I see him kind of

Jordan  1:41:22
rant. Yeah. But like, he may not exist at all right?

Dan  1:41:26
Any God, that is conceivable, I can't imagine him being like, or her being like, hey, you lived a good life. I appreciate what you did. He had a great family. But you made those queers a cake. And that would be that's a big deal for me. That's like, I can't imagine that's a hilarious God. You do have to if that was if that was really good. That's a pretty funny fucking bet. Yeah. So this guy goes on a little bit more about hating Democrats.

Unknown Speaker  1:41:55
You know, my heart bleeds when I see the young people are supporting democratic party which is directionless. And now, you know, party they're trying to take Keith Ellison as the chief and he is Islamist. He wants to destroy

Jordan  1:42:10
United States disagree with that, and Americans should

Unknown Speaker  1:42:13
wake up. If you don't wake up, you will be in your slumber and your slump of lead to death. I

Jordan  1:42:19
agree with that.

Dan  1:42:21
For different reasons. So

Jordan  1:42:22
we're for two for three on dumbshit. He said,

Dan  1:42:25
But but the other two you Do you disagree with what he's actually saying? You just agree with the literal words? Of course. Yeah. There's no evidence I can find that Keith Ellison is a radical Islamist.

Jordan  1:42:36
I will find any there either. Yeah. With my zero research, that's how much research I need to do.

Dan  1:42:43
I've done a little and I I've also done some research on this next clip, which is another wild accusation.

Alex Jones  1:42:51
Could you believe though that in Europe, and here they actually sold out? And Brennan, as the head of the CIA is a hardcore hobbyist? Yes. And this has been put up,

Unknown Speaker  1:42:59
but and so we have to be careful. And Alex Jones is doing a good job. I've been watching his videos is

Jordan  1:43:05
he's a hardcore. What

Dan  1:43:06
will hobbyist What's it will hobbyist? It's one of the branches of radical Islam. It's one of the groups that's mostly responsible for the terrorism that we see. Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah. And the idea that John Brennan, the former head of the CIA was a well hobbyist, sleeper cell kind of thing is

Jordan  1:43:28
wacky? There's a lot of sleeper cells in like, there, because and I think we talked about this before, which is that because a lot of people are so reasonable. If you want to go and paint them as evil, you have to make shit up. Yeah, you can't you can't engage with them on reality.

Dan  1:43:50
That one of the big reasons that they have this narrative I looked into because I wanted to get to the bottom of why they think that Brennan is, well hobbyist sleeper cell, and most of it dates back to him refusing to call the terrorists radical Islamic terrorist who wanted to call them extremist terrorists. Okay. And within not not like taking away the fact that they were of the Islamic faith, but just prioritizing that they are extremist terrorist. Yeah. Which is really the more important point.

Jordan  1:44:22
Well, what do you what do you call the IRA?

Dan  1:44:26
You'd call them extremists. Yeah.

Jordan  1:44:29
Or would you call them radical?

Dan  1:44:31
Catholics?

Jordan  1:44:32
Yeah, radical Catholics. I do that though. Yeah, exactly. But even then, if you do call them that. What are you doing? Like what is the what is the goal there other than to demonize them? It's to tar or their religion? Yeah,

Dan  1:44:48
it's to tar other Catholics who aren't involved in their exact their behaviors. So if you're

Jordan  1:44:52
gonna go with any kind of radical religion there, then all you're really doing is saying, These are the people who actually They believe what they're saying. And other people who maybe don't practice it, also believe that that this should be happening.

Dan  1:45:08
Well, there's another dangerous piece of it too, and that it's sort of like they're doing it we should too. mentality of being like, these are the radical. Islamist the only way to fight them is radically with Radical Christianity. You have to have another crusade kind of thing. And it's not our fault. We had to do this to respond to that. Yeah.

Jordan  1:45:27
And that's his whole whatever it is, they say we're doing is what they're doing. Yes. So we have to do it.

Dan  1:45:33
This clip isn't done. He's gonna talk a little bit about Alex Jones is international audience. Ooh,

Unknown Speaker  1:45:37
duh. We have to be careful. And Alex Jones is doing a great job. I've been watching his videos on YouTube. And my son who lives in India always calls and tells me Don't forget, don't don't don't neglect Alex Jones views. It's very important. And it's a save America. And I'm so glad to learn Zola. Huge lizards in India. Yeah, of course you have. And they have to tomorrow, I'm flying to India. And I'm going to be an ambassador for Mr. Trump. The

Jordan  1:46:04
India's fucked up as it is.

Dan  1:46:08
They got a lot of issues on there. Not a lot.

Jordan  1:46:09
Did you see that? That dude just eliminated paper currency?

Jordan  1:46:14
I didn't see that. Just overnight. He

Jordan  1:46:15
was like, all of your paper currency is now worthless. Whoa, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:20
Because that was who's this guy,

Jordan  1:46:22
the Prime Minister, not just this guy. Did you see this guy right there who was talking to Alex Jones? Yeah. Philip Thomas.

Dan  1:46:29
I do know that. I've in the past talked about how India has monkey police. Yes. And people think that I'm some sort of xenophobic bigot because I live with that. I bring up the stories. And literally they have they have they have monkey police and police other monkeys. Yeah, it's crazy.

Jordan  1:46:45
They're much problem. It's such a huge place with so many different cultures and languages and everything. Like it's it's

Dan  1:46:57
the north and the south are like night and day from each other. And we can't even really understand that we think of our like, rural America and the urban elites. Yeah. And so like that. It's so much bigger than that. And

Jordan  1:47:09
then you get into Pakistan as well being and and this whole thing, it boggles my mind how it's all basically the UK. Like they just Yeah, so when it's their fault, yeah, whenever they just drew up random lines, where it's like, okay, everybody who identifies as Pakistani now moves from wherever they were living, and they just drew up these random borders, and that could not have caused more insane conflict.

Dan  1:47:35
It's like the remnants of colonialism being being brought to full light. Yeah, essentially. Yeah. So this guy has another thing he wants to say. And this is a direct shout out to the Muslims, maybe another pro wrestling promo type of shout out to the Muslims.

Jordan  1:47:49
They told

Unknown Speaker  1:47:50
me you have to be very careful about Islamic agenda. You know, Muslims are all good. Oh, let them be good at home.

Jordan  1:47:56
Nobody says they're all good. And also that

Dan  1:47:59
wildly simplistic view of the world Muslims stay home.

Jordan  1:48:07
All right, fine.

Jordan  1:48:09
It is it is tempting. The simplistic view of the world is so tempting. Of course, the good versus evil is such a tempting concept to believe and because it makes everything easy. Yeah. It makes everything so easy.

Dan  1:48:22
But what you miss on the nuances kind of reality? Yeah. So he has one more thing he wants to say. And this really scares me quite a bit. This is our last clip from Alex's breakdown of Trump's speech on the street. This is a bit scary.

Alex Jones  1:48:38
If they killed Trump, which I know they're seriously considering doing. I think it'll be an even bigger. No, no,

Unknown Speaker  1:48:42
I don't think that will happen. Because our police, our military, our secret service, they are on strong. By best I agree with they're going to try it on saying Oh, yeah, of course. Yes. Yes, of course. They tried, but they trade it beating me. But Trump will triumph. Jesus will protect them and protect Jesus and protect because God is installed and has installed Mr. Trump to become the president of the status nation, and the most the greatest superpower ever in the history of mankind.

Jordan  1:49:10
Yeah, that's, that's true. Yuck. That is true. We are the greatest superpower in the history of mankind, which is the scariest possible reality. Yeah, to have Trump as the fucking president.

Dan  1:49:22
But just that part where he's like, Trump will triumph and screaming it is just like this. So Hitlerian Yeah, like that is the kind of speech you'd hear from people who are super into, and I'm not here to say that Trump is Hitler. No, that's that's again, the good and evil who was it? The Super simplistic worldview is

Jordan  1:49:42
Dan Harmon. Dan Harmon has a has a great little. Not bid but just like this concept where it's like, I would rather we call him Hitler, before he becomes Hitler. Like if Hitler was called out for being Hitler before the book. fora he became that it's like, no, that's a good thing. That's a good thing that we're trying to stop this from happening, but

Dan  1:50:05
because we have the awareness of what has happened in the past, we should use that awareness. Yeah, that's the only way for never again to actually work.

Jordan  1:50:12
Yep. And instead, it is the same kind of nationalism that gave rise to all that bullshit.

Dan  1:50:18
Hitler used religion to mean it's, I mean, like, we're, you see these people on the street, and they're all like, they're wrapping up all of their religious beliefs into this nationalistic movement. And whether or not Trump means that to happen. He's not strong enough to control these people. Oh, yeah, absolutely not like whatever his real agenda is, like, let's imagine a scenario where he actually does just want to lower taxes. If that were all he really wanted to do, he still has these fringe weirdos, who are emboldened by him, were empowered by him. And they're putting whatever bullshit they have into his victory. And he can't control them. No one can

Jordan  1:50:59
know, which is, which is the lesson that the GOP is currently learning because they couldn't control Trump, they should have learned that with a tea party, you sure would have thought that? Yeah. But what they, what they did was they piggybacked on it. And they assumed that they could minimize it, while still using it. And I mean, you just look at how Fox News, instead of being the propaganda arm for the GOP, became the like, the GOP. Yeah, like they started to dictate to the GOP, what was going to happen instead of the GOP, you know, telling them to make their point. Yeah, exactly. I mean, if you if you just go by, like the stated objectives of the GOP 40 years ago, it's insane to think that all of a sudden, now it is, you know, not just, you know, lip service to balancing the budget or anything like that. But they're using these cultural like, hey, no gays, no gays, as a way to get tax cuts for the rich. It's the culture war. Exactly. And it's the same, like if you get people to fight over dumb shit, you can trick them into voting against their own interests. Yep.

Dan  1:52:11
And we can see that Alex Jones is analysis largely has to do with the dumb shit. Are we

Jordan  1:52:19
are we giving him the props of analysis? Well, I

Dan  1:52:22
mean, he would call it that. So I just want to give him you know, I

Jordan  1:52:25
want to say, Do you want to speak in his own language? Sure. Yeah. Speaking of his own language,

Dan  1:52:29
I want to end this episode with a couple of clips that are fucking awesome. Okay, now, please, I don't I don't

Jordan  1:52:37
want to limit microphone down.

Dan  1:52:39
I don't want to limit your freedom microphone down. But it's important to hear what's being said.

Jordan  1:52:43
What about my religious freedom?

Dan  1:52:44
Yeah, I'll limit that. So this this is an interaction that Alex had with a protester on the street who had a sign that had to do with free speech and the First Amendment being taken away and the press and, and what have you. This woman? I don't know who she is, but she is my new hero. Okay.

Alex Jones  1:53:05
I mean, really? Well. I'd love to hear about freedom of the press with him. Legalizing domestic propaganda under Obama. Liquor on your Oh my God. Oh, my God. Are you a Puritan? I'm just amazed that you're doing your job with liquor on your bed. I need the guts. I got too many gods. Maybe you got too many gods, anyway. Well, it's actually made up I've had a coffee earlier. Fake News.

Jordan  1:53:33
Fake news. I had a coffee earlier.

Dan  1:53:36
Yeah, that's why I smell good smell. Let

Jordan  1:53:38
her leather. Liquor on his breath. Yeah, that's I had a coffee earlier. God, Jesus, that is the most that's what you say to a cop.

Dan  1:53:49
But you have liquor on your brand. No,

Jordan  1:53:51
no, it's fine. I had a coffee earlier. Yeah, sir. Could you get out of the car? Please? No, I'm not drunk. I had a coffee. I'm gonna yell fake news at cops from now on. Are you drunk? Fake News. Fake news. Yeah. Oh, do you work for Media Matters? Police.

Dan  1:54:08
Soros paying 3 million people to protest. So that lady is fucking awesome. Yeah, she did not give a fuck no. So he you saw exactly what he did immediately when she started to throw that reality at him. You smell like booze? And he's like, oh, yeah, I need guts not to yell at someone like you. You tries to spin it? Yeah. Now you're gonna have to put the mic down again, because they have another interaction. Ooh, that's a little bit later. And, man, this is great. I just love this. This is this. This shows the thin skinned cowardice of Alex Jones.

Alex Jones  1:54:44
Oh, yeah, you sweetheart. Hey, if I was losing an argument, sweet cake, I'd be like MSCM and I wouldn't tweet cake. Cupcake. Excuse me. Excuse me. I wouldn't bring you over here if I was losing the argument. Okay, I'm other calls me. Would you like in some strange? Love it would you appreciate your life okay. My face over here cupcake.

Unknown Speaker  1:55:19
Yeah

Dan  1:55:24
What a dick. What a total fucking dick. I want to say that is totally fair

Jordan  1:55:31
thetic Oh yeah, someone who agreed with

Dan  1:55:35
us acted like that we would. Yeah, no fuck you. Yeah, yeah, that's insanely shitty behavior. Yeah, no, that's a first of all misogynist and that's a

Jordan  1:55:45
childish bully. Yeah, that is a 13 year old on the playground who just can't engage with anybody on ideas. Just trying to move. Yeah. Cupcake cupcake cupcake. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, that's full on drunk fucking ah, and

Dan  1:56:03
I think that's why they kept him off the air for most of the time. Yeah. Broadcasting, she does he say shit like that, you know, it's the I just,

Jordan  1:56:14
it's not a you know, and I can't. I can't call up the offense for it. You know, like, it is it is not something that I'm offended by. Because I understand any kind of plight know, that I've never had to experience

Dan  1:56:29
and to her credit, that lady handled that with a plumber. Yes. And decency and decorum.

Jordan  1:56:33
Which is why he got even angrier at her. Yeah. Like if she did started shouting back, he would have pulled back and been like, I'm taking the high road now. Look at this dump feminist. Exactly, exactly. You just fucking accepted what he was doing, recognized it and then immediately minimized and

Dan  1:56:54
narrated sort of the absurdity. Yeah, he's a child. Yeah,

Jordan  1:56:58
he's a small child. It's like what would happen

Dan  1:57:00
to us if we ran into the laughing would make him Oh, it would make him so angry. Whereas the yelling you

Jordan  1:57:06
wouldn't call me cupcake so many times? Or Or no, he would call me. Cake.

Jordan  1:57:12
Yeah, there we go.

Dan  1:57:13
Like look at you, you smiley fuck. Oh, yeah. You

Jordan  1:57:17
think it's funny? You think it's so funny to laugh at me? You're a cook. You're a cock. Yeah. No, that is fucking bullshit.

Dan  1:57:25
I was hanging out with our friend Marty DeRosa the other night and he had a nice reminder, he gave me a nice reminder of we watched Alex's coverage of Julian Assange his big announcement. During the campaign. Assange was like, at three in the morning, I'm gonna make a big announcement. And so Alex and his whole crew stayed up to watch that and broadcast it live broadcast their coverage of it, because they thought it was gonna be all about like the nail in the coffin for Hillary. Yeah. And all it was was that it was Wikileaks 10th anniversary. And so at that point, they started screaming Yeah, Kuk them Hillary's butt plug and all this and look how much that's shifted with an only a couple months. Yeah, only a couple months now. They're like WikiLeaks is the true intrusion. Yeah, it's insanity. To me. It's it's it's such a wild hypocrite. Fuck.

Jordan  1:58:23
But but here's the thing. And this is the thing that you see on Twitter all the time, or aren't even on The Daily Show. Right. Remember, whenever John used to have those clips of some, you know, Mitch McConnell saying some bullshit. Yeah. And then four years later, Mitch mechanicals are Mitch McConnell. Yeah, I was thinking Mitch McConnell.

Jordan  1:58:44
Hey, all right. All right. All right. All right. All right.

Jordan  1:58:48
Now saying the exact opposite bullshit. Yeah. And the thing about a team sport is no one cares. Well, you forget no one cares about hypocrisy, because your team is winning.

Dan  1:58:59
You forget that three years ago, you only won the championship because the guy who beats his wife was on your team. Yeah. And you turned a blind eye to that. So now you can still cheer for the team. Next Ray Rice

Jordan  1:59:09
ran the ball real hard. I know. He punched his wife and dragged her out of an elevator. But man he ran the ball were real well, yeah. I

Dan  1:59:16
mean, we see this over and over. Yeah.

Jordan  1:59:18
No. And that's the that's the problem. I always have with even even with people who were Obama supporters, who just accept everything. And it's, it's like, no, he was hypocritical in a lot of different ways. Sure. And there's a bunch of ways to justify it. And I know he's making decisions that are so much harder than I can even possibly imagine. That does not mean he is not still been a hypocrite so many times.

Dan  1:59:44
Yeah, I reject the argument that it's wrong to him to critique the team you're playing.

Jordan  1:59:50
Yeah, you should absolutely do it like the Democrats right now are they should be replaced by the fucking Women's March. Well, it's like it's Like we don't need

Dan  2:00:01
the Democrats like what Philip Thomas said. The Democrats are directionless. They'll have Thomas

Jordan  2:00:07
Anderson, the great director. Do you see Anderson? He I

Dan  2:00:11
mean, that is that that is a point that he makes that is very fine. That's valid. Yeah, but so anyway, the inauguration happened. Alex was clearly drunk for a good part of it.

Jordan  2:00:22
And figuration happened, which

Dan  2:00:24
means it's time to pray. It is time to pray and it's time for things to change. I have good or ill this episode is a little bit weird because Alex was out on the street and there was a very limited amount of coverage that he did. But in our next episodes, he'll be back in studio I think we'll be able to bring things back towards the center back towards a normal Alex screaming a whole bunch. Good deal.

Dan  2:01:16
I look forward to hearing all about it when you get back. Tell me if you find any of these Muslim no go areas.

Jordan  2:01:22
I'm gonna guess that people are gonna ask me about what it feels like to be an American in the age of Trump.

Dan  2:01:27
I remember when I was abroad. And there was a lot I remember when I was a broad. You're passing. I remember when I was abroad when Bush was president and he got a lot of shit. Well, there was a lot of like, whoo, kind of feelings. I can't imagine that it's any better now.

Jordan  2:01:47
I think I think if I do if I do a set anywhere. The first words I have to say are I'm sorry, I'm an American. I'm sorry. And then I can continue talking.

Dan  2:02:00
I'd like to start this up. But it's time to pray. It's time to break. We'll be back shortly.
