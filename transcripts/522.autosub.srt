00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,391
Last week there was an incident in front of our home when we returned from dinner

184
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:11,231
Amanda bicycle recognize being started screaming numerous political epithet

185
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,535
Which are not fit for a family newspaper

186
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:17,631
While there was a scuffle mrs. Stone sustained no new injuries in the event

187
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,215
Report said she was badly beaten or hospitalized are incorrect

188
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,543
This event was also accurately reported to the Fort Lauderdale Police

189
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,127
Seems like Alex is kind of embellishing the story a little bit

190
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,967
For dog pee probably should have reached out to Rodger for a comic

191
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:38,367
Considering how close the two of them are

192
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:44,767
How to report a completely false story about Rogers wife on air

193
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,559
Galaxy Golf

194
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
So

195
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,703
I would say this is not good and that's what story about Laura Loomer I'm going to need season evidence before even

196
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,751
Don't start caring about whatever is going on there

197
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,591
And even gets reported about her on Infowars as an attempted a publicity stunt

198
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:03,199
Until proven otherwise that Rodger himself is on a rampage

199
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,991
And has been dressing up like a

200
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,319
Only thing that makes sense to me

201
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:13,695
He's attacking people left and right dress up like a pitbull day drinking is involved

202
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,791
Now we get to the new framing of

203
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,607
The storming of a capital back on January 2nd

204
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,631
Alex

205
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,959
Some historical parallels feel like we're on

206
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:28,031
We're on like the 5th new framing

207
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,055
Other events that

208
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:35,711
Doesn't need any new 408 we're going to get a couple ones on this episode we going to get a couple frame this is frustrating

209
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
Okay good

210
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,295
Infowars.com is confirmed

211
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,343
January 6th

212
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,879
Was

213
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
2.0

214
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,231
Dog

215
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,047
We're going to be covering

216
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,583
When we come back

217
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,863
Riding that printer

218
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,167
Snuggled in that warm bread

219
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:57,983
Is

220
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,543
What happened

221
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,335
Price tag

222
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,807
He was very popular at Sonic stolen the election

223
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,599
Firebomb that

224
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
Match

225
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
So

226
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
This is

227
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
Good

228
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,951
I like the idea that something

229
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:24,351
Didn't print it out I'm excited to find out what that's going to print it out it's got the little hooks on the hours they got a

230
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,911
Perforate the thing and then a tear it apart

231
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:27,935
Yeah

232
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:33,311
I would say is a couple of details wrong about the reichstag fire here

233
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:38,687
I think I'm probably most important element he's completely making up his at the fire happened after Hitler won an election.

234
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
People thought was fraudulent

235
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
That's not

236
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,063
I like to say this because he knows that his audience is gullible

237
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,879
Ball and he paints a one-to-one comparison of Hitler and

238
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,439
It's dance to scare them more and drive more profits

239
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,207
Infowars

240
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:54,815
In reality the reichstag fire occurred on February 27th 1933

241
00:13:55,327 --> 00:14:01,471
In January of that year Hitler been appointed appointed Chancellor of Germany's government which is still under the control of the country

242
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,007
Paul Von Hindenburg

243
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:07,615
The structure of the government was at the president was the elected leader of the country who would then appoint

244
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,383
Chancellor

245
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,735
Who would be responsible for introducing legislation to members of the reichstag who are also

246
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,503
Elected

247
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,343
At any point the president could dismiss his Chancellor

248
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,623
You know that he was

249
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,439
He had control over that position

250
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,719
He thought well

251
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:29,887
According to the Smithsonian Magazine Hindenburg reluctantly appointed Hitler as Chancellor on the advice of Franz Von

252
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
Poppin

253
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,215
A disgruntled former chancellor who believe the

254
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,287
Conservative parties should Ally with the Nazis

255
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
To keep the Communists out of party

256
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,407
Man I heard something like that so frequently pass

257
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:46,527
Fear of Communism leads to aligning with ashes every time

258
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,087
The reality of the racetrack fire is that it was an event

259
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,415
I almost certainly committed by the Nazis which they blamed on communist

260
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,999
This allowed Hitler to use the event as a rallying cry against the Communists

261
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:00,351
Justification for why the government needed to assert dictatorship level powers to crush

262
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
The threat they pose

263
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,167
There's no other way to put this on this

264
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:09,311
Why what Alex is doing right now is attempting to be same political maneuvering that the Nazis engaged in 1933

265
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
Yes correct

266
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
Terrible event

267
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:14,175
The drove home the sobering reality to a large portion of the country

268
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,711
I'm a terrible event can be in

269
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
Incredibly useful

270
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,759
You can blame it on your enemies

271
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,807
This is why Alex is now

272
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,343
On-air fudging details

273
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,367
About the reichstag fire

274
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,159
And if you did it

275
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:28,511
It is wise to blame it on your enemies otherwise people will think it's your fault

276
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,559
True

277
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,375
That's certainly true of the present situation

278
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,423
You don't want people to think it's your fault though

279
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,519
So Alex really has a bad handle on history

280
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,103
I've heard him that mean like you know the fake quotes R1

281
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
Something

282
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,151
But like man

283
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,943
He's way out of line

284
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:54,111
2733

285
00:15:54,367 --> 00:16:00,511
Alex Jones

286
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,751
Narrowly won the presidency of Germany

287
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,079
Von Hindenburg was not

288
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,199
Powerful position in

289
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
Republic

290
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,551
This is crazy not true

291
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,599
Hitler had not wanted Alexa

292
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,879
Compare the presidency of Germany

293
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:33,535
He was Chancellor beginning in 1933 at which one of the maneuvering to seize more and more power for himself in the knots

294
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:38,143
Tea party who had a great showing in the reichstag elections in the 1932

295
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,911
Election

296
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,679
People like Nazis

297
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:46,079
Hindenburg died in 1934 at which point Hitler dissolved the office of the presidency and combined its powers without it

298
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:46,847
The chancellor

299
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,663
Essentially making himself both Chancellor and president

300
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:56,319
A1932 election Hindenburg it's soundly defeated Hitler but the Nazi party itself like I said have gained a large number of seats

301
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:01,439
The scenario that Alex's painting is 100-percent revisionist history because he needs his audience

302
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,975
To think that their living through a direct

303
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,511
Parallel to Hitler's rise

304
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,279
Power

305
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,815
Paul Von Hindenburg

306
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,375
Chancellor and there was not a contested election

307
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,655
For president to the way that Alex

308
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
Cuz describing

309
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:18,079
This is just an idiot making stuff up because his he knows his audience doesn't know any better and won't bother to look into it

310
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,359
Not care either way

311
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:23,711
This is one of the things that really like to drive home to anyone who may have some inclination

312
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,783
To take Alex Jones seriously or think he knows what he's talking about

313
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,855
If he has this little a grasp of basic facts

314
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,671
Acts like who was in what office when The reichstag happened

315
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,463
And he's so willing to

316
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:40,607
The confidently assert really fundamental and accuracies why would you ever give him the benefit of the doubt with more complicated

317
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,959
Ever if you can't be bothered to understand like really simple arithmetic

318
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,495
You shouldn't listen to him about like

319
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,567
Geometry or algebra trigonometry

320
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,847
He doesn't know how to add

321
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:56,479
No no absolutely not he doesn't have a basic grasp of the fundamentals of it

322
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,247
Existent

323
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,831
He doesn't know grammar don't let him tell you how to edit your paper

324
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,647
Whatever you like

325
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,671
You don't know if

326
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
If you don't know the building blocks

327
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,279
Upon which understanding can be built right

328
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,327
Your

329
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,191
I feel like one of the fundamental things that he doesn't get is that some things are

330
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,727
And some things are not

331
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:24,639
Everything seems to be fungible there but something's there was some things have to be yet something's have to not be

332
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,199
And the things they cannot just be whatever you want them

333
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:32,319
Great and if he wants me to take it all seriously the idea that he knows this secretive

334
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,087
Information that

335
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,975
Hitler was set up or all this nonsense that he throws around all the title is revisionist WWII history

336
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,279
And he doesn't know who was in what office staff

337
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,071
That's embarrassing man

338
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,351
You can't do this

339
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,143
You know what is

340
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,679
Blowing my mind

341
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,471
And it's just going to be soap

342
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,239
Painful

343
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,287
It's going to be so painful Dan if you recall

344
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,591
Do those early days

345
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,359
Open 2017

346
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,639
Whenever you would call it

347
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:57,919
A Nazi

348
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:03,551
And people would go you can't just throw that word around

349
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,879
That's a terrible thing to do it needs to be used correctly

350
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:10,207
And now we are about to begin a long stretch

351
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,511
I've literally everything Biden does

352
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,047
Not making him a Nazi

353
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,351
That will be screamed at us

354
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:22,751
From all corners of the world including the ones who screamed at us to not call compliment

355
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,055
Exclusively from those poor

356
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:30,687
Come from Alex one of the good things always fall back on his he knows

357
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,991
Literally nothing about WWII

358
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:38,623
One very smart

359
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,231
And was blamed on

360
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
Asianet

361
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,351
Lisa's not pretending it was

362
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,423
Yeah it's almost like he's

363
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,239
Trying real hard to thread the line where he's like

364
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775
The Nazis were the good guys

365
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:02,431
What does he say the election prior to the fire was in April 1932

366
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,199
Your prior to

367
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,503
To the fire 360

368
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:12,671
After the there was an election for reichstag members scheduled for six days after the fire but that's

369
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,463
The opposite of what Alex's describing

370
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:18,815
Alex either knows nothing about WWII history and is pretending he doesn't order

371
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:24,191
Or he doesn't know what the reality is and he's Willy fully lying to them in order to

372
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,775
Make it more closely match this scenario also to scare them you betcha

373
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:28,799
You really should see

374
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,591
Stop

375
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:37,759
Congratulations though Alex you have a real depth 100 books on WWII 1000

376
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:44,159
Books on behalf of

377
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:48,255
Alex's

378
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,327
Just slander sir slander

379
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,167
Interpretation and their things are like that are like

380
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:55,935
What

381
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,215
Was

382
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
Who was where

383
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,543
In what power alignment

384
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,615
Yeah that's what I'm saying it some things are

385
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,687
And some things are not it can't just say that that's had the

386
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:12,319
It it's embarrassing for Alex and he never has to pay any consequences

387
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,879
Like even in terms of embarrassment for like

388
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:18,464
Not knowing any of this s***

389
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,512
So sad

390
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,304
So Alex

391
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,096
Mentioned earlier that the FBI

392
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,120
Are called

393
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,168
We might learn a little bit more

394
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,264
Twilight Zone Twilight Zone

395
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,312
What in the world of Twilight Zone

396
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:40,480
Imagine what people in Twilight Zone Twilight Zone

397
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
The Twilight Zone

398
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,880
Regular challenge

399
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,416
You don't know Madman

400
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,464
Your people in the military

401
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,840
Cornerstone

402
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,376
What you know about what happened

403
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:08,640
I'm guessing that Ike first of all you write Twilight Zone in the Twilight Zone will be just normal life

404
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:12,736
Cancel each other out

405
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:19,136
How about anything that would be the version of the show they watch of the Twilights out consequences

406
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,512
Anyway Alex keeps talking about the FBI contacting him

407
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,304
I think I might know why that is

408
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:31,680
You remember that he said he had an employee who was there and got footage of the woman getting shot inside the capitol

409
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:36,032
Maybe an employee who was illegally entering the capitol

410
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:42,432
That sounds like something the FBI would look into his employees Sam released his raw footage of entering the Capitol building

411
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:46,272
I was going to play you the minutes where he actually walked through the doors of the building

412
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,320
Thereby committing a crime

413
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:53,952
If you can see any reason why law enforcement might be interested in talking to Alex

414
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,000
Enough

415
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,024
We're not going to take

416
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,608
We're not going to take all your food

417
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,704
People

418
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,264
Be clear that voice is the cameraman

419
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:08,800
Bedroom

420
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,432
All the capital

421
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
Here we go

422
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,736
Here we go

423
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,976
This is the first time

424
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,512
Steve

425
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,304
Dumbfounded

426
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,032
I don't know how I made it out of there

427
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,848
Butcher Boys

428
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:50,016
This is not this is not a peaceful protest

429
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,392
Want to be accurate about that but whatever that means

430
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,416
You heard

431
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,280
What does Guantanamera mean

432
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,824
Where we go

433
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,128
We are

434
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,432
Over there

435
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,088
Nickelodeon movies

436
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:27,904
Hi

437
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,488
Chewy.com

438
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,560
Infowars store

439
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,584
Dot-com

440
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,864
We got sales

441
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,912
We got sales for days

442
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,192
Please

443
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:43,776
It's because of your support they were able to get into things like this

444
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,592
I show you the real news that the media won't

445
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,896
Disabled

446
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,920
Tomorrow

447
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:53,760
You're going to skinny

448
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:59,904
We are

449
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,280
The plug

450
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,632
I just

451
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:16,032
I just said these people need to be babysat I don't even know if we need to start working today need to be punished or if they

452
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,824
They need to be babysat because

453
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,384
Literally have no ability to process

454
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,784
This reality

455
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,136
Force.com

456
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:40,096
I'm going to add back to my quickly growing collection of things that really don't look good in hindsight

457
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,168
This is

458
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:48,288
Import

459
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,312
You can't

460
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:55,968
Really we do like this I got to assume that you know there's a lot of people who have been arrested

461
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:02,880
For breaching the capital even people who are just recording people who didn't break anything at your illegal entry that is

462
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:06,208
True I don't see why Sam be arrested

463
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,232
So

464
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,000
You can't arrest him

465
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,536
He works for Infowars

466
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,352
The FBI's afraid

467
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:15,168
Pissing off

468
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,704
Should Sam be arrests

469
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,032
There might be some interesting questions about do you work it in fours

470
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,824
Why did you

471
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,872
Record going it licked it Alex

472
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:30,016
Send you there on an assignment

473
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:36,672
That Infowars continues Capital that little clip of video

474
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:44,352
Keep that he was there in an official capacity would suggest that as part of his duties

475
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:48,192
While promoting infowarsstore.com he committed a crime

476
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:55,872
That might be something that people would want to talk to Alex about I don't know through the Looking Glass here Dad were in the Twilight Zone

477
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,640
Ensure

478
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,664
Everything's normal

479
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,528
Anyway Rogers wife

480
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,552
Going through some things

481
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,112
This is the real world you cannot

482
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,256
Amman

483
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,304
Ran over his wife

484
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,496
The Rodger now is going into hiding

485
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,800
This is a joke

486
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,384
Why does my hospital had emergency surgery

487
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,920
Because a man

488
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,200
His wife up

489
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:40,416
Condo area Nobody's around random

490
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:45,024
Walking the dog

491
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,608
If I were Rodger ibp

492
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,448
It's about that would be really not happy about Alex's Behavior

493
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:57,312
Don't f****** embellished stories about my wife in order to make people scared of the left

494
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,592
Cheesy dick

495
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,616
I know that's the job

496
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,640
Yeah yeah

497
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:04,736
Come on that I hope someone

498
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:05,760
Scream cut

499
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,296
His dick off at Rodger Stone

500
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,320
But I'm not not

501
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:13,952
So if I were a dry be mad about that also not be thrilled about this

502
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:16,768
Beating up

503
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,560
Seventy-five-year-old whatever she has

504
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,632
How old is wifey

505
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,168
Oh my God

506
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:28,800
Beautiful women

507
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:29,824
Wow

508
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
What are we doing

509
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:34,176
What do we do we got to do that we don't

510
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,224
To do these things Alex

511
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,504
We don't have to

512
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,272
To say

513
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,808
His daughters hot we don't

514
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,600
Well I mean it's it's

515
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:45,952
An interesting why he was trying to recover from saying that Roger's wife was hot

516
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:50,048
Is child instead

517
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,072
That'll make it better

518
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:56,192
What a good save everybody who's why isn't everybody reaching up for i5

519
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:00,032
5 going on where's everybody else is I-5

520
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:03,360

Backfire

522
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,664
And I

523
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,456
I was so glad that this paid off

524
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,296
Cuz I was worried that that stuff that he was printing out wasn't going to be

525
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,832
The opposite of check-offs

526
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:17,952
Printer print out

527
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,256
This is 2.0

528
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,632

00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,672

546
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,104
The German word for the fire

547
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,664
Confused Alex Wiley was cold reading Theory

548
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,944
Is it pathetic

549
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:17,600
Hey white more revisionist history about Hitler coming up

550
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:22,720
You you assume a legitimacy that somebody essentially from the internet doesn't

551
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,792
Pickle papers suggest

552
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,096
We at least did the work

553
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,144
And then you find out they

554
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,680
Just printed out the internet and that

555
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,704
That's 10 times

556
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,240
Is less interesting

557
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,592
The newsman of days of your might have

558
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:42,176
Desk papers looking at

559
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:42,944
You know

560
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,760
I don't know I might maybe I've only seen this in sitcoms

561
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:50,880
But like somebody comes running in with a piece of paper

562
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:57,280
Transcriptions because you couldn't even do s*** like that you have to read it out loud like a man

563
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:03,424
I think I was just trying to emulate that to give himself some kind of like the appearance of that and it's just Wikipedia articles

564
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,728
Here's more ride b*******

565
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,776
Hitler first only got two left

566
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:12,128
Wasn't enough and then it was

567
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,992
Weimar Republic

568
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,464
Hitler was not elected president prior to the rice Chex oir

569
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,744
Chancellor by Hindenburg

570
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,560
The title fewer didn't really even exist.

571
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:36,704
Set the timer to guess you was a few or the Nazi party but it wouldn't come into being like a state role until after Hindenburg

572
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,800
Has a president of Chancellor into a new title

573
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:44,128
Fuel her and rice Chancellor which eventually got shortened to fuhrer

574
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,432
And then they got shortened to Senate majority

575
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:53,600
I hate to sound like a broken record here but Alex is making s*** up about Nazi history for his own benefit here and then pretending with the nerve

576
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,880
Berg trials back him up

577
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:59,232
The thing that I think is most transparent respect

578
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,280
Alex

579
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,072
Damn well in that moment

580
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,608
He's making this up

581
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,656
Yeah he knows he's making this up

582
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:13,056
That's why you say teaching to something like the Nuremberg trials which is absolutely useless as a rat

583
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:19,200
The beach part of the tribe how many months-long years-long

584
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:25,600
Exactly came out in those trials even

585
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:31,488
Pull the thread to determine how reliable a source is being solid to go other than

586
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,280
Thousands of pages of testimony

587
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:37,376
And you're not even really sure what you're looking for to approve Alex right or wrong

588
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,680
That's a big part of Alex's game

589
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,984
One of his favorite things to do is make absurd

590
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,848
Completely false claims and insist that some impossibly long text actually proved him right

591
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,712
He's never read those texts but it doesn't matter cuz he knows that his audience hasn't been won't either

592
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:55,552
That's why he'll constantly just point it thousand plus page books like

593
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,368
Tragedy and hope or ecoscience

594
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:00,416
He just insisted those things

595
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,464
Actually proved him right that's all in there

596
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:09,120
It's a way of trying to Railroad criticism and make it impossible for anyone to actually engage with the things that are being said unless they

597
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,400
Read these really long book

598
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,192
Pretending to have Ray

599
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,752
I would dig through the Nuremberg document

600
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,800
Disprove what hour to say

601
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:20,640
He gives up his right to be taken seriously when you completely fabricated history like this

602
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,456
But I couldn't help it so I did to grab a little

603
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:29,088
Distance from page 110 of volume to the trial of major war criminals

604
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,208
This is spoken by Justice Robert Jackson the chief us prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials

605
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:41,632
The burning of the symbol of three parliamentary government was so providential for the Nazis that it was believed they saved the fire them sell

606
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,752
Certainly when we contemplate their known crimes we cannot believe they would shrink from Mere arson

607
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:50,336
It's not necessary however to resolve the controversy as to who set

608
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,104
The fire

609
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,968
So I guess if I were to sing that came out in the Nuremberg trials of the Nazis themselves at the fire that

610
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:58,784
Chief us prosecutor doesn't seem to even making that indictment

611
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,320
In the Nuremberg trials

612
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,088
And in fact

613
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:04,416
Though it's generally accepted consensus that the Nazis did

614
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,696
Probably start the fire

615
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,512
Come by even today

616
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:14,144
Even the US Holocaust Memorial Museum says quote the origins of the fire are still unclear

617
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:15,936
I mean

618
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,312
I think the prosecutor really makes a good point which is just like

619
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:28,224
Just Amy you take it off at it it doesn't matter anytime

620
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,040
It doesn't even matter

621
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:31,808
He did was

622
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:34,112
Horrible enough fire is not

623
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:39,232
Anytime anytime somebody is engaging in WWII revisionism where they're like

624
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,816
Changing a little bit of the of the story away from

625
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:45,120
Nazi Genocide

626
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:49,728
Is it to me like that sign that you're eventually going to try and get me to think that

627
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,032
Even if there was a problem with Hitler

628
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,336
It wasn't the genocide or the fascism Park

629
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,616
I see you coming sir

630
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,432
They're Alex's Alex's really f*****

631
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,712
Weird on this thing

632
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,016
This really struck me as like

633
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,320
This is unnecessary

634
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,600
It really is

635
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,136
Disposing of a

636
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,160
Either

637
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,464
Complete and total ignorance

638
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,000
History on Alex

639
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:12,768
Does Park

640
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:13,536
Or

641
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:16,608
A willingness to lie to his audience

642
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,960
In any way to make history look like what he wants

643
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,728
What's the present

644
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:26,080
Look like to them in order to convince them of a lie about the present

645
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,384
Either those are pretty bad looks

646
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:32,480
Yeah I mean what's that old saying he who lies about the past

647
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,504
Controls the present

648
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,784
And then becomes

649
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,808
Senate majority

650
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,600
So

651
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,624
We get

652
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,392
I guess

653
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,672
At this point on 40

654
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,720
Is Guyton bush

655
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,000
Haha

656
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,304
He's the Batman Batman

657
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,936
Cast on the show much

658
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,472
In the in the reason

659
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,752
History Sol

660
00:35:55,008 --> 00:36:01,152
People who just discovered our Show recently probably won't know of our obsession with Jon rappoport

661
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:04,736
Follow us on Twitter for 400 episode

662
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:05,760
And then

663
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,088
Go to the knife

664
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:13,184
He is a guy who is a quote on quote

665
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,464
Investigative journalist

666
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,256
Ism hiv-2 nihilus

667
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,816
Is a real dick

668
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,096
Monetizing Alex

669
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:23,936
Alex has an intense emotional Reliance on him

670
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,496
Sometimes whenever John

671
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,824
The 4th hour Alex will do 5 minutes within where you

672
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:33,920
Just like Johnny Lee Africa

673
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:37,504
We love you so much John Rappaport tell me I'm a good man

674
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,808
I just needed to hear that have a good man

675
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,368
Through his interviews not really all that great

676
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,648
It's kind of just about how like

677
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,928
You know there

678
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:49,792
FIFA did not ship through the Rolodex of Infowars guessing we're like

679
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:54,400
I guess rapaport's the only one who hasn't been documented as saying we did it

680
00:36:54,656 --> 00:37:00,544
We took over the Capitol in a positive way there are there are a fair amount of like wow they're back

681
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,896
Like Mike Adams was bad last couple episodes

682
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,968
Rapoport's here showing up later we're going to get the

683
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,016
Steve Quayle is f****** back

684
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:16,416
Who here was against the cuckoo anybody raise their hands anybody Ole Boy Oh not a lot of faces okay

685
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,488
So here's a little taste

686
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:22,816
Who is this guy

687
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,584
Standing next to him

688
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,864
Well he was arrested

689
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,192
All of this comes tumbling out

690
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,240
Sebastian Inlet go

691
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:35,360
He was released

692
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,176
You know

693
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,968
It's like Keystone

694
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,040
Alex is referencing John Sullivan

695
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,600
Then who's not by any stretch of the word

696
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:51,232
Initially Alex I've been saying that this dude has been arrested and let go and he's making us both

697
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:56,096
Since Ben Sullivan had been arrested but he wasn't really let go

698
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:01,984
You released from jail without bail but whenever Alex brings that up he fails to mention the conditions of his release

699
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,776
Concluded surrendering his passport

700
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:09,152
Having computer activity is monitored being not allowed to go on social media and being under house arrest

701
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:16,064
He's definitely still in huge trouble but the phrasing that he was released from jail is being misrepresented by people like Alex implies that

702
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,856
The charges have been dropped when that is not the case

703
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,672
Yeah the legal system is not really there

704
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,976
Interest in portraying a

705
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,000
Accurately out

706
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,280
Capital letters and stuff

707
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:31,168
Although I don't know all the details but Sullivan's not someone who left-wing activist seem to

708
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,752
Hey them

709
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:40,384
There's an article in The Intercept that's like the number of activists from the west coast to a raised concerns about him longbow

710
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,664
Before he went to DC

711
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,200
But anyway

712
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:48,320
Weirdly you know where I actually first saw John Sullivan for the first time

713
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,112
It was in the footage

714
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:55,232
From inside the capitol that was shot by the Infowars employee Named Sam interesting

715
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:59,328
Gear Sam talking to John Sullivan just after that woman got shot

716
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,120
Trying to get the footage

717
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,680
That John Sullivan headshot of the incident

718
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,784
Okay

719
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,344
Infowars.com

720
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,728
A couple of interesting things here

721
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,384
The first is obviously hope ghoulish it is that these two are so interested in talking about how good their footage is a woman being shot so soon after

722
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,176
So close to where the shooting happen

723
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:50,272
Voyeurism on display here that I think reflects poorly on them both

724
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:55,136
Yeah seems unaware of Infowars

725
00:39:55,648 --> 00:40:00,000
If you were really an antifa provocateur who's there to set up the Patriots to make them look bad

726
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,280
Strange city with sound

727
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:05,888
Completely unfamiliar with the name in 40 supposed to be the Patxi's in Fall Guys with this whole thing

728
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,288
Conversely if he really were left-wing activist seems unlikely that he would be unaware of Infowars in that circumstance to

729
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:18,688
Given that there are media organization that is proves that poses a very real than relevant threat to left-wing Act

730
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,456
It was community

731
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:26,112
I honestly don't know what to make of their exchange and I can't possibly imagine how difficult it would be to process information after seeing someone

732
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:28,672
Get shot so like not recognizing a name Cody

733
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,440
Sofia brainlab

734
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,720
I have no idea

735
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,488
But I do think

736
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,280
Pretty funny to look at the Dynamics here

737
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,816
On the 6th

738
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,864
When Alex was on his own show

739
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,144
He was touting this footage

740
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,704
Said he'd gotten from inside the capitol of the shooting

741
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:44,032
Footage was shot by Sam Lloyd

742
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:47,360
And John Sullivan was the other footage that Alexander

743
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:50,432
Booty I was not turned out to be an auntie for agent

744
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:54,784
I honestly wonder if Alex even realizes that the person that Sam got footage

745
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,368
Trump to send to Alex was John Sullivan

746
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:02,976
I bet Alex doesn't even realize

747
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,536
Another Gaston

748
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:10,400
Online right-wing talk show host

749
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,168
The show before

750
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,240
You might have been I'm not sure if Pete Santilli

751
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,544
The same tailor lace

752
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,080
I couldn't help it

753
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,896
I don't like this guy but I also am not interested

754
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,200
January 20th

755
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,272
Commander-in-chief hasn't called us to a peaceful

756
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,040
Protest

757
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:29,600
Auto Washington DC he just said wherever your

758
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,720
I believe that there are setting the stage the FBI said

759
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:35,744
Forewarned

760
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:36,768
Replace

761
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,072
There were going to be some agitators coming in

762
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:40,864
Because

763
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,656
For the FBI

764
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,216
Let

765
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,008
Polices.

766
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,336
Operative

767
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,104
In the window

768
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,384
Obviously

769
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,663
The emotion involved in just

770
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:56,479
Years ago

771
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:59,039
2018 from 2015

772
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,087
Headline Infowars was Obama

773
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,879
Plan martial law in Maryland

774
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:03,903
How'd that go

775
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,023
Jimmy trigger

776
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,375
Is document still aren't real

777
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,423
There's still definitely just something that Harrison

778
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:18,751
Smith family was cruising around 4chan

779
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:21,567
X-rated besoros Sunday

780
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:28,223
Pizza in Philly the guys like a radio show host but he's only relevant at all because he was arrested at the malheur wildlife

781
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,015
Refuge occupation

782
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:36,159
The charges ultimately were dropped against him most likely because he was both occupying The Refuge and pretending to be a journalist

783
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,975
So didn't even want to f*** around and try and figure out how that

784
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:43,839
First Amendment needle gets threaded and I got there like

785
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,399
Jesus Christ either that's just too much

786
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,679
It's too much it's too much

787
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,959
He's a dumb dumb

788
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:51,263
And he's on just to try and help Alex

789
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,799
Convince people that

790
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,823
Said said

791
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,127
People up and going to like

792
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,151
Coming weekend

793
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,943
It's all going to be a mess

794
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:01,247
Who's going to be the agent provocateur deven

795
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,527
Mass shooting

796
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:03,295
Bombing

797
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,367
And now that we're here recording this on Tuesday

798
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,439
I think it's I think it's fascinating to me just because

799
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,975
In in Subway's

800
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,255
This is

801
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:15,839
Kind of the only way that these people would be able to try and

802
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,607
Keep their

803
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,143
People from committing

804
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,167
Mass acts of violence

805
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,471
Cuz I can't come out and say

806
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:22,239
We were lying

807
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,287
People be like

808
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:25,823
No you weren't

809
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:32,223
Or you're lying to us or it doesn't matter we still want overthrow the capitol but if you say that if you go

810
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,247
You're going to be

811
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:36,831
Torrid and then blames that's more likely to cut

812
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,855
Through the

813
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,927
It's like a it's like when you're talking to a child in pretend land

814
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,695
You have to talk to

815
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,743
To the pretend land child not the regular

816
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:46,559
Yeah because you just say

817
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:52,959
Something along the lines of like complete denunciation of violence

818
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:58,079
Is a certain amount of your audience who will think that you've sold out or something because that is how

819
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,871
Information is filtered

820
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,663
For a lot of these communities

821
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,991
Yeah you have to be like okay yeah you want to do this

822
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,807
You're right to want to do it

823
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:14,463
The Trap and you'll be a symbol that'll bring all your brethren down holy that is probably the only way you're right

824
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,279
Yeah it's it's

825
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,839
It doesn't really work for everyone

826
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,631
I don't know

827
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,911
This was pretty fun

828
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,215
Pete Santilli has one big message

829
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,519
And it's like yeah alright I believe

830
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,335
What I want

831
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,871
Do you understand right now

832
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,407
You're most

833
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:35,455
Trusted people that you have around you

834
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:38,015
Are going to be the ones that you will

835
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,063
You will be shocked

836
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,343
Actually working

837
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,367
For this app

838
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,927
There's trillions of dollars at stake

839
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,999
Your security person may be paid a hundred

840
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:48,767
Thousand dollars

841
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,047
Just set you up to

842
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,327
Information

843
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,607
In order for you to

844
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,375
Make a steak

845
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,655
Turn on recording

846
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,471
And essentially be used in an adult

847
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,055
Repeats messages nobody in the right-wing can be trusted

848
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:05,151
Listen everyone or everyone was solidarity

849
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:07,967
The moment that it is expedient for them to do is yes

850
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,575
You could afford

851
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:15,135
Did you guys ever hear about

852
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:18,975
Stalin's closest politburo friends and all that stuff

853
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:23,327
Did you ever notice how they backstab each other all the goddamn time will guess what that's what fast

854
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,143
Well I know that Stalin bird of the reichstag

855
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:28,703
Right after

856
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:31,263
We don't have time to figure it out dad

857
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:35,871
Makes a bit of an accusation here that I found two states

858
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,919
I believe and we're getting

859
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,967
Information now that there were maps that were put out

860
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,015
A guy named John Sullivan

861
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,063
B0m

862
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,343
FIFA

863
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,623
Activist

864
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:47,647
Just so how

865
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,415
Happened to be press

866
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:51,743
How she was able to determine that

867
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,279
Going through the Labyrinth

868
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:55,327
The hallways in the

869
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,351
Halls of Congress

870
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,375
How she was able to

871
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,911
One particular spot

872
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,191
Or Secret Service would be

873
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:03,519
I'm sure was provoked by John Sullivan

874
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,055
She's very emotional and

875
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,591
The window

876
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,615
She goes up

877
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,151
She gets shot

878
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:15,807
I got to say it feels kind of like defamation to just randomly imply that just because Sullivan was an ear Ashley when she got shot that's

879
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,343
Somehow he later there

880
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:23,999
If the standard for making that accusation is that low then it could easily be said that I was his cameraman Sam must have led her to where she got

881
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:30,399
HotShots Infuse right there too

882
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:35,519
Flag-burning friend Taylor Hansen was right there too so he must have been the one who lied her there

883
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:38,847
This is a very serious accusation that Pete is making based on nothing

884
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:43,199
The only reason he's doing it is so that he doesn't have to feel bad about being an active participant

885
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:43,967
In the media

886
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:47,295
Ecosystem that missing forms and radicalize people like Ashley

887
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,855
The point where she thought it was a good idea to storm the capital

888
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:53,439
He can't take that really hard look in the mirror so the best way to

889
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:59,839
But that also has to come up with a convenient story where someone else's bad guy who actually secretly mcenany

890
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,887
Add Aleve to this

891
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,959
Yeah at no point in time can that man just say

892
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:05,727
Wait

893
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,031
I think it was me and my ilk

894
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:08,799
Except let her

895
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:13,407
I can our Real World come out

896
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:19,807
I don't know if I have the reflection I have to change my behavior or recognize that I'm a villain while I

897
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:22,623
My profit off it

898
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,415
Good luck.

899
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:27,231
So Alex keep lying about Roger's wife

900
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:30,559
And we don't need to hear more of that cuz basically just the same thing over and over again

901
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,351
Videos of mother Gaston

902
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,631
Okay Isaac

903
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:36,447
This guest is listen to our show

904
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:40,031
It's as relevant from Rebel media and I really think

905
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,359
Tell me if you know why I think that

906
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,639
What happened

907
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,943
What's your view what's coming next

908
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,807
Look up we all noticed

909
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,087
You know the phrase

910
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,111
News

911
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,391
And you can battle Freight

912
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,927
Fake news on a daily basis

913
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,975
What happens when cat is

914
00:47:59,487 --> 00:47:59,999
Cement

915
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,535
When that cement hardens

916
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,815
And it becomes

917
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,607
Straight you can't even

918
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:06,655
Argue or dislodge

919
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:10,239
I'm not saying that I came up with that metaphor

920
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:13,055
It's something that I've used in this very specific context

921
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:16,639
Many times he uses it multiple times

922
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,175
In this interview

923
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,967
And I was just sitting here like you mother

924
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:24,319
Weaponize my own s*** against make that

925
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,111
Liquid sucks

926
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:29,439
Not very interesting as an interview we're going to jump

927
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,207
To the 5th

928
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,279
So 15th of Friday

929
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,815
He does listen to our shows

930
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,095
Can find out how little

931
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,887
F*** about it

932
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:41,471
Go cry to Tommy Robinson about Samantha

933
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:46,335
Anyway so we had some vaccine possibly related death

934
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,895
Norway and Alex's covering that story

935
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,735
Just on this little

936
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:56,575
Bissell.com

937
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,111
Which is Scott links to

938
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:02,207
Reuters

939
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:05,279
23 dead in Norway

940
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:08,095
They said that's okay it's going to kill something

941
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,655
I'll just normalizing the day

942
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:11,679
That's just

943
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:18,591
So this is an instance where the headline can look pretty scary but the actual story might not actually be as much of a cause for alarm

944
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,359
As It Seems

945
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:25,759
The first thing to be clear about is that these deaths that have happened in Norway are obviously being study

946
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:28,831
At the time of this episode there's not been any causal link

947
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:31,647
That's been made between the vaccine and these death

948
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,415
Switch

949
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:33,695
Mail.

950
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:36,767
If Alex would actually read some of the underlying

951
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:42,655
Information that the centaurs article is based on

952
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:47,007
From Stephen Evans professor of epidemiology

953
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:49,567
At the London School of hygiene and tropical medicine

954
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:56,223
Evans told the UK's science Media Centre that when people who are at high risk of death get back

955
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,759
Made it there will be a certain number of

956
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:58,783
Coincidental.

957
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,319
That's what occurred shortly after vax

958
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,087
Destination

959
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:05,439
Regulatory bodies across the world are closely monitoring these fatalities Ivan said

960
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,975
And are able to calculate the exact

961
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:09,535
Expected number of deaths within various time.

962
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:15,167
We do not yet know but it would seem that the observe numbers of deaths

963
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:17,215
Is not notably above the numbers

964
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,239
Expected he said

965
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,519
Adding that there was quote

966
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:22,847
No need for anxiety but complacency is equally mistaken

967
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:28,223
If we're vaccinating people who are going to die soon some of them are going to die soon

968
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,503
After we vaccinate

969
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:35,391
People who happen in high-risk categories may have a higher XP

970
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:39,231
Citation of coincidental.

971
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,767
To be taken into account

972
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:43,583
Also the possibilities brought up in these articles

973
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,887
Minor side effects

974
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,423
Possibly being much

975
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:52,287
More serious issues for people in Moore

976
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:53,823
Anyway

977
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,359
I think that if you look at

978
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,895
Get something like how this

979
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:57,663
Guide

980
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,967
Stephen Evans is explaining the situation

981
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:02,271
I think it sounds very responsible

982
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:04,063
Yeah because he has both

983
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,599
Both side sort of reflect

984
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,367
Kidero just like

985
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:12,255
There's reasons why this number would be there were people looking at it will understand this better

986
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:17,631
This is not a reason to be super worried but it's also not a reason to just be like whatever

987
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,423
You know I hate

988
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:22,495
I remember when I was when I was young

989
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,031
When I was little

990
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:25,567
They had kids Bibles

991
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:30,943
You know that were Illustrated and they simplified a lot of the stories and they left out all the rapes

992
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:31,967
And

993
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:38,623
I think that's what we need for like science news journalists we need to give them like the kitty version of

994
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,391
Real science

995
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,439
And they can disseminate that so people don't get

996
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,207
Get to scared

997
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:44,767
You know cuz they we can't be having people with her

998
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:45,535
Headlines like

999
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,327
Vaccine involved in two deaths

1000
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,351
B23

1001
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:53,727
Apologies

1002
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:56,287
True no it's not

1003
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:59,871
23 people died after getting the vaccine

1004
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:01,151
It's related or connected

1005
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:04,479
How many of the cases it is

1006
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:05,759
Is unclear

1007
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:11,391
B is the headline itself can be weaponized so easily by people

1008
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:13,439
With the wrong

1009
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:17,791
Information be good message messaging is is critical

1010
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:20,607
At this point with the medical information I think

1011
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:24,959
I would change that headline to tens of millions vaccinated without dying

1012
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:28,031
Unsurprisingly statistically relevant

1013
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:30,335
But unsurprising so far at this

1014
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:32,639
This point in time 23 like let's go back

1015
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,663
To the old track

1016
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:35,967
From the 60s

1017
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:39,295
Start writing R1 headlines

1018
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,319
Okay

1019
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:44,159
Another headline

1020
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,351
Suicide

1021
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:56,191
Drug overdose

1022
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,215
And more

1023
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,031
I can tell from

1024
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:03,359
The phrasing of the headline that Alex is reading there that it's a

1025
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,127
Post

1026
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,687
In an outlet called the Dhaka Tribune

1027
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:09,759
I didn't know that I'll accept up with you Bangladeshi media

1028
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:14,623
I guess one of those interns just has a Google alert for lockdown studies and they're going to hit the filter

1029
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:21,279
This is an article published on January 11th about a paper put out by a Canadian doctor of Pediatrics named Ari joffe

1030
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:26,911
The paper is called covid-19 rethinking the lockdown groupthink and it's not been published by anyone

1031
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,191
Nor is it. View

1032
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:30,495
Odd also it was written last October

1033
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:37,151
I was absolutely didn't read this paper what does interns just sent to the headline from an outlet in Bangladesh covering the Canadian paper

1034
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,687
For the no one cared about 3 months

1035
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:41,503
This is trash at work

1036
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:44,575
Now

1037
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,623
Alex gets to a point where

1038
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,391
You kind of think

1039
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,207
Maybe we got to move on

1040
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:52,767
Maybe gotta move on from Trump

1041
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:56,095
I think he's starting to have those those feelings of like

1042
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,375
We must move forward

1043
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,167
I could Snap My Fingers

1044
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,215
Come out against Trump

1045
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,335
Tails because it's private

1046
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,615
Things are done

1047
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:09,151
Message works

1048
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,199
Illegali

1049
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,503
The minions

1050
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:18,367
What's the Second Amendment betray America

1051
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:22,207
Make it so easy just come out just a little bit

1052
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,279
Red flag laws or or

1053
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,047
Come out

1054
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:31,167
We radical Islam alone

1055
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,079
Jones you come back here

1056
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:39,871
Greg

1057
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,711
I never been your fault

1058
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,991
I don't want to be in your phone

1059
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:45,759
But that's

1060
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:48,063
Where are the sigils

1061
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:51,647
Truck settings for that

1062
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:55,231
Trump said that

1063
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,095
Talk about something

1064
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,423
Why he thought he did the right thing I'm so you can get

1065
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,799
Pizza Hut

1066
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:22,879
We failed to do the right thing when it came to

1067
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,183
And now he knows that

1068
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,023
We move on

1069
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,559
Now it's Joe Biden

1070
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,863
We will never accept

1071
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,655
Who's going to come after us

1072
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:38,495
Because he runs a globalist

1073
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,287
Find family

1074
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,311
Dropbox

1075
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,151
Rubicon

1076
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:51,807
Unbelievable

1077
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:58,207
This dude so mad about qanon

1078
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,487
Check is what we just started real

1079
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:05,887
There's also there's something interesting in paradoxical turn on Trump

1080
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:09,727
Only for him to then and his ramp I think we can move on to fight Joe Biden

1081
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:14,591
Turning on trumpet leaving that season of a show behind me

1082
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,127
If you're Alex you don't go

1083
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:16,895
Get to do this

1084
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:19,199
You don't get to whip your audience into an apocalyptic

1085
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:25,599
Fervor but a trump was appointed to be ruler by God and this election is a spiritual battle between Trump and godliness in the literal devil

1086
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:28,159
Then when it's time to move on you to say we move on

1087
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,207
The devil one

1088
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:31,999
He's a good dude I guess we talk

1089
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,535
Talked a little bit he's everywhere

1090
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,583
Alex promise the end of days

1091
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,351
And a f******

1092
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:38,399
King devil if I can got in and guess what

1093
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:41,215
It's probably just going to be a slightly disappointing government

1094
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:45,567
A bunch of money yelling about f****** b*******

1095
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:49,919
Also I want to point out this thing that Alex has been doing a lot lately that I find really offensive

1096
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:53,759
He keeps talking about how he could join the globalist so easy

1097
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:56,063
They want him on their side and any minute he

1098
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,343
Be one of the elites

1099
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:59,647
This is meant to be heard by the audience

1100
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:02,975
Like an abusive spouse yelling about how they could do so much better

1101
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:07,071
The message is really clear that Alex could join the globalist whenever he wants

1102
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,095
Because he's special

1103
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:11,935
But no one listening has the same offer extended to them because they are not spare

1104
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:18,847
And you should be glad that I'm not joining these globalist choose to shine my light on

1105
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,639
You a******.

1106
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:21,919
It's it's

1107
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:22,687
Stark

1108
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:26,527
Yeah it's a really narcissistic and and gross

1109
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:30,367
I don't enjoy it I would prefer he didn't do that or exist

1110
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:32,415
Well I mean like if you didn't exist

1111
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:35,487
I know there's at least two people in the world

1112
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,767
Who

1113
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,071
Woods

1114
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,095
Miss him

1115
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:44,959
I got the wrong clip here thinking real hard

1116
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,239
I got the wrong clip-on okay

1117
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:49,567
Later Alex says the two famous people told

1118
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:55,967
I'm something this is a clip where two people tell him about one single famous person

1119
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:57,503
Rewind

1120
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:02,111
Didn't hear that part there's one person

1121
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:07,231
Does Woodbury

1122
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,279
Who did I say

1123
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:13,887
Christopher Walken

1124
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:18,239
But the video where he's admitting it all

1125
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:21,055
Houston employees like a man with a gun to his head

1126
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,103
Blackmail

1127
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,295
Weird

1128
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,415
The Jack Dorsey

1129
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,487
Jones is always right

1130
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:44,863
Famous Hollywood producer

1131
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,447
Music producer

1132
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:53,567
It's like their Guru and then he's like Berry Gordy all the time

1133
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,663
And this is like a while back and I'm like okay alright

1134
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:00,991
You can't make up the weirdest level

1135
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:04,831
This is right before Phil Spector died right

1136
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:17,119
I love me some famous music producer

1137
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,727
Yeah man I don't know

1138
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,567
Let's imagine this is

1139
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:26,591
True

1140
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,663
You got something better to do with your time

1141
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,199
No he does it

1142
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:37,599
He looks at me like I'm

1143
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,367
Guru

1144
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:40,927
I'm really really done with anybody

1145
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:42,719
Treating a rich person like there

1146
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:43,743
Real like

1147
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:46,303
What's going on with Jack Dorsey

1148
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,583
What's going on

1149
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,119
Money

1150
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:53,727
I don't even care about Jack Dorsey I want to talk about Alex Jones being his Guru

1151
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:59,615
Alright well then that still makes sense money is the only thing he cares about I mean

1152
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:05,247
I must have felt terrible to kick your Guru off of your own platform

1153
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,783
Multiple times

1154
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,063
Absolutely

1155
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:11,647
I believe David Knight on

1156
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,975
David night is my night light

1157
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:21,375
I just think about this like you get kicked out of a bar and they're like later you like the bouncer tyminski

1158
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:22,399
Gyro

1159
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,423
And loves me

1160
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,447
Guy f******

1161
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,775
So I hope his heart

1162
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:28,799
Kick my ass out of there

1163
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:31,359
Alex didn't tell that story

1164
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,639
To be powerful

1165
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,199
I didn't tell you that

1166
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:41,599
Jack Dorsey Story 2 Channel power Fuller to Loma Portal Hollywood only part of the wash

1167
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:47,999
The power structure really is true that you cannot register or fathom

1168
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:50,303
Popular Infowars really is now

1169
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,351
That was all God's plan

1170
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,679
All of us together

1171
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:01,311
Almost all these liberal talk show host attack me

1172
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,335
They actually listen

1173
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:06,175
Mike cernovich visiting year

1174
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:09,247
So don't you know they all love you and they all listen all the time and

1175
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,271
Don't you know all those

1176
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:11,039
Big people

1177
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,231
But I appreciate

1178
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:21,023
It is awful

1179
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,559
Don't believe anything Mike cernovich

1180
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,607
41

1181
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,887
7 / 2

1182
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:29,471
Man this is sad

1183
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,007
Is bad

1184
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:34,847
You know what the only people that I could really make a solid case

1185
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:37,919
I really dislike him but do listen to Mir

1186
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:39,711
That would be

1187
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:44,319
Alex

1188
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,087
Is

1189
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,879
Confusing man

1190
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,671
In many ways grade

1191
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:49,951
He has certain taste

1192
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:52,255
Disgusting once he has a

1193
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:54,815
The crush on somebody

1194
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,095
This really happen

1195
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:59,167
Remember about a year ago visiting my

1196
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:02,495
Whatever you're mine my wife's mother

1197

In San Diego

1198
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,079
And so

1199
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,359
Craft little

1200
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:10,943

Beautiful Hotel and golf course with a walk around the golf

Or stuff I'm rich your Nike

1204

Nobel prizes and it's been going on

1206
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:32,959

1207
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,287
View

1208
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,359
I said man I'll have a website or a podcast

1209
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,895

01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,711
Chemtrails and Country Club

1211
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:49,087
Beautiful country clubs beautiful pool beautiful statues

1212
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,111
Five star hotel

1213
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,647
I never stayed somewhere that nice

1214
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:00,351
Everyone

1215
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:03,679
Everyone so then

1216
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,983
I get about 5 a.m.

1217
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,335
That's it

1218
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,687
Fishpig Popstar

1219
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,039
She must be

1220
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:23,135
New album is called

1221
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:27,231
Chemtrails

1222
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,535
Over the country club

1223
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,631
Playa del Rey

1224
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,167
Alex continues

1225
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:40,799
Lana Del Rey

1226
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:44,383
It's about going to Lana Del Rey

1227
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:48,735
He is so into this Chemtrails over the country club

1228
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,807
Eddie can't even enjoy it you can't even enjoy it

1229
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,343
He loves it he loves

1230
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,647
And he can't publicly

1231
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:59,999
He has to spend a f****** 10-minute Jag on how famous he is

1232
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,535
Goddamn

1233
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:07,935
People can't even come out and say he loves Lana Del Rey Alex I would like for you to challenge yourself

1234
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:13,823
Explain to me how much you love the song Born to Die

1235
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:21,247
Hey Alex what are you watching the national anthem video about that

1236
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:25,087
Samurai Dr from the Artists Den

1237
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:31,743
Are they are they just so great it's so great

1238
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,023
Like the last two albums

1239
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:37,375
Just decided I f****** love like

1240
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:40,703
You don't need you don't bring It Up all In For This americana's

1241
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:41,471
I guess maybe

1242
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,495
Another Tuesday 10

1243
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,775
The cop or something

1244
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:46,335
I don't know I don't know exactly what it is but it is

1245
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:52,223
Really weird that what we should be doing should we should the antifa focus more on

1246
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:55,551
Biplanes and crop-dusting mind control

1247
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:58,111
Over Resort town

1248
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,135
I don't know

1249
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:02,975
I think that's a good idea I listen to this this Chemtrails over the country

1250
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:03,999
Country Club song

1251
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:07,583
And I don't know I still like Lana Del Rey I'm not but

1252
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,119
I think I might be a little bored

1253
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:13,471
Good songs on Norman f****** Rockwell but like

1254
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:16,799
As a whole I thought that song was really

1255
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:21,407
Kind of just standard Lana Del Rey stuff

1256
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,175
Intrigued meme

1257
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:24,479
Got it kind of felt a little bit

1258
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:27,039
A little safe a little down the middle

1259
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:28,063
Is this

1260
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,855
Alphabetically

1261
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:32,415
The sequel to Bombs Over Baghdad

1262
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,207
Yes

1263
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:40,607
Moving on Alex interviews Larry Pinkney

1264
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:43,423
It was a black panther back in the day

1265
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:45,471
And today

1266
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:51,871

1267
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:55,199
Alex get back to talking about Rodgers wife

And she knew the Rodger

1277
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:16,191

Talk to him for more than an hour you have to sign a waiver that says he's allowed to say about your time to

1293
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:05,087
You're probably you probably right

1294

What's that talk about

1307
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:43,231
We're not talkin about centers within the NBA

01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:49,631

1310
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,423
Alex

1311
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:55,007
In the past we listen to episodes from like the 2009

1312
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,799
Sierra around them

1313
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:00,895

How do I keep nose stuff ahead man

1315
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:05,759
He's just really right about stuff

1316
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,039
That was asked him how he

1317
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:07,807
Pino's

1318
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:10,367
The stuff that he knows I'm interested in finding out

1319
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:13,439
I don't know if you could predict this and it's not a good answer

1320
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:15,999
Simply this

1321
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:19,839
I went from the gutter most important

1322
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:22,655
I got was Wild on Montana State University

1323
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:26,751
Jesus

1324
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:29,055
And I accepted Jesus in my heart

1325
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:31,615
I was living in my mother's house

1326
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:32,895
And

1327
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,687
10 10 blocks from University

1328
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:37,503
And Jesus literally and I noticed going to play

1329
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:43,391
He gave me a panoramic history

1330
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:45,951
And told me he was calling me not understand

1331
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:46,975
I just found out

1332
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:48,767
What's the date

1333
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:51,583
Best spirit of God convicted my heart but here's the thing

1334
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,375
He gave me a panorama of his

1335
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:56,703
The future was just imagine

1336
01:08:59,007 --> 01:08:59,775
Pizza Steve

1337
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,567
Going to

1338
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:02,847
The things from you

1339
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,383
Until there shortly

1340
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,663
To come to pass

1341
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,967
He told me he said I want you to prepare

1342
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:08,991
Are My People

1343
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:10,015
The End of the Age

1344
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:14,367
I'll bring people to tell you what you need to know but you must be

1345
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:15,391
Good morning

1346
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:19,487
Oh boy

1347
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,791
You are such a good medium

1348
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:23,327
You do not need to do

1349
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,095
Do voices

1350
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:29,727
The reason that you don't know things is because I'm going to hide them from you until

1351
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:33,567
I have appeared to you Jesus from Beyond

1352
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:39,199
The grave why I'm not explaining things to you

1353
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,735
Also if

1354
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:42,271
You know the Lord came down

1355
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:44,575
Steve panoramic view of History

1356
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:46,367
Probably explain to Alex

1357
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:48,927
That Hitler was elected president before the right text

1358
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:55,327
You know Jesus did left out that part for some odd reason not everything's in the panorama

1359
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,863
Everything about history

1360
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:59,679
If you're seeing a panoramic view of History

1361
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:01,471
One that's a lot

1362
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:03,775
To take ensure how long was he there for

1363
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:06,591
I mean a day to God is 1000 years

1364
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:12,991
Totally I feel like if you are there at like if we had some scripture

1365
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:15,039
Remember neck if it's the name of a ribosome

1366
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:23,231
Oh the Places that you learned sure we see through a glass Darkly

1367
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:24,255
None of us have the full play

1368
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:26,815
Picture but the Riza has a clearer picture than the rest

1369
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:28,095
Let's drop

1370
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:28,863
So

1371
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,399
Steve

1372
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:31,935
Talk to God

1373
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:34,239
Who gave him a panoramic view of

1374
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,007
Of History

1375
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:37,311
I told him that he was going to leave

1376
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,591
God's people

1377
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:39,359
Or something

1378
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:40,895
Nylex had if

1379
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:41,663
Visitation

1380
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:45,503
You got a visit from Jesus I got a visit from the other guy

1381
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:48,319
Why'd you get a visit from Jesus I got a visit from the dead

1382
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:51,391
Because I was serving the devil

1383
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:52,415
Wholehearted

1384
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,207
And somebody somewhere

1385
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:56,255
For me because

1386
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,791
I was totally

1387
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:02,399
Why did I get a visit from the Devil

1388
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:03,423
I got the other

1389
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:07,007
The other guy

1390
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:11,615
Even Jesus was Tim

1391
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:14,431
Either one of us

1392
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:18,783
It's really important

1393
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:20,575
This is a spiritual war

1394
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:26,207
I don't know I feel I feel like everybody who's ever been interested now it's Jones

1395
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:27,487
Once again should have lead

1396
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:29,023
All their stories

1397
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:30,047
Alex Jones

1398
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:30,815
,

1399
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:33,631
Guy who believed the devil visited

1400
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:34,399
Yeah

1401
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:36,191
I I just have a heart

1402
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:39,775
I want to know the rules of this universe it's really getting annoying

1403
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:46,431
It's like whenever it's like when you're watching a superhero movie and then it the deus ex machina somebody already out all the sudden

1404
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:50,015
Has a new power Heroes

1405
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:53,855
Set up the rules for me exist within the rules of space

1406
01:11:54,111 --> 01:12:00,255
When they started to get to the blower that could give people powers and heroes is like no we can't do this anymore

1407
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:03,327
What's going on with that Eclipse we can't do this

1408
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,607
Stop at stop

1409
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:11,007
Nope you can't just everybody's claiming that they got visits from superpowers and she had no come on man I got busy

1410
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:17,407
The day by Hephaestus God

1411
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:22,527
Good person that you got visited by the devil and that I was a bad person that I got visited by Jesus

1412
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:26,623
It's like yin and yang but we don't believe in that boat

1413
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:27,647
Yeah

1414
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:36,351
That's the kind of conversation but stay complaints

1415
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:38,655
Boy this show is

1416
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,423
Dog

1417
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:47,103
Cowboy Steve's got a prediction that has nothing to do with Giants or visitations from Otherworld

1418
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:49,919
Like this state

1419
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,991
7 years ago

1420
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:55,295
Even if you don't

1421
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:03,487
Allows China and Russia to destroy the United States in a nuclear attack

1422
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:06,815
Bugs going to reveal the sins of the leaders to the people and

1423
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:08,863
And a People Sims before a holy God

1424
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,983
SOB's on a planet

1425
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:16,799
Those are sons of Belial

1426
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:20,127
As if we've seen it we're seeing the Deep state

1427
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,663
I guess get a bunker

1428
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:24,991
I prefer the Sequoia and Bilal

1429
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:27,551
I thank you very much I don't know I guess

1430
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:29,087
China and Russia going to Nuke us

1431
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:30,111
Yeah why

1432
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:33,183
I don't know they heavily invested in

1433
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:35,743
I think they want us to live

1434
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:38,047
Anyway

1435
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:38,815
Steve

1436
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:39,583
Is

1437
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:41,119
And insufferably

1438
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:41,887
Annoying

1439
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:45,727
Weirdo I love him 7 years

1440
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:47,519
He's at Visions if I wanted

1441
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:53,919
Just hear somebody talk about like being visited by God and how do you know Bilal is going to Nuke the

1442
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:55,199
The Earth or whatever the f***

1443
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,735
I could call my wife

1444
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:03,903
I won't listen to that same person tell me about antifa

1445
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:07,231
I'm just not playing that game

1446
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:08,767
At anyway we go on

1447
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,303
16th and that's Saturday

1448
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:16,703
Okay what Alex has an episode on Saturday must be an emergency emergency emergency episode I think

1449
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:18,239
Dogs that little bit of time to think

1450
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:21,055
We got a new reason that the six Pappa

1451
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:22,591
There will be another reason

1452
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:25,151
Don't come until actually Sunday

1453
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:29,503
But on Saturday Alex

1454
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:31,551
Pink

1455
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:34,367
Think he might not be feeling good about

1456
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,927
We all know the false flag

1457
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:39,231
When is the scoundrels

1458
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:40,511
Ace in the Hole

1459
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:41,791
Duration

1460
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:45,887
And now they played it

1461
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:47,423
What is a good cover

1462
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:51,775
Vernon sever their racist

1463
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,055
12 Wok

1464
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:55,615
I didn't do it

1465
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:02,271
And then Ashley pieczenik on

1466
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,039
A few days ago

1467
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:04,831
Chortling and

1468
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:06,623
Celebrating

1469
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:09,439
That's right

1470
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,487
But not in the way

1471
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:12,511
He said

1472
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:18,911
But see that's the thing about the globalist mindset

1473
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:21,215
As the terrain changes and they

1474
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:22,495
Flipside

1475
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:24,543
Gauging Machiavellian Behavior

1476
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:27,871
They think that's intelligent

1477
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:29,663
They think

1478
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:32,223
Cold-hard social-darwinist stick

1479
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:35,039
Where they carry it out

1480
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:40,671
Proof of their righteousness

1481
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,207
And it's not

1482
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:44,767
Stevens global

1483
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:48,095
II

1484
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:51,423
What's going on here in this world

1485
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,215
Play out as a it goes along

1486
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:57,055
He was traveling but not in the way he seemed

1487
01:15:57,567 --> 01:16:03,711
The way you seem to be chortling was that Trump had one and everything is totally fine

1488
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:13,439
It should be pointed out that our episode of mocking the s*** out of Steve's interview with him came out on Friday

1489
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:18,815
Friday so I don't know it's baby

1490
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:20,351
I don't know if that's what led to this

1491
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:22,143
Emergency episode of reflection

1492
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:24,191
Probably not

1493
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,823
You stalking about 1984

1494
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:34,175
Emmanuel Goldstein is a is a setup

1495
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:38,527
But other characters

1496
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:41,855
In 1984 and how

1497
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:42,879
How they interact

1498
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:45,183
Torture came in the courtroom

1499
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,231
They thought

1500
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,255
Friends

1501
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:49,791
Cuz I couldn't leave them in car

1502
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,863
Just like in 1984 O'Brien

1503
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,911
And it's all just a fictional account

1504
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:55,679
This

1505
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,471
Is

1506
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:02,079
But but he still thinks O'Brien's are good. He's like

1507
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:05,151
O'Brien they got you and Brian come to the jail cell

1508
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:06,687
O'Brien they got you

1509
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:10,527
I got you two years old they got me a long time ago Westin

1510
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:15,391
The differences with somebody like me

1511
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:17,183
I know pechenik shuttle Bryant

1512
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:20,255
I'm just observing him and watching him I'm not listed Smith

1513
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:22,047
Oh boy

1514
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,583
Subway

1515
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:25,887
Okay

1516
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:31,263
I'm not getting manipulated I am the master manipulator

1517
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:33,823
I am observing him as an excited

1518
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:39,199
Experiment

1519
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:42,015
Just say whatever bulshit that he wants to have

1520
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:47,903
But I was observing

1521
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:50,975
Closer dad

1522
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:56,863
Cool versus sad I am glad I'm not a narcissist

1523
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:59,423
Really you know what it would really f***

1524
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,959
Wake me up for a good day or two

1525
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:05,567
Need to create a mythology around it I be like

1526
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:07,103
I got had

1527
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:09,919
And I would learn from it and I would move on with my life

1528
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:16,319
And then I do and then you would bring up the Nigerian email scam before

1529
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,599
Happened before

1530
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:22,719
Alex is still talk about 1984 any cuts into talk anymore about this Emmanuel Goldstein

1531
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:23,487
Being character

1532
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,791
Here is Emmanuel Goldstein

1533
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,351
Goldstein is a

1534
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:30,399
Fictional character in George Orwell's

1535
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:31,679
Dean

1536
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:34,751
Dystopian novel 1984

1537
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:37,055
Is the principal Enemy of the State

1538
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,335
Go to the party of the

1539
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:39,615
Oceania

1540
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:46,271
So he's reading the Wikipedia page for Emmanuel Goldstein I'm not sure I was watching the video all right

1541
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:50,623
Reasonably pauses there when he says the 1949 novel

1542
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:57,023
Is because on the Wikipedia page it in accurately says the 1984 novel 1984

1543
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,303
Or they have the year wrong

1544
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:04,703
Correcting that she was

1545
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:08,031
Tristan his analysis of 1984

1546
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:09,055
Anyway

1547
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:12,639
He's he's he's bummed out cuz

1548
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:13,663
On the one hand

1549
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:15,455
They got false flag

1550
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:17,247
Are you pissed off

1551
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,527
Welcome

1552
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:21,087
He's experiencing.

1553
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:24,159
Biden's going to be

1554
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:25,439
It's

1555
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:28,255
It's tough times all around for the Patriots yeah sure

1556
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:30,303
And there's literally only one solution

1557
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:32,863

Run down the street

1569
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:59,487
Will the sign saying watch

1570
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:01,535
The productive solution is just

1571
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:03,327
Get me free publicity

1572
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:04,863
It's Dom

1573
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:05,887
Man

1574
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,167
Brutal

1575
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:09,983
Great

1576
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:11,519
Fern emerging

1577
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,543
Cynthia episode

1578
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:14,848
Alright so we're going to be told how we're going to die

1579
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:22,016
Okay omigod

1580
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:26,880
Mike Adams is so goddamn dramatic

1581
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:34,304
The owner of it's over for Humanity there will only be lone survivors is dramatic

1582
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:40,704
He's like a Junior High student this guy is going through some things

1583
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,240
Writing poetry all day

1584
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:48,640
Unbecoming of an adult the way it's Maudlin is over-the-top

1585
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:49,408
It's just

1586
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:55,808
Not cool it's like how you imagine Edgar Allan Poe in high school you're like Jesus that guy must have been exhausted

1587
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:57,344
Annoying probably

1588
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:01,952
Who's smaller head

1589
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:02,976
Soma

1590
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:09,376
Mike wants to explain why there's so many troops in DC now by argument would be that a bunch of people storm the capitol

1591
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:11,936
I don't understand

1592
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:12,704
Did

1593
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,728
Existing threats

1594
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,776
Sand you know continuing

1595
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:21,152
People saying they want to do it again men are universally nonviolent

1596
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,688
That's what I've heard from them

1597
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:25,248
Another explanation

1598
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:29,088
30,000 troops in Afghanistan

1599
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:30,112
3000 Throop

1600
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:31,136
American

1601
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:33,184
This is ten times

1602
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:36,768
The size of America

1603
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:38,048
Cannon to kill a fly

1604
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:39,584
Rights

1605
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,144
Nation of this is just for the inauguration

1606
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,192
Complete nonsense there's something else happening

1607
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:45,472
I've been sent photos

1608
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:47,520
The Patriot missile Banks being set up

1609
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:50,336
In other states in America

1610
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:53,152
I'll be no there there is legitimate concern

1611
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:54,944
About Chinese troops

1612
01:21:56,224 --> 01:22:02,368
Chinese troops in Mexico concerned about Chinese troops in Mecca

1613
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:05,184
Mexico does not sound like something I I believe

1614
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:09,280
I don't know why they would be in a massing of troops in Washington DC who is in the

1615
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,584
Border but

1616
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,400
I don't know

1617
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,168
Yeah that

1618
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:19,008
Argue also one of the reasons they're so many more troops

1619
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:24,640
You know how hard it is to get 30,000 troops to Afghanistan that's all

1620
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:31,040
Long way away

1621
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:36,416
Where does Alex and Mike's narratives shouldn't use that as the number

1622
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,488
Mike has

1623
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:40,768
I'm somebody

1624
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:42,816
Who sang the Trump is going to win

1625
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:45,120
Their CIA show

1626
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:48,960
I think he's talking about Steve

1627
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:51,776
I don't know though because he won't name names

1628
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,568
There are some

1629
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:54,592
Bad faith actors

1630
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:59,456
That even in the last 24 hours I was able to even laughing midterm

1631
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:06,112
A particular bad fact I don't want to mention any names but someone who had fooled a lot of people with online videos that were popular

1632
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:09,440
Saying that no you at Trump's going to be sworn in on the on the 20th

1633
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:14,048
That person is a CIA operative I've been able to acquire his

1634
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:15,584
Is the ID number

1635
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,120
Working at the CIA

1636
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:18,400
So that's it that's a no

1637
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:20,448
If you had evidence

1638
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:23,008
That somebody was running operations

1639
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,032
80

1640
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:25,312
Definitive proof they work

1641
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:26,336
For the CIA

1642
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:27,616
Like you would put that out

1643
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:30,688
You would have to put that out you'd have to think that like

1644
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,480
Super dangerous for me to have the

1645
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:38,624
Alex would say right you have to get it all out

1646
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,464
Yeah I mean it's not a sin Disturbed Mission Impossible if you are

1647
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:45,024
Jennifer aydin undercover operative

1648
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:52,448
The biggest things that will get you killed until you release that information

1649
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:55,264
Who is coming out with that information

1650
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:59,616
So I think this is about Steve

1651
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:01,408
Pennywise

1652
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,944
Some pretty serious things on the horizon

1653
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,248
I'm sure there's possible Chinese invasion

1654
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,040
I also another threat

1655
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:08,064
Consider

1656
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:09,856
I'm very very concerned

1657
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:11,136
That the Deep state

1658
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,928
Is going to set off a dirty bomb

1659
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,208
In the u.s. city

1660
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:16,256
Going to blame that on Patriots

1661
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:20,096
And that's why they're desperately knocking on doors looking for somebody to recruit

1662
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:21,888
Somebody who actually has a history

1663
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,984
Of appearing on videos and end podcast and so on talking about guns

1664
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:27,264
Or chop or what have you

1665
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,032
You

1666
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:29,056
Yeah

1667
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:29,824
Yep

1668
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:31,616
All of this stuff is you

1669
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:38,016
You realize this is you are you speaking to a threatening to dirty bomb made

1670
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:44,928
I am I am loving all of these I'm concerned about what they're going to say the Patriots

1671
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:46,976
Because part of me is like

1672
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:50,816
Do you guys think the Patriots are capable of building a dirty bomb

1673
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:57,472
Cuz that concern me I think they definitely are I know what that oath keeper guy was arrested a couple years back with a napalm

1674
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:04,640
Yeah I think I think what we're all really hearing from these people is oh my God I'm worried about what we created

1675
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:05,664
It might be out of

1676
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:09,504
Is an

1677
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:10,528
Controllable

1678
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:11,808
Completely out of

1679
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:14,368
Lime group that we thought would just be

1680
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,392
Fun

1681
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:17,184
Yeah unfortunately

1682
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:23,584
All of our fanfic about history didn't warn us about what Real History would have warned us about an uncontrolled

1683
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:27,168
I think it's kind of like me starting the year the seltzer

1684
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:33,824
I thought it would be good fun and I thought that you know we just have Seltzer's and I try them

1685
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,360
And it got out of hand

1686
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:37,152
You picked you went

1687
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:40,480
502 b and a year is too long

1688
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:44,320
It's an unwieldy amount of time it's an unwieldy amount of sell turmeric

1689
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:46,368
Commitment that had it for a long time

1690
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:52,000
. not saying it's over I created something that I thought

1691
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:54,816
And it was fun it was a lot of fun

1692
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:55,840
A lot of momentum

1693
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:57,120
For a while

1694
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:58,144
But it was uncontrollable

1695
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,192
Flagged a little bit and then it came back

1696
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:01,216
It's still back

1697
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:04,288
Controllable thing you can't just force

1698
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:05,824
Set me up for doesn't work

1699
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:09,664
But neither does democracy apparently

1700
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,200
Cuz Mike has to tell you

1701
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:14,528
Country is Father's day so dramatic

1702
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:20,416
The rule of law has collapse in this nation and whether you're arrested just depends on which side you're working for so

1703
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:21,696
If

1704
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:23,232
Patriots

1705
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:25,792
Are you going to be considered guilty no matter what you're doing

1706
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:32,192
If you're a radical leftist you can throw Molotov cocktails and set fire to Federal buildings and burn police cars and shine lasers at Federal

1707
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:35,776
Agents in your mythology

1708
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:38,080
Apples in 24 hours by a George soros-funded

1709
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:39,360
A district attorney

1710
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,384
In your local city

1711
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,944
We will now enter the era of complete

1712
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:43,968
Lawlessness

1713
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:44,992
There is no

1714
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:46,784
Controlling legal Authority

1715
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,088
That is legitimate in this nation

1716
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,648
Which means the constitutional republic Has Fallen

1717
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:53,184
Damn

1718
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,720
Wow that happened

1719
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:55,744
Yeah

1720
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,792
Big news

1721
01:26:58,048 --> 01:27:00,608
Huge if true

1722
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:06,496
I love all that is no legitimate legal Authority in America

1723
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:08,032
Game on right now

1724
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:10,336
All the things that would stop you from

1725
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:11,616
Doing things like storm

1726
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:13,152
The capital that would be

1727
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:17,248
And there's no legal

1728
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:23,136
I guess if you will Mica saying smoke them if you got them

1729
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:28,512
It reminds me so much of all those 2021 articles where it's like

1730
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:29,536
Cops

1731
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:32,608
Have been proven to hurt leftist set

1732
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:34,400
Three times the rate of

1733
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:35,680
White nationalist

1734
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:36,448
Seems like guys

1735
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,496
I'm glad that you have

1736
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:40,032
New hard data

1737
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:41,056
But come on

1738
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:42,592
This is America

1739
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:46,944
We didn't need a new Guardian article in 2021

1740
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:47,968
We had

1741
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:52,832
Guardian articles in 1914 saying the exact same set but it's good enough

1742
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:55,904
The more articles but you could have just put up like Apple

1743
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:56,672
Picture of the

1744
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:58,464
Flag been like see this is what we

1745
01:27:58,976 --> 01:27:59,488
Fair enough

1746
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:00,256
Now

1747
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:02,816
One thing you're not going to see an article about

1748
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:05,376
Is the evil eye

1749
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:08,448
I don't think

1750
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:09,472
That's true

1751
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:16,640
I want star documentary about this guy who actually had magical powers could hypnotize people with his

1752
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:22,272
Narrated by Vincent Price

1753
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:25,600
No it was this really rich guy great mustache

1754
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:26,880
Haha

1755
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:28,160
Mezmur

1756
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:34,560
I remember that in one of his employees was little guy who would watch films right and then review them

1757
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:36,096
Poorly

1758
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:39,936
The guy whose film reviewer night

1759
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:41,984
To the UN School

1760
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:45,312
Doctor Demento

1761
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:48,384
Please tell me that you know what I've done

1762
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:51,200
Was that

1763
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:57,600
The critic man I forgot about the evil eye

1764
01:28:57,856 --> 01:29:04,000
Oh s*** look into my Triton could do that

1765
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:09,120
That's what I would have

1766
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:12,192
Evil eye

1767
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:17,824
Is a real thing I don't want to have a George W bush moment with you where he said you know I think

1768
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,360
I looked at it

1769
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:23,200
Everybody knows it's the eyes are bloody nose

1770
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:24,480
It's a wonder the show

1771
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:26,784
I look at your eyes and I see a serious

1772
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:28,064
Intelligent

1773
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:31,136
Focused person that's really concern you look at my eyes

1774
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:32,672
EBay CC the same thing

1775
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:34,976
I look at the eyes and itching

1776
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:36,256
Increasingly worse

1777
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:38,560
At the grocery store or in public

1778
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:40,864
And I'm sick more agitated

1779
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,936
Crazy looking people that look like skitzofrenix or demon

1780
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:46,240
And what you put a photo of a composite

1781
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:48,032
Democrat leaders eyes

1782
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,592
And it's not like we're cherry pie

1783
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:51,872
Every

1784
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:53,664
Photo of them they look

1785
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:54,432
Like

1786
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:56,736
They are from another dimension

1787
01:29:57,248 --> 01:30:01,088
I mean I've I've met somebody people I've been in rooms with these people

1788
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,112
And

1789
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:03,136
What is it

1790
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:06,208
About the eyes what is going on

1791
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,488
Do you study

1792
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:11,072
Lely medical issues that the 5G

1793
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:12,352
The GMO all of it

1794
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:14,656
What is what is causing people

1795
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:15,680
Tow truck

1796
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:17,984
Looks like this in interact like this

1797
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:19,776
Medical Windows cases

1798
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:24,128
This is not a medical issues a spiritual issue they are demonically infested

1799
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,152
That's no joke

1800
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:27,968
Exaggeration that there are actual

1801
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:29,248
A demon

1802
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:31,040
Are demonic entities that are

1803
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:32,064
A possessive

1804
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,112
These people and then what happens is the body

1805
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:34,880
Play the physical body

1806
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:36,416
He begins to mirror the internal

1807
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:37,952
Dark Spirit structure

1808
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:44,608
This is the health Ranger if you don't understand what led to the situation on

1809
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:46,912
The six that you created and f******

1810
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:47,680
Can cause

1811
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:49,472
This is what you would say

1812
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:57,152
Your political enemies are literally demon-possessed and the constitutional republic Has Fallen

1813
01:30:57,408 --> 01:31:01,504
You are not fighting responsible rhetoric

1814
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,784
Bananas

1815
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:10,208
I just think it's funny that this guy runs a natural news like alternative medicine site me sitting here on are talking about how people

1816
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:12,512
Bullseye's can tell you what their Demons Inside

1817
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,048
That's another thing

1818
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:20,448
Lead every article about Mike Adams

1819
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:27,360
I need room to look at me I have a cross-eyed like what would you think about me

1820
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:28,640
Sorry is the sign of the deep

1821
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:30,432
I Was Born This Way

1822
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:31,200
With a demon

1823
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:33,248
Sorry

1824
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:38,624
These people are stupid

1825
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,952
Don't wait out starts talking about Steve and I would say that he describes

1826
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:44,768
Steve kind of like how you might describe a lunatic

1827
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:48,352
We'll talk about Steve pieczenik here I'm interviewing him for 19 years

1828
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,888
He is a Big Smoke

1829
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:51,936
He was involved in one of incredible stuff

1830
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:54,240
He did help write Tom Clancy's novels

1831
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:57,824
And he has a twisted syre laughs at you and says you know

1832
01:31:58,336 --> 01:31:58,848
We Co-op

1833
01:31:59,104 --> 01:32:01,920
You'd he's adoration you know does all that condescending stuff

1834
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:08,576
But he's a lot of good things you're supposed to 9/11 an inside job and

1835
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:09,344
Wow

1836
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:10,368
Alright

1837
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:16,256
Have you fired David Knight

1838
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:19,840
You dumb motherfuker

1839
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:24,192
Really has not

1840
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:25,984
Are really has not

1841
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:27,776
It's such a

1842
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:29,056
Great turnaround

1843
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:30,336
Time to go fast

1844
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:36,480
It's like a goddamn Twilight Zone

1845
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:39,040
If they were night wasn't so boring like this could be a

1846
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:39,808
Huge

1847
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:41,600
Boost his career

1848
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:45,696
Now his credibility would go off the charts if anyone were still list

1849
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:50,048
I did actually list

1850
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:52,608
Listen to a video of David Knight talking about Steve

1851
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:54,400
After

1852
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:55,936
I believe is after the 6

1853
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:57,216
And I was like

1854
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:58,752
Pac-Man Steven stuff

1855
01:32:59,264 --> 01:32:59,776
So boring

1856
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:00,800
Couldn't even get

1857
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:03,616
Eclipse from

1858
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:05,664
Fired him because of Steve

1859
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:08,992
Andy says Alex doesn't care about anything except

1860
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:09,760
Traffic

1861
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:11,552
William

1862
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:12,320
Damn

1863
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:15,648
Hamilton boring

1864
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:18,976
Thanks for speaking the obvious to power

1865
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:23,328
So Mike and Alex get to a wrestling with the idea that Steve made this fat

1866
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:24,352
About the election

1867
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:30,240
And like how if he's wrong it doesn't matter cuz any kid never come back on the show again

1868
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:32,544
1910s people discussing like

1869
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,824
Well if she is a

1870
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:39,200
Which then unfortunately we're going to have two burner but we don't know yet

1871
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:42,784
I notice about that he made a bet with you

1872
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:49,184
At and you were going to offer to employ him if he's right and who's going to offer to never come on your show again if he's wrong

1873
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:50,720
What was no downside

1874
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:52,512
For him to offer that because

1875
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:56,096
This is this if he's if he's playing us it's his final play

1876
01:33:56,352 --> 01:34:00,192
He will never want to come on your show again

1877
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,616
How many demands he come back on

1878
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:09,664
What he said does it come true

1879
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:16,576
Well you know fine this morning he can you can just say no and what you going to do you no go find them and put them on camera no no

1880
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:23,232
Why the final play Steve will be back in like a couple of months

1881
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:24,000
Of course

1882
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,792
Fernandez didn't happen

1883
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:27,840
Done this Rodeo too many times

1884
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:31,936
I guess this is a little more severe than other times though because I

1885
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:34,240
Alex's feelings are hurt

1886
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:38,848
Feelings in the past I just haven't heard him be like

1887
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:44,992
When using you man I know that was too good that was just too good a day clips

1888
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:46,784
Four stars for sure

1889
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:50,368
Not as busy though not as much as that's true

1890
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:55,488
Is it was worried about a dirty bomb worried about Chinese Invasion sure

1891
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:57,280
He also is worried about anyone going

1892
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:58,816
Protest

1893
01:34:59,072 --> 01:34:59,584
Do it alright

1894
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:01,376
Listening do not fear

1895
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:03,936
Participate in any of these Capitol protest

1896
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:05,472
Not that there really any

1897
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:07,520
Actually being organized by Patriot

1898
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:09,312
But don't participate in those

1899
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:12,640
Don't go to the capital this is all false flag operation to being set up

1900
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:13,920
What you can do

1901
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:15,456
Is legally and lawfully

1902
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:19,296
Prepare to defend your home your family and your local neighborhood or community

1903
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:21,856
Against the any kind of aggression that made

1904
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:23,136
That may happen if the left

1905
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:28,000
I believe they can carry out a a local Uprising and go door-to-door killing people like

1906
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:30,304
What happened in the cultural revolution in China

1907
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:33,120
And that's a very real possibility this guy is so dramatic

1908
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:35,680
This is this is painful to listen to

1909
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:39,264
Do these people not hear themselves like I know they don't care about what

1910
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:41,824
I know they don't care about the words that they say

1911
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:44,896
But I cannot imagine listening to somebody

1912
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:45,920
Who tells me

1913
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:48,992
That my political enemies are literal demons

1914
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:50,528
I'm breath

1915
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:51,552
Tells me

1916
01:35:51,808 --> 01:35:52,576
That I should

1917
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,344
Protest

1918
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:54,368
Don't

1919
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:55,904
Do anything

1920
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:57,696
Barricade your doors

1921
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:03,072
Don't do the protesting cuz at the Trap but you should be ready to kill people who were coming door-to-door

1922
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:06,400
Skill conservative something we are going to have a

1923
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:09,216
Dearth of Jehovah's Witnesses if they go to the South

1924
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:11,520
So no that wouldn't do it

1925
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:13,824
Alex is worried about

1926
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:16,128
Migration is worried about immigrants

1927
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:20,992
Camiguin can just changed immigration right now

1928
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:25,088
Interesting Theory by interesting I mean absurd

1929
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:26,624
Motivated by racism

1930
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:28,928
You look at Europe in the model they want here

1931
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,464
Everyhome a Saison

1932
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:31,744
How to take a African

1933
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,280
Or middle eastern migrant

1934
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:36,096
I did not respond your house at work for the UN

1935
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:37,632
So they can do whatever they want

1936
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:40,960
Further breakdown you're home I mean this is literally

1937
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:42,496
The Takeover civilization

1938
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:43,776
That's messed up

1939
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:49,408
Why you'd assume that any immigrant that you allow and agree to have in your home

1940
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:50,688
Out of the charity

1941
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:54,016
Hardwood baun spyware

1942
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:56,064
Cool you could just say

1943
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,600
Okay well first off

1944
01:36:58,624 --> 01:36:59,648
You could say no to

1945
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:01,696
Imagine

1946
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:02,464
Second

1947
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,768
If you do have somebody in your home

1948
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:12,704
Don't they know how insanely hostile you are towards

1949
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:18,848
Is unsafe or even the government was like okay we're going to put you in all of these

1950
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:19,872
But not

1951
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:20,640
This one

1952
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:21,920
Those people

1953
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:23,200
Are going to

1954
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:23,968
Kill you

1955
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:30,368
It doesn't it doesn't seem like it's in anyone's best interest so it's not paranoid

1956
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:32,928
Of white nationalist types like Alex and that

1957
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:33,696
That's that's all

1958
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:35,488
Either you want to buy though

1959
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:36,256
Yeah we can't

1960
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:38,048
Quarter soldiers in our homes

1961
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:40,608
God dammit you better mind

1962
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:42,144
Cuz that might come back natural

1963
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:44,960
I was just sort of going down this path

1964
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:47,264
Gets distracted by thinking about Steve again

1965
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:51,616
He doesn't like it cuz he was laughing at him

1966
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:53,664
Show will attract this together

1967
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:55,712
What could be the final

1968
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:57,248
Final shows me you heard my

1969
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:58,784
Like like you said

1970
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:00,832
This could be your last time coming on

1971
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:03,648
The quail said that but I thought it was funny

1972
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:05,440
About all y'all just don't worry

1973
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:08,512
But I won't be coming back on your she'll probably get haha

1974
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:09,792
Because

1975
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:12,096
Thurmond Eye Optical

1976
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:15,168
I don't think he's delusional

1977
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:17,984
And I think he knows something really really big

1978
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:19,520
It's coming up here

1979
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:21,312
And then he wants to just put the

1980
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:22,336
That last Lafayette

1981
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:24,128
By-the-way Jones

1982
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:26,688
Thanks for helping us get martial law to have the Kappa

1983
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:27,968
I think that

1984
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:29,504
Steve was laughing at Alex

1985
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,528
Spanky's also.

1986
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:35,136
The problem with the way that exclusive nobody offer someone like Allen

1987
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:36,672
Septra because

1988
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:38,464
He's built up Steve over the years

1989
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,488
Far too much

1990
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:45,376
To sort of penetrate the facade of like the fake version of him he's presented to the audience

1991
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:51,776
Which is really easy for someone like you or me

1992
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:53,824
Very smart delusional person knows

1993
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:58,432
Forrest Gump himself into every single

1994
01:38:58,688 --> 01:39:04,832
Reinforce his credibility over and over and over and over again

1995
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:05,856
And now

1996
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:07,392
It does look so good

1997
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:12,256
Yeah it's not like Steve is a pathological liar that is aware of his

1998
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:13,024
Pathology

1999
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:17,120
And he's laughing at you for buying anything that he says he might

2000
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:19,168
Nikolai araiza pathological liar

2001
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:22,752
Who is laughing at you for not believing his lies

2002
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:26,848
And you know what

2003
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:31,200
Steve wasn't like laughing it out when he said he wouldn't come back on his show

2004
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:32,736
He was being dismissive

2005
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:37,600
He was like Rob's I'm wrong I'm not coming here shortly but don't have me on my

2006
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:39,648
He was a certain confidence

2007
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:42,720
I think it's so funny how

2008
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:43,744
Much

2009
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,024
Alex condescended

2010
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:45,792
To the Q shop

2011
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:47,328
Who is a fan of his

2012
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:50,144
Who believes almost identical ship to

2013
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:50,912
Steve pieczenik

2014
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:52,704
And then how much you got his ass hoe

2015
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:54,496
Spicy Fortune

2016
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:55,776
Who is supposed to be his

2017
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:58,592
Like I'm making you shaman

2018
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:00,640
I'm going to prison maybe that's why

2019
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:05,504
These people just exist because they it's not possible for them to have good relationships

2020
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,808
People like they simply cannot do it

2021
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:09,600
What they believe is friendship

2022
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:15,488
Is exploitation and what they believe is love or affection

2023
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:17,280
Is actually a secret plot

2024
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:24,192
Let you know I'm calling Pete Santilli here you know everybody and the right-wing is

2025
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:26,496
You further right bitter taste tell you out

2026
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:27,264
Ain't that the truth

2027
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:28,288
Ain't that the

2028
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:29,568
The truth so

2029
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:31,104
At this point

2030
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:32,128
On this

2031
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:33,920
Emergency Saturday broadcast

2032
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:35,968
Alex gets into what I described is

2033
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:38,528
Incredibly familiar territory

2034
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:42,112
My goal I woke up about 3 a.m. this morning couldn't sleep

2035
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:44,160
I know you're so clear like 3 a.m.

2036
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:48,256
Literally got like three and I was really clear

2037
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:49,536
The backboard Shield

2038
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:50,304
The Met

2039
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:52,608
That's what I need to go on there tomorrow

2040
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:54,144
If my last show ever

2041
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:54,912
And say that

2042
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:56,448
Add to people and then I forgot to do that

2043
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:57,472
You just said that

2044
01:40:58,496 --> 01:40:59,008
EXO

2045
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,312
People download this to hard drive save it

2046
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:03,616
The show next week show literally

2047
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:07,456
Social Mike

2048
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:10,784
Speak to that behavior gone all at my messages if it's my wife she'll because

2049
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:12,576
This is the knowledge now

2050
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:15,136
Future they're going to win

2051
01:41:19,488 --> 01:41:20,512
This is so frustrating

2052
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:25,888
Yeah you know why because it was a running bit on our show cuz he kept

2053
01:41:26,144 --> 01:41:28,192
And then on November 24th

2054
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:29,728
He actually did it

2055
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:33,568
And it was sad it was a failure

2056
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:38,176
What you want to do it over

2057
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,992
But it's just so annoying

2058
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,040
Nothing nothing matters

2059
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:49,440
We did the payoff for this joke already you are you doing it again why are you hurting me this feels like it's personal

2060
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:53,024
That's the personal attack I'm not a good enough comedian

2061
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,816
To pull off doing this joke

2062
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:59,680
Again we already did the season we what we like

2063
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:00,448
Look

2064
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:02,240
I I had one joke

2065
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:03,776
Good I told for longer than

2066
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:07,872
3 years and even that was a little bit too long

2067
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:09,408
Was this is over

2068
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:12,992
We move on we write new material we got to go Alex

2069
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:14,272
You are a hack

2070
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:15,296
You know where

2071
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:16,832
It is attacking

2072
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:17,600
It's like

2073
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:18,368
Okay

2074
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,928
You're a writer for home

2075
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:22,208
Right I don't know why the

2076
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:24,000
This came into my head maybe it's cuz Tim Allen.

2077
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:25,024
Conservative

2078
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:29,632
Tim Allen is the star of the show so there's an episode that you do

2079
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:30,400
And like

2080
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:32,192
A season later

2081
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:35,776
He insist that you do the same story

2082
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:39,104
Pretends or seem to not be aware that you've done this story already

2083
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:45,504
And now you got to try and find a way to make this episode happen the second star and what

2084
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:47,040
Funny again

2085
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:50,368
This goddamn fake Last Broadcast

2086
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:52,416
I'm Fury arable

2087
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:54,208
That is terrible

2088
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:56,000
If it does work and is really funny

2089
01:42:56,512 --> 01:42:57,792
It might have them just taking it

2090
01:42:58,048 --> 01:43:01,376
Very seriously cuz he's very dramatic and dramatic man

2091
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:08,032
He said he's like it is such an honor to be here

2092
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:09,568
You fuc

2093
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:11,616
It's it's really silly all right

2094
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:14,688
This goes down

2095
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:16,224
Right when the fascist

2096
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,760
State that comes in

2097
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:20,064
Put us all into a bind

2098
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,088
That folds

2099
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:22,624
People like Alex

2100
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:23,904
People like Mike

2101
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:26,720
Any info Warriors will be needed to rebuild

2102
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:27,744
Society

2103
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,536
The evil

2104
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:32,352
Fascist regime will eventually

2105
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:33,376
Call

2106
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:36,192
It will fall under its own arrogance will fall under

2107
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:37,728
Its own mistakes

2108
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:40,288
Under its the weight of its own deception

2109
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:41,824
It will eventually fall

2110
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:45,408
As many evil regimes have fallen in the past you have we defeated

2111
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:47,712
The Third Reich

2112
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:49,504
The USSR

2113
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:50,528
Fell

2114
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:52,576
This

2115
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:53,600
American

2116
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:56,160
I tried to call American this globalist

2117
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:57,696
Coup against America

2118
01:43:57,952 --> 01:43:59,232
Will not last forever

2119
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:00,256
It will fall

2120
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:01,536
And when it does fall

2121
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,840
It's people like you and I

2122
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:05,376
And the listeners to the show

2123
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:07,680
It will be necessary to rebuild the neck

2124
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:08,448
Text Society

2125
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:09,984
In the

2126
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:11,008
The image

2127
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:13,568
Of Christian principles and values

2128
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:14,848
With added

2129
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:17,664
New freedoms that weren't in the original Bill of Rights

2130
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,944
Such as health freedom

2131
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:20,224
The right

2132
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,760
To always say no

2133
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:25,344
Two medical interventions to say no to vaccines to say

2134
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:26,880
That right

2135
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:28,416
Which was I

2136
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:33,024
I think dr. Benjamin Rush wasn't it who wanted to put that in the theater

2137
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:33,792
Initial

2138
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:37,120
Bill of Rights but it didn't make it in there we need that to be

2139
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:38,144
The third amendment

2140
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:38,912
For example

2141
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:41,216
The First Amendment freedom of speech

2142
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:44,544
And and religious expression Second Amendment 23rd Amendment

2143
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:46,080
Freedom Health freedom

2144
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:47,360
You always have the right to

2145
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:48,128
Control your own body

2146
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:50,176
The government can never Force anything upon you

2147
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:56,064
I mean this sincerely I don't know if Mike Adams knows there's already a third amendment only agree with you

2148
01:44:56,320 --> 01:45:00,416
100% believe you that means he might not know about the other one

2149
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:02,464
That's f******

2150
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:06,048
Scary I'll tell you the one that he definitely doesn't want to know about

2151
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:07,840
Anyone that involves

2152
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:10,656
Some of those later ones

2153
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:12,448
He's probably a little bit if you are

2154
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:14,752
That was weird

2155
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:19,360
I don't know what I mean like I understand the key dwells in a media space

2156
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:21,152
Basic really obsesses about the first

2157
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:24,736
I mean the Third

2158
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:31,136
Is pretty important to that's at quarter results reflect really remember

2159
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:37,536
Steve is the problem whenever people like him say stuff so insanely confident I have to be like

2160
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:38,304
I swear to you

2161
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:40,096
I know what this is

2162
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:42,144
Question for 1 second

2163
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:48,544
Can of like maybe I just mistook it maybe I could be wrong it could be the sixth amendment maybe I don't know.

2164
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:54,944
In this extreme right-wing world like there was a real long stretch of time during Obama's presidency were they were obsessed

2165
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:58,272
How about states rights

2166
01:45:58,528 --> 01:46:00,064
All that nonsense

2167
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,368
I'd so like I don't I don't understand

2168
01:46:04,672 --> 01:46:07,488
It would be so easy just to say we need another amendment

2169
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:14,400
The people who have spent so much time

2170
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:15,424
Slapping accounts

2171
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:16,192
Intuition

2172
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:19,264
Telling you to read it and putting it in their pocket

2173
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:20,544
Have never read it

2174
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:21,568
Yep

2175
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:22,592
I couldn't understand it at

2176
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:29,248
Also I think that Mike's imagine Health Freedom Amendment would guarantee access to reproductive Healthcare including abortion

2177
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:33,856
Guarantee the right to not have a kind I know that he's considering that

2178
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:37,184
It's like a thing where the government can't force you to have medical things done

2179
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:42,816
When you also want to make sure the government can't force you to not have any medical procedure you think is necessary done

2180
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:45,632
That seems like an important element of Health freedom

2181
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,424
These people are fundamentally stupid

2182
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:48,704
I just can't stand it

2183
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,752
I hate I hate this dramatic

2184
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:53,568
Some weirdo this guy is so weird

2185
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:56,128
Evil eyes exist I just

2186
01:46:58,688 --> 01:47:00,736
Isle of the Dead

2187
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:03,552
Just

2188
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:04,832
Junior High

2189
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:11,488
Guy going through puberty kind of like everything is so serious kind of delivery

2190
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:16,608
They're going to dirty bomb us yet it's an honor to be here with you Alex on your lap

2191
01:47:16,864 --> 01:47:19,168
After the fall of the American fascist

2192
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:22,496
Say people like you and me will be needed to rebuild Society

2193
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:29,408
Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous

2194
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:30,688
So

2195
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:34,016
Dial Alex is supposed to be doing his last

2196
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:35,552
Episode thing here

2197
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:38,112
Robert Barnes

2198
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:40,672
That would be the last episode

2199
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:42,720
Just talks b******* about you

2200
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:46,560
But

2201
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:47,584
He's talking about

2202
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,632
Okay so brought Barnes is laying out like what

2203
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:50,656
Qanon dead

2204
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:54,240
They targeted certain group

2205
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:56,032
If you listen to this

2206
01:47:56,288 --> 01:47:57,568
It sounds almost identical to

2207
01:47:57,824 --> 01:47:59,104
The Infowars business model

2208
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:00,384
They also

2209
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:01,152
Targeted

2210
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:01,920
Three groups

2211
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:03,200
In particular

2212
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:08,064
Qanon targeted first people that otherwise our crowdsourcing Grassroots

2213
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:09,088
Castigated Journal

2214
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:10,368
Second

2215
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,904
Are they targeted

2216
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:12,928
Soldiers at

2217
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:13,696
Ex-soldiers

2218
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:16,256
They targeted cops and ex-cop

2219
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:19,840
And people that also were religious

2220
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:25,472
Tell your people that are accustomed to believing in a source of authority independent oven separate from the state

2221
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:28,032
Incorporated references to religious rhetoric in

2222
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:29,568
Incorporated references to

2223
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:31,360
Bible verses Incorporated

2224
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:32,128
Princess dude

2225
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:35,968
God this is not Gnostic Roman cults.

2226
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,016
You're describing info

2227
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:40,064
That should be his last broadcast

2228
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,112
Because it's Barnes explaining what Alex

2229
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:44,928
Unreal or less unreal

2230
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:47,744
Complaining about the FBI

2231
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:52,352
If is what Shakespeare he would give that Soliloquy and then immediately Beast

2232
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:56,704
Esbi

2233
01:48:56,960 --> 01:49:00,032
And he's made a big deal about how they're like saying that

2234
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:01,568
He caused the uprising

2235
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:02,336
Are you playing

2236
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:04,640
The storming of the capitol

2237
01:49:04,896 --> 01:49:07,456
He comes clean a little bit about what they actually had questions

2238
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:10,528
Myself

2239
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:14,112
FBI contacted our security people want to bring them over to talk to him

2240
01:49:14,368 --> 01:49:16,416
Oh we don't care about Alex going to talk to you

2241
01:49:16,928 --> 01:49:19,488
Oh okay

2242
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:23,072
I don't worry about it we just got false reports that you guys were in the capital

2243
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:25,120
Just tell us you weren't the Caballero

2244
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:27,424
So show Sam was

2245
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:29,728
Aya your cameraman was

2246
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:32,544
He's doing a plug when he went in do you know how he know that

2247
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:36,896
Ateez being broadcast

2248
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:38,432
On your website

2249
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:41,248
I got it from bam. Video

2250
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,064
Also if I were the FBI to would be like

2251
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:46,112
Let's talk to your security people

2252
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:49,184
Not you you lying piece of s***

2253
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:50,208
I've seen your deposition

2254
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:52,256
Do not help

2255
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:56,608
So hire Larry klayman for this one though so it'll be great

2256
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:59,936
Alex talk to Barnes about how bad Q is for a while

2257
01:50:00,192 --> 01:50:00,704
And it's annoying

2258
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:03,264
And then he gets on his own

2259
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:04,288
Any

2260
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:05,568
Reeds

2261
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:07,104
A fake Cicero quote

2262
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:07,872
Okay

2263
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:09,152
And real

2264
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:10,176
Quote

2265
01:50:10,432 --> 01:50:11,712
His favorite quote

2266
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:13,248
The man in the arena

2267
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:16,320
The Teddy Roosevelt quote

2268
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:20,928
Dogma bystanders and the reviewers they mad or not

2269
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:24,256
The man in the arena he falters and that is okay Paul Wright

2270
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:27,072
Kind of s***

2271
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:28,096
So much

2272
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:31,424
I think it's the only thing that Gives Life Meaning anymore

2273
01:50:31,936 --> 01:50:32,448
Then

2274
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:34,496
He goes a little bit of

2275
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:39,360
We got Roosevelt

2276
01:50:39,616 --> 01:50:40,640
We got Cicero

2277
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:41,920
Oakshore

2278
01:50:42,432 --> 01:50:43,200
This

2279
01:50:43,968 --> 01:50:44,736
That a friend of mine City

2280
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:46,528
Text message this morning

2281
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:48,576
Subject forwarded from a friend

2282
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:52,160
A man named Tom Nicholson post on Facebook as account

2283
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:54,720
Sports car that you just bought

2284
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:58,560
Now I'm an approach to told him that the money used by the car

2285
01:50:59,072 --> 01:50:59,840
Go to bed

2286
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:01,888
Thousands of less fortunate people

2287
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:04,448
Industry of the

2288
01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:07,520
Stop the tractor

2289
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:08,544
Her dumbass

2290
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:11,872
Also built the desire for people to have nicer things

2291
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:15,200
But then to build the desire for better medicine a better technology a better future

2292
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:16,736
I'm sorry I'm not ready when he said

2293
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:19,552
The response the man made in

2294
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:20,832
Internet

2295
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:24,160

Corvette

2298
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:29,536
I wonder how many people

2299
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:32,608
Could have been fed for the money that sports car cost

2300
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:34,656
I replied I'm not sure

2301
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:38,496
A lot of families in Bowling Green Kentucky who built

2302
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:42,080
Prepare the people who made the tires that fit the people who

2303
01:51:42,336 --> 01:51:43,104
Are the components

2304
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:47,712
It said the people in the copper mine and mine the copper for the wires

2305
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:52,064
Alex is reading a chain email that your grandma would send you

2306
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:58,720
Yeah I believe this is the meme this is Valium meme that's like

2307
01:51:58,976 --> 01:52:03,072
Military man was in the professor's room in the professor was like

2308
01:52:03,328 --> 01:52:05,632
Military man stood up

2309
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:09,984
It was like I hate liberals and then

2310
01:52:10,496 --> 01:52:11,264
I was like

2311
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,288
I don't know

2312
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:16,128
I thought this was supposed to be your life broadcast you're reading a chain email what is going on

2313
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:20,224
You know I said I just made my last broadcast really good but I

2314
01:52:20,736 --> 01:52:24,832
It's just too heavy of a subject that was my last broadcast from here

2315
01:52:25,856 --> 01:52:28,416
I'm just too tired already but I'm going to write some notes tonight

2316
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:29,952
Tomorrow Sunday show

For 6 p.m. and give you my view on the world

2318
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:37,376
So Sunday I'll write a note

01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:38,400
To your dad it is

01:52:38,656 --> 01:52:39,168
Yes

01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:45,312
Saturday a.m.

2324
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:47,872
It just a remarkable way

2325
01:52:48,384 --> 01:52:50,688
Anybody who really thinks that Alex Jones is like

2326
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:52,736
Sincerely religious

2327
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:53,504
Enjoy

2328
01:52:54,272 --> 01:52:55,296
So I will end

2329
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:57,600
Transmission with the Lord's Prayer

2330
01:52:58,624 --> 01:53:02,976
Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven

2331
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:05,792
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts

2332
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:06,816
We forgive our debtors

2333
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,888
Temptation but Deliver Us from Evil

01:55:49,632 --> 01:55:51,168
To blame know what happened on The Clique

2400
01:55:52,192 --> 01:55:53,984

You know that.

2409
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:18,816
I look like I employed them

2410
01:56:19,072 --> 01:56:19,584
Actually

2411
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:20,608

Fight

2414
01:56:24,448 --> 01:56:26,240
As sure as hell we did about who they were

2415
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:29,824
They were telling the crowd they were probably but

2416
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:33,920
They were boogaloos

2417
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:38,528
No Boogaloo boys

2418
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:39,552
No

2419
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:40,320
Flaps

2420
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:44,672
Got to throw throw the Boogaloo boys overboard

2421
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:45,696
About man

2422
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:50,560
I really like how Alex said boogaloos

2423
01:56:50,816 --> 01:56:54,912
Really really hit it really did

2424
01:56:56,192 --> 01:56:57,984
So apparently this is how he's going

2425
01:56:58,240 --> 01:56:59,264
Going to get around

2426
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:01,824
The fact that there were a bunch of people who

2427
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:02,848
Where

2428
01:57:03,104 --> 01:57:04,384
Okay for sure man

2429
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:10,016
Yeah I assumed you were roads isn't on this Sunday broadcast

2430
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:13,344
Be making up a story about Stewart Rhodes wife

2431
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:17,952
Getting run over dog

2432
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:20,512
In hiding

2433
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:23,072
Anyway Alex has a new video

2434
01:57:23,328 --> 01:57:24,608
Of the Boogaloo boys

2435
01:57:24,864 --> 01:57:26,144
Sure

2436
01:57:26,912 --> 01:57:28,960
I got this is so funny

2437
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:29,728
Alex

2438
01:57:31,264 --> 01:57:33,824
He's so bad at this this whole thing

2439
01:57:34,848 --> 01:57:36,640
And it's just so incredible because

2440
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:39,456
Try to get this out on Pussycats out of here

2441
01:57:40,224 --> 01:57:41,760
Gateway pundit

2442
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:43,040
Mary Claire

2443
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:44,320
Wait what went on the water

2444
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:47,392
How much at the first big one

2445
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:48,160
She told you about

2446
01:57:49,952 --> 01:57:51,744
You can bet your bottom dollar you'll be seeing this one

2447
01:57:53,536 --> 01:57:54,560
The first one

2448
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:57,632
But

2449
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:59,168
Those are inside

2450
01:57:59,424 --> 01:58:00,448
Nightclub don't talk about flight

2451
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:01,472
Mommy as Rolf

2452
01:58:01,728 --> 01:58:02,240
Flight Club

2453
01:58:02,496 --> 01:58:03,008
Lafayette Club

2454
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:04,544
I sent him so he chose me

2455
01:58:05,312 --> 01:58:06,336
Why wait that's

2456
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:09,408
Exactly against the rules of Fight Club

2457
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:10,176
I just

2458
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:10,944
That's

2459
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:16,832
Alex Jones

2460
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:23,232
Then Tucker Carlson sent me this clip I'm going to leave it there you just said everything

2461
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:26,304
This clip was sent to you by Tucker Carlson

2462
01:58:27,072 --> 01:58:28,352
And if that's true

2463
01:58:28,608 --> 01:58:31,936
That tells us all we need to know about Tucker Carlson

2464
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:32,704
To get a comment

2465
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:36,288
From Tucker on that because I would imagine he would not

2466
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:37,312
Admit

2467
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:40,384
To sending information to Alex being a source

2468
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:42,432
On account of Fight Club

2469
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:49,088
Being ruled by still talk about Fight Club I would imagine that he would say no idea

2470
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:51,136
An hour to have to wrestle with wife

2471
01:58:51,392 --> 01:58:53,184
No one will be publicly associated with him

2472
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:55,232
But they'll have his employees on their shows

2473
01:58:55,488 --> 01:58:57,536
Anyway

2474
01:58:58,048 --> 01:58:58,560
At this point

2475
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:01,632
We've not decided that the Boogaloo boys

2476
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:05,472
Are going to be blamed for anybody who appears to be

2477
01:59:05,728 --> 01:59:08,288
Write a right-wing whatever

2478
01:59:08,544 --> 01:59:13,152
Feel-Rite wig and we got blue glue for people who are gone for people who are weird

2479
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:14,176
Even though

2480
01:59:14,688 --> 01:59:15,200
Sure

2481
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:18,016
So now that's settled

2482
01:59:18,272 --> 01:59:21,600
It's time to go back to familiar territory

2483
01:59:23,904 --> 01:59:30,048
Over 7000 strong migrant Caravan

2484
01:59:30,304 --> 01:59:36,192
And this will be hundreds of thousands if not Millions like it you're up at the UN plan as soon as they knew the body would let him in

2485
01:59:36,448 --> 01:59:38,240
They began the

2486
01:59:38,496 --> 01:59:40,032
Guatemala

2487
01:59:40,288 --> 01:59:40,800
Here it is

2488
01:59:41,056 --> 01:59:44,384
Migrant Caravan narratives are back

2489
01:59:47,712 --> 01:59:48,224
Just

2490
01:59:48,736 --> 01:59:49,504
It just do it

2491
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:51,040
Take 4 years off

2492
01:59:51,808 --> 01:59:55,648
End run reruns where you just edit inviting over Obama it

2493
01:59:55,904 --> 01:59:56,928
It's got to be the same thing

2494
01:59:57,184 --> 02:00:03,328
A lot of similarities how much time you can take off if you're just going to recycle the same show

2495
02:00:03,584 --> 02:00:05,120
Just run reruns

2496
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:07,424
I really hope that you have

2497
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:09,472
Drafts of all of your

2498
02:00:09,728 --> 02:00:13,312
Articles from the Obama days

2499
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:15,872
Yeah man my grits are

2500
02:00:16,128 --> 02:00:19,712
Coming to America showing their plan

2501
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:22,784
War doesn't look like it did in Vietnam War

2502
02:00:25,088 --> 02:00:26,112
This is Modern War

2503
02:00:26,368 --> 02:00:28,160
This is global agency

2504
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:32,000
Take your vaccines and roll over to die

2505
02:00:32,256 --> 02:00:36,608
Remember

2506
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:40,192
In the next two years

2507
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:42,496
I mean

2508
02:00:43,264 --> 02:00:44,800
Almost kind of feels like you

2509
02:00:45,824 --> 02:00:47,616
Say have a good answer be destroying the cap

2510
02:00:47,872 --> 02:00:50,688
Yeah yeah it does sound like we are at War

2511
02:00:50,944 --> 02:00:52,480
Yeah and the enemy is

2512
02:00:52,736 --> 02:00:55,040
Demons trying to bring it immigrants

2513
02:00:55,808 --> 02:01:01,696
That sounds some suspiciously like white nationalist talking really feels like that

2514
02:01:02,208 --> 02:01:03,232
Oh really

2515
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:04,768
Just part of the Great

2516
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:05,536
Replacement

2517
02:01:07,584 --> 02:01:08,608
Uses people as a weapon

2518
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:10,656
They turn their food off the trailer jobs off

2519
02:01:10,912 --> 02:01:12,448
You just think you're staying home for

2520
02:01:12,704 --> 02:01:13,472
If you monster

2521
02:01:13,728 --> 02:01:14,496
Vacation

2522
02:01:14,752 --> 02:01:16,544
No it's collapsing the Border

2523
02:01:17,824 --> 02:01:20,896
When you become poor the third world starves to death

2524
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:23,968
When the first world collapses the third world dies

2525
02:01:24,224 --> 02:01:25,248
How many

2526
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:27,040
Time did I drill that

2527
02:01:29,344 --> 02:01:29,856
And now in Europe

2528
02:01:31,392 --> 02:01:31,904
Everywhere

2529
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:32,672
Borders

2530
02:01:32,928 --> 02:01:33,696
Collapsing

2531
02:01:34,976 --> 02:01:35,488
Giant

2532
02:01:35,744 --> 02:01:38,048
World populations that don't have jobs

2533
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:40,352
And don't have any structures are coming here to do what

2534
02:01:41,376 --> 02:01:42,912
Collapse the infrastructure

2535
02:01:43,936 --> 02:01:44,960
Do not go to work

2536
02:01:45,472 --> 02:01:47,264
Forget you to say you're not essential

2537
02:01:49,056 --> 02:01:50,848
Amistad Street

2538
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:52,384
Then they come in

2539
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:53,920
Tell you

2540
02:01:54,176 --> 02:01:55,712
That you got to open your borders up

2541
02:01:55,968 --> 02:01:58,016
Because the third world

2542
02:01:58,272 --> 02:01:59,808
And then I get here and they're organized

2543
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:01,600
In the political weapon

2544
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:02,880
And political groups

2545
02:02:03,392 --> 02:02:04,672
From the beginning

2546
02:02:04,928 --> 02:02:06,720
Year and a human

2547
02:02:06,976 --> 02:02:08,768
Refugee camp in Marxist

2548
02:02:09,024 --> 02:02:10,304
Venomous ideology

2549
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:12,608
Projected by Mark Zuckerberg

2550
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:16,192
Projected by Jeff Bezos

2551
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:19,520
Rejected by all them on record commanding

2552
02:02:19,776 --> 02:02:21,056
That's quite a sentence

2553
02:02:21,312 --> 02:02:23,360
Yeah you know.

2554
02:02:23,616 --> 02:02:26,176
Concerns that it might not be awake nationalist thing

2555
02:02:26,432 --> 02:02:30,016
Yeah I wasn't really made it pretty clear there

2556
02:02:30,272 --> 02:02:34,880
I would say over this territory so many times in the past

2557
02:02:35,136 --> 02:02:35,648
Best when he's gotten

2558
02:02:35,904 --> 02:02:38,464
Into the the past Caravan there it is now

2559
02:02:38,976 --> 02:02:40,512
This is is very much

2560
02:02:40,768 --> 02:02:42,560
Watch based on a white

2561
02:02:42,816 --> 02:02:43,840
Identity Sierra Toyota

2562
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:44,864
No

2563
02:02:45,632 --> 02:02:46,400
I would say

2564
02:02:48,448 --> 02:02:50,240
Do behavior that he's engaging in

2565
02:02:50,496 --> 02:02:52,800
And the way that he's framing a lot of these ideas

2566
02:02:53,568 --> 02:02:54,080
AR

2567
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:55,104
Very dangerous

2568
02:02:55,616 --> 02:02:58,176
They're the sort of things that I do think

2569
02:02:58,432 --> 02:02:59,456
Sound a lot like

2570
02:02:59,712 --> 02:03:00,224
Insight

2571
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:03,296
Violence of people that you suspect might be Emigrant

2572
02:03:04,064 --> 02:03:06,880
This is the Takeover this is Modern Warfare

2573
02:03:07,136 --> 02:03:09,440
Using giant third-world starting horde

2574
02:03:10,464 --> 02:03:12,256
Starvation or invasion

2575
02:03:12,512 --> 02:03:18,656
And the un's got to manage with the lap every damn bit of it and they're going to swap your bread city they're going to swap your

2576
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:21,984
Military

2577
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:22,752
Attack

2578
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:27,872
I don't know what you would expect the outcome of that to be other than like

2579
02:03:28,128 --> 02:03:29,408
Rank xenophobia

2580
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:32,992
I am the possibility of violence

2581
02:03:33,248 --> 02:03:34,272
Directed towards people

2582
02:03:34,784 --> 02:03:35,296
That are

2583
02:03:35,552 --> 02:03:36,064
Determined

2584
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:36,832
Tubi

2585
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:38,624
Immigrants whether or not they ask

2586
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:42,208
We are followed by a sign at every border that says whites only

2587
02:03:43,232 --> 02:03:44,256
Yeah it's it's pretty bad

2588
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:46,304
It's not on

2589
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:47,840
Familiar territory for Alex

2590
02:03:48,096 --> 02:03:48,608
Certainly

2591
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:52,448
But I just constantly end up getting in a position where like

2592
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:54,496
The world is really like

2593
02:03:55,008 --> 02:03:55,520
Serious

2594
02:03:55,776 --> 02:03:56,288
You know

2595
02:03:56,544 --> 02:04:02,432
I just don't understand how Alex cannot be living in a world of reflection about how serious things are

2596
02:04:02,688 --> 02:04:04,736
And how unhinged people are

2597
02:04:05,248 --> 02:04:08,832
And how how dangerous we are in a Miss like a misinformed

2598
02:04:09,088 --> 02:04:09,600
Populous

2599
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:12,672
People are living outside the prism of reality

2600
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:14,720
Don't believe

2601
02:04:14,976 --> 02:04:15,488
Leave

2602
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:19,072
That he is a committed believer of the things

2603
02:04:19,584 --> 02:04:21,632
That are distorted reality

2604
02:04:22,144 --> 02:04:22,656
Absolutely not

2605
02:04:22,912 --> 02:04:23,424
He's

2606
02:04:24,704 --> 02:04:25,216
Monetize

2607
02:04:25,728 --> 02:04:26,752
Exploiting

2608
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:29,312
The fact that other people living in to take reality

2609
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:30,336
That he preaches

2610
02:04:30,592 --> 02:04:32,384
You wouldn't be able to operate

2611
02:04:32,896 --> 02:04:34,944
If he actually believe the things that he say

2612
02:04:35,456 --> 02:04:36,736
He wouldn't be able to work

2613
02:04:36,992 --> 02:04:38,528
You wouldn't be able to do any of that s***

2614
02:04:38,784 --> 02:04:40,832
He would be dead by now because he would have

2615
02:04:41,344 --> 02:04:42,880
Storm the Austin Capitol

2616
02:04:43,136 --> 02:04:44,160
10 years ago

2617
02:04:44,928 --> 02:04:45,696
It's not

2618
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:49,536
8/8 it's nonsense and I I I just constantly

2619
02:04:50,304 --> 02:04:51,584
I think like wild that will take

2620
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,888
Take it seriously and you just never does never does

2621
02:04:54,144 --> 02:04:55,168
It's a mean yeah yeah

2622
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:56,448
It's hard to

2623
02:04:56,704 --> 02:04:58,240
Say anything you know when you ask like

2624
02:04:58,496 --> 02:05:00,800
How do these people not take it more seriously and it

2625
02:05:01,056 --> 02:05:02,080
It's just like scream

2626
02:05:03,104 --> 02:05:03,616
Mother

2627
02:05:04,384 --> 02:05:07,456
It's mine can't matter that much though

2628
02:05:07,712 --> 02:05:10,528
I guess so f****** much I guess

2629
02:05:12,064 --> 02:05:16,416
It's talking about how his enemies are ugly and they want to kill you read about this

2630
02:05:16,928 --> 02:05:18,720
I don't know

2631
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:20,512
I would say this isn't safe

2632
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:25,120
It's all weird disreputable

2633
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:27,168
Creature

2634
02:05:27,424 --> 02:05:28,704
That's all they can get

2635
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:29,472
Cuz they're such a

2636
02:05:32,032 --> 02:05:35,104
But no good looking no well-spoken no honorable man

2637
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,640
Will even serve this

2638
02:05:37,152 --> 02:05:37,920
But it still doesn't matter

2639
02:05:38,432 --> 02:05:39,968
Men don't take the

2640
02:05:40,224 --> 02:05:41,760
The field

2641
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:44,064
Because you didn't join the fight

2642
02:05:44,576 --> 02:05:46,624
And the fight is informational is cultural

2643
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:50,464
It's spiritual and it's about information

2644
02:05:50,976 --> 02:05:52,000
And it is about

2645
02:05:52,768 --> 02:05:54,560
Non-compliance it is about symbolism

2646
02:05:55,584 --> 02:05:57,376
Won't matter if they're going to hurt you so bad

2647
02:05:57,888 --> 02:06:00,448
Because they have a nature like a child molesters got to write the child

2648
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:01,728
Or murderers.

2649
02:06:03,264 --> 02:06:05,568
Have the drive and this desire and they thought I

2650
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:11,968
Power over you

2651
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:14,016
Their stock go up at Amazon

2652
02:06:14,272 --> 02:06:15,296
Now they just got to do it

2653
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:16,832
Put you down

2654
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:24,000
And they're going to go and go and go and go and go they can

2655
02:06:24,512 --> 02:06:25,792
Will you stop that

2656
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:28,096
I can't stop until you stop them

2657
02:06:28,352 --> 02:06:28,864
Wild

2658
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:30,656
Wild

2659
02:06:31,168 --> 02:06:32,704
It's not it's not a good look

2660
02:06:33,216 --> 02:06:34,496
Overall

2661
02:06:34,752 --> 02:06:37,312
You know what I've always thought I've always thought that the Democrat

2662
02:06:37,568 --> 02:06:38,080
Secret where

2663
02:06:39,872 --> 02:06:40,384
Could be

2664
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:42,944
Governing the country with

2665
02:06:43,712 --> 02:06:44,992
And they refused

2666
02:06:45,248 --> 02:06:45,760
To do that

2667
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:48,064
For the same reason Alex refuses to take the

2668
02:06:48,576 --> 02:06:49,088
Like seriously

2669
02:06:51,648 --> 02:06:53,696
If you material improve the lives

2670
02:06:55,232 --> 02:06:56,768
I'm just running my

2671
02:06:57,024 --> 02:06:58,048
I'm losing my mind

2672
02:06:58,304 --> 02:06:58,816
I understand

2673
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:01,888
And if you think that Alex is

2674
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:04,192
Solely driven by money

2675
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:05,984
Then I would

2676
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:09,568
It suggests that this must be what everyone keeps telling him to do more

2677
02:07:10,592 --> 02:07:11,104
Humpty Dump

2678
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:13,408
Brian stelter 100000

2679
02:07:13,664 --> 02:07:15,712
He later bitching no one watches me

2680
02:07:19,296 --> 02:07:20,832
You are one that I mean

2681
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:23,648
You molest the truth

2682
02:07:29,536 --> 02:07:30,304
Filter problematic

2683
02:07:33,888 --> 02:07:35,936
We have to be clear-eyed about what is a domestic Terror threat

2684
02:07:36,448 --> 02:07:38,240
But also very careful not to exaggerate

2685
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:43,616
There's a domestic Terror threat it's called your speech

2686
02:07:44,384 --> 02:07:47,968
I-24 Americans at the Capitol who's Orion a small riot

2687
02:07:48,224 --> 02:07:49,504
It's the worst things in Pearl Harbor

2688
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:51,552
You're a child

2689
02:07:53,856 --> 02:07:54,624
He plays all these games

2690
02:07:55,136 --> 02:07:56,160
Let's go back to the shack

2691
02:07:56,416 --> 02:07:56,928
The pot

2692
02:07:57,184 --> 02:08:00,256
It's interesting cuz it was supposed to be as fake last show

2693
02:08:02,048 --> 02:08:02,816
Entire segment

2694
02:08:03,072 --> 02:08:04,864
Complaining about a Brian stelter

2695
02:08:05,376 --> 02:08:11,520
Peace on his fake last show cuz that the time capsule

2696
02:08:11,776 --> 02:08:17,920
He's done one of these where he just plays a Brian stelter interview that Justin Smoak this paper

2697
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:20,992
Just a completely normal I was listening to it on like

2698
02:08:22,016 --> 02:08:23,808
I'd like first of all he's not saying

2699
02:08:24,832 --> 02:08:29,696
Is responding to it is not a hot take it is a pretty

2700
02:08:30,464 --> 02:08:34,048
Soft conversation about misinformation on

2701
02:08:34,304 --> 02:08:40,448
You take Brian stelter do and just a regular old like hey how have you been and turn it into a 10-minute logs

2702
02:08:40,704 --> 02:08:42,496
Scary so scary

2703
02:08:43,008 --> 02:08:44,544
The truth look at his eyes

2704
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:46,848
For Old Times Sake here's a minute

2705
02:08:47,104 --> 02:08:47,872
40 of Alex

2706
02:08:48,384 --> 02:08:49,664
Just getting really mad at stelter

2707
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:52,736
We have to be clear-eyed about what is a domestic Terror threat

2708
02:08:52,992 --> 02:08:54,784
But also very careful not to exaggerate

2709
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:56,064
Overstate

2710
02:08:56,576 --> 02:08:58,368
Undue fear

2711
02:08:58,624 --> 02:08:59,904
In this country right now

2712
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:04,512
I think that's actually very careful here.

2713
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:07,840
Just because someone may believe that other

2714
02:09:08,096 --> 02:09:09,120
President did not win

2715
02:09:09,376 --> 02:09:10,400
The election are the

2716
02:09:10,912 --> 02:09:14,240
Did not win or that someone believes in qanon

2717
02:09:14,496 --> 02:09:15,520
Doesn't mean that there are

2718
02:09:15,776 --> 02:09:16,288
Going to go

2719
02:09:16,544 --> 02:09:18,080
Go pick up arms

2720
02:09:18,592 --> 02:09:22,688
It's like I'm questioning election we don't put them in the FEMA camp right away

2721
02:09:22,944 --> 02:09:28,064
Did he say that

2722
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:29,600

Possible counselor ever be a solution of real clear. Listen to this

2728
02:09:41,888 --> 02:09:42,912
Information crisis

2729
02:09:47,264 --> 02:09:49,312
Is there a final solution enough

2730
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:51,360
But how do we deal.

2731
02:09:51,616 --> 02:09:52,128
People

2732
02:09:52,384 --> 02:09:54,432

2733
02:09:54,688 --> 02:09:55,200
Georgia

2734
02:09:55,456 --> 02:09:56,736
Closing things

2735
02:10:06,976 --> 02:10:08,768
What's a comeback I'm going to be nice

2736
02:10:09,536 --> 02:10:10,560
Play the clip on a

2737
02:10:14,144 --> 02:10:14,656
It's hard to look

2738
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:18,240
What does it matter

2739
02:10:19,264 --> 02:10:21,568
They know that the global is word is through stelter

2740
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:25,152
And so here is this this this this

2741
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:28,480
They call us that

2742
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:32,832
Brian

2743
02:10:34,112 --> 02:10:35,648
Uebelhor

2744
02:10:35,904 --> 02:10:38,464
I'm not saying that he's not at a public

2745
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:42,560
Figure oriented accomplish anything I'm just saying he's Brian stelter

02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:46,912
The Voice

2748
02:10:47,168 --> 02:10:48,448
The globalist

2749
02:10:48,704 --> 02:10:49,728
The voice of

2750
02:10:49,984 --> 02:10:56,128
The globalist stelter house small potatoes everybody who's a big deal is

2751
02:10:56,384 --> 02:10:57,664
I am I just

2752
02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:01,504
I think it's fascinating cuz you know like if this is the pretend last show

2753
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:03,552
Make

2754
02:11:03,808 --> 02:11:04,832
Since I mean like

2755
02:11:05,088 --> 02:11:05,856
Alden

2756
02:11:06,112 --> 02:11:08,672
Hates Brian stelter

2757
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:09,952
I can't

2758
02:11:10,208 --> 02:11:15,840
Figure out except the Brian stelter has mentioned Alex a couple times and he comes off as a less

2759
02:11:16,096 --> 02:11:16,608
Then

2760
02:11:16,864 --> 02:11:19,936
Alex's definition of masculine man

2761
02:11:20,192 --> 02:11:21,472
Exit that bothers Alex

2762
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:22,496
On some level

2763
02:11:22,752 --> 02:11:23,264
Right

2764
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:29,664
It feels like he's been emasculated by a less masculine man in Alex's eyes and just say

2765
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:30,944
Alex is a dumb

2766
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:33,760
Bill because I don't think

2767
02:11:34,016 --> 02:11:35,552
Alex leaving his mind

2768
02:11:35,808 --> 02:11:36,832
Where has Alex

2769
02:11:37,088 --> 02:11:39,392
Is clearly thinking about the times.

2770
02:11:39,648 --> 02:11:42,208
All the time

2771
02:11:42,464 --> 02:11:44,000
Is Brian stelter so much

2772
02:11:44,256 --> 02:11:45,536

Just it come out on the show if these these outbursts is amazing

2774

Customer friedersdorf

2776
02:11:55,264 --> 02:11:56,544
And now it's a process

2777
02:11:56,800 --> 02:12:00,128
Unhealthy healthy

2778
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:01,152
So Alec

2779
02:12:01,408 --> 02:12:02,176
It's comes back from break

2780
02:12:02,432 --> 02:12:02,944

2787
02:12:17,536 --> 02:12:19,840
Few minutes of this I'm going to try to shut off.

2788
02:12:20,352 --> 02:12:23,168

2789
02:12:23,424 --> 02:12:24,192
Turn down

2790
02:12:24,448 --> 02:12:29,056
The anger see from that huge percentage of Republicans who believe that the election was stolen

2791
02:12:35,968 --> 02:12:39,040
But yeah

2792
02:12:39,296 --> 02:12:40,064
He's on

2793
02:12:41,088 --> 02:12:42,368
God is so much stelter

2794
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:44,928
He's talking

Halak

2797
02:12:47,232 --> 02:12:48,000
We're at War

2798
02:12:48,256 --> 02:12:49,536
To not be enslaved

2799
02:12:50,816 --> 02:12:54,656
There comes a point when powerful organizations and groups

2800
02:12:54,912 --> 02:12:55,680
Poseidon

2801
02:12:57,216 --> 02:12:58,496
No matter what happens

2802
02:12:58,752 --> 02:12:59,520
Committed to the fight

2803
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:08,224
We are now under globalist attack

2804
02:13:11,296 --> 02:13:14,112
I tried to warn him over decades

2805
02:13:14,368 --> 02:13:17,952
Barry Goldwater Cleon skousen so many others warned before I was even born

2806
02:13:21,024 --> 02:13:23,072
They believe that we were so strong

2807
02:13:23,584 --> 02:13:24,608
We could not fall

2808
02:13:27,168 --> 02:13:27,680
From within

2809
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:32,032
Fact of slavery

2810
02:13:33,056 --> 02:13:34,592
Ambassador persecution

2811
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:37,408
And the full thrust of the globalist attack

2812
02:13:38,176 --> 02:13:39,456

2813
02:13:40,992 --> 02:13:44,576

2817
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:08,384
Start building fires I want to start large brush fires in the street I understand to let everyone know

2818
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:14,784
What is happening yeah

2819
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:17,600
There's too many people who are unaware

2820
02:14:17,856 --> 02:14:24,000
He is doing this again I need someone to know that he is doing this

2821
02:14:24,256 --> 02:14:26,560
So annoying to because

2822
02:14:26,816 --> 02:14:30,656
Like he did nothing but waste time on a Sunday show

2823
02:14:31,168 --> 02:14:32,448
There's so much just like

2824
02:14:32,704 --> 02:14:33,984
It's the Boogaloo boys that's

2825
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:35,776
That's who we don't like now

2826
02:14:36,032 --> 02:14:38,848
Tucker Carlson's Mysore swoops bike club

There's this

2831
02:14:51,136 --> 02:14:54,720
Last clip here from Sunday's fitting cuz it's kind of how Alex wraps up

2832
02:14:57,024 --> 02:15:03,168
I will say that it is exciting for me because now on Friday Orr show we will find

2833
02:15:03,424 --> 02:15:07,008

People that went in non-violently to be set up and arrested

2844
02:15:33,120 --> 02:15:34,400
When they've arrested

2845
02:15:34,656 --> 02:15:35,424
They both are released later

2846
02:15:35,936 --> 02:15:37,216
They did their job well they said

2847
02:15:37,472 --> 02:15:37,984
America

2848
02:15:38,496 --> 02:15:40,288
Trump knew his supporters were patriotic

2849
02:15:42,336 --> 02:15:45,920

2886
02:17:16,288 --> 02:17:17,056
Affordable Towers

2887
02:17:17,312 --> 02:17:21,152
It's 5828 didn't understand why you tells his version of the story

2888
02:17:21,664 --> 02:17:26,016
It's far more exciting than saying that the Patriot movement is a bunch of stupid double Towers

2889
02:17:26,272 --> 02:17:28,064
Spotswood Pizza until he would say

02:17:41,888 --> 02:17:42,656
Destroying the cons

Constitution

2897
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:45,984

Yeah I just don't know

2908
02:18:14,144 --> 02:18:18,496
Don't feel like I learned much from the strip

2909
02:18:18,752 --> 02:18:24,128
I'm glad I got the benefit of his vows

2910
02:18:24,384 --> 02:18:24,896
Dozens of books

2911
02:18:25,152 --> 02:18:26,688
Totally it's nice

2912
02:18:26,944 --> 02:18:27,712

Multiple in

02:18:29,504 --> 02:18:32,320
Instances of him just reading Wikipedia Pages poorly

2915
02:18:33,088 --> 02:18:34,112
God this is dumb

2916
02:18:34,368 --> 02:18:35,136
The show is so dumb

2917
02:18:35,392 --> 02:18:37,440
Excited for Friday though

2918
02:18:39,488 --> 02:18:40,256
Well I mean

2919
02:18:40,768 --> 02:18:44,352
Can't wait for the second broadcast broadcast

2920
02:18:44,608 --> 02:18:45,888
It'll be better then

2921
02:18:46,144 --> 02:18:46,912
The November 24th

2922
02:18:47,168 --> 02:18:49,984
For sure I would hope so

2923
02:18:50,752 --> 02:18:51,264
Yeah

2924
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:54,848
Multiple.

2925
02:18:56,384 --> 02:19:00,480
Yeah I just think it'll be something interesting on the day of the inauguration like

2926
02:19:00,736 --> 02:19:02,016
I I hope

2927
02:19:02,528 --> 02:19:06,624
Did everything go smoothly in the world now we're recording this on Tuesday comes out on Wednesday

2928
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:07,648
I hope I hope it's a

2929
02:19:07,904 --> 02:19:09,696
Uneventful day by and large

2930
02:19:10,208 --> 02:19:11,488
I also hope that Alex

2931
02:19:12,512 --> 02:19:14,560
Prize or something she wear I hope it's

2932
02:19:14,816 --> 02:19:20,960
I hope he throws a hatchet or something like I hope it's not just moppy Alex

2933
02:19:21,472 --> 02:19:22,752
There's potential for likes

2934
02:19:23,008 --> 02:19:23,520
Some real

2935
02:19:23,776 --> 02:19:24,288
Performance

2936
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:26,848
And I hope we see something as opposed to nothing

2937
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:29,664
But I hope that the something we see isn't this like

2938
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:31,456
This sucks that Sunday show

2939
02:19:31,712 --> 02:19:32,480
The like

2940
02:19:32,992 --> 02:19:34,784
The hard shift into like

2941
02:19:35,296 --> 02:19:38,112
Immigrant bashing is really not good

2942
02:19:38,624 --> 02:19:40,416
I know that's a normal thing for Alex

2943
02:19:40,672 --> 02:19:41,440
Absent

2944
02:19:41,696 --> 02:19:43,488
For a little while or at least on the back burner

2945
02:19:43,744 --> 02:19:45,792
Really don't like to see a coming forward again

2946
02:19:46,048 --> 02:19:47,584
It's really annoying

2947
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:49,120
The full

2948
02:19:49,376 --> 02:19:52,192
Let's direct our attention away from all Democrats

2949
02:19:52,704 --> 02:19:53,216
Directly

2950
02:19:53,472 --> 02:19:53,984
Towards

2951
02:19:54,496 --> 02:19:55,520
Minorities of any

2952
02:19:56,032 --> 02:19:56,544
Shape

2953
02:19:56,800 --> 02:19:58,848
Specifically ones that aren't White

2954
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:00,384
Is is

2955
02:20:00,896 --> 02:20:01,920
Normal but it was

2956
02:20:02,432 --> 02:20:04,736
It was nice whenever they just wanted to kill us all equal

2957
02:20:05,248 --> 02:20:05,760
You know

2958
02:20:06,016 --> 02:20:08,320
