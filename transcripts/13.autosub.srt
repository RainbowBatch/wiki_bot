Infowars

3
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:20,992
Over a nice glass of wine with my friend

4
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,368
He is

5
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,488
Today we have

6
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:38,400
I've been thinking about I know that in our early episodes you speculated that we would find an understanding evolve

7
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:40,704
Alex so that you start to empathize with him

8
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:41,984
I've got to be honest

9
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,264
I'm starting to hate

10
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,360
I used to be sort of amused released

11
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,408
Curious I think I hate him

12
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:54,784
My feelings about him are so very complicated

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,856
Sure physical attraction

14
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:01,440
There's no doubt the super male vitality

15
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:08,096
I don't have a clip of this

16
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,168
It's called caveman

17
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,192
No

18
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,728
No

19
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,520
You know what it is

20
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,848
I just hope it's a big slab of me know better

21
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,688
Ground-up bones

22
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:31,648
An actual they break into the ocean

23
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,696
Listening to the commercials but he was

24
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:40,096
Explaining how like animals or go after bones first cuz I want to get the marrow and all the stuff around

25
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,728
I'm on board so far

26
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,264
Do they grind them up

27
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,544
They put in a pill

28
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,568
And they sell it to you

29
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,104
What

30
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:56,736
Delete sense of anything I've ever heard I think that's what the product is

31
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,504
What is

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,784
That is legit

33
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:05,440
The best way for a serial killer 2

34
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,208
Keller

35
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,256
People in

36
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:11,072
Don't know if the FDA has got to get involved

37
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,216
Vitamins

38
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,496
Sure they're good

39
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,056
It was just announced

40
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,592
Wednesday show

41
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,872
So this is breaking

42
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,664
This is gooses huge

43
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,736
Time goes on

44
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:34,880
Today the reason that we had to do what we got to do this episode I know we had an episode come out yesterday

45
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,160
Mental Health

46
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,440
Scare of the world

47
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,232
Panera college campuses or

48
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,072
But it was important

49
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,656
Looking like lurking like

50
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,936
A Batman

51
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,984
But we had to get back together

52
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,776
Evercord another episode because

53
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,616
In the time between when we recorded the Rapaport episode

54
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,176
Mike Flynn

55
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,480
General Flynn resign

56
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,016
Finally stepped down

57
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,832
Fastest

58
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,856
In history

59
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,624
Which is just beautiful

60
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,696
Yeah we're living we're living in

61
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,976
Perfectly normal time

62
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,328
Yeah I have a response

63
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:21,472
Let's do it we knew that he was going to he loves General Flynn

64
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,032
Swimming towards link

65
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,104
Like he's like the two of them

66
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,152
I'm certain that Alex's doctor

67
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,456
I'm certain

68
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,504
Conversation

69
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:37,600
And unlike where else is playing

70
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:45,024
Flynn has his own Supply

71
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,072
It's not need anybody else

72
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,120
Albert setso

73
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,448
Look

74
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:57,312
Start a farmer

75
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,592
Something like that

76
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:02,944
I will look at his future career and retired General

77
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,504
Did the

78
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:10,112
I lost my train of thought but we we knew that Alex was going to be

79
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
Like losing it

80
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,672
This is my thought

81
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,696
Next week

82
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:18,047
All he was talking about is like I got inside information

83
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,583
Reince priebus

84
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,607
Booty calls

85
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,887
Reince priebus

86
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,423
Is going down

87
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,519
He's a snake in the grass

88
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
Priebus

89
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,591
He's the one who's leaking that like

90
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:35,455
Trump is wandering around in his bathrobe

91
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,503
Paul Ryan acolyte

92
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,063
Who is actually funded by George Soros

93
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,135
Yep.

94
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,695
Complex deep state

95
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:52,095
So for the whole last week is going down I want to break it for you on Monday

96
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,423

Tuesday

98
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,471
Flocking

99
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,519

100
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,567
Rebus Stillwater

Stay in

102
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,479
The office

103
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,503
What do you mean

104
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,343
I mean before because all over the place

105
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,623
Square

106
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,951
The day before Flynn resign

107
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,231
People were being like

108
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,047
Are you still going to stay in there this it is

109
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:26,143
Completely unstable it's all it's all fake news and

110
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,959
Forget anything that's negative Alex doesn't talk about

111
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:33,567
Inconvenience

112
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:38,943
He'll talk about the leaks in the inside sources that he has probably telling him

113
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,503
Like 2 days 3 days ahead of time

114
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,783
Probably out

00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,575
You not going to talk about that on the air

116
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,415
Really so you know

117
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:53,023
Don't actually have sources

118
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,351
Yeah I know kid we've established that most of the stuff comes from

119
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:01,727
Call Ann from people who direct message Paul Joseph Watson on Twitter

120
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,567
As well as evidence examples of that

121
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,871
Still however imagine

00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
Late night song

136
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,415
Cuz he needed to make an emergency

137
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
F******

138
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,719
Signal

139
00:06:54,975 --> 00:07:01,119

And it's

145
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,247
What were mostly going to be dealing with

146
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,831
Is this broadcast

147
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,879
And here's why I'm is it a drill

148
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,951
It is not a through hell

149
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,231
An emergency

150
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
Yeah

151
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,839
More than the actual episode Excel

152
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,631
Is because the actual episode

153
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
Is super repetitive

154
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,471
And he's just hitting talking point

155
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,519
And over and over again

156
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,895

00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,031
On his own network yet supposed to be broadcast

166
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:15,871
On all the radio.

167
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,663
Virginia

168
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,199

And get to

174
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,791
To the central thing we should all be afraid of

175
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,583
It's Tuesday

176
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,911
February 14th 2017

177
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,983
I'm about to go live

178
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,359
RadioShack TV broadcast in about an hour and 8 minutes

00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,223
But I had to come in early

181
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
The breakdown

182
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,647
I want to say really quick to

183
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,695
I didn't lengthen any of the

184
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:06,303
Deposit

185
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,119
To get this emergency message

186
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
Slowly

187
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,263
The clip has started

188
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,127
Samantha

189
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,455
The reason this is so important

190
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,527
Is that I have studied

191
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,551

192
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087

00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,511
Books on eBay

195
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,303
If you go back and read those books

196
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,143
1670 18th

197
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,959
20 years ago

198
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,031
Well I wasn't present

199
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,127
The Grammys in the enemy's in

200
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,687
What big TV show

201
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,271
That is dumb down just information but

202
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,719
Like Foreign Affairs put out by The Washington Post

203
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,559
Council on Foreign Relations

204
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,399
Application or bi-monthly

205
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,727
Tell you what they're doing

206
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,847
Articles in foreign affairs that came out yesterday

207
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:30,015
Now this isn't to Hollywood producers

208
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,319
This isn't

209
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,183
Hollywood

210
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,231
Dishes

211
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,071
Cheese

212
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,631
Our Lord

213
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,447
Snowcoach

214
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,727
Is it totaled

215
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007
Roll over your dead

216
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,127
So here is where we finally understand one of the things that

217
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,431
Play goodness for a really long time

218
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,759
What the f*** is he talking about when he talks about white

219
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
Yes

220
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:09,183
That is exactly what it was like

221
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,351
Newspapers like what

222
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:22,751
Red and black and the white papers

223
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,895
Both of them the global if they're speaking to

224
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,199
Indeed

225
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,759
Fuel for the Illuminati

226
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
Foxtrot

227
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,807
Heathcliff

228
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,855
Lived in a f****** dump

229
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,975
Not adults are you lived in a junkyard

230
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:49,375
Oh that's right

231
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,311
1st phorm

232
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,383
The papers are part of it

233
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:04,479
And I'm not saying that whenever he says white papers what he's talking about is

234
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,039
Is referring to is

235
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,319
He says

236
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,343
Foreign affairs

237
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,671
Turtle he's actually talked about it called foreign policy

238
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,999
Write an essay I know that

239
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,279
Yeah I know that

240
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,607
The other one that he mentioned

241
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,655
Yeah wait by the Washington

242
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,495
He's not himself later

243
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,311
Foreign policy

244
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,639
There's a little bit of a denser news

245
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,527
Where is the Council on Foreign Relations

246
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,599
Could not what they're going to do

247
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,511
How do you get to save

248
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,071
How do you get to say that like that

249
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,863
They put it out in public

250
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,191
Just do it

251
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,239
Is there going to kill Trump

252
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
Well

253
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,567
Here here is where we're going to be being literal or

254
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:06,687
I think you being literal equations that I've had

255
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:10,783
Succumb to the beginning of the show

256
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,575
I have to temper that with

257
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,135
Again a little bit of pity deep-seated

258
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:22,047
Didn't animal love

259
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,583
Lacks the ability to

260
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,119
To comprehend what he's reading

261
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
Sometimes

262
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,199
Deciding understand what they're saying

263
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,807
There's a third possibility that I think it's more likely

264
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,087
Human bites

265
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,879
Have a slight

266
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
Paranoid

267
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:48,927
Schizophrenia

268
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:54,047
I know somebody

269
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,119
A really good question

270
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:02,751
We're going to start to see him reading a ton of things into stuff that just literally isn't there

271
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,519
Holyshit

272
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,591
So the foreign policy article that he's fighting

273
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,127
First of all doesn't say

274
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,151
In any way

275
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,711
Suggest that people should kill Trump

276
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,831
That's probably a prosecutable offense right

277
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,647
It always say putting it in a major publication

278
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,511
It also doesn't say any of the things that he later says it's

279
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,303
But also

280
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
The idea

281
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,631
That there is a magazine

282
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,423
Foreign policy

283
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,215
That for 20 years

284
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,263
Or however long it's been out

285
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
In existence

286
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,079
He's been putting the Illuminati

287
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,127
Play book out there into the public

288
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:44,223
And for 20 years Alex Jones has been on the air yelling about

289
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
30 years

290
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,527
20 years on the air

291
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:51,135
He's been yeah yeah yeah

292
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:55,743
He's like 42 or something 47

293
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,279
Just call it the moment he

294
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,583
Papa pube

295
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
Peter peace

296
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,423
He was so afraid of

297
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:09,823
Immediately went directly to foreignpolicy.com

298
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,895
This childhood I think his dad might have had some of that paranoia

299
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,943
2

300
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,711
I don't know

301
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:19,039
Because because even if we go back to our

302
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,879
That was full-on learned

303
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
Right

304
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,071
I think he is

305
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,607
Right now

306
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,935
Finally watching the full on break from real

307
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,263
4

308
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:43,103
Reality starts to sleep in and more people like Flynn

309
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,151
End up getting indicted

310
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:51,551
He shut those strong indications he's straight-up lied to the FBI

311
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,319
There's

312
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
Indication

313
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:59,743
They're not strong indications their actual from information

314
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,303
We have

315
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,071
The truck

316
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:09,471
In the media is a really good point because a lot of information

317
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,287
Are relying on is released by the

318
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,407
They are and have never been

319
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,431
Trustworthy

320
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,527
You have to take things with a grain of salt

321
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,343
It does have that ring of because

322
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,367
Trump in Flint

323
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,135
Talk s*** about the

324
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,671
Communautaire like

325
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:34,815
Go back to the code of the streets

326
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,583
You think about

327
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,375
All of the s*** that Barack

328
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,423
That seems so out of

329
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,447
Character for what

330
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,471
He really

331
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,799
I like believe what you would imagine

332
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,383
He seems like a guy with compassion

333
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,943
Wouldn't want to go crazy town

334
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,479
On whistleblowers and

335
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,831
So you start to see all of this should come out

336
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,135
Quickly these guys are being destroyed

337
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:00,927
What they

338
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,487
Huh

339
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,047
Yeah that he

340
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:12,959
Frank Marshall Davis was his dad

341
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:19,359
Crack addict who has a transgender

342
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,383
What is he

343
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,919
Just really was

344
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:26,527
That's it that's it

345
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,807
Smoked

346
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:33,439
Remember remember when we were mad at

347
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,255
Smoking

348
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
Freezing anyway

349
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,631
Speaking of that light treason

350
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,911
Archie Bunker

351
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,983
Divide Illinois

352
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:50,591
Drinking Boone's Farm cuz we don't deserve nice things

353
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,919
He gets into the situation with

354
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,967
What's playing and his interpretation of it

355
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,527
And when he's done we can agree

356
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:05,695
Of course his resignation

357
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
Now

358
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:10,559
Truth-seeking in Flynn's resignation doesn't in controversy surrounding White House

359
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,887
General Flynn

360
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:17,215
With other military leaders to say no to backing Al-Qaeda

361
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,567
In Syria in The Killing 100,000 people

362
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,871
It was a great moral moment for our military

363
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,711
Decided to not follow

364
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
Criminal lawyers

365
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,015
Play the following four decades

366
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:30,783
Bala

367
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,855
Jesus mom

368
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:37,439
And so she knows about all this plan

369
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:42,047
They released the communicators that Flynn supposedly

370
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,351
Security advisor

371
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,471
At that time December 15th

372
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,263
Who was the president elect

373
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,639
Working around the clock

374
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,223
Against the law

375
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,503
CIA

376
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,039
State Department

377
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:11,231
He's supposed to talk to you

378
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,935
He said the president's policy

379
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,983
The president

380
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:30,431
The present

381
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,247
Exactly what a Russian spy would say

382
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,551
Inflating the truth

383
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,855
Like

384
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
Until

385
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,647
Your brother

386
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,183
Europe

387
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,207
But still

388
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,255
How did the Riviera Resort

389
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,023
Citizens

390
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:52,447
Adventure sworn in position

391
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:59,359
I was just straight-up I have been

392
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,151
Released

393
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,943
Recording they absolutely have it

394
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,991
But from sources who have listened to them

395
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,271
They all

396
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,807
Save that he was very

397
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,343
Who is it talking about

398
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,135
One Source even said

399
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:15,999
It isn't possible that he wouldn't remember talked about it the entire phone call was about

400
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:20,863
Is Slim's phone and spying on him

401
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,679
Tapping the Russians phones

402
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:28,799
I actually have always monitored

403
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,567
Those

404
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,871
That's the thing that came out

405
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,943
Was under underreported text

406
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,247
But

407
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,295
They're listening to

408
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,111
The American communication

409
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,631
Fuquay-Varina

410
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,935
They are listening to

411
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,471
American communicate

412
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:04,639
But that's not necessarily have to be true

413
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,687
Miki spying on Flint

414
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:13,087
They were spying on these it was collected

415
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,391
Like this story

416
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,184
Save

417
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,488
They saw that Russia wasn't

418
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
Retaliating

419
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,792
Which seems so out of character

420
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,376
For them and they were saying they were surprised by that to the point where they

421
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,448
Dick Baxter this

422
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,472
Length of time

423
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:36,128
50 what may event was communicating with Viaduct

424
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:36,896
Caught up on

425
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,176
The tapes

426
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:38,944
Communicate

427
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
Now

428
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:42,272
The interesting fact

429
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,600
The case you don't think so I think they were listening in real time

430
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:52,256
How I imagine a reel-to-reel

431
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:58,656
You're talkin about

432
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,616
Okay you're right

433
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:13,248
My fantasy is more fun

434
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,576
What was the Logan Act

435
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,624
They were like the more you read about it

436
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,160
Avista Subs

437
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:24,000
And nobody has been prosecuted will doors one guy

438
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:32,192
The new movie coming out

439
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,984
Predator

440
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,800
I can't I can't believe that it's never happen

441
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:37,824
In that length

442
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:38,848
Sure

443
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:42,432
It has to have there has to have been those civilians that

444
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,456
Have gone outside

445
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,248
And negotiated

446
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,528
Almost there

447
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,552
I don't

448
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,624
Could have imagined

449
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,648
This

450
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,208
Sweetly blatant

451
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:58,304
Pretty obvious the laws there breaking are ones that

452
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,584
People don't even

453
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,352
Think about

454
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,680
Because it seems so stupid to break those laws

455
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,704
The way that they're doing

456
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,984
Brazenly

457
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,080
Brazen the phone calls line up with when

458
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:16,480
Trump was like very smart of Vladimir Putin.

459
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:21,600
Insinuates

460
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,208
Agree with Alex

461
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:32,352
Hey I'm resigning is going to just put more blood in the water if not allowed him to

462
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,168
That's a really good

463
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:35,936
That's a really good

464
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,984
It's kind of showing a little bit

465
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,520
I'm showing that You're vulnerable

466
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,384
He doesn't want to give that perception

467
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,432
He's not playing a good

468
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,456
Kmart

469
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
Cards here

470
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:55,392
Soccer never had to play this game of cards as bad as there's a lot of Tails going around

471
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,720
It seems like it's

472
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,744
Seems like they are

473
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
They're just

474
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,048
They like the Republic

475
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:02,816
Congress is

476
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,864
As much b*******

477
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,424
7 / 0

478
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
Exact

479
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:15,616
It's not not going

480
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,480
Based on what

481
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,040
True now

482
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,160
I do I do

483
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,440
You absolutely believe that

484
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,232
Should be

485
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,000
Arrested

486
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,024
Prosecuted

487
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:37,632
Interesting theories about him that I can't because I don't

488
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,680
I couldn't articulate them well

489
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,472
But I've read some interesting write-up

490
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,496
That suggests

491
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,056
Might be

492
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,848
Not as bad as dude

493
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,616
Is

494
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,152
It appears

495
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:54,784
I'm not sure about this and I don't want a voucher that cuz it look bad

496
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:01,184
Basically ruined America almost 8 again

497
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,256
This is a pretty compelling argument

498
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,304
Carolina eighteen-year-old Russia

499
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,936
Hackerone that's it I strongly recommend you guys look up the

500
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,216
North Carolina

501
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,496
Russian hacker

502
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,544
Basically

503
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,592
There there

504
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,872
The theory is he cat

505
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,896
Anthony Weiner

506
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,712
16 year old girl

507
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,736
Yeah

508
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,016
Was then the

509
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,088
Because it was a crime

510
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,112
Look into

511
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:30,880
2

512
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,648
His laptop

513
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,928
And that's whatever some

514
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,744
Hillary's emails

515
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,656
It seems like the most

516
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:49,568
Rube Goldberg spy right it's not

517
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,128
Super like

518
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,664
It's not the most believable

519
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,968
But there's some pieces of it that kind of

520
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,504
You know it makes you think a lot

521
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:08,512
I end up sounding like Alex himself crazy nonsense

522
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,304
Visit these are interesting ideas

523
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,840
But I don't know if they're true

524
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
I won't

525
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:17,984
Blame

526
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,752
Spiracy

527
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,032
Whenever

528
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,312
Ignorance and incompetence

529
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,872
Yeah

530
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,896
Speaking of Icarus

531
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,944
Alex wants

532
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
So tell you

533
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,992
Jordan

534
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:34,112
Jordan Holmes from

535
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:40,000
I will be so mad if you got a shout-out Netflix

536
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,352
Clearly because I'm the least dangerous between

537
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:47,680
Every single time he says

538
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,800
I'm so convincing

539
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,872
So you're basically as much as

540
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,200
It's just getting close

541
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:05,600
Getting close little flickers going on

542
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,624
In the world

543
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:09,952
Explain what's going on here

544
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,512
Rebellion

545
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:18,912
Speak that if you don't

546
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:23,008
No we can think Machiavelli we know it's not good

547
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,432
People

548
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,648
Let's build an infrastructure let's build a space program

549
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,696
Technologies developed

550
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,424
That's not a wimpy

551
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,472
You know silly worldview

552
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:56,544
Oh you're silly everybody's evil that won't work

553
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,640
Usually doesn't like to use

554
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,480
There's already.

555
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,016
He's not a goddamn Russian

556
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,904
Because it's not playing all these really

557
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,256
Here you can see it in his face

558
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,024
Pissed off

559
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,192
And then

560
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:24,960
Like that

561
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,752
Bulshit he just dropped had a lot of

562
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,104
Couldn't stop it from coming out

563
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:37,760
The Regular Show

564
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,528
He means more

565
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,344
Is this sounds very real

566
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,464
Foreign policy article again he calls it foreign affairs

567
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,072
He will straighten

568
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:51,840
Kind of sidetracked

569
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,120
Really nobody

570
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,984
Paul Watson link to the

571
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:01,056
Fidget spinners

572
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,592
About Trump

573
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,128
Read

574
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:07,456
These articles

575
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,808
I'm guessing because

576
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,600
Read

577
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,672
He does not

578
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,208
$3

579
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,256
The mouth of Lucifer

580
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,328
They say they're at

581
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,120
Foreign affairs

582
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,424
Which again is only for love

583
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,728
They put it out

584
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,544
And

585
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:35,872
They're like war on truth

586
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,920
Get your truth here but now

587
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,016
Whatever

588
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:48,416
He says someone else is doing is what he's doing he has about the globalist putting all this stuff

589
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,720
Up and didn't know that you're too dumb to go read it

590
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,024
That's him talking about his listeners

591
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,816
Reading the sources you talk to

592
00:29:55,584 --> 00:30:00,960
He's projecting his own feeling of his audience being dumb

593
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,240
I bet it has to be

594
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:05,568
The articles that he cites contradict what he say

595
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,336
Consist

596
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,920
That's a really good

597
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:13,504
That's a really good point there's almost like

598
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,272
I don't get the

599
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,808
Complete unconsciousness

600
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,880
Is it like somehow the truth is trying to get out

601
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:23,488
This goes back to I think that the truth about him is

602
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:30,144
One part may be a little bit bigger part paranoia a huge part lack of writing

603
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:33,216
Yeah lack of reading comprehension

604
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,240
Okay

605
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,776
Baby

606
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,848
You know Texas Public Schools didn't do him a great service

607
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,152
Want I want

608
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,176
No more about it

609
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,480
Personal life to see if there are like

610
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,760
Full-on paranoid

611
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,784
Schizophrenic

612
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,576
Really

613
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:54,208
Scary to think about it I tried to find biographies about him or anything about his life in

614
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:58,816
There's really not a ton about his early life but you can find some sources

615
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:05,472
And actually there's an episode of the dollop about Jade Helm where they talk about his early life a little bit

616
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:10,848
Some sources talk about is how when he was in high school

617
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,128
He was convinced

618
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,664
That people selling drugs

619
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,432
To the kids

620
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,712
We're working

621
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,992
Are they were like

622
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,016
Entrapping kids

623
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,064
That works for the school

624
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,464
Yes been that guy for like 30 years

625
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,864
If you've also based on his self-reporting of himself when he was younger

626
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,168
If you believe him he did have a paranoid

627
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,472
Sort of ideations when he was young

628
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,264
Who cares

629
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,384
Concern

630
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,224
Yeah

631
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,784
To laughing at a mentally ill

632
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,856
Who needs help but the problem is

633
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,880
He's a great showing

634
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,160
He's a great Showman

635
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:56,928
And

636
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,232
His entire premise is

637
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,768
Anti him getting help

638
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:06,400
Such a damaging awful part of our culture

639
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,032
We can't

640
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,056
Okay now

641
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:16,640
Here is my theory based on what you just said for why the print industry

642
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,456
For Global

643
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,504
Yeah there can't be that many

644
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,784
No

645
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,320
Published

646
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:28,672
For Global oh man we're going to learn something else about globalist

647
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,440
It's really tragic

648
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:33,792
At the end of this episode 2

649
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,096
They realize the lies don't work

650
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:39,424
About to execute

651
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,960
Really horrible devastation

652
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,032
Starting huge Wars

653
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,592
DC anyting

654
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,528
Obama

655
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,320
Bunker

656
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,600
Is it in the news

657
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:01,440
2 miles from the White House and is recruiting with Soros and army

658
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,744
Bolshevik Revolution

659
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,280
That's not true

660
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:10,400
What what news would have that on there without there's no article on Breitbart

661
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,032
Ugh by the very barrister

662
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:16,800
Definition

663
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:22,176
That links to an article in the New York Post

664
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,968
And that's the only source on it

665
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:26,016
Pulled it up and read it

666
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,808
There's no real evidence

667
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,344
That

668
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,160
Militarized bunker

669
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:37,280
Throwing the article in the article

670
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,072
Institutional scholar is

671
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,352
Recruiting an army

672
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,400
In the article the only relevant

673
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:46,752
Citations that are made about Obama at all or 1

674
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,288
Hyperlinks clip

675
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,824
Are I'm sorry

676
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,104
How that is

677
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,872
Is about

678
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:54,176
Obama

679
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,200
Protest

680
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,480
I'm deciding

681
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:00,064
Former President Barack Obama

682
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,088
Anti-trump protests

683
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:03,392
He was sending a message of approval to his troops

684
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,416
Fruits

685
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,184
Yes

686
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,744
Obama has an army of agitators numbering more than

687
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,512
30000

688
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:11,328
We'll fight as Republicans

689
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,096
Historic present

690
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,144
Already showing a little bit of

691
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:20,800
What does no Citation for this 30000 number or the fruit this is absurd

692
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:23,104
Give me an idea of

693
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,384
What

694
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,664
The hiring process

695
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,968
Well they put

696
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:34,624
Know what it is all about is that Obama is working with that organization organizing for action

697
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,160
No community

698
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,464
I like how a cow

699
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,488
Still on

700
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
Is there big

701
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,328
Boogeyman

702
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:47,168
F****** with the middle of nowhere

703
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,984
Orchestrating all of

704
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,848
Trump millions and millions of

705
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,480
30000

706
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,064
All of them names

707
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,344
The claim that

708
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,112
Soros

709
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,160
Got this bunker in the army

710
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,184
Bolshevik

711
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,208
That was crazy

712
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:16,352
The only way you can take that is truth is if you read the Breitbart article that have no source

713
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,680
Okay go ahead and read that it's not it's

714
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,704
Not news

715
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:25,568
It is absolutely not verified it's not source

716
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,848
It is

717
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:32,224
Basically you're not smart enough to

718
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,272
To see that that's the only way globalist

719
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,040
Communicate with e

720
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,576
Each other is on

721
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,672
This isn't even in foreign policy

722
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,952
Lincoln

723
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,512
That's right it would have to be

724
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,656
Guys get excited Obama starting this bunker up

725
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,800
Foreign policy newspaper that

726
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:57,568
They send out

727
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,104
To each other

728
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,152
Mostly about

729
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,736
I woke up I've never.

730
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,040
You can see little actually

731
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,576
You don't feel like there is a

732
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,184
It was a coup Over America under globalism by stealth with a counter-coup a trump

733
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,000
They're launching a counter counter to right now and there's

734
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,792
Incredible things going on right now

735
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,912
This is an amazing time to be alive

736
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,472
I feel sorry for

737
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:31,104
Weather

738
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,224
When they come out

739
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,064
And these articles

740
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:44,928
And they say everything I said but from their perspective

741
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,208
It's

742
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,888
My analysis

743
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,568
And not because you listen to me but because he

744
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,368
How old

745
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:19,488
No hard good people are fighting to try to give them Freedom it's just

746
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,560
I think he is

747
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,352
It's almost too much to ask

748
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,888
It's it's

749
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,472
Okay we're not going to lie anymore

750
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,408
We stole

751
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,504
System

752
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:48,160
He wants either because they want their own power

753
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,328
He's going to bring it all

754
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,864
Pictures of six.

755
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,192
56

756
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,472
This is the devil

757
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:11,200
This is trying to say that that's what the article is saying

758
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,224
The antitrust

759
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,504
No

760
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,040
You saying that the globalist

761
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:17,088
Through this foreign policy article

762
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:19,136
Are trying to say to the Russian

763
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:22,208
Hey guys come on come join us against Trump

764
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:28,096
And that's where the counter is happening because the original

765
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,376
Counter-coup was when the rush

766
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,656
Actions were on his side

767
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,448

Was a soft

776
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:09,312
That was done by Hillary Clinton

777
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,848
And George Soros

778
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,664

That was the original

782
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:27,488
Behind the scenes there was another soft coup

783
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,792
There was done by people who were

784
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,584
In the intelligence communities

785
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,376
Working with Russia

786
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:38,496
Okay so we all want to talk about

787
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,032
Do Russians were kind of working on it

If there's a coup

807
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:36,608
And you're saying that there's a counter-coup I've never heard this many times in a row

808
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,144
If there's a counter-coup

809
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,168
And you're arguing that

810
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,008
You can't then be surprised when there's a counter company

Reading way more devilish things into this article that

820
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,008
Very clearly

821
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,056
I've read this article 45 time

822
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,104
Yeah I've read it over

823
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:24,992
There's a couple things that I think you could really seriously misrepresent and I think he does

824
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,344
And once he starts to get into

825
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,136
More of a substance of it all explained

826
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,160
Describe what the Arctic

827
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,720
But for now he wants

828
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,256
What's the talk little bit

829
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,024
About

830
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,560
The

831
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,936
Can you get the little bit distracted again

832
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:47,264
Always gets distracted which with

833
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,312
Which dimension is he

834
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,104
Distracted with this time

835
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,919
17

836
00:41:54,431 --> 00:42:00,575
This clip is where he realizes that the name of the

837
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,111
The article are the eternals

838
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,439
Himself

839
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:07,999
So ends up having a Phillips

840
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:10,047
Discourse with himself

841
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,607
About the nature of honesty that is

842
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,631
F****** fantastic

843
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:18,239
I think I can't wait to listen

844
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:22,079
He says that is if it's the article's title

845
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:22,847
It's not

846
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:28,223
That's the title of the article on Infowars that tall Joseph son wrote

847
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:28,991
Which

848
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,527
Which uses

849
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:33,087
The article in Florence

850
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:39,487
But it never says that anywhere inside the article name of the archelon

851
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:43,839
Then the extra cold because their propaganda

852
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,887
Gina keep in mind

853
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,423
Is just literally

854
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,703
A weak lie

855
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,239
Now we'll get to the office

856
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:54,591
I see foreign policy but

857
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:59,967
I always tell the truth even when I make a mistake and policy is find a article

Information

861
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,239
They just want that stigma

862
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:33,247
Compare that to the average person who's totally unconscious cannot please everybody feel like me

863
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:38,623
Stolen

864
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,159

865
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,951
There's a lot there

866
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:42,719
Crazy

867
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,999
Yeah there's a lot there

868
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,535
That's

869
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,327
Play that again like halfway through

870
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,375
Okay

871
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:52,703
Like I so hard that you liked

872
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,775
But your brain takes

873
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:59,871
Information

874
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:09,599
The average person who's totally unconscious

875
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,207
He could have

876
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:19,839
Oops

877
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:24,447
1000%

878
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,775
Spiraled into some kind of weird

879
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,567
Have to be always right

880
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,615
Even though I made a mistake

881
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,663
What I really did was that a Freudian

882
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:37,759
Flip but of the truck at the beginning when I was

883
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,575
It's forward affairs with foreign policy

884
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:45,439
I wasn't saying that I was just being fully

885
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:51,839
Informational

886
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:54,399
Championship

887
00:44:54,655 --> 00:45:00,799
20 times when it was Gavin McInnes

888
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:11,551
Super easy to make

889
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:15,135
You know what I was being truthful even when I wasn't because Nigel McGuinness is a pro wrestler

890
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:18,719
F****** crazy

891
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,487
Used to be like me

892
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:27,935
What is what is that years ago everybody used to be like him what does that mean

893
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:32,543
You might know that because of ancestral memories

894
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,335
Descendants

895
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,895
If if there is like if

896
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:39,455
If he really does have a narrative

897
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,735
Through-line

898
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,015
Everything he believes

899
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,599
Like if you just be the whole pie

900
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,623
Picture like

901
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,927
Beautiful makeup

902
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:55,071
Zodiac Killer the guy searching for the string

903
00:45:55,327 --> 00:46:01,471
Volume up together that's

904
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,519
I work at a straight-up

905
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:07,615
Just turn this into 1

906
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:14,783
And then I'm just going to start peeing and all these empty wine bottles never never leave my room

907
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,063
And that's how Trump

908
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:23,231
He's finally gets into a little bit more about

909
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:23,999
The article

910
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,279
But still doesn't real

911
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,887
You read this stuff and it's just like

912
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:35,775
Revolution

913
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,871
Come up with Garrett with you

915
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,783
We're going to kill him

916
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:53,695
They even announce the one lie they tell is their biggest truth

917
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:57,279
They say in two different articles I read that go

918
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:00,863
Is canceled the Bolshevik Revolution celebration

919
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,655
And they say

920
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,191
He did that

921
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,751
Revolutions now

922
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:10,591
He's part of the revolution

923
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:14,431
And they're trying to mop-up timing is entitled hardliners in our government right now

924
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:21,599
I'm going to go ahead and more of an old hardliner than Putin himself

925
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:25,951
Probably not a single most hardliner they're also he

926
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:28,511
He came up with an amazing zip code

927
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,095
Telling is actually the

928
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,631
The truth

929
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:36,191
That is the sound of one like lap

930
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,215
That's amazing

931
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:38,239
I have the article here

932
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:44,127
In 2016 a senior Russian official explain to a group of visiting for orders why the government decided not

933
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:47,455
To celebrate the upcoming 100th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution

934
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,783
Yes it was a turning point in Russian history he argued and yes

935
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:51,807
President Vladimir Putin

936
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,087
Please today's Russia is

937
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:53,855
Successor to both

938
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,135
Bazaars and the Bolshevik

939
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,183
But celebrating a revolution

940
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,207
It would send the wrong message

941
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,231
Society

942
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,767
The Kremlin today

943
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:07,423
Today is

00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,215
The visitors were told Enda

945
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,263
Skittish about eulogizing 19:7

946
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:13,567
They plan to use the scent

947
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,335
Centenary

948
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,103

949
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,127
Santana Row

950
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,783
To solve social and political

951
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,575
That is the

952
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,343
Fat

953
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:26,879
But he's taken

954
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:28,159
That part from

955
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,719
To regime change

956
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:31,743
Especially when

957
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:32,767
2

958
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:33,791
Russian

959
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:34,559
Regime-change

960
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,607
Right

961
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,935
You see the difference between the text

962
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,215
And what is interpretation is

963
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,799
The other stuff about

964
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,847
Okay the others always keep

965
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:47,871
Hidden between the

966
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:52,991
Course

967
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,783
It's always

968
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,319
You tried like circling the

969
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:59,135
The first letter of every word in one of those

970
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,159
Susannah putting it

971
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:00,927
Together

972
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:01,951
Haven't seen what the

973
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:05,279
Do I did put like rice wine vinegar on my

974
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:08,863
My phone comes up after text

975
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:13,215
So far.

976
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,775
My phone is not operating very well.

977
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:18,847
Little bit more

978
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:21,151
It's a little bit more religious

979
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:24,991
Revolution now

980
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:28,319
He said it was bad communism was bad

981
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,255
Christ Providence

982
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:40,863
Huge

983
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:44,191
None of that was in the article

984
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,983
Is there any evidence

985
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,007
Other than

986
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,799
How much

987
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,335
Gay people

988
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,615
That he is

989
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:54,175
Is in any way a like a

990
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:54,943
Christian

991
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,735
I don't know

992
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:01,087
This is like does he attend like a Russian Orthodox Church

993
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:05,695
I don't know I've never really been too interested in just lives

994
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,463
A shirt

995
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,487
Chico's

996
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,535
They would be disrespectful

997
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:12,351
It would be disrespectful to a spoon

998
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,119
Dwyer shirts

999
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,655
He would take it as a sign

1000
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:17,215
Exactly

1001
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:20,287
Edgar

1002
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,103
I don't know

1003
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,127
Yeah you did

1004
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:29,503
He's just out there and an hour to bring up on a later show do the talking about how

1005
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,551
Tin with the money changers

1006
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,575
Keep beat their ass

1007
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:39,999
Do you make a good point out of Christ could fight if he wanted to

1008
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,791
It's like Christ

1009
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:45,375
The bringer of peace and love goes into the temple is like

1010
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:54,335
He was making the argument that the reason price got mad about that was because they were using

1011
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,127
Like I different

1012
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:58,687
Types of currency

1013
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:00,735
In order to Belk people out of money

1014
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:04,319
That's what he was mad about

1015
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,087
To the church

1016
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:11,231
Or whatever you look at the

1017
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,071
Varying interpretations of what

1018
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:17,887
Christ was actually mad about in that story but

1019
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,167
Is Big point is that

1020
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,959
Before

1021
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:24,287
I've never thought about how out of character that is for Jesus

1022
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,567
Just talked to him

1023
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:28,639
It is a little weird but there's a whole bunch of stuff you look into like

1024
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:37,599
That is true the real weird when a kid

1025
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:43,999
Come on

1026
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,631
My favorite book of the Bible

1027
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:50,399
My bad

1028
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:54,239
You know we're making a lot of jokes about the globalist

1029
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,263
But we're always taking

1030
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:04,479
Are killing the family right now

1031
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,551
Final cliff

1032
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:09,855
Cultural and spiritual death

1033
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:15,487
The Brazilian the Italian

1034
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:20,351
I don't want to not have kids I don't want to give over

1035
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,655
Elon Musk Tesla

1036
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:26,751
Merge with machines are dyed the global draw announcing their their crap

1037
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:33,919
Composite engineering humanoid

1038
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:43,903
Plans

1039
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:47,999
Childbirth we're going to have a slight disagreement

1040
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:51,583
I mean you might be able to eliminate all sorts of very tragic.

1041
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,607
Diseases and stuff

1042
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:54,911
There's also an argument to be made that

1043
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:59,519
Variety is the spice of life in the last episode

1044
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,567
Even some mental illnesses or strength

1045
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:05,663
One-of-a-kind

1046
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:09,759
Airbnb

1047
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:16,159
But you must doesn't say that the article

1048
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:19,743
Who is also

1049
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,279
Workers unionizing like

1050
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:28,191
Elon Musk is not some kind of global as hero hero but he is the closest thing that Alex knows to like

1051
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,007
Okay

1052
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:35,359
He's using it there was an article that have come out recently where Elon Musk was talking about

1053
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,151
How because

1054
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:39,711
Because of the rapidity in the

1055
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,479
At the speed

1056
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,271
That technology is evolving in

1057
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,831
Emerging with Humanity

1058
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:47,391
It might be in the necessary piece of

1059
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:53,279
He's talked about that is sort of a

1060
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,607
Hypothetical thing

1061
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:58,911
I'm hoping that maybe coming down the line with the

1062
00:53:59,167 --> 00:53:59,679
You know the nature of

1063
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,703
How are technology

1064
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:06,847
Birds with machines or deities are saying they're like

1065
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,407
We might end up becoming cyborg

1066
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:12,735
I am officially saying it here merge with machines

1067
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:17,599
Countries that he pulled out of his ass

1068
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:23,231
Where my favorite random country America Japan Brazil

1069
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:23,999
Italy

1070
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:29,887
Like those are his world superpowers right by

1071
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:30,655
To pull out of

1072
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:32,703
The EU

1073
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:38,335
Example

1074
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:39,871
So it's always on

1075
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:41,407
Yeah much like Georgia

1076
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:48,831
Georgia is on

1077
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,647
Next on that

1078
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,183
It's a good thing

1079
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:55,743
Nationalism never led to Fascism in it

1080
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,607
Great track record

1081
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,887
Never repeat

1082
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:02,655
Repeating the same

1083
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,447
Exactly

1084
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:05,727
Years ago ever

1085
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:06,495
370 years

1086
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:08,543
I don't know what's going on in Brazil

1087
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,335
But

1088
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,663
It's not good Brazil is a tiger

1089
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,943
Play the bat

1090
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:19,039
Is worse and more corrupt than our

1091
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,831
Kidnapping

1092
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,367
Economy

1093
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:26,463
Actually with a real coup

1094
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:29,791
What's the temperature

1095
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:32,607
Well unless you count the first

1096
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:36,959
I was getting rid of the military dictatorship that was the first Coupe

1097
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:39,007
The first clue than the counter-coup is white

1098
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,799
People doing what we do best

1099
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,335
Carriacou

1100
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:45,407
Yeah so this next clip

1101
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:46,943
This next one

1102
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,223
You might be thinking like

1103
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,015
These painting a really Bleak picture

1104
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:52,319
The world and she's pretty back

1105
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:56,159
He's a really depressed about it

1106
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,439
In the depressed

1107
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:02,559
Okay he's got a solution for you

1108
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:05,119
Do you know what that I respect that allotment

1109
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,399
Because most Republicans

1110
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,423
Do not go that far

1111
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:12,799
Open the mainstream solution

1112
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,079
At least you got

1113
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:19,199
Like they're saying they want to get rid of even close to it

1114
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:23,807
Repeat

1115
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,367
At least Alex Jones is like hey

1116
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,903
How about Healthcare

1117
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,183
From the 11th

1118
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:34,047
He's not even going to be that specific and also

1119
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,583
At the end he's going to talk about

1120
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:36,607
Okay good

1121
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:39,935
We have to organize herself into chivalrous good

1122
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,983
Strong organization

1123
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,055
That that that read invoke the rituals of

1124
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:47,615
Also I want to interrupt

1125
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,431
The beginning

1126
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,271
You think you talk about like night

1127
00:56:55,807 --> 00:57:01,951
Think he's more to Orange doors open

1128
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:05,279
Replied like

1129
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,863
And women

1130
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,911
Chivalrous Society

1131
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:13,471
Jamal from dragons

1132
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,031
Alright

1133
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,567
Definitely not going to leave

1134
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:20,127
Some of his f****** listeners to end up like Don Quixote

1135
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:27,551
We have to organize herself into chivalrous good strong organizations like

1136
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:30,111
Rituals of the birthright

1137
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:36,511
That that that that

1138
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:40,095
Flower supposed to be

1139
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:46,495
Meijer humans worship God made because God is what we worship

1140
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:52,127
Like the ritual

1141
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:59,295
We can do anything this is all the tests

1142
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:02,111
Level

1143
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:05,695
You don't just think God just gives his creatures unlimited power

1144
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,231
Spoiled children

1145
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:13,631
No wonder these luciferian khilona power of the universe

1146
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:19,775
Hellboy

1147
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,383
Full on fire and brimstone

1148
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:28,735
Not scarjo

1149
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:38,719
Long live like he gets a little Jim Jones

1150
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:42,303
Sinners in the hands of an Angry God

1151
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:47,935
The feeling that I worry that if things get really bad

1152
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,239
To be either take to the streets or

1153
00:58:57,151 --> 00:59:03,295
Right like globalism being a literal death cult

1154
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,623
So we need to do it first

1155
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,999
It's possible I don't know it

1156
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:13,791
Really weird though like

1157
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,327
Again

1158
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:21,727
Ice I'm not taking him out of context play I'm engaging this with the source material which is

1159
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:22,751
Just his talking

1160
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,799
He always likes

1161
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,567
To say

1162
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:28,127
I don't believe these things it's what the globalist

1163
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,663
Believe

1164
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:38,623
Children on there like at the beginning after work I don't understand

1165
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,391
Second

1166
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:43,487
You know what the second does Lucifer give it to the sickness first

1167
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:44,511
I guess so

1168
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:49,119
Implicitly saying or even explicitly is

1169
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,167
That is a good point

1170
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:55,519
Explicitly say

1171
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,543
50 good

1172
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,311
You folks

1173
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:00,383
Himself good powers

1174
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:07,039
Where these evil people are just given evil powers for joining up it's a complete psychotic break

1175
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:13,439
Living in an in Dragon Ball Z

1176
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,743
11000

1177
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:22,143
Superman you got to take super male Vitality Pandora play Goku over 9000

1178
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:27,519
Caveman

Recharge up

1180
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,079
Shoe Up Bones

1181
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,383
Yeah she's a fat correct

1182
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:35,455
This is ground up bumps

1183
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:38,527
Marshmallows

1184
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:44,927
There's a lot of

1185
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:50,559
I think the whales are great and the elephants are great but you know what

1186
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:55,167
Grand Blanc trillium times but I do like animals all the time

1187
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,727
Doesn't say that is a recurring theme

1188
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:03,871
The animal gets into

1189
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:04,895
S'more Satan talk

1190
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,943
You look at Chucky Schumer

1191
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:14,367
You look at all these newworldorder people and you look what they're doing you look what they're involved in and they are

1192
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,439
And there is a real

1193
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:19,231
Struggling

1194
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:21,791
Taking place right now on this planet

1195
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,351
Are you look at the

1196
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:26,399
Michael Moore's and the

1197
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:28,447
Gloria Steinem zanzea

1198
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,215
F*** you

Again women

1203
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:42,783
It's always about women

1204
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:46,879
It does seem to be has backflip with Maxine Waters and ants

1205
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,671
Pelosi so they're fresh on the mind

1206
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,999
Takedown glorious

01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,631
Handle the Glorious

1210
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:00,703

01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:05,055
Ground up ground up into bone right now

1212
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:10,943
The reason he's mad at her if he believes this

1213
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:11,967
If you work for the CIA

1214
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:15,551
But not the devil or does the CIA also work for

1215
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:23,999
Load chart

1216
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:28,863
The org chart

1217
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:31,679
Specific

1218
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:32,703
Bulls or work

1219
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,983
For the CIA

1220
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:40,383
But also the devil on a false

1221
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:46,783
His idea of the hierarchy of thing

1222
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,343
Cuz we know whenever I get a clip

1223
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:56,767
Current players this next clip we learned a couple things

1224
01:02:57,279 --> 01:03:01,375
First Iraq turns out the Jerry sandusky's son got arrested for

1225
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:04,703
Children

1226
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:11,103
Send something that is generational a lot of times cuz if you are kind

1227
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,663
Hundred percent is almost no

1228
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:16,735
Doubt in my mind that that's that's that's a real tragedy

1229
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:20,831
And how it is

1230
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,879
They're part of a bigger system

1231
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:26,719
Course and this is also a clip where we learn

1232
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:29,535
That recently

1233
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:40,543
Future

1234
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:45,151
Told you anything like that

1235
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:45,919
Ever

1236
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:52,063
Lascivious

1237
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:55,647
Fuk was that also I don't know if there's any evidence

1238
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,439
That is true

1239
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,719
That they were

1240
01:03:58,975 --> 01:03:59,743
Brookshire

1241
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:02,047
Children are there pedophiles

1242
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:05,375
Yeah it doesn't matter

1243
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,399
Using that

1244
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,423
Such a

1245
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:12,287
Exploitative Manor because you have to juice up your base you have to make

1246
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:15,103
You have to make the people even matter

1247
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:15,871
Chucky

1248
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:17,663
Bike

1249
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:19,455
Bike connection to this

1250
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:22,271
It's insane but anyway

1251
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:25,599
Very animated

1252
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:27,903
Because this is the evidence

1253
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:29,439
He brings up

1254
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,975
These references

1255
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:33,023
50 *

1256
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:34,303
On the last

1257
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,327
Three episodes

1258
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,887
The shout

1259
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:41,471

01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:45,311
Great Gary Oldman portrayal of Dracula

1261
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,383
Really

1262
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:49,407
Speaking role

1263
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,175

1264
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,199
Area

1265
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:52,479

Barron Penn State

1267
01:04:58,879 --> 01:04:59,647

01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:20,895
You keep making your jokes about Trump what's happening

1274

Is there a red pedophiles from Pennsylvania to California as Weiner prepares to be indicted

1275
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:30,111
As all of these criminal groups get rolled up

1276
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:33,183
You just remember what side you were on

1277
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,487
Good God look at

Physically ugly cheerleaders

What's a manifestation of the fact that that's their spirits

1281
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:46,239
And that's what they want and they want ugly

1282

01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:10,047
Your physical appearance is what your spirit manifested

1292
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:12,863
Without you looking at a goddamn mirror

1293
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:13,887

01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:21,727
Super offensive about that clip is the insinuation

1309
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:22,751
There's only two sides

1310
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,031
There's like

1311
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:25,823
If you're not on board with Trump

01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:30,431
Yeah you are one of these pedophiles

1313
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:33,247

01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:07,807
Also a lot of these reports are coming out that are being used as evidence that Trump is rolling up

1323
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:08,831
Pedophile Networks

1324

01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:17,791
And a lot of times they aren't

1331
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:20,351
Pedophile ring

1332
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,119
Adult

1333
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:24,191
There prostitution

1334
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:27,775
Goddamn things

1335
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,823
But also

1336
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:32,127
Human trafficking is just what a lot of

1337
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:33,151
Tatoosh encharge

1338
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:33,919
Just get ended up

1339
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:34,943
Being propped up to

1340
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:40,319
Oh really yeah getting arrested are just small-time prostitutes

1341
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:41,599
Or a pimp

1342
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:44,159
That's not good

1343
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:52,607
Throat industry should be legalized I think that's a good thing

1344
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:53,631
There's to be protection

1345
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:55,935
That is not the same thing as human trafficking

1346
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:56,703
Which is

1347
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:57,471
Horrified

1348
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:58,751
Absolutely

1349
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:00,543
Everything is truly horrifying

1350
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:03,871
Complete those two together can a hundred percent

1351
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:06,431
A lot of these sites are doing

1352
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:09,759
I can't I can't say that for every single incident

1353
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:11,295
A couple of them I looked into

1354
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:13,855
This is just a run-of-the-mill prostitution

1355
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:18,719
The big point that I want to make is that you can

1356
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:19,999
Very much be against

1357
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,815
Pedophiles

1358
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:24,607
The appointment

1359
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,935
Somehow we're in that world

1360
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,215
We're in The Darkest Timeline

1361
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:32,031
S*** about

1362
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:33,567
Land

1363
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:35,615
Alex

1364
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:37,919
Tells a little

1365
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,711
It's a dinner

1366
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:43,295
Does it all God is somebody going to compliment car again

1367
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,319
No it's

1368
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:45,599
Even more insane

1369
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:49,951
The globalist the Breakaway deepstep was spying

1370
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:58,655
So good

1371
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:11,199
I want you to talk to Trump about

1372
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:14,015
Nuclear submarines for Taiwan

1373
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,719
Laker run back seat

1374
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:25,535
Here's Jones acting like he's got contacts

1375
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:30,399
That's how it works

1376
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:32,703
That's not how it works

1377
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,983
Is not hot

1378
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:41,407
He's a really bad spot something might have happened

1379
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:44,479
Is probably our submarines

1380
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:49,599
I imagine if this did happen it was someone trying to prank

1381
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:56,511
Yeah it was Intelligence agencies

1382
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:59,071
It's the intelligence community

1383
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:02,399
Hey Bixby

1384
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,167
But

1385
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,191
You do have

1386
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:06,495
To give them at least a basic level of,

1387
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:09,055
They're not going up

1388
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,127
Hey man

1389
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:18,783
You been doing any

1390
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:25,183
Best Buy you got do drugs like

1391
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:27,231
Crazy

1392
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:33,631
For someone who claims to have sources of know how things work on the inside with anything other than

1393
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:35,423
Someone

1394
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,215
Possibly it was it's just him

1395
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:39,519
Something

1396
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,799
Scourge of the entire thing

1397
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:41,823
Most likely

1398
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:44,127
I like how you use the

1399
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:47,455
The

1400
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,735
What's your big

1401
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:49,759
SWA

1402
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:51,295
I think it's

1403
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,063
That I'm just

1404
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:54,111
To genuine integrity

1405
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:58,207
So much I'm too nice I really am just such a

1406
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,231
Genuinely good

1407
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,815
Finishes up his dinner like

1408
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:06,399
If you do some role-playing but what is firing my life

1409
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,823
Wolfgang Puck

1410
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:22,271
On a weekly basis

1411
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:28,159
Try to do the job tell the truth

1412
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:34,559
Oh yeah why

1413
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:48,383
When's been blackmailed

1414
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:53,759
So that's that's basically the thrust of his eyes argument

1415
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:59,135
Flynn was doing talking to the Russian ambassador's was actually saying

1416
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:03,231
I can't talk to you about this yet

1417
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:04,511
Artfully Dodge

1418
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:09,375
The question is

1419
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,143
Absolutely

1420
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:12,447
Anybody

1421
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:18,335
Genuine to lie about what it was they talking about

1422
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:22,943
But they just asked him and he said I can't do about it so when he was asked about it

1423
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,247
You didn't think that that qualify

1424
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:26,271
Wow

1425
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,063
Which

1426
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:37,023
A thing where you're like

1427
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:37,791
Hey I think

1428
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:41,119
That might be something to report

1429
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:44,447
But it's Alex's version of the truth was real

1430
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:48,031
It's not very different

1431
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:49,311
Scenario I think

1432
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:54,175
I don't think I would be that worried about him saying something like that

1433
01:13:54,431 --> 01:14:00,575
That's not true

1434
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:01,855
Opposite of anything true

1435
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:04,159
I don't think people are so

1436
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:04,927
F******

1437
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:05,951
Boner doubt

1438
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:07,743
To make a case against someone

1439
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:10,303
That they're going to Trump up that

1440
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,351
The laziest

1441
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,119
Sting

1442
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:14,911
To also he claims

1443
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:17,471
That he knows that this is what happened because

1444
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:21,567
So he's

1445
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:23,871
He's fighting something that isn't

1446
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:24,639
Public

1447
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:27,711
These transcripts

1448
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:29,247
I do like how he describes

1449
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:30,015
Woking

1450
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:32,831
He has to deal with

1451
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:41,279
Russian with a video camera

1452
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:44,863
Just absolute Saturday anyway here is actually the roleplay

1453
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:46,399
About

1454
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:54,335
And of course the president then I guess got advised or Flint

1455
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:57,663
I bet

1456
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:02,271
The plans you said sir I don't wanna be a distraction

1457
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,999
That's awesome

1458
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:16,607
Keep advising me behind the scenes

1459
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:19,423
You have to know you can't do that behind the scenes

1460
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:26,079
It's really important that there are those things

1461
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:28,127
You can't just advise him behind the scenes

1462
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:34,783
I think it's good that he said I haven't talked to any of these people I'm just guessing

1463
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,319
I bet the way window

1464
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:40,927
Cuz if you had talked to them that this was like what was going on

1465
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:45,535
Pictures of trivial

1466
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:51,935
Against the law

1467
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:57,311
Nobody is listening to Alex Jones

1468
01:15:57,823 --> 01:16:01,919
Everybody does not care if they want

1469
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:09,087
Russian

1470
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:12,159
Russian hacker

1471
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:12,927
Teams

1472
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:16,767
Though the hacker farms and they're just all doing the the views

1473
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:21,631
Just over and over and over again

1474
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:27,263
So he was talking about

1475
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:29,311
You know selling this stuff doesn't

1476
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:34,687
Fund the operation the way you need

1477
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:36,223
I would I would like to

1478
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:36,991
2 track

1479
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:39,295
Like his tax returns

1480
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,087
It's too late for that

1481
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:42,367
It's too late for the

1482
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,903
The Republicans voted against

1483
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,695
Coronavirus tax return

1484
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:53,119
Because it's time for us to just move on we get Freedom of Information Act Alex Jones

1485
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:53,887
Night

1486
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:54,911
Not yet

1487
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:57,983
We got to wait 25 years or whatever what's Obama gets his

1488
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,031
Street soldiers out there baby

1489
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:12,063
Which is about 2 how all of this

1490
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:14,623
What's going on in the world is preparation

1491
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:15,647
For war

1492
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:18,975
And then he talked about how Marine Le Pen

1493
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:27,423
And this is for when they start a war with Russia

1494
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:36,895
Products they're saying in France they're saying in German they're saying everywhere

1495
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:39,967
In-N-Out

1496
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:42,783
I don't want anti-christian groups everywhere will you know what

1497
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:44,063
They're secretly

1498
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,343
You heard him first

1499
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,647
Russian spies

1500
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:50,975
And the state department

1501
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:51,999
Against Trump

1502
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:55,583
For good reason

1503
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,887
A Russian agent

1504
01:17:58,655 --> 01:17:59,167
Who says that

1505
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:02,751
And then they got spies

1506
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:04,543
Around the clock around the PIN

1507
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:07,615
Waiting for her to go to a cocktail party or an event and

1508
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:10,431
Shake the hand

1509
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:15,039
It's just his Wolfgang Puck

1510
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:17,343
Story again

1511
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:19,903
These arguments people are saying that she's a Russian

1512
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,231
She's a f****** fashion

1513
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:29,887
She's rushing Russians actively

1514
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:35,775
To get in the shower because it facilitates

1515
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:43,711
Someone called her she sued

1516
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:46,271
They went to court and it got thrown out of court because

1517
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:52,671
The Court ruled that your opinion and her philosophies are legally

1518
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:58,815
People are

1519
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:01,375
70 Court case

1520
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:03,167
Rita

1521
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:04,703
Excellent

1522
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:07,007
But that's that's his whole thing is like

1523
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:09,823
Russian agent

1524
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:13,919
I don't necessarily disagree with them that

1525
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:18,015
Phobic in a way that isn't

1526
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:18,783
Productive

1527
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:21,087
There are surely times where I've seen

1528
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:23,391
People say oh it's the Agents of the Russia

1529
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:25,951
Who are at fault for all kinds of things

1530
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:29,791
It's much more likely to be just basic and calm

1531
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:35,167
It was a

1532
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:35,935
Basic

1533
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:36,703
Phishing attack

1534
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:40,031
Two did was click on a link

1535
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:44,127
It was a Russian hacker put the link

1536
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:46,431
Also

1537
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:48,991
Internet

1538
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:56,159
The biggest problem with our government as it is right now is that it seems like everybody in power

1539
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,207
Googling

1540
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:03,071
People stay in power for longer than they should

1541
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:05,887
And Technology moves way faster than anyone

1542
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,703
So you end up with people in power

1543
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:13,567
Who's been there since the internet was young and how all this stuff works

1544
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,896
I don't fucken understand all this stuff

1545
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:18,176
And I've grown up with

1546
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:19,968
What Trump is a seven-year-old

1547
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:22,016
He's f***** imagine

1548
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:23,552
Every seven year old man

1549
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:29,184
They're all of their Collective internet knowledge

1550
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:32,512
Together in a golden toilet

1551
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:33,792
And that's what Trump

1552
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:39,424
How you end up reading confidential documents with a cell phone flashlight

1553
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:43,264
Crazy

1554
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,288
Look

1555
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,152
Yeah you know how they put their f******

1556
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:50,176
Phones in the

1557
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:51,456
Freezer

1558
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:55,552
Because they might just even be listening a little bit

1559
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:56,320
Pointed

1560
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:57,344
Phone

1561
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,112
With

1562
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:58,880
Flashlight

1563
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:00,672
At classifieds

1564
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:01,696
F****** doctor

1565
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:03,488
At Mar-A-Lago

1566
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:06,048
Ada public dinner with

1567
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:10,912
The Japanese prime minister prime minister man I have tape on my

1568
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:12,192
Computer's webcam

1569
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:13,728
Because that's how they can

1570
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:15,776
You can watch

1571
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:24,224
Bloom one part you 70 another part like

1572
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,248
Oh my God

1573
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:31,136
They posted a picture with a guy who

1574
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:32,928
Carries around the nucleus

1575
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,208
Football

1576
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:43,168
I'm sure they've switched it out and it's a new guy now but like

1577
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:45,984
If you are like really doing

1578
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,032
Security for the president you see someone like

1579
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:50,336
Buddying up to the nuclear football guy

1580
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:56,736
You wouldn't get that guy a waste

1581
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:59,552
That is insane

1582
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:05,952
Strangelove territory that we're getting the better of trump being allowed to use his own private

1583
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:06,720
Security instead of

1584
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:07,488
Trained

1585
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:08,256
Secret Service

1586
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:12,864
He has his own like guard around him and they don't know what is

1587
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:14,912
What is dangerous what's a leek

1588
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:16,960
What's the

1589
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:17,728
Acceptable

1590
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:20,544
It's not and it's going to get so much worse now.

1591
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,128
I mean

1592
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:27,456
Jordan it's all progress until the end

1593
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:32,320

1594
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:35,392
Avenue story for you

1595
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:36,672
So the globalist

They trying to do

1597
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:44,608
That's on God

1598
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:47,168
The first going to make you ugly and stupid

01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:51,008
Poison get you accept evil

Do you

1601
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:54,336
Because if you declare your Birthright

1602
01:22:54,592 --> 01:23:00,736
Unconscious

1603
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:03,296
Will that you don't have a

1604
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,624
Play Store

1605
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,792

01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,704
Those walking

1607
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:24,032
Everytime I look at Nancy

1608
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:24,800
Pelosi age

1609
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:27,616
Your life

What is

1611
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:32,224
Whataburger

1612
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:36,576
Usually usually

1613
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,904
Looking at his whole Satanism talk as like a

1614
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:44,000
Thinly veiled metaphor

1615
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:47,584
Where in holy war

1616
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:51,680
Cuz he does spell out some more in this next

1617
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:55,008
This is for this is

1618
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:56,544
Like left behind

1619
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,312
Novels

1620
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:58,592
Situation

1621
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,688
They're Renfield

1622
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:07,040
Dracula

1623
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:14,464
Hundred percent of Jewish

1624
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:16,256
That is definitely a Jewish

1625
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:21,888
People make fun of him cuz he looks Jewish

1626
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:24,704
Why

1627
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:27,264
Are anti-semites still allowed

1628
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,056
I don't know if he actually is

1629
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:31,872
He's subconsciously doing that

1630
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:33,664
He also said that Michael Moore has

1631
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:36,224
Not

1632
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,760

Don't accuse Jews of having that evil look

1637
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:51,328
Yeah

1638
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,888
Doesn't have to look I can't think of a reason why

1639
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:55,424
More Dracula

1640
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:57,216
Pelosi

1641
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:58,752

Totally freaked out by Washington Mall

1644
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,152
Narcissist

1645
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:06,688
Schumer

1646
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:10,272
Walk in this

1647
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,344
A Michael Morris kind of

1648
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,880
Reach Dracula level

1649
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:17,952
George soros's

1650
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:18,720
Big old

1651
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:20,000
Big

1652
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,096
They turn themselves over

1653
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:26,144
We're stopping on unit

1654
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:33,824
Honestly

1655
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:36,640
This sounds like a drunk guy to salute

1656
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:37,920
Really cool weather

1657
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:41,504
It really doesn't so he's doing

1658
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,296
Yeah cuz that has a

1659
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:49,952
Val Kilmer

1660
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:54,816
Liver that exact same monologue in Tombstone

1661
01:25:55,072 --> 01:26:01,216
Tales of Alex Jones don't worry about him

1662
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:07,872
They're probably cuz of the blood

1663
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:08,896
Oh okay

1664
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:11,200
Cuz all the blood rushes to their

1665
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:12,992
I don't I don't know

1666
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:17,344
He wouldn't say names obviously cuz that's okay

1667
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:18,880
I'm alive

1668
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:20,928
Paranoid

1669
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:26,560
They're even bigger ones in the shower

1670
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:27,584
He's picking out names

1671
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,864
But the bigger ones in the

1672
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:32,192
Confusing and worrying

1673
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:35,008
Cuz he does mention the names like Rothschild

1674
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:41,408
Modern Boogeyman talk about George Soros

1675
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:43,456
Who is over them

1676
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:45,504
And it goes back to life

1677
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,552
Conspiracy narratives As Old As Time

1678
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:49,344
Power Players

1679
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,880
You never hear their name

1680
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:53,696
They're the ones were pulling the strings are okay

1681
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:56,256
There's a hundred percent undisprovable so

1682
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,304
Let's just have fun

1683
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,864
Speculating wildly

1684
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:02,912
Bigger

1685
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:03,936
Do the bigger one

1686
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:07,776
It's very weird but

1687
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:11,360
Totally would

1688
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:15,456
Fear of God

1689
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:17,760
Ever submitting them is death

1690
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:22,368
When is death not for me not for my ego

1691
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,416
But for the species

1692
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,464
Oh I'm selfish

1693
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:28,000
I realize my life

1694
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:31,840
Like that part I

1695
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:34,144
Nowhere better than them by

1696
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:35,680
Trillions

1697
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:40,544
He doesn't know how to

1698
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:42,080
Total differences

1699
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:43,104
Ligers

1700
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:43,872
Dementia

1701
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:45,408
Complete different Paradise

1702
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:46,944
Totally different

1703
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:55,392
How often

1704
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:56,416
Is not about it

1705
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:57,440
Is ego

1706
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,744
Seems like it's a lot about

1707
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:00,768
There's a b

1708
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:02,048
Is a bit of it it's

1709
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:02,816
Feels that way

1710
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:05,120
It's difficult

1711
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:06,656
To wrestle with like

1712
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:07,424
Okay

1713
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:09,472
This guy is talking

1714
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:10,240
About

1715
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,776
Renfield

1716
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:13,056
And Dracula's

1717
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:14,848
And pick Dracula's

1718
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:16,384
End

1719
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:20,224
And he's a policy

1720
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,272
You don't like just

1721
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,808
It doesn't

1722
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:25,088
It doesn't work

1723
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:28,416
The two don't go together

1724
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:32,768
You would need real catalogs information about these here big Dracula

1725
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:37,888
Glitter vase

1726
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:38,656
Is

1727
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:40,192
Decreasing since he

1728
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:40,960
You started going

1729
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:47,360
Enjoying the ride

1730
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:48,384
Anyone

1731
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:49,408
Gurus

1732
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:53,760
I don't want to say if you've been listening to Alex for this long you're already all in

1733
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:55,552
You're just going to follow this to the end

1734
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:57,088
Austin post

1735
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:58,368
Saint conspiracy

1736
01:28:58,624 --> 01:28:59,648
Boards about him

1737
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:00,672
In the last

1738
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:01,440
Couple weeks

1739
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:02,976
And

1740
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:04,512
Unfortunately

1741
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,328
A lot of people who watch The Joe Rogan

1742
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:10,912
A lot of them more like

1743
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:17,312
You know what it was kind of slow but at the end when he started talking about transdimensional stuff that's when I realize

1744
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:18,080
Is this guy gif

1745
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:21,920
No

1746
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:23,456
Boo

1747
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:27,552
It's so I think actually he's probably picking up that

1748
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,112
Dom psychonaut

1749
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:33,184
Kind of group yeah and I'm not saying anything

1750
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,488
Be people who identify a psycho.

1751
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,048
Isaac hallucinogens are real cool

1752
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:40,864
And I support people experimenting with them

1753
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,936
And all that s***

1754
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:46,496
There's a lot of really dumb people in that group

1755
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:49,056
Yeah but fry their brains

1756
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:50,848
I think you picked up a lot

1757
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:55,456
So when he started spouting this Dracula ship they're like

1758
01:29:58,528 --> 01:30:02,112
Man

1759
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:03,136
Tire world

1760
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:04,672
He just brought in his base

1761
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:06,464
As it gets more and more crazy

1762
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,232
To the

1763
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:08,512
Did the Big Ten

1764
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:10,304
Republican ideology of

1765
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:11,584
Baby amazing

1766
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,400
Because he's using all this

1767
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:16,448
Dimensional language

1768
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:18,240
And Dracula's

1769
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:22,336
And coupling go with something that is as repugnant

1770
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:23,872
And universally hated

1771
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:27,200
Child abduction and murder

1772
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:30,528
The people who are like

1773
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:36,160
It's it's better emotional manipulation you take this

1774
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:37,440
Frazee

1775
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:39,744
Paranoid delusions

1776
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,584
A match them with a real-world issue and all of a sudden you have

1777
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,864
An argument that people

1778
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:46,912
They don't want to argue again

1779
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:50,240
Cuz you argue against his Dracula metaphor wait sound

1780
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:51,264
If you're not

1781
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:55,104
If you're not thinking it sounds like you're defending pedophile

1782
01:30:56,128 --> 01:31:02,016
It's very much like in election years for judges

1783
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:05,344
It's it statistically proven that that year

1784
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,880
They're way tougher on

1785
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:07,904
Crime that other way

1786
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:10,720
Because you don't want to be the guy

1787
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:12,000
Who is

1788
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,024
Not punishing

1789
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,304
Pedophiles enough

1790
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:18,912
Or if you if you accidentally lock somebody up

1791
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:20,192
The public isn't as

1792
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:24,800
Turned off by that is if you let someone go and then another crime

1793
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:27,872
That's interested

1794
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:29,152
Futurama joke

1795
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:31,456
Like

1796
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:33,760
Yeah

1797
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:35,296
Yuck

1798
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:37,088
Anyway

1799
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,136
This is where we're full-on in

1800
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:40,416
To where Alex

1801
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:46,304
We're not on the major broadcast so he's really allowed to go full

1802
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:50,144
Trillions and trillions of light years away from anywhere resembling

1803
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,424
Yeah

1804
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:56,032
And the rest of the clips that I have are essentially a call to action

1805
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:57,056
And

1806
01:31:57,312 --> 01:31:57,824
Furtherance

1807
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:01,664
Okay enjoy this one this one is why we actually maybe

1808
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,224
Shouldn't be all that afraid of globalist probably

1809
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:08,320
20 more years and they shouldn't

1810
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,088
Be a problem

1811
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:09,856
Jesus

1812
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:13,184
The good news is globalist can hardly reproduce

1813
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:18,304
And their disease and mental health that's why they're obsessed with technology and science

1814
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:24,960
Because by the inbreeding they have made themselves susceptible

1815
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,456
What

1816
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:38,016
What is breeding

1817
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:39,296
They've made themselves

1818
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,320
Susceptible

1819
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,136
Disease they already have

1820
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:44,672
Which is what

1821
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:47,232
Globalism

1822
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,048
Have we established an actual disease

1823
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:53,376
No but it's just trying to pair the ace

1824
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,912
Let's call all globalist

1825
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:55,680
Have pneumonia

1826
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:57,472
They're inbred

1827
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:00,544
Reasons

1828
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:03,616
Because of inbreeding inbreeding it's it's it's

1829
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:10,016
Just trying to send as opposed to being obsessed with weird creepy

1830
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:11,552
Yeah

1831
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:13,856
They can't reproduce

1832
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:15,136
Is just trying

1833
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:16,160
How to connect in

1834
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:18,976
Like it just people's intrinsic distaste

1835
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:20,256
Spur like Blue Bloods

1836
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:25,888
All the stories of the past and s*** like that

1837
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:26,656
Toxic mask

1838
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:29,984
It is all about

1839
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:33,312
For you know I should be able to fight him

1840
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:41,248
Perfect sperm in yada yada yada

1841
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:42,528
So all of those

1842
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:43,808
Emasculation

1843
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:46,112
Narratives can always come

1844
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,416
Whether it is

1845
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:51,488
But also

1846
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:54,304
Weird experimentation

1847
01:33:56,864 --> 01:34:00,704
Body glove with Dracula you see out walking around

1848
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,752
5 or 10

1849
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:09,152
Experiments they can't do it

1850
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:10,432
Complete

1851
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,024
Do they need the blind

1852
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:28,864
Metaphysical

1853
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:30,144
Everyday

1854
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:32,448
Or their God desserts

1855
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:33,984
That they're the most

1856
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:36,800
Horribly Fallen enslave people

1857
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:42,944
All they have is

1858
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:45,504
Demonic will to crush good people

1859
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:51,648
Man-o-man

1860
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,536
Call

1861
01:34:57,792 --> 01:35:00,864
Demonic wilda Crush people

1862
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,144
We have not established

1863
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:04,192
Possible win scenario

1864
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,008
Do they get rid of all these people

1865
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,568
Is soy

1866
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:15,712
The comic books

1867
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:19,040
He's driving

1868
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:20,832
Outback

1869
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:24,672
Alex Jones hazard

1870
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:31,072
Globalist wanted to be famous and there were no globalists

1871
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:34,912
What you might have been enemies

1872
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:37,728
Right that's exactly what happened

1873
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:38,496
Yemen

1874
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:41,568
A lot

1875
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:43,616
All the time but it it like

1876
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:48,736
It's so it's like we're seeing this it's so manipulative and so stupid

1877
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:51,296
Like the Royal Family

1878
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:52,832
Pyramids

1879
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:55,648
For every vampire

1880
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,440
Clearly

1881
01:35:57,696 --> 01:36:01,792
But it's not easy as not being literal except

1882
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:08,448
Let's go bring it up goddamn Renfield

1883
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:09,728
So you're really boring

1884
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:12,288
Economics and xenophobia

1885
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:17,408
Watch the movie witch

1886
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:18,176
Gary Oldman

1887
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:19,200
Disappeared

1888
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:20,480
Amazing

1889
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:27,136
Acceptance

1890
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:30,208
Disappeared

1891
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:38,144
So for every one of those used deformed

1892
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,168
Experiment

1893
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:41,728
So so again we came

1894
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:45,824
Moving back and forth from the metaphysical to the physical

1895
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:46,848
Because what is the

1896
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:48,384
Deformed experiment look like

1897
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:50,432
Do you not see it walking the street

1898
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:51,712
They're Shackled

1899
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:55,040
How many global

1900
01:36:57,856 --> 01:37:04,000
Is this never seen the movie but is this a Man in the Iron Mask

1901
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:09,888
I wrote it down before you said it

1902
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:11,680
Again

1903
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:12,960
Leonardo DiCaprio

1904
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:17,056
Disappears into the role of the Man in the Iron Mask who looks exactly like

1905
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:19,104
Not the Man in the Iron Mask

1906
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:20,896
Yeah I do

1907
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:27,296
We don't know how many globalist are those there are those Legends of kings and Royal Family

1908
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:28,576
Have the deformed child that they

1909
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:31,392
Bend Indiana correct

1910
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:34,720
I mean the result of inbreeding

1911
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:37,792
If you want a conspiracy theory that then yeah you

1912
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:40,864
You could stay

1913
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:41,888
How to create an Ultra

1914
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:42,912
Royal family

1915
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:48,544
Or do you want onions

1916
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,872
Throwing spaghetti at the wall

1917
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:53,920
Very unrelated weird

1918
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:55,200
Scary things

1919
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:56,224
Yeah

1920
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,248
Let's always doing

1921
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:58,528
It's it's

1922
01:37:58,784 --> 01:37:59,552
It's a basic

1923
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:00,576
Gestalt

1924
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:02,624
As you might put it

1925
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:03,392
Object

1926
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:05,696
Fear it's a

1927
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:07,488
I want to know

1928
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:09,024
Does he ever have

1929
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:12,352
Possibly have nose

1930
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:14,400
That's no so he is just

1931
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:16,192
Improving the s*** out of it

1932
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:18,240
Yeah he is a master improvised

1933
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:20,544
No

1934
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:21,568
Improvident

1935
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:24,384
I could do this

1936
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:25,920
You didn't know you

1937
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:27,712
You could not I could easily

1938
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:31,040
3 hours a day with this level of

1939
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:33,088
And you gave me

1940
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:35,392
Unbridled testosterone pills

1941
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:39,744
Built-in narrative that there's evil Boogeyman

1942
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,792
Around

1943
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:47,936
You give me everyday like three news stories that I barely understand it gives extrapolate on

1944
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:49,728
F*** yeah I could do that

1945
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:57,152
I think it is exactly like one of those situations where a world-class athlete

1946
01:38:58,176 --> 01:39:02,784
It looks like I said I could probably immediately compete with that

1947
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:06,880
Everybody's

1948
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:07,904
Yeah

1949
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:10,208
Effortlessly without an hour and

1950
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:10,976
40 minutes

1951
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:13,792
40 minutes exactly

1952
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:15,072
All right we could do

1953
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:16,608
First of all we could do 5-hour

1954
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:23,520
1/2 hours on our own

1955
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:29,408
And if I'm feeling like

1956
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:34,272
I got to kill 10 minutes I'll just throw it to report or something like that

1957
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:38,112
That's a t-shirt

1958
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:42,720
Yes that's a shirt

1959
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:45,536
DJ dubplates sjw

1960
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:48,352
Can't reproduce

1961
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:49,632
This makes clips

1962
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:50,400
Southwest camp

1963
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:53,472
Tubi

1964
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:54,752
Literal

1965
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:57,568
Genuinely think the globalist Contra 4

1966
01:39:57,824 --> 01:39:59,360
I literally don't know how that could be a metal

1967
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,664
There's no way

1968
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:04,992
Other than maybe the ideas that their ideology cancer

1969
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:07,040
Triplett

1970
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:09,600
Eclipse features

1971
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:12,672
Jomon like

1972
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:15,232
Swing and I couldn't do this

1973
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:18,304
3 hours a day

1974
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,608
Kizi

1975
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,656
As a performer I think he

1976
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:27,520
He's really good at this let's not interrupt this just you can enjoy what I will admit

1977
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:28,800
I couldn't do

1978
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:30,848
I've set my will against them

1979
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:35,200
I'm asking you to set your Wellness them and Trump has said his will against him as well

1980
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:37,504
At work like a laser beam

1981
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:38,272
Particle beam

1982
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:39,808
It just gets stronger

1983
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:46,464
Stronger and stronger running has focused and focus on them and be do good things in our lives to be honorable and not

1984
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:50,816
Focus on God and focus on life and focus on blue skies and Greenfield

1985
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:52,608
A little fish swimming around happy pond

1986
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:54,912
Happy Trees in this Focus

1987
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:56,192
Subatomic shelters

1988
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:59,008
Focus on them around offending them

1989
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:01,312
Thanks

1990
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:07,968
I can feel God's will

1991
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:18,976
It will fall forever

1992
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:22,048
Young about 28

1993
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:26,912
38 minutes infowars.com but this would Bellion against God will fall

1994
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:30,752
They already know they're following already know they're losers are not to take us with him

1995
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:33,568
And everybody knows that their heart hasn't been in

1996
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:35,616
I haven't been in

1997
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:37,664
Affected by it

1998
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,712
Full

1999
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:42,784
There's a reason

2000
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:45,088
You're not in every movie that's been made

2001
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:46,112
Since the 1990s

2002
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:47,648
Well I mean did you see that

2003
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:50,464
Swing from Talking Bob Ross happy trees

2004
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:51,232
2

2005
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:52,256
I think about what

2006
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:55,328
Has been crying

2007
01:41:55,584 --> 01:42:00,448
Yeah that was vengeful Wrath

2008
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:04,288
Like he's showing so many

2009
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:14,016
Jericho

2010
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:18,624
If he's actually feeling of things he's presenting he's feeling

2011
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:20,160
He's in trouble

2012
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:23,744
Ncmo

2013
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:24,512
Paranoid

2014
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:25,280
Schizophrenia

2015
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:26,560
Yeah because

2016
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:29,120
So what is it

2017
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:31,680
I don't know

2018
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:32,704
Is He-Man

2019
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:36,544
Is he some mix of the two I think he is teething

2020
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:41,664
Give tinges of paranoia and then also portable reading

2021
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:43,712
I think

2022
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:44,992
Possibly

2023
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:46,784
The most dangerous,

2024
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:47,552
Yeah

2025
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:50,624
I don't know I don't I don't think

2026
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:53,184
You could function the way he doesn't actually

2027
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,976
Vistaprint

2028
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:57,536
Too easy to function

2029
01:42:58,048 --> 01:43:02,400
Yeah we don't like to think about the idea that this big of a liar could

2030
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:03,424
Best in the world

2031
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,704
Yeah that's a good point

2032
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:07,776
But it's entirely possible that he gets off

2033
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:09,056
Berenices

2034
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:11,360
There's there's every

2035
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:13,664
Monster in the human race

2036
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:14,944
Send it seems like this one

2037
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:20,320
Costumes that are recently came out and said that he's a complete sell-out

2038
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:24,160
There's a guy who was interviewed who I used to work with David Knight

2039
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:27,488
Before he went to work for Infowars who

2040
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:33,632
He was kind of a Libertarian guy

2041
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:37,472
What's up the theory that this guy had was that they know they're in on the joke

2042
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:38,752
They know what they're doing

2043
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:43,104
Also apparently it's come out that Infowars employees

2044
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:46,944
I can't find absolute proof this but I've seen it cited a couple times

2045
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:49,760
That's a Infowars employees have signed lifelong

2046
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:50,784
NBA's

2047
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:51,552
Non-disclosure

2048
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:53,344
For the next 10

2049
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:54,368
Millionaires

2050
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:57,952
Basically

2051
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,560
It's entirely possible illegal

2052
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:08,192
You can do that you can never talk about this

2053
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,496
It's a willful entering into a contract

2054
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:11,776
That's true

2055
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:14,848
You can do it it's just sketchy as fuk

2056
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:19,968
F*** cuz it kind of implies that like if word ever gets out that we don't mean what we're saying

2057
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:26,368
It's going to be really a non-compete agreement

2058
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:27,136
Don't

2059
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:28,928
Tell that we're lying

2060
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:33,280
Goodbye goodbye

2061
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:36,352
Here is where

2062
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:38,400
This is huge encounter could my argument

2063
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:40,960
It within the next flight

2064
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:44,544
We have the technology to will the culture the spirit

2065
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:46,336
All of those things together

2066
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:48,128
To build the stairway

2067
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:52,992
What building is what does it not airing now

2068
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:59,136
Interface with

2069
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:01,952
Take it down

2070
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:05,024
When the rebel Falls it will

2071
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:08,352
That's one of the greatest mystery

2072
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:10,144
How far to go

2073
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:11,680
Because

2074
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:13,216
On this plane of existence

2075
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:19,872
Good Fight Fire With Fire

2076
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:25,504
You good wanted to be evil it would be

2077
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:28,576
Infinitely worse than what these following people who would imagine

2078
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:34,976
That's a really good one

2079
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:37,024
Because these Fallen creatures

2080
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:38,560
Party smart

2081
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:39,328
As we are

2082
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:46,240
That's a weird rationalization

2083
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:51,360
Summation of the way that

2084
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:52,640
It's kind of moral

2085
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:54,432
Society

2086
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:55,968
If you are good

2087
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:57,504
You always have to

2088
01:45:58,272 --> 01:45:58,784
The fight against

2089
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:00,064
Yeah

2090
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:01,088
You always have to

2091
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:02,368
Have a joker to fight

2092
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:04,672
Creating

2093
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:05,696
Your own evil

2094
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:06,976
Right

2095
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:08,000
That

2096
01:46:08,512 --> 01:46:09,280
We can go to

2097
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:10,560
Safari thing is

2098
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:11,840
The is the

2099
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:13,888
Reality of any kind

2100
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:14,656
Morality

2101
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:17,216
System

2102
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:18,240
It's going to require a

2103
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:19,008
Purity

2104
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:28,224
Little girl I don't like the idea that it's going to crush the Innocence there's going to be collateral damage

2105
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:38,464
Be careful about what we say like cuz we bring it into the world

2106
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:44,864
We've done maybe 10-12 episode

2107
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:53,056
Most crazy thing for him to say never

2108
01:46:57,664 --> 01:47:00,992
What I do know is that he is never stop yourself from saying something

2109
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:03,808
Unless it was intentional

2110
01:47:04,064 --> 01:47:08,160
Classify the only time he stops himself is when he's like

2111
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:12,000
Yeah

2112
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:13,792
We're going to go to

2113
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:18,656
Break this special report

2114
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:20,448
Which again was supposed to be about

2115
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:23,008
Foreign policy

2116
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:26,848
Every time we get to the end of the episode I have no idea what we

2117
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:33,248
Started the episode with and about the the article in foreign policy

2118
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:43,488
Even though it's not actually called foreign policy

2119
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:47,328
This is parting shots the report which

2120
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:57,824
I want to warn all you that are Senegal and giggling

2121
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:58,592
Solat

2122
01:47:59,104 --> 01:47:59,872
I'm out shown

2123
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:00,896
You have been warned

2124
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:02,688
You have

2125
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:03,456
Ben Warren

2126
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:05,248
You have been

2127
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:11,392
I don't want to go into vampire hold

2128
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:17,280
Fire holes or Alex Jones

2129
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:20,352
That is a Rough Rider

2130
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:27,008
F*** it why did I get born

2131
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:33,408
Seems pretty alright I would go down

2132
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:37,504
Twilight

2133
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:43,136
If we're talking literal vampires

2134
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:46,976
Maybe weird child blessing vampire

2135
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:48,768
No that's

2136
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:53,376
That's a very bad

2137
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:56,704
Empire

2138
01:48:56,960 --> 01:49:03,104
Sliding scale of morality and then you could you could be a good vampire

2139
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:05,152
K-Love

2140
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:06,176
That is

2141
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:08,992
Healthcare

2142
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:11,808
So that's the end of this special report

2143
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:15,136
Oh no no

2144
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:17,184
Couple bonus

2145
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:19,488
Clips from Tuesday's episode

2146
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:22,560
As you'll recall

2147
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:24,352
He said

2148
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:25,632
Special Report

2149
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:26,912
Witchy aired

2150
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:27,680
4

2151
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:28,704
His Tuesday show

2152
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:33,568
Yes you said he was going to read that entire foreign policy article on the show

2153
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:34,336
Yes

2154
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:35,104
And I told you

2155
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:36,128
He did he did

2156
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:37,152
But

2157
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:39,712
He keeps saying he's going to

2158
01:49:40,224 --> 01:49:41,760
Throughout the ship

2159
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:50,464
Super clip of every time he says that he said that cuz I have a nine-to-five job

2160
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:56,864
The times isolation you are slacking off

2161
01:49:57,632 --> 01:49:59,936
Sean Spicer is doing a news conference

2162
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:02,752
Go to this

2163
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:04,800
Wow you just cuts away

2164
01:50:05,312 --> 01:50:07,104
Distracted

2165
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:11,712
I have a couple of them this first one is about Fifty Shades of

2166
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:13,760
Gray the sequel

2167
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:15,552
50

2168
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:18,624
It's sort of a bad habits

2169
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:21,440
Eventually going to lead us to movies by High School

2170
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:25,792
That's what's going on in this country

2171
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:30,656
Come on top

2172
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:32,448
Bad stuff

2173
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:35,008
I need to get in there Club

2174
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:43,200
That's again his whole idea that in order to get into the elite

2175
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:46,272
Too f****** kid getting jumped into a gang

2176
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:53,184
Yeah it's basically that everyone has to have blackmail on each other also

2177
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:53,952
Doesn't work

2178
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:57,024
I don't believe it that's how the world works but

2179
01:50:57,792 --> 01:50:58,304
Beams on 10

2180
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:00,352
Is in trouble

2181
01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:07,264
That

2182
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:10,848
Their whole shindig

2183
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:13,408
Isn't it so far

2184
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:17,760
Publicly shame it's sexualizing

2185
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:22,368
Mothers and fathers are bad

2186
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:29,280
Knowing to the mothers and fathers are bad

2187
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:31,328
It's not from Arrested Development

2188
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:35,680
Now that's better boy

2189
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:42,080
Probably Sandler's 50 100 genders in

2190
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:45,408
Total societal attack

2191
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:49,760
And the intelligence agencies

2192
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:51,552
Help

2193
01:51:52,064 --> 01:51:58,208
All the weird Copic stuff that the butt

2194
01:51:59,232 --> 01:52:01,024
Different

2195
01:52:02,304 --> 01:52:07,936
About enslaving

2196
01:52:08,192 --> 01:52:14,080
That's why they've got you know Fifty Shades of Grey the new one comes out and it's more intention

2197
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:19,456
Hospital

2198
01:52:19,712 --> 01:52:22,016
And the next he'll be killing somebody

2199
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:26,624
Successive approximation

2200
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:31,488
Slap your wife on the butt

2201
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:33,792
That's fine

2202
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:37,632
They like it you like it

2203
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:39,936
All right where's this going

2204
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:43,264
Right

2205
01:52:48,128 --> 01:52:53,248
Pickup

2206
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:54,784
Summer daughter

2207
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:57,856
Want to go out with some Potbelly pedophile

2208
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:01,952
It comes knocking on your door

2209
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:09,632
They're not

2210
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:17,056
They're very much not a potbelly pedophile comes to your door and says I want to take

2211
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:18,848
Your five-year-old out on a date

2212
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:22,176
Definitely

2213
01:53:22,432 --> 01:53:25,760
Even if it's legal that's just bad parenting

2214
01:53:26,272 --> 01:53:28,320
Think about this

2215
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:29,600
To get into like

2216
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:30,368
Another

2217
01:53:30,624 --> 01:53:31,904
The nations of Renaissance

2218
01:53:32,928 --> 01:53:34,208
The Great Western cultures

2219
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:35,744
Look at Greece

2220
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:38,560
And angry

2221
01:53:39,072 --> 01:53:43,168
Only if it wasn't based in

2222
01:53:43,424 --> 01:53:48,544
If it is based in love and respect generally underage boys

2223
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:53,152
It was generally that early man on man nonsense so

2224
01:53:54,688 --> 01:54:00,064
Not doing this

2225
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:06,464
Western Civilization

2226
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:16,448
For both people

2227
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:20,288
That's a crazy swing very quick escalation

2228
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:24,896
But the other thing I want to bring up is the idea that like

2229
01:54:25,152 --> 01:54:25,920
If your kid wants to

2230
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:28,736
The fuk is Potbelly pedophile they should have the right to

2231
01:54:31,296 --> 01:54:33,344
Twice in the last week and a half or so

2232
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:37,440
Milo's talked about how when he was underage

2233
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:39,488
He f***** older dudes

2234
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,536
He was the aggressor

2235
01:54:44,096 --> 01:54:46,400
What Alex is talking about

2236
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:51,520
Right now are you making me

2237
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:52,544
Feel bad

2238
01:54:53,824 --> 01:54:55,616
So I mean it's just like it's a little

2239
01:54:56,128 --> 01:55:01,248
Going to grill him on it

2240
01:55:01,504 --> 01:55:04,320
Milo

2241
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:05,088
Commentary

2242
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:08,672
And I don't necessarily disagree with

2243
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:11,488
Criticize

2244
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:13,792
I do want to make the point

2245
01:55:14,048 --> 01:55:18,912
That Milo is a Nazi I'm all conversations

2246
01:55:19,424 --> 01:55:19,936
Don't

2247
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:22,496
Don't antagonize the good

2248
01:55:23,008 --> 01:55:23,520
I'm sorry

2249
01:55:25,056 --> 01:55:26,592
I will say it was

2250
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:32,992
A little iffy of us not to listen on the show to the thing that we said

2251
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:35,296
He made me feel so bad

2252
01:55:39,392 --> 01:55:40,160
I'll tell you this

2253
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:41,184
Susanville

2254
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:46,560
In this clip I believe Alex Jones makes the argument that science-fiction

2255
01:55:59,872 --> 01:56:00,896
Like at work Reddit

2256
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:07,296
Putting moles in everywhere I mean this is so seditious and then they tell us when they're the globalist Takeover arm

2257
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:16,000
By the way I want to say this real quick cuz one of my favorites

2258
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:17,024
Survivor pulled

2259
01:56:17,792 --> 01:56:18,560
Good get ready for that

2260
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:20,352
Okay

2261
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:25,216
But this better deliver is also further Evidence

2262
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:25,984
That Alex

2263
01:56:27,008 --> 01:56:28,288
Believes the stuff he says

2264
01:56:28,544 --> 01:56:29,056
But he doesn't believe

2265
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:32,128
Such a conundrum

2266
01:56:59,776 --> 01:57:03,616
New York Times

2267
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:06,688
Is

2268
01:57:06,944 --> 01:57:11,552
Every major culturally non-Christian

2269
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:20,256
What

2270
01:57:22,816 --> 01:57:25,888
British families

2271
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:29,984
And they

2272
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:44,064
Start developing it

2273
01:57:56,608 --> 01:57:59,168
Couldn't come up with it but they've been given the knowledge

2274
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:02,496
Thanks for the basic template

2275
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:10,944
Build

2276
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:14,528
Wait

2277
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:17,600
What's real.

2278
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:20,160
So Satan's up

2279
01:58:20,672 --> 01:58:21,440
Right

2280
01:58:22,464 --> 01:58:26,304
And he is a text to mention it to me

2281
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:29,376
Demons or whatever

2282
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:37,824
Paneling

2283
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:44,224
Force I thought we were starting with off-world entities that

2284
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:46,272
The Christians and the Jews believe

2285
01:58:46,528 --> 01:58:50,112
Appeal to the idea of like

2286
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:52,928
They believe in Satan he's a fallen angel

2287
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:55,488
So that's what we're talkin about is off-world

2288
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:59,584
Because off world is kind of very much like

2289
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:00,608
Hey you know this

2290
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:07,520
That knows our knowledge that these things are

2291
01:59:08,032 --> 01:59:11,104
Planted in the brain of h.g. wells

2292
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:16,480
No he did build a build a working time machine

2293
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:17,760
No I think we all know that's true

2294
01:59:18,272 --> 01:59:19,040
Great podcast.

2295
01:59:19,296 --> 01:59:20,320
It's very much

2296
01:59:21,856 --> 01:59:23,392
You're skipping

2297
01:59:23,904 --> 01:59:24,672
You're skipping a step

2298
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:30,048
The globalist

2299
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:32,608
Trickle this information they find all the knowledge

2300
01:59:32,864 --> 01:59:35,424
They want to tell scientist to make it

2301
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:36,960
Yes but they know

2302
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:40,032
F*** people are going to know we got this information from somewhere

2303
01:59:40,288 --> 01:59:44,896
Right there going to be free

2304
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:45,664
To write

2305
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:49,248
Stories definitely freaked out by that at all

2306
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:57,696
Demonic information about so when the public finds out about it they're ready for it because they read about it inside

2307
01:59:58,976 --> 02:00:01,280
Complicated

2308
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:05,120
We talked about Occam's razor

2309
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:06,144
Also

2310
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:09,984
Like apparently you can sign a non-disclosure for your entire life

2311
02:00:10,496 --> 02:00:14,848
Other means you brought up the time machine that's a book by h.g. Wells still don't have one of those

2312
02:00:15,104 --> 02:00:17,408
Invisible

2313
02:00:17,664 --> 02:00:19,712
For June

2314
02:00:20,224 --> 02:00:22,016
Programming

2315
02:00:22,272 --> 02:00:23,296
Invisible Man

2316
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:26,880
We haven't War of the World

2317
02:00:27,648 --> 02:00:30,976
I don't know the rest of HG Wells bibliography but

2318
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:32,256
I think you got the highlights

2319
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:37,120
I think none of them have been invented anyway espoused

2320
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:38,656
Hugo's moron this

2321
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:40,192
The end of my clip

2322
02:00:40,704 --> 02:00:41,472
Description is just

2323
02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:42,240
Alakazam

2324
02:00:50,944 --> 02:00:57,088
UFOs

2325
02:00:58,880 --> 02:00:59,904
The other dimensions

2326
02:01:01,184 --> 02:01:07,328
Movie Pacific Rim

2327
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:10,656
Energy of motion

2328
02:01:12,448 --> 02:01:13,728
So wait that was real

2329
02:01:16,544 --> 02:01:19,104
Dinosaurs

2330
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:21,408
Cuz that would be way more fun

2331
02:01:23,456 --> 02:01:25,504
That talk to top psychiatrist psychologist

2332
02:01:37,792 --> 02:01:41,376
It was in the days of men

2333
02:01:41,888 --> 02:01:45,728
The seed was it clean because they

2334
02:01:49,824 --> 02:01:50,592
That's in the Bible

2335
02:01:53,408 --> 02:01:58,272
All the come up.

2336
02:02:10,048 --> 02:02:12,352
I think he was saying there at the end the dinosaurs are free

2337
02:02:14,144 --> 02:02:20,288
Vicky Eddie Bravo this c.s. Lewis

2338
02:02:20,544 --> 02:02:22,848
Off this planet Trilogy right there

2339
02:02:23,872 --> 02:02:25,920
I don't I don't know

2340
02:02:26,176 --> 02:02:28,224
God dammit

2341
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:33,344
I don't know book series of

2342
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:34,624
Science fiction novels

2343
02:02:35,136 --> 02:02:36,416
Which were

2344
02:02:36,672 --> 02:02:37,696
Weird

2345
02:02:37,952 --> 02:02:40,512
Let you know how the

2346
02:02:40,768 --> 02:02:43,584
Availed

2347
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:45,888
Allegories

2348
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:47,168
This one

2349
02:02:47,424 --> 02:02:48,704
Is even more better

2350
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:52,032
That's basic

2351
02:02:52,288 --> 02:02:54,336
That's pretty much what he was just describing right

2352
02:02:54,848 --> 02:02:56,384
Also

2353
02:02:56,896 --> 02:02:59,200
What the f*** was he just describing right there

2354
02:02:59,712 --> 02:03:01,760
I'm not going to do this cuz I Clips really long

2355
02:03:02,016 --> 02:03:02,784
But I most wanted list

2356
02:03:03,296 --> 02:03:06,624
Kind of do too I still don't understand what it was

2357
02:03:07,136 --> 02:03:07,904
So-so

2358
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:13,280
We're not billions of years old I think we can establish that

2359
02:03:13,792 --> 02:03:14,816
Right so

2360
02:03:15,072 --> 02:03:16,096
Has he made that noise

2361
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:20,192
Even way back when

2362
02:03:20,704 --> 02:03:23,008
People were genetically

2363
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:24,032
This TV

2364
02:03:24,288 --> 02:03:25,568
Cuz there were giant people

2365
02:03:25,824 --> 02:03:28,896
Moving like 2,000 years old

2366
02:03:31,456 --> 02:03:33,248
He is referencing the

2367
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:34,784
The flood which is only about fourth

2368
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:41,184
Thousand Years lyrics

2369
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:44,512
Again in the Bible

2370
02:03:45,792 --> 02:03:49,888
Lucifer the Fallen Angel there's no devil couple of verses

2371
02:03:50,144 --> 02:03:53,984
The talk about like a Angels came down and bread with human women

2372
02:03:54,496 --> 02:03:55,520
There was an abomination

2373
02:03:58,080 --> 02:03:59,872
There are a couple of

2374
02:04:00,384 --> 02:04:02,176
Weird verses in the Old Testament

2375
02:04:02,432 --> 02:04:03,200
That could be

2376
02:04:03,712 --> 02:04:04,224
Well because

2377
02:04:05,504 --> 02:04:11,648
Could be metaphorical also

2378
02:04:12,416 --> 02:04:12,928
F****** Giants

2379
02:04:14,464 --> 02:04:20,096
Terrible lizards

2380
02:04:20,352 --> 02:04:21,632
Say that

2381
02:04:24,448 --> 02:04:25,984
Giants are probably why we have

2382
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:41,344
They would still be right above the water they still be able to breathe because that last exactly

2383
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:43,392
Snorkel

2384
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:48,256
They can't tread water is

2385
02:04:48,512 --> 02:04:52,096
True facts if there's anything you take away from our podcast it is better

2386
02:04:52,352 --> 02:04:55,424
Giants can't tread water

2387
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:57,472
Okay

2388
02:05:01,312 --> 02:05:05,152
I just reverse engineer that the study didn't read the writings and watch what they're doing

2389
02:05:05,664 --> 02:05:11,040
But

2390
02:05:11,552 --> 02:05:12,832
I'm not saying I believe any of it

2391
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:14,624
Or

2392
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:21,536
Western Society

2393
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:26,912
Absolutely hate women

2394
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:29,472
Global estate women

2395
02:05:29,728 --> 02:05:30,496
Wawa

2396
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:33,568
Okay so one that dinosaurs

2397
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,872
Only 6,000 years old

2398
02:05:36,384 --> 02:05:37,920
Because of that

2399
02:05:38,176 --> 02:05:39,712
Because of that we know

2400
02:05:40,224 --> 02:05:43,040
That Western Society is opening its doors to Islam

2401
02:05:46,112 --> 02:05:47,648
Because they hate Christianity

2402
02:05:48,672 --> 02:05:49,696
And I hate women

2403
02:05:50,720 --> 02:05:51,744
Does the guy

2404
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,536
Call that woman sweetcakes

2405
02:05:53,792 --> 02:05:56,864
Aggressively

2406
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:04,032
Yeah

2407
02:06:04,288 --> 02:06:05,312
So but like

2408
02:06:05,568 --> 02:06:10,432
I want I think that's f****** crazy

2409
02:06:10,944 --> 02:06:12,480
I don't believe

2410
02:06:12,992 --> 02:06:19,136
Using that word for minutes

2411
02:06:19,392 --> 02:06:20,928
Was either they believe this

2412
02:06:21,184 --> 02:06:22,208
And they're insane

2413
02:06:23,232 --> 02:06:24,768
Or they're just insane

2414
02:06:29,376 --> 02:06:30,400
Fort I mean

2415
02:06:34,752 --> 02:06:38,848
If you had One Moment of clarity guys

2416
02:06:39,104 --> 02:06:45,248
I don't know if I actually believed it.

2417
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:47,552
Colonel Kurtz

2418
02:06:47,808 --> 02:06:48,576
He dead

2419
02:06:48,832 --> 02:06:54,976
My own supply line I don't f****** know anymore

2420
02:06:56,512 --> 02:06:57,280
It's blue

2421
02:06:57,536 --> 02:07:01,632
Bone pill

2422
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:12,384
It's like you see how far you can get before people like uniformly

2423
02:07:12,640 --> 02:07:14,432
Shut the fuk up

2424
02:07:14,688 --> 02:07:18,016
Is there is there high performance trolling

2425
02:07:18,272 --> 02:07:18,784
That's that

2426
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:20,576
Is there is there anyone

2427
02:07:20,832 --> 02:07:22,112
Do you think there's any line

2428
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:24,672
No

2429
02:07:24,928 --> 02:07:28,768
No it we're already past multiple dimensions

2430
02:07:29,024 --> 02:07:30,304
Vampires are real

2431
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:37,216
Everybody on his side

2432
02:07:37,472 --> 02:07:38,496
Yeah dinosaurs

2433
02:07:40,544 --> 02:07:41,568
Maybe.

2434
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:44,384
Transmission

2435
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:45,920
How the globalist

2436
02:07:46,176 --> 02:07:47,712
Technology from the dead

2437
02:07:50,528 --> 02:07:51,296
What is

2438
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:52,832
What is there left

2439
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:56,416
Only

2440
02:07:56,672 --> 02:07:58,208
Turning it into a Nazi Oregon

2441
02:07:58,976 --> 02:08:00,256
Like really

2442
02:08:00,512 --> 02:08:01,280
Weird

2443
02:08:01,536 --> 02:08:03,840
It's not on the edge

2444
02:08:04,608 --> 02:08:08,704
No way into not the organization

2445
02:08:12,544 --> 02:08:13,824
I don't think

2446
02:08:14,592 --> 02:08:15,360
I don't know how much

2447
02:08:15,616 --> 02:08:16,896
It was audience with following

2448
02:08:17,408 --> 02:08:17,920
Guys

2449
02:08:18,944 --> 02:08:19,456
Got to be honest

2450
02:08:20,736 --> 02:08:22,016
You know what you're right

2451
02:08:22,272 --> 02:08:25,600
You're right I think a good percentage would but I think you'd lose

2452
02:08:29,696 --> 02:08:32,512
No because yeah I think you're right

2453
02:08:32,768 --> 02:08:34,560
Because he does go out of his way to be like

2454
02:08:35,072 --> 02:08:37,888
What was it what was it that he said that

2455
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:44,288
Trouble going to build factories in Black areas I don't know what it was

2456
02:08:45,824 --> 02:08:47,360
Is that a good thing

2457
02:08:51,712 --> 02:08:54,272
He's harkening back to the idea that Trump knows

2458
02:08:54,528 --> 02:08:56,832
Is that inner cities need

2459
02:08:57,088 --> 02:08:59,392
More jobs and I will fix everything and that you're going to

2460
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:00,160
Again

2461
02:09:00,672 --> 02:09:01,440
Not not

2462
02:09:01,696 --> 02:09:06,560
Just black people live in inner cities very much true also reductive in terms of what the actual issue

2463
02:09:10,656 --> 02:09:14,240
He's saying that like he's a racial Justice Warrior when it's

2464
02:09:17,568 --> 02:09:18,080
Not a fan

2465
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:19,616
But like

2466
02:09:20,384 --> 02:09:22,176
I can't get away from this

2467
02:09:22,432 --> 02:09:22,944
Yes

2468
02:09:23,456 --> 02:09:25,248
The argument that he's putting forth

2469
02:09:25,504 --> 02:09:27,296
About satanic forces

2470
02:09:28,064 --> 02:09:29,856
Giving of the globalist

2471
02:09:30,368 --> 02:09:34,208
Their information

2472
02:09:34,464 --> 02:09:36,512
Then fed to HG Wells

2473
02:09:37,536 --> 02:09:39,584
That's not what the globalist believe

2474
02:09:40,096 --> 02:09:41,120
He believes that

2475
02:09:42,144 --> 02:09:44,960
He believes that based on his quote on quote research

2476
02:09:45,216 --> 02:09:47,008
Is reverse engineering

2477
02:09:47,264 --> 02:09:47,776
Which is

2478
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:49,312
Sure

2479
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:55,968
That is he saying I don't believe this is what they believe

2480
02:09:56,480 --> 02:09:59,040
Anything else is

2481
02:09:59,808 --> 02:10:01,344
That was the one that week

2482
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:02,368
Point

2483
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:04,928
You really believe that today

2484
02:10:05,184 --> 02:10:07,744
It's part of that last text

2485
02:10:08,256 --> 02:10:11,328
And if you try to dodge the idea that

2486
02:10:12,352 --> 02:10:12,864
Do you know

2487
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:14,656
Satanic forces exist

2488
02:10:15,424 --> 02:10:17,216
They can influence people in these

2489
02:10:17,984 --> 02:10:21,824
Is global real

2490
02:10:22,336 --> 02:10:23,616
Invicta

2491
02:10:24,128 --> 02:10:26,944
He literally think he believes that Satan

2492
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:29,248
Technological advances

2493
02:10:29,504 --> 02:10:31,296
He has to believe

2494
02:10:31,552 --> 02:10:33,344
That what they believe is real

2495
02:10:35,648 --> 02:10:37,696
I don't know what the other options

2496
02:10:39,488 --> 02:10:40,512
That's what that

2497
02:10:40,768 --> 02:10:41,280
Just like

2498
02:10:41,536 --> 02:10:43,840
Just like just like

2499
02:10:57,664 --> 02:10:59,200
That is the tagline to this park

2500
02:11:04,832 --> 02:11:05,856
No there's no wait no

2501
02:11:07,136 --> 02:11:07,648
That one's not

2502
02:11:09,952 --> 02:11:16,096
I have one more clip and it's from an hour and 40 minutes into Tuesday's episode

2503
02:11:16,352 --> 02:11:21,216
1/2 hours into you finally gets into the article

2504
02:11:22,752 --> 02:11:25,568
He finally gets into

2505
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:29,152
Oh no actually you don't you already know

2506
02:11:30,944 --> 02:11:32,992
I'm going to go with he manages to make it

2507
02:11:34,016 --> 02:11:34,784
He interrupts

2508
02:11:35,296 --> 02:11:36,064
In the first time

2509
02:11:37,344 --> 02:11:38,112
He makes it

2510
02:11:38,368 --> 02:11:38,880
Total

2511
02:11:39,136 --> 02:11:39,648
Through

2512
02:11:39,904 --> 02:11:40,672
Four sentences

2513
02:11:40,928 --> 02:11:41,440
Maximum

2514
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:49,888
Making a mistake I caught it before David Knight comes out

2515
02:11:50,144 --> 02:11:51,936
Starting to worry about Trump

2516
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:56,544
About that is communication the world

2517
02:11:57,056 --> 02:11:59,360
Actually Spanish

2518
02:11:59,616 --> 02:12:05,760
I'm sorry if I interrupted it but it does quite a bit about that

2519
02:12:06,016 --> 02:12:07,040
Okay

2520
02:12:07,552 --> 02:12:09,856
CenturyLink

2521
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:18,304
What's the 2017

2522
02:12:20,864 --> 02:12:22,400
A revolution of the past

2523
02:12:22,656 --> 02:12:28,800
They say they're for the first

2524
02:12:31,872 --> 02:12:34,432
Read any of the actual article

2525
02:12:34,688 --> 02:12:37,504
I read that first paragraph

2526
02:12:38,528 --> 02:12:39,040
Revolution

2527
02:12:39,552 --> 02:12:43,136
The hundred-year I mean him just now

2528
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:46,208
Interrupted with his own commentary

2529
02:12:46,464 --> 02:12:48,000
1.4

2530
02:12:48,768 --> 02:12:52,352
Was a secret Ally of Alexander Shelton

2531
02:12:53,376 --> 02:12:56,192
Minnie Mouse

2532
02:12:56,448 --> 02:12:58,496
Communism

2533
02:12:58,752 --> 02:13:00,544
If you want to

2534
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:06,944
Become a superpower at least wrong

2535
02:13:10,016 --> 02:13:10,528
They're all great

2536
02:13:10,784 --> 02:13:11,296
Great

2537
02:13:12,832 --> 02:13:13,600
Hey how about

02:13:17,696 --> 02:13:22,048
Beat your wife yeah I know I saw that

2540
02:13:22,304 --> 02:13:26,400
Globalists job Christian all of the all of these globalist

2541
02:13:26,656 --> 02:13:28,448
Making it illegal to beat your wife

2542
02:13:32,288 --> 02:13:33,568
They're the opposite of Hollywood

2543
02:13:34,592 --> 02:13:35,872
Hollywood knows it

2544
02:13:36,384 --> 02:13:42,528
Christianity coming back there it's real and all the Cold War brain washers don't want people to believe the proof of what

2545
02:13:42,784 --> 02:13:43,296
What's happening

2546
02:13:57,888 --> 02:14:00,448
As a result of the Electoral victory of Donald Trump

2547
02:14:00,704 --> 02:14:02,752
Rebelution

2548
02:14:06,080 --> 02:14:07,616
Irrational each that's not true

2549
02:14:09,152 --> 02:14:13,760
Completely free market model

2550
02:14:14,016 --> 02:14:14,784
Now there wasn't

2551
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:15,808
You don't think so

2552
02:14:16,064 --> 02:14:20,160
Well I know he transitioned into the words of the article because those were not

2553
02:14:22,208 --> 02:14:23,488
Spider-Man 3 tenses

2554
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:25,280
But hate that he is like that

2555
02:14:25,792 --> 02:14:26,560
True

2556
02:14:30,912 --> 02:14:32,448
Trousseau

2557
02:14:32,704 --> 02:14:35,520
Narcissistic

2558
02:14:35,776 --> 02:14:39,104
He's actually hardcore revolutionary

2559
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:40,128
What song is this

2560
02:14:55,232 --> 02:14:58,560
The focus on his disturbingly

2561
02:14:59,072 --> 02:15:03,168
Vindictive simplistic narcissistic insecurity

2562
02:15:03,424 --> 02:15:05,728
Yeah that's a really good idea

2563
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:09,056
Exception being made for those conspiracy theorists

2564
02:15:13,408 --> 02:15:16,480
Like Alex Jones

2565
02:15:16,992 --> 02:15:18,272
He's worse

2566
02:15:18,528 --> 02:15:19,040
CIA agent

2567
02:15:26,208 --> 02:15:26,720
Spelman

2568
02:15:27,488 --> 02:15:32,864
Revolutionary

2569
02:15:33,120 --> 02:15:37,728
And that's the secret then they go on and say Russia they're going to CDC

2570
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:41,824
Come on come on you don't really want to do this

2571
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:43,360
He's going to take over

2572
02:15:44,384 --> 02:15:47,200
Facts about snow cones in hell

2573
02:15:48,224 --> 02:15:49,248
Everybody wants one

2574
02:15:51,552 --> 02:15:52,576
Snow cones in hell

2575
02:15:53,088 --> 02:15:59,232
Jeffrey the globalist the free yourself from the globalist everybody wants one it's like selling snowballs in hell

2576
02:15:59,488 --> 02:16:00,768
In order to

2577
02:16:01,024 --> 02:16:03,072
Okay now I get that

2578
02:16:04,096 --> 02:16:08,192
Reading

2579
02:16:08,448 --> 02:16:09,216
But the important

2580
02:16:09,728 --> 02:16:10,496
Were there I think

2581
02:16:10,752 --> 02:16:11,264
Reviews

2582
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:15,104
That is a true self as a revolutionary insurgent

2583
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:16,640
Anthony

2584
02:16:17,152 --> 02:16:20,224
Himself as anything other than

2585
02:16:20,736 --> 02:16:21,248
A big baller

2586
02:16:22,016 --> 02:16:22,784
Small Trump

2587
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:23,808
Where am I

2588
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:28,160
Could be generous perhaps

2589
02:16:28,416 --> 02:16:28,928
Protective Circle

2590
02:16:29,184 --> 02:16:31,232
We belong in the classic revolutionary Playbook

2591
02:16:31,488 --> 02:16:33,536
His shocking off style of executive action

2592
02:16:33,792 --> 02:16:35,328
Is designed to rattle

2593
02:16:35,584 --> 02:16:36,096
Sketches Pony

2594
02:16:36,352 --> 02:16:36,864
Unprepared

2595
02:16:37,888 --> 02:16:38,400
To wage war on

2596
02:16:39,936 --> 02:16:41,472
That's a fair assessment

2597
02:16:41,728 --> 02:16:47,872
To keep people on their toes and my nephew are dealing with Congress

2598
02:16:50,944 --> 02:16:54,016
Yeah but what he says is called

2599
02:16:54,272 --> 02:16:56,832
The Kremlin is starting to be worried about Trump

2600
02:16:59,136 --> 02:17:05,280
Call I'm sure they are the other

2601
02:17:05,792 --> 02:17:06,560
Russia

2602
02:17:06,816 --> 02:17:12,960
Never talks about the American government ever why would they

2603
02:17:15,008 --> 02:17:16,032
The fear of color Revolution

2604
02:17:16,544 --> 02:17:20,384
They understand better than Americans and Europeans the radical nature of political change

2605
02:17:23,456 --> 02:17:24,992
Describe

2606
02:17:25,504 --> 02:17:28,064
And the revolution

2607
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:30,112
The Germans allowed to go on with

2608
02:17:30,368 --> 02:17:32,416
The Bolsheviks

2609
02:17:32,672 --> 02:17:33,952
How

2610
02:17:34,464 --> 02:17:37,024
The conversation with Russian

2611
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:39,840
Indicate they're starting to have similar fears and doubts

2612
02:17:40,096 --> 02:17:40,608
Today

2613
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:43,168
About the revolution that Trump is going

2614
02:17:44,448 --> 02:17:46,752
Baba baba baba

2615
02:17:47,264 --> 02:17:49,568
Celebrating

2616
02:17:51,104 --> 02:17:52,128
Of course I work now.

2617
02:17:52,384 --> 02:17:54,432
Doesn't our political Elites in Moscow.

2618
02:17:54,688 --> 02:17:55,200
Cheering

2619
02:17:55,456 --> 02:18:00,320
They believe that they recognize that position has become abruptly and agonizingly

2620
02:18:01,600 --> 02:18:04,928
It's true that trumps Ascension opens up the possibility of normalizing Russia

2621
02:18:05,184 --> 02:18:05,952
His relations with the West

2622
02:18:06,464 --> 02:18:08,256
Beginning with a reduction or even elimination

2623
02:18:08,512 --> 02:18:09,024
Directions

2624
02:18:09,536 --> 02:18:11,072
It also validates a lot of rushes

2625
02:18:11,328 --> 02:18:11,840
Ideological

2626
02:18:12,096 --> 02:18:13,376
Criticisms of the liberal order

2627
02:18:13,632 --> 02:18:15,168
They may perhaps or Shadow policy

2628
02:18:17,984 --> 02:18:19,776
Such as the Cold War

2629
02:18:20,032 --> 02:18:20,800
Alliance

2630
02:18:21,056 --> 02:18:21,568
Breaking up

2631
02:18:24,384 --> 02:18:25,152
Do you know what I did

2632
02:18:25,408 --> 02:18:27,712
Consider until just now while you're reading

2633
02:18:28,992 --> 02:18:32,576
Ventnor adopted this is boring although you did say that off

2634
02:18:33,856 --> 02:18:35,392
He just told me that this was boring

2635
02:18:35,648 --> 02:18:37,952
No I didn't consider it

2636
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:41,024
Yeah we got to go

2637
02:18:41,536 --> 02:18:44,864
I didn't actually consider that maybe at this point Russia's think

2638
02:18:45,632 --> 02:18:47,936
This is going to blow up in our f****** faces

2639
02:18:48,448 --> 02:18:51,264
I know what this article is about

2640
02:18:51,776 --> 02:18:54,080
Looking at what's going on

2641
02:18:54,336 --> 02:18:55,616
When going down

2642
02:18:55,872 --> 02:18:57,152
Has to be the one where they're like

2643
02:18:57,408 --> 02:18:58,176
We did not see

2644
02:18:58,944 --> 02:18:59,456
Oh s***

2645
02:18:59,712 --> 02:19:02,272
Yeah that is a big ocean

2646
02:19:02,528 --> 02:19:06,880
But illusion is also ushering in a period of turmoil and uncertainty

2647
02:19:07,392 --> 02:19:09,952
Including the hood of self-defeating War

2648
02:19:11,744 --> 02:19:12,256
Disintegration of the

2649
02:19:14,048 --> 02:19:15,072
Present leadership

2650
02:19:15,328 --> 02:19:16,608
Has no appetite for globulin

2651
02:19:16,864 --> 02:19:17,376
Instability

2652
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:27,104
A little bit later about how

2653
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:29,664
Because Trump is erratic

2654
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:32,224
Unpredictable it's taking away that as a

2655
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:32,992
The tool that Putin

2656
02:19:33,248 --> 02:19:36,320
Continues also because he was the one who would

2657
02:19:36,576 --> 02:19:38,368
Like go around normal tree

2658
02:19:40,672 --> 02:19:42,464
You can't use that as as heavy a punch

2659
02:19:42,720 --> 02:19:43,744
He created a monster

2660
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,304
Robux

2661
02:19:46,560 --> 02:19:47,328
Unless

2662
02:19:48,608 --> 02:19:49,376
He actually

2663
02:19:49,632 --> 02:19:53,728
Really then puts into question whether or not

2664
02:19:53,984 --> 02:19:55,008
He really has black

2665
02:19:55,264 --> 02:19:55,776
Metal Terrier

2666
02:19:56,032 --> 02:19:57,568
Because right now

2667
02:19:57,824 --> 02:19:58,848
It's on his way

2668
02:19:59,104 --> 02:20:01,920
Maybe not in the short-term

2669
02:20:02,176 --> 02:20:03,968
Well we haven't lifted the sanctions

2670
02:20:04,224 --> 02:20:04,992
No

2671
02:20:05,248 --> 02:20:06,272
No sew

2672
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:08,320
Do you think I would be a calamity

2673
02:20:11,904 --> 02:20:16,512
No I don't know so so the stated objective for Putin I think

2674
02:20:17,024 --> 02:20:17,536
Not

2675
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:29,568
Did you create that in

2676
02:20:29,824 --> 02:20:30,336
Disability

2677
02:20:30,592 --> 02:20:31,360
In America

2678
02:20:32,128 --> 02:20:35,456
That way he can dismantle or at least pick up

2679
02:20:35,712 --> 02:20:36,736
The part of the EU

2680
02:20:37,504 --> 02:20:41,344
That will give him the opening to then create a grievance outside of the

2681
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:45,184
The only possible in Game of creating chaos in our political system

2682
02:20:46,976 --> 02:20:53,120
Retaking the Soviet Union because Putin's is really just kind of nostalgic but that's almost exactly what we

2683
02:20:53,376 --> 02:20:56,704
We speculated 10 episodes back

2684
02:20:57,216 --> 02:20:58,752
It based on

2685
02:20:59,008 --> 02:21:00,544
What you're reading right now

2686
02:21:01,568 --> 02:21:02,592
It seems like

2687
02:21:03,360 --> 02:21:04,640
That's not going according to

2688
02:21:04,896 --> 02:21:05,920
2 plan

2689
02:21:06,944 --> 02:21:07,712
The blade

2690
02:21:11,808 --> 02:21:16,416
But

2691
02:21:16,672 --> 02:21:18,464
Solid quality with our our

2692
02:21:18,976 --> 02:21:23,584
I'm going to talk about

2693
02:21:24,864 --> 02:21:28,960
So they're going to kill Trump

2694
02:21:29,216 --> 02:21:32,032
Yeah the only thing I can base it on is this next line

2695
02:21:32,288 --> 02:21:32,800
Okay

2696
02:21:33,056 --> 02:21:37,408
What the what the Kremlin fears most today is the Trump may be ousted or even killed

2697
02:21:38,688 --> 02:21:40,480
That's the only line that has anything to do with it

2698
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:48,416
Is it that would be a bad outcome

2699
02:21:48,672 --> 02:21:53,792
His outdoor Kremlin insiders argue is

2700
02:21:54,048 --> 02:21:54,816
Some campaign in washing

2701
02:21:55,072 --> 02:21:59,424
Therefore

2702
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:00,192
Success

2703
02:22:00,704 --> 02:22:03,520
This seriously restricted Russia's geopolitical options

2704
02:22:06,592 --> 02:22:07,104
Russia

2705
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:09,152
To discredit and possibly impeach Trump

2706
02:22:09,408 --> 02:22:11,456
Well Republican Elites want to use Russia

2707
02:22:11,712 --> 02:22:12,480
To deflate and

2708
02:22:12,736 --> 02:22:13,248
Blind drop

2709
02:22:13,504 --> 02:22:16,064
The Russian government fears not only

2710
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:19,136
Of course but also the possibility that he could opportunist

2711
02:22:19,392 --> 02:22:21,696
Quickly switch to a tough anti Moscow line

2712
02:22:21,952 --> 02:22:22,464
In order to make

2713
02:22:22,976 --> 02:22:24,512
Republican leaders in Congress

2714
02:22:25,792 --> 02:22:27,840
That's what's in this article

2715
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:29,632
Really

2716
02:22:33,472 --> 02:22:34,240
No matter how much

2717
02:22:34,496 --> 02:22:39,360
Think about foreign policy which I kind of really think about it a lot

2718
02:22:39,872 --> 02:22:42,432
Is constantly reminding me that

2719
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:44,224
This game

2720
02:22:44,480 --> 02:22:46,784
Is so ridiculously complex

2721
02:22:48,576 --> 02:22:52,928
Yes Trump's presidency has also complicated moscow's relations with China and Iran

2722
02:22:53,440 --> 02:22:56,512
Check on Scout is interested in normalization with away

2723
02:22:57,024 --> 02:23:00,864
But not at the cost of joining a coalition

2724
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:04,704
Which Trump seemed insistent on creative

2725
02:23:05,984 --> 02:23:06,752
220 million Muslim

2726
02:23:07,264 --> 02:23:11,104
And therefore cannot indulge in the radical antithesis

2727
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:12,128
Holyshit

2728
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:13,152
Yeah

2729
02:23:13,408 --> 02:23:13,920
This is

2730
02:23:15,456 --> 02:23:16,992
Yep

2731
02:23:18,272 --> 02:23:20,576
You're looking at

2732
02:23:21,088 --> 02:23:22,112
If Russia

2733
02:23:22,368 --> 02:23:25,184
So they did have an influence on the election there's no denying

2734
02:23:25,696 --> 02:23:31,072
Yes but this article even whatever they're talking about that talk about

2735
02:23:31,328 --> 02:23:32,352
Clear what kind of

2736
02:23:32,608 --> 02:23:33,888
Definitive role they played

2737
02:23:34,144 --> 02:23:40,032
Or if the influence they had was decisive

2738
02:23:40,288 --> 02:23:43,360
Whether or not it was a deciding or or whatever it was

2739
02:23:43,616 --> 02:23:45,152
This article would argue that

2740
02:23:45,408 --> 02:23:48,992
They were Putin was mostly against the idea of Hillary

2741
02:23:49,248 --> 02:23:50,272
Because she was against

2742
02:23:50,528 --> 02:23:51,808
His actions in Ukraine

2743
02:23:52,064 --> 02:23:58,208
And white

2744
02:23:59,232 --> 02:23:59,744
Yeah

2745
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:03,072
Mayweather

2746
02:24:03,328 --> 02:24:08,960
Too strict is the the worst thing

2747
02:24:09,216 --> 02:24:11,520
What's going to happen when you push a little button

2748
02:24:11,776 --> 02:24:13,568
Because now there are ten million

2749
02:24:13,824 --> 02:24:15,360
Scenarios that might wind up happening

2750
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:17,408
Agree

2751
02:24:17,664 --> 02:24:21,504
If which it seems enough

2752
02:24:22,016 --> 02:24:22,528
MP

2753
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:24,320
Probably

2754
02:24:24,576 --> 02:24:26,624
It will almost

2755
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:28,160
Because of his ties to Russia

2756
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:32,768
Bad guy

2757
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:34,304
Yeah it's it's

2758
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:37,376
Read.

2759
02:24:41,216 --> 02:24:43,264
Coming out today of

2760
02:24:43,776 --> 02:24:44,288
Russian

2761
02:24:44,544 --> 02:24:45,056
Fighter plane

2762
02:24:45,312 --> 02:24:46,336
Buzzing are shipped

2763
02:24:47,616 --> 02:24:50,432
War games

2764
02:24:50,688 --> 02:24:56,320
Testing

2765
02:24:57,088 --> 02:24:59,136
Yeah I don't want to be the end result

2766
02:24:59,392 --> 02:24:59,904
I think

2767
02:25:00,160 --> 02:25:04,000
If we could all just go back to him a maintaining of what was going on

2768
02:25:04,256 --> 02:25:06,304
3 months ago maybe it would be pretty cool

2769
02:25:06,560 --> 02:25:08,608
How how crazy is it

2770
02:25:13,472 --> 02:25:16,800
The Declassified

2771
02:25:17,056 --> 02:25:17,568
Information

2772
02:25:18,336 --> 02:25:18,848
I don't know if it's

2773
02:25:19,360 --> 02:25:20,896
But it's information that snout

2774
02:25:21,664 --> 02:25:23,200
Where there was a

2775
02:25:23,968 --> 02:25:25,248
U.s. military

2776
02:25:27,552 --> 02:25:28,576
Training exercise

2777
02:25:29,856 --> 02:25:34,208
That showed up on Russia's intelligence report

2778
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:36,768
As being exactly like what would happen

2779
02:25:37,024 --> 02:25:38,048
If America was launching a

2780
02:25:38,816 --> 02:25:40,864
They sent the order

2781
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:42,144
We're Italian

2782
02:25:42,912 --> 02:25:46,752
And it was because of one dude on the on the button

2783
02:25:47,008 --> 02:25:47,520
Stickley who is like

2784
02:25:48,288 --> 02:25:49,568
Let's hold back and wait

2785
02:25:49,824 --> 02:25:52,128
That we don't have a massive nuclear war

2786
02:25:52,384 --> 02:25:54,176
Yeah

2787
02:25:54,432 --> 02:25:56,480
Like you go back he got a medal and

2788
02:25:56,736 --> 02:25:59,040
Ronin to Siberia never to be heard from again

2789
02:26:01,856 --> 02:26:02,624
Comes

2790
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:09,024
So it seems like that we're one p**** hair away from destroy

2791
02:26:09,792 --> 02:26:10,816
All the time

2792
02:26:11,328 --> 02:26:14,144
Let me wrap up this article

2793
02:26:19,776 --> 02:26:21,056
This display is pretty address

2794
02:26:23,104 --> 02:26:26,688
Anyone who spends any time in Moscow discover that ordinary Russia

2795
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:29,248
In contrast with a majority of European

2796
02:26:29,504 --> 02:26:31,296
Feel surprisingly positive about Trump

2797
02:26:31,808 --> 02:26:33,600
What reason does the fairy exist

2798
02:26:33,856 --> 02:26:34,624
It rushes confer

2799
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:35,648
Temptation with the West

2800
02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:37,440
Another is that they share Trump

2801
02:26:37,696 --> 02:26:40,768
Cynical borderline apocalyptic view of international politics

2802
02:26:41,024 --> 02:26:44,352
They never believed

2803
02:26:45,888 --> 02:26:47,168
Most interesting lie of all

2804
02:26:47,424 --> 02:26:49,984
They readily compare Trump to an early Boris Yeltsin

2805
02:26:50,496 --> 02:26:52,032
Impulsive

2806
02:26:52,288 --> 02:26:53,568
Trusting only of his family

2807
02:26:53,824 --> 02:26:55,872
If that works

2808
02:26:56,128 --> 02:26:57,152
Does the mattress hold on power

2809
02:26:57,664 --> 02:26:58,688
The problem for the Kremlin

2810
02:26:59,200 --> 02:27:00,992
Is it Yeltsin was a revolutionary leader

2811
02:27:01,248 --> 02:27:03,040
And Putin has decided to make 27

2812
02:27:03,296 --> 02:27:03,808
15 year 4

2813
02:27:04,064 --> 02:27:05,856
Deploring not celebrating Revolution

2814
02:27:07,136 --> 02:27:09,696
Which goes back to the beginning of the article when he's talking

2815
02:27:10,208 --> 02:27:12,000
About the Bolshevik Revolution

2816
02:27:13,792 --> 02:27:17,888
To tie the end back to the beginning of a foreign policy

2817
02:27:18,144 --> 02:27:20,960
Free stuff and it's kind of your in the weeds a little bit like that article

2818
02:27:21,216 --> 02:27:23,008
The ability to bring the end back

2819
02:27:23,264 --> 02:27:25,568
The beginning first of all I tip my hat that's good right

2820
02:27:25,824 --> 02:27:26,848
And then second

2821
02:27:28,128 --> 02:27:28,640
I mean like

2822
02:27:29,152 --> 02:27:35,296
When do you know anybody says but like it's deploring obviously that's a little bit of a tip of the cap to the deplorable

2823
02:27:37,344 --> 02:27:37,856
Blair

2824
02:27:38,112 --> 02:27:39,904
Very well written

2825
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:42,720
Avoids my most

2826
02:27:43,744 --> 02:27:44,512
Thing that happened

2827
02:27:44,768 --> 02:27:45,280
The news right now

2828
02:27:45,536 --> 02:27:46,048
Especially a penny

2829
02:27:46,304 --> 02:27:48,352
Bulshit

2830
02:27:49,888 --> 02:27:52,448
At no point in time does that article ever go with

2831
02:27:52,704 --> 02:27:58,848
Trump's own particular brand of populism or whatever it is right right right because that's the laziest

2832
02:27:59,104 --> 02:27:59,616
Dumbest thing you can say

2833
02:28:00,128 --> 02:28:02,176
It's a shortcut for you're an idiot

2834
02:28:02,688 --> 02:28:03,968
And that article

2835
02:28:04,224 --> 02:28:04,992
Well research

2836
02:28:05,248 --> 02:28:07,296
Point-by-point has really good analysis

2837
02:28:07,552 --> 02:28:08,832
I have nothing to do

2838
02:28:09,088 --> 02:28:10,112
Is that Alex has a

2839
02:28:10,368 --> 02:28:11,136
It's great writing

2840
02:28:11,648 --> 02:28:12,160
That's really good

2841
02:28:15,744 --> 02:28:17,536
This

2842
02:28:19,584 --> 02:28:21,888
You find it in

2843
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:28,544
Magazine no matter what

2844
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:31,616
It was written by

2845
02:28:32,128 --> 02:28:33,152
Relationship

2846
02:28:33,664 --> 02:28:34,176
Okay

2847
02:28:34,688 --> 02:28:35,456
But yeah

2848
02:28:35,712 --> 02:28:36,480
Good job

2849
02:28:38,272 --> 02:28:41,856
From the bottom of our tiny tiny podcast

2850
02:28:44,416 --> 02:28:45,952
I mean

2851
02:28:46,208 --> 02:28:46,720
Juno

2852
02:28:47,232 --> 02:28:49,792
This is just yet another example of

2853
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:51,072
You know

2854
02:28:51,328 --> 02:28:52,608
I am taking a source

2855
02:28:52,864 --> 02:28:56,448
He created an entire Special Report

2856
02:28:56,704 --> 02:28:57,216
From the flag

2857
02:28:57,472 --> 02:28:58,240
Patrick Flynn

2858
02:28:59,008 --> 02:29:05,152
Didn't say what he said it's

2859
02:29:05,408 --> 02:29:06,688
Used as a deflection

2860
02:29:06,944 --> 02:29:08,224
From his main man

2861
02:29:08,480 --> 02:29:09,248
Michael Flynn

2862
02:29:09,504 --> 02:29:11,552
Having to resign so we didn't have to talk about that

2863
02:29:11,808 --> 02:29:17,440
Yeah except about the transcripts and what Michael Flynn actually did

2864
02:29:17,696 --> 02:29:21,792
Two genuine analyzed

2865
02:29:22,048 --> 02:29:22,560
Not

2866
02:29:22,816 --> 02:29:23,584
Because he was

2867
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:26,144
Maybe you're doing anything wrong

2868
02:29:26,656 --> 02:29:28,448
Cuz he's a martyr for the cause

2869
02:29:28,704 --> 02:29:34,848
This without talking about it for 35-40 minutes in the Special Report

2870
02:29:35,104 --> 02:29:41,248
Write about it without actually getting into it

2871
02:29:41,504 --> 02:29:45,856
Science fiction is an Illuminati

2872
02:29:46,112 --> 02:29:46,880
Rumsey

2873
02:29:47,392 --> 02:29:50,976
Fantasizing about Dracula's and lasciviously talking about

2874
02:29:51,488 --> 02:29:53,280
Pornographers and child murderers

2875
02:29:53,536 --> 02:29:55,840
I hope you're not on his side you're for them

2876
02:29:56,352 --> 02:29:59,424
It's Insanity as much

2877
02:30:01,472 --> 02:30:03,776
It's like a like imagine there's a bullseye

2878
02:30:04,288 --> 02:30:06,336
On one side of your wall like a dartboard

2879
02:30:06,848 --> 02:30:07,360
With Mike

2880
02:30:07,616 --> 02:30:08,128
Michael Flynn

2881
02:30:08,896 --> 02:30:09,920
Right now

2882
02:30:10,176 --> 02:30:11,456
108

2883
02:30:11,712 --> 02:30:13,248
180°

2884
02:30:13,504 --> 02:30:17,600
And throw all of the spaghetti you've ever seen deer entire life with the wall

2885
02:30:18,112 --> 02:30:19,648
And just hope people don't look at that

2886
02:30:19,904 --> 02:30:20,416
F****** dark

2887
02:30:20,928 --> 02:30:22,976
The evidence is not crazy

2888
02:30:25,024 --> 02:30:25,536
That mean

2889
02:30:26,304 --> 02:30:27,328
I don't know how you'd pull

2890
02:30:27,584 --> 02:30:29,120
That level

2891
02:30:29,632 --> 02:30:30,912
Of not dealing with it

2892
02:30:31,936 --> 02:30:33,216
If you are crazy

2893
02:30:33,472 --> 02:30:35,776
Denial be like

2894
02:30:36,032 --> 02:30:38,592
You have to be intentionally dodging s*** or else

2895
02:30:38,848 --> 02:30:39,616
Yep that's right

2896
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:46,784
Jordan has been fun trip through Tuesday's event on
