00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,064
Put it out on Twitter so I guess he denied that there was anything going on

10
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,600
Could not have

00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:34,208
That lot over the phone yet but yes earlier today we had a very

17
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:39,072
Congenial conversation

18
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,864
Complicated

19
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,400
It's not alright

20
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,984
And then if they're like

21
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,384
Do that the Senate votes it's very simple but it's complicated

22
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,272
If it does happen they're going to be like

23
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,040
No no no

24
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:02,112
And it won't happen because the Republicans are f****** coward

25
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,904
Even he fuc

26
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,304
He knows because Haler

Larry Nichols like you said he agreed to talk to us for an hour

30
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:33,344
He also said I think your offer was half an hour I also predict is going to hang up with

31
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,488
Pretty quick is he is going to try and worm his way out of

32
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,512
Literally every

33
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:45,376
Well

34
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:50,752
And here is Larry Nichols right now guys

35
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,336

You are right on time I friend

38
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:17,888
Real quick before we even get into this there's one thing that I do want

39
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,424
Tucanos

40
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,704
Upfront

41
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:27,360
Which is questions about your past with the clintons and a lot of the

42
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,384
Claims that you've made

43
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,992
You've said a lot of things that are

44
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:34,784
Andrew

45
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,856
So what we'd like to do is

46
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:43,232
Just have a conversation where you feel comfortable telling us what it what really happened

47
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,048
And all of those things is that okay with you

48
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
Excellent

49
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:54,496
What work did you do for for Bill Clinton

50
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,256
The largest

51
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,543
Gotcha

52
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,879
I was thinking I was thinking Doogie Howser but that's fine

53
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,655
Started working for Bill what year was that

54
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,263
76

55
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:37,151
Okay and then how did that turn into your jobs for Bill

56
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,519
Call Neva

57
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,119
Little Rock

58
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,959
Sorry Justin Bieber

59
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
And what was that

60
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,055
It was a 70

61
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,103
It was the 70s

62
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,983
So in the very first meeting you had with Bill Clinton

63
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,287
Bill told you

64
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,103
That he likes to screw around basically

65
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:35,071
So why did you why did you start working for him then if that was that

66
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
Money

67
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,079
Yeah so are we working

68
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,159
Political world lyrics

69
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,207
This is killing me

70
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,799
So did you function as his campaign managers in

71
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:54,431
And this was during the first time he was governor of Arkansas

72
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,759
He did not become

73
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,807
Governor contiguous leash

74
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:03,647
He lost the second time and then became Governor again

75
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,927
In 83

76
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
Nat1

77
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,007
Whatever you're that watches

78
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:43,327
Song b**** Don't listen

79
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,647
Who are who are the

80
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
People from Vietnam

81
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,335
Okay so you went to work

82
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,359
4 bill

83
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,919
Then you went to work for Frank White

84
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,479
And then you went back to work for Bill

85
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,487
Okay

86
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,559
La Thoma

87
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,415
To build build sold out

88
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,583
So Bills sold out basically in 82

89
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,351
Okay

90
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:31,263
Okay so then you stopped working for Bill in 1988 why did that have

91
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,639
When you're when you were working in the marketing department of the Arkansas Finance Development Authority

92
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,319
Where's the Nicaragua

93
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,599
Resistance

94
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,391
Haha

95
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,143
El Rancho

96
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,295
What what

97
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,063
Racket

98
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,815
So did you actually go to Vietnam

99
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:32,703
Doing crazy stuff in the jungles Nicaragua Nicaragua

100
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:38,079
Okay could you could you tell us a little bit of that crazy stuff

101
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,551
How did how did Reagan put you down in Nicaragua

102
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,391
You didn't you didn't stop working for Bill until 1988

103
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:27,135
New York whatever

104
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:47,359
Okay so if I understand this correctly

105
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,431
You had a jingle business

106
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,455
And then

107
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:57,855
Directly from there you were recruited into extrajudicial Nicaraguan operation

108
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,439
That's wild

109
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,999
But how in God's name

110
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,815
Did the Stephen

111
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,631
The did the Stephens Brothers have something to do with that

112
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,687
I need one of their guys

113
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,503
Truth or dare

114
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
You got understand

115
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:53,151
Okay so here's the here's the problem I have with that

116
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
Is that

117
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:58,527
Is there interest make sense or whatever that's fine but the ideas

118
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:03,135
Like they would have you take care of all of their interests based on

119
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,463
A slight bit of advertising work seems very strange

120
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:12,863
Yeah that's like if Obama had the guys from the Sonic commercials kill run I ran for awhile

121
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,263
Wild

122
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,015
Is just a job

123
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,575
Alright

124
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,159
So so because of that

125
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:44,095
24/7 once he got elected

126
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:19,167
All right that that sounds a little bit far-fetched

127
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,287
I mean it's okay

128
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,567
So

129
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,103
Alright alright let's

130
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
I mean

131
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,663
That bananas

132
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:36,575
If it's true that is one of the most implausible realities I think I can imagine

133
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:42,719
Fair enough fair enough

134
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:47,583
The public version in all the information

135
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:51,167
Verifiable through Source reports

136
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,495
I wear that you work there at the Arkansas

137
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,543
Financial Development Authority

138
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,079
And that you made a bunch

139
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:01,663
Long distance calls to Nicaragua and that's why bill

140
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,943
Ask you to resign

141
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,271
So

142
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,719
How is it how is it that

143
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:21,119
All of this reporting corroborates one side of the story and only you is supporting yours

144
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,727
Today

145
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:34,175
Fox News

146
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,247
There is

147
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:55,167
We're all the adults do you got to take everything with a grain of

148
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:59,007
Adults

149
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,823
The only world I have to deal with

150
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,639
Nicaragua

151
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,175
Well yeah but

152
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,391
Arkansas

153
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,888
Washington

154
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:04,800
What should I say

155
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:13,760
You went on a radio show in claims you kill people for the Clinton

156
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,552
What's that

157
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,832
You were drugged up

158
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:23,232
So

159
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,040
Ashoka

160
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,928
Children

161
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,456
Okay The Killing was metaphorical

162
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,136
OK Google

163
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,744
Saying that you made stuff up then

164
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,536
I mean

165
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:07,936
That kind of makes it hard to believe what you're saying right do you see the DCd

166
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,312
That's fair

167
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,872
I truly believe that yes

168
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:22,016
I barely really care what I believe

169
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:37,888
We're not trying to come down we're not

170
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:02,208
So if

171
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,512
If you admit to having made up

172
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,328
Whenever there wasn't any information

173
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,984
Would you say that when you said that Barack Obama is a secret Muslim you made that up to

174
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,384
What I did

175
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,736
Okay so when did you stop

176
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,952
When your family told you that you were getting too old

177
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,256
Call mrs. at Triad

178
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
Right

179
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:28,736
Sure sure sure

180
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,024
Right

181
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,824
Dish

182
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,992
Crazy

183
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:07,392
Well it's also I mean all this stuff is great

184
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,352
Airstrip

185
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:33,760
Trump from where I'm from where I'm sitting Larry just seems very convenient that you're bringing that into all of this

186
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:37,088
When you admit that you were involved in Nicaragua

187
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,880
You know it seems like you're

188
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:42,976
Maybe

189
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,112
Right

190
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:15,232
Now here's here's my here's my question to you real quick before you keep going any further

191
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,792
Now when you are

192
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,328
Describing this story

193
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:23,424
This is happening at the same time that you are convicted of fraud

194
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:30,080
And it was

195
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:33,920
By deception they were facing charges all around Arkansas

196
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:37,760
And

197
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:44,416
That was before that this was that in the lead-up to when you were

198
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:48,768
Alright

199
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:53,888
Beaver Lake

200
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:05,152
That's that's fine that's fine Clinton as some sort of all all night

201
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:08,480
Towing power that can just black people at at will

202
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:11,040
Don't you don't you see how this kind of

203
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,112
Conspiracy just doesn't hold up

204
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:19,488
Especially because you're also saying that it's Brothers

205
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:39,456
Okay well then we'll then let me

206
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,736
Let's switch gears then

207
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,016
So

208
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,112
Just recently in 2015

209
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:51,232
You told Alex Jones that Obama was the last

210
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,304
Because if you're the last president

211
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,424
Yes

212
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,216
Why do you think that's true

213
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,072
Washington last 25-30 years

214
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:37,312
Into a state

215
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,368
When the president

216
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,968
Santa Clara

217
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,576
That's demonstrable be untrue

218
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,304
I don't know I don't know

219
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,584
Yeah I live in Chicago

220
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,192
No yours in Washington

221
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,032
Show me show me

222
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,640
State congressman

223
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,064
I've read a lot of these

224
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,880
FEMA camp in the FEMA documents

225
00:31:55,136 --> 00:32:00,000
I've read a lot of those all of all of those FEMA documents are public information

226
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:04,864
So you're saying that there's a secret documents that we don't know about

227
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,424
Additional

228
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,216
Government

229
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,056
Temperature

230
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:34,304
Is there people that run around and they say they know

231
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,928
I think we're just basing this on

232
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,232
Things we've read

233
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:09,632
Things that we understand that the president becomes king and all the Congress people become do

234
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,960
It's just very fanciful it doesn't

235
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:17,312
That's not how the world works

236
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,968
Roughly 250,000 dollars

237
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,744
Well yeah all they want is tax cuts for the rich

238
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:43,680
Kimani that's not in their salary

239
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:50,080
Considering parachute they're taking on consulting jobs later on

240
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,616
Some sort of

241
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:54,176
Feudal society that they're trying to build

242
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:24,384
I bet

243
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,248
That's a good point

244
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,808
I think everybody's pretty aware

245
00:34:55,872 --> 00:35:00,992
Well we're going to talk about the cost of things

246
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,040
Would you

247
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:08,160
Would you say that right now part of your income if not a lot of it

248
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,952
Comes down to

249
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,000
You know people

250
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,536
Believing what you're saying

251
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,640
Also

252
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:36,320
You know we have job

253
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:41,440
We have nine-to-five jobs in a couple of jack off to pick were funny

254
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,792
Larry

255
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,272
Right

256
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:10,880
Well then here's my question

257
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:16,256
Okay if you are afraid of Obama trying to become the last president

258
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,792
And they're becoming King

259
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:22,144
Essentially are you not worried about Trump doing that

260
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,240
Okay

261
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,288
So would you say that Trump is

262
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,360
So here's the thing I want to know

263
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,944
Knowing what we know about Trump and his actions currently

264
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,992
It seems far more likely that

265
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:37,760
Trump is

266
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:41,088
Going to try and pull that off it is if it is real

267
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,624
Then Obama ever was

268
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,952
Right because he's not a secret movie

269
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:52,352
Oheka Castle

270
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:05,664
If it's becoming King is part of the FEMA provisional powers

271
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,712
It's the reason babe

272
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:14,112
FEMA as it is right now after these hurricanes we've seen that they don't do the best job necessarily

273
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:19,232
They're not necessarily the most effective organization that we have within our government

274
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:22,560
It seems like installing a kingship

275
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,608
Might be difficult when they can't

276
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,656
Get supplies where they need to be

277
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:30,496
And then you need the support of the military

278
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:34,848
They would have to turn against the entire concept of democracy

279
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,424
Wow

280
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,824
Washington

281
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,592
Any goddamn money

282
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:12,480
Believe me when I say if there really were a rainy day fund

283
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:16,576
He would have

284
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:51,392
A long way away from having a FEMA provisional

285
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,696
Government very very different

286
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:05,216
Very close to being a

287
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,784
Percent of the people in this country

288
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,344
I'm sure of that

289
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,648
I believe that a hundred percent

290
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:43,616
You can you can if you'd like to we say f*** all the time

291
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:46,688
Alright

292
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:51,296
Now we're on board

293
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:54,112
So here's here's another

294
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,136
Here's another question

295
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,928
For you all right

296
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,256
When you when you go on Alex's

297
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,424
You willingly go along with the the whole globalist idea how much of that do you actually believe

298
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:24,576
Roaches

299
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,264
It's good you lucked out on that one

300
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:52,224
What would you do talk about one time was that you believe

301
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,528
Hillary Clinton practice black magic

302
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,232
Which was

303
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,384
Isn't that troopergate

304
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,224
Whatever

305
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:34,976
Designing Women

306
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:38,816
Lovett great show

307
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,544
Quick follow-up

308
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:54,175
Can a Witness church quick follow-up

309
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:59,551
Linda bloodworth-thomason from Designing Women was there

310
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:03,647
Did Delta Burke ever go or Meshach Taylor

311
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,463
I'm curious I like that show and I was a kid

312
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,791
Yeah

313
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:13,119
I was just asking if Meshach Taylor ever went to the woods Church

314
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,655
With Hillary

315
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,751
You there

316
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:24,639
I'm sorry about that a little bit of issue it's just

317
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,687
Really really quick

318
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:27,711
I mean

319
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:30,527
Here's here's my last question to you

320
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:41,791
Yes

321
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,687
Call Cuzzo just

322
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:03,551
So just cause more attention to come your way that's not a good argument

323
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:10,463
I think you're I think that's probably save might have better use of their time in the same way

324
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:13,791
You did threaten to Blackmail Congress recently

325
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,583
And no one's going to sue you for that

326
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,447
Congress people have a much better use of their time

327
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,495
Been hunting down these sort of

328
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:25,311
Lawsuits that probably could be one based on

329
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:30,175
It being very

330
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:35,807
Sure

331
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:36,575
Oh

332
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:43,231
Right information that you would otherwise use to Blackmail them would then become public

333
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,023
Yes it would

334
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:49,375
Larry Larry

335
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:53,983
If that argument work no one would ever get charged with blackmail

336
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,871
Here's something you can do

337
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:02,943
Okay

338
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,183

00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,071
Blackmail him

340
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:33,663
Biker witches

341
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,479
Maybe whatever

342
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:39,807
Alright

343
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:57,727
I think you're I think we have a misunderstanding of what our goals are and

00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:04,127
Isaac thank you for talking to us I think we got to get a move on

Yeah the issue and the issue becomes too like

352
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:39,199
So much stuff is is completely undisprovable

353
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:45,599
And that whole idea of you had to be there at the wild 70th and Arkansas switch

354
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:51,999
It's like in the 70s people or blackmailed people do cocaine in the south

355
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:58,399
There's all that sort of stuff and it's like alright fine that's the narrative obviously wasn't in the 70s

356
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:03,263
Arkansas it's very difficult to get around the

357
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:07,871
You were a functionary low-level adman and then you got put in charge

358
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:11,455
Of drug running and gun-running operations in Nicaragua

359
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:16,319
And the youngest president ever is Handler like it's just all

360
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,623
Lake and his rebuttal to that is just

361

00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,207
Do you know what's crazy

365
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:26,815
Guy who wrote badabababa

374
00:46:54,463 --> 00:47:00,351
Yeah I know but I couldn't really get anything and there's there's like follow-ups and rebuttals I would have liked to make end

375
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:06,751
It's just incredibly difficult timeline works out

376
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:10,591
But I know he was doing after he got fired from the Clinton campaign

377
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:13,151
There's literally no way any of that stuff matches up

378
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,711
You started working with a guy named Larry case

379
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,527
Been trying to sell stories about these women

380
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,319
To tabloid papers

381
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:24,671
Larry case recorded all of his conversations and gave them to the Press

382
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:27,231
After he and Larry Nichols had a huge falling out

383
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:31,327
I will put a link up later to Salon article about this

384
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,375
It's it's fascinating like

385
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:40,543
You're never going to get what you want out of a phone call like that my biggest issue there is

386
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:45,919
Why don't we just we just let him ramble and that might not be the best thing ever but I got a little bit of a cold

387
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:48,991
I was I was really hoping that if we

388
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:49,759
Like

389
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:54,367
I was hoping that it sooner or later he would drop

390
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,647
The facade

391
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,671
Because why

392
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:59,743
Because they can't f****** keep doing that

393
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,535
We know it's not true

394
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:05,887
He genuinely believes that though so I guess I guess of course there's no point in

395
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:12,543
And doing that s*** piece of s*** clearly killed people in Nicaragua

396
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,823
Or whatever the f*** you want

397
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,383
What's a belief if you have lights

398
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:20,735
30 years of follow-up or 30 years of building in

399
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:25,599
You know this narrative that it's going to be very difficult for you to

400
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,367
To give it up

401
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:33,535
I think I think that you just lived inside that now and I don't want to

402
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:36,607
You know it's crazy it's not my interest

403
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:40,191
I don't I don't

404
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,983
I obviously don't believe

405
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,031
Most of that and now your name is just

406
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:48,895
Apparently in the chat room

407
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:53,503
Yeah

408
00:48:54,271 --> 00:49:00,415
Now that we have a thoroughly unsatisfying interview with that piece of s***

409
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:06,815
Glad we did it and I wish we were pushed a little bit

410
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:10,399
It's always going to be different

411
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:12,959
You know I having a conversation with

412
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:13,983
Someone who is

413
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:18,335
You know pretty well-versed in marketing and propaganda has a lot of experience in it

414
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:24,735
And you know could you see the way he kept trying to butter us up the same way that

415
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,503
I love you guys

416
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:31,903
And you can believe what you want to ignorance is always not very

417
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:35,999
Cuz like

418
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:40,351
Time-in out is what it is

419
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,399
Jingle business

420
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:45,471
To a huge player in Nicaragua

421
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,751
Is f****** banana

422
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:54,943
A bit more detail that's been less

423
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,967
Which is

424
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,527
My guess is

425
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:03,135
That is something that he heard or read one time and a mystery novel

426
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:08,767
Hangout with Hangouts VFW Hall

427
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:15,167
Yeah exactly the first clip from Today Show

428
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,447
Episode

429
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,727
It was a boring show

430
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,543
Alex's just out on a whole big

431
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:26,943
Hey I've been totally right about everything responsibility

432
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:27,967
Being right about everything

433
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:32,575
I'm going to turns out to the Mandalay Bay Hotel

434
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:35,391
Timeline

435
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:38,975
That the police are suggesting now is not maybe you accurate

436
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:42,815
Spokespeople come out

437
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:46,143
Just the timeline that says that the guys shot at

438
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:48,191
Security guard

439
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,727
6 minutes before you open

440
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,263
Bonfire B not be accurate

441
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:56,127
Bright and the reason that they might be saying that is because that's the shooting

442
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:58,431
Their company is

443
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,711
Brialee imploding

444
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:01,759
And one of the reasons is because

445
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,039
Seems unsafe

446
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:09,695
And the idea that the shot a security guard in six minutes elapsed and then he starts shooting everybody only

447
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:15,839
Feeds into that collapsed spiral that the business is going

448
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,631
I don't agree with a narrative

449
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,167
Even if they have no evidence

450
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,959
That's the case right

451
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:21,727
PR move

452
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:22,495
Alex

453
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:29,151
Anyway here's a clip where we're going to start about

454
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:35,807
Guaranteed

455
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,135
But that's what they're all like in Hollywood it's not a crystal ball

456
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:48,863
Directions

457
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:52,703
Phrenology

458
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,431
In there

459
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:04,991
Not criminals LifeLight

460
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,295
15 different types

461
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:11,135
You just learn the group's

462
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:13,951
How wild hog acts have a whitetail deer racks

463
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:15,487
How Puma axe

464
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:19,839
Relax gif

465
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,375
Palafox at

466
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:25,215
The way you are out

00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:33,663
I want to give Millie a children and innocent

468
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,199
Young beautiful women

469
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:44,415
Using the bathroom on the floor

470
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,487
All you want that song

471
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:50,559
Call me God

472
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:52,095
Get on the ground

473
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:54,911
Call Dad.

474
00:52:55,167 --> 00:53:00,031
Weinstein

475
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:04,383
What I do on the ground you understand

476
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:23,327
Really enjoying that too much

477
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:29,215
I mean Harvey Weinstein

478
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:35,615
Falafel stop

479
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:40,479
He's like hey it is bad whenever women are more like

480
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:47,135
It's only bad whenever Hollywood

481
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:50,463
Glitches be like it's not about putting them on a pedestal

482
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:54,559
It's almost as if he believes like you just make him calm everything will be fine

483
00:53:55,071 --> 00:54:01,215
That's like version of misogyny

484
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,239
Read them that poorly

485
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,519
So long as you're like

486
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:10,175
Worshipping them at the same time at all

487
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:16,575
Talking about worshiping poop and what-have-you which makes me real thrilled to learn we learn in this next clip

488
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:18,367
About to

489
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:23,231
Everyone hates Trump

490
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:27,839
Message my oldest daughter yesterday so I should thirteen-year-old sweetheart

491
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:38,079
Watch

492
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,151
Have you watch any of that

493
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,711
What do you watch

494
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:45,247
She goes

495
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,271
Will you

496
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:50,111
Oh no

497
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,975
Sure

498
00:54:57,023 --> 00:55:02,911
Across the street the high schoolers

499
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:08,031
Paparazzi

500
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:10,847
Cameras

501
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:20,063
I can literally go out in Austin

502
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:26,463
Watching Angelina Jolie or Morgan Freeman

503
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:32,863
Angelina Jolie

504
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:39,263
Morgan Friedman

505
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:43,103
I'm not bragging it's probably mean

506
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:48,479
I feel self-conscious about how hard I'm bragging

507
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:54,879
Look I'm not going to get a camera and prove the kids mob me everywhere I go

508
00:55:56,927 --> 00:56:00,255
Harvey Weinstein shooting on the floor and then making snuff films with ladies

509
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:04,095
You should not have twelve-year-old listening to that

510
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:04,863
Even

511
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:08,959
Critiquing in breaking down what he talked about I don't want twelve-year-old Livengood

512
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:12,799
I'd be horrified if I went to school ever

513
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:13,823
No

514
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:20,223
We got it we got to teach them young no turning power how else do we get the win them off the scat play

515
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:25,599
They have the internet now we got to we got to explain that it's bad

516
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:29,439
Someone took

517
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,231
Vetta it's shocking

518
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:37,631
But he can still talk to his kids at this point

519
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:42,751
Allowed to use clips of the show and the trial

520
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:45,567
It's court ordered that I go to

521
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:48,383
Psychology meetings every two weeks

522
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,431
With my

523
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:53,503
Daughters

524
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:58,111
Your f****** your kids like that don't do that

525
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,135
I don't have to go

526
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:01,695
I perfect

527
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:07,071
There's nothing wrong with me

528
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:11,167
Narcissism the horrible things that I put everyone around me through

529
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,567
What happened

530
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:21,151
Walking to psychology places

531
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,687
Psychology

532
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:24,223
Walking out

533
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:30,111
Young daughter and a son

534
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:33,439
Another day love David

535
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:38,815
Already. What is that why they're in the psychology place they like

536
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:45,471
Love that night is when he says which is which is the dead ringer

537
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:49,311
No one brings that up in public

538
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,079
Appreciate

539
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,871
I go sit down

540
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:53,919
My daughters are inside for an hour

541
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:00,063
15 year old girl comes and sits down

542
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,231
Researching

543
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,535
No option

544
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:12,607
And she looks at me

545
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:16,191
How much do Noah Troyer right now on this app

546
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:18,239
Not true

547
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:24,639
That is the Nicaragua of

548
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:40,511
I didn't talk to the fifteen-year-old girl cuz she was on a company's like that

549
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,535
Predator

550
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,095
Nah

551
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:50,495
Leave people alone in public is leaving her alone is worth

552
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,103
It's time to play

553
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:58,943
It's weird if you talk to someone in public if they're not alone

554
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:00,479
Then I think I think that

555
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:03,039
Definitely true

556
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:06,879
It's it's weird not true story

557
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:09,951
But it is it's not I don't think it's wrong

558
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:10,719
It's just

559
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:13,535
Strange part of your fantasy life Alex

560
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,631
Incredible

561
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:20,703
It's amazing

562
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:31,711
Where the future are where are we

563
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,759
The point is

564
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:37,855
They are the past they know they've delap

565
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:46,047
He's basically saying that he's the future while saying I don't know where the future

566
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:49,119
I'm just saying everybody else is in the past

567
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:58,591
Do you think his kids listen to the show

568
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:04,991
The show

569
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:08,063
Tell me how much they loved Infowars

570
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:09,855
Keeps going

571
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:12,415
I and I

572
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:15,487
There's even more

573
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:18,047
Give three examples

574
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:31,359
Almost

575
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:39,551
But the statistics show what I just told you

576
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:44,927
Show my children go to school so they wash it was in there

577
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:52,095
I also don't forget that like the school from Fame but for Infowars they're all dancing down the street and then the

578
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:08,223
Is it all the kids at my kids school listen to the show

579
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:09,247
He's dumb

580
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:14,879
To the first rebuttal he could come up with all my kids go there so they must watch it all at school

581
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:21,279
Jim the classes because

582
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:23,839
Not a chance

583
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:27,423
Also if you were if you were Alex Jones kids

584
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,727
There is no way that you would want

585
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:36,383
People at your school to know you were Alex Jones if it was bad enough being me

586
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:42,783
In high school the computer teacher at my elementary school

587
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:49,183
Roodle music Jeremiah Elementary School

588
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:58,143
Terrified.

589
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:03,007
The light in person or it's a tragedy everywhere I don't know what the reality is

590
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:09,919
Young people and they see me at the mall River

591
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:14,527
Literally the living me

592
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:16,319
Home Depot

593
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:17,599
Park Slope

594
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:18,879
Hispanic

595
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:22,207
Executive class in Spanish

596
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:34,495
Girls

597
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:41,151
We've even got business classics

598
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:46,527
Let me tell you something

599
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:53,183
None of that priority boarding

600
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:56,767
The mall slack-jawed at their senior living me

601
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:02,911
It's really pretty hard

602
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,447
Quite a bit about

603
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:13,151
Which is a little bit too long for me to have been an out-of-context drop but I wish it would have been

604
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:15,711
Because this is f****** this is delightful

605
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:18,015
Domination

606
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,807
I'm control

607
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:24,159
Lyndon Baines Johnson is it on record

608
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:27,231
What hold cabinet

609
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:29,535
He took extended

610
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:31,839
Incredibly stanchfield

611
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,399
Dumps

612
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:56,415
Passed the Civil Rights act as well as Medicare and

613
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:05,887
Subtle differences to holding cabinet

614
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:06,911
Forcing women to do today

615
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:10,239
Our presidents have been almost universally

616
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:12,287
Course

617
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:18,175
It takes one help towards you deserve power

618
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:21,247
It seems like

619
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:24,063
Much smarter people than me have said this

620
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:29,695
It should be a picture

621
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:32,255
Anybody who wants to

622
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:35,071
It's indicative but there's something wrong with you

623
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,607
I'm so

624
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:40,191
This is a little bit more about Lyndon Baines Johnson

625
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:43,775
Then we've got to get to a failed prediction that I made last night

626
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:47,871
Hollywoodism

627
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:51,711
Aldi superintendent

628
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:57,087
Eminem

629
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:00,671
Eminem

630
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:04,767
Just some pathetic corporate shill and LeBron James

631
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:10,655
So I texted I think this morning and I predicted that the show would be about Eminem

632
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:17,055
And how he's a race traitor

633
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:22,687
Willie's word that Eminem rap battle

634
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:34,719
I was hoping you'd bring up Eminem cuz I wanted to talk about in a little bit

635
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:42,143
First of all I think Eminem is pretty great especially in the context of d1212 is amazing

636
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:51,359
Set out intentionally to freak out white people

637
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:57,759
Isaiah is a part of the job I love it

638
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:00,575
Descendant of that I didn't like that as much but yeah

639
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:06,463
I do respect a lot of Eminem's worth

640
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,231
I don't disagree

641
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,511
But be that as it may

642
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:11,071
That video that Eminem dropped

643
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,887
I got to say

644
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,423
Is that great

645
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:20,031
I appreciate

646
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,591
The context in the subject matter

647
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:28,479
I think that's great I think he's saying something that he's being like

648
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:38,719
You cannot possibly support what I'm into that's great but Manny was weak on the bars

649
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:46,911
Him pacing around it's very produced and then everyone like all these dumbasses on Twitter posting like

650
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:52,799
Oh my God that freestyle was sick and I can sell it

651
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:55,615
Crazy before

652
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:57,663
If he was doing it he was actually

653
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:59,455
Off the Dome as they say

654
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:01,503
It would have been so much better

655
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,783
It would have been amazing

656
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:09,183
But that was very very rehearsed and first to make it seem extemporaneous

657
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:13,791
Because I was like I don't want to

658
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:18,143
I don't want to a be a part of this and be the guy who's like

659
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:25,823
Like I don't want any part of it last night

660
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:33,503
I spell supportive

661
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,855
I just think it was week in terms of actual rapping

662
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:39,647
Yeah I just need that to be clear

663
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:43,487
Dumb zombies

664
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,559
Schmucks

665
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:49,119
They do spend money on that

666
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:53,215
It's not the young people anymore

667
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:55,263
They're like Dad

668
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,311
I don't want to

669
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,383
Go see Harrison Ford movie your life

670
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:07,039
Harrison Ford movies

671
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:21,119
I don't want to go see Hollywood mode

672
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:27,519
Oh you don't want to go see the 2 hour and 40 minutes if you want to watch

673
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:31,103
Hollywood

674
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,111
I've never

675
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:50,559
He's a correspondent on Infowars sometimes

676
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:56,447
Good online

677
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:01,055
Today on the show Alex Jones does it takes a lot of calls

678
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:04,383
Comparatively it's still not many calls right

679
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:06,687
His normal rigmarole

680
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:12,831
Quite a few called one of them is a trying to lure him into talking s*** on the Jews

681
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:19,231
Advising the are the globalist actually the Kazarian

682
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:23,583
Evil Georgia

683
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:28,447
But he does fine but the best call is a guy

684
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,727
2

685
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,263
Mix Alex remember

686
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:34,847
A long time ago said he was going to make a music show

687
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:42,783
That was brought up again yeah because we know that

688
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,135
Properties

689
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,927
Basically

690
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:51,487
Infowars or Patriot music

691
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:57,887
What way does that mean what's Infowars music

692
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:03,263
Muslims in public freak out

693
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:09,407
The last four years I work with a friend of mine it's Nashville staff writer

694
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,687
Here in Omaha

695
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:14,271
And that's basically the feedback that I got from him is

696
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,111
I would

697
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:19,391
Music sucks

698
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:23,999
If that's possible

699
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:26,559
It's just part of being a conservative

700
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:29,631
Because you don't have the

701
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,399
Potential

702
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:36,543
Facebook in your opportunity to be able to promote your music personally there no

703
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:43,967
Cabal on our back brother

704
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:46,783
Once were awake and we know that they're on our back

705
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:49,343
Just like a bucking bronco or bull

706
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:55,743
Turn on frosty on our back forever and hold on for dear life but they're never going to

707
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:56,767
8 Seconds

708
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:14,687
Independent new music

709
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:19,295
This guy does not have a producer

710
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:23,647
Hollywood

711
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,927
Just gets a little weird

712
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:29,023
And so that's why

713
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:30,303
I'm sure you're great

714
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:35,935
Music online

715
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:38,239

01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:42,335

That's amazing

721
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:07,167
Two more clips

722
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:10,751
In manipulating his audience pretty hard

723
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:12,543
One last clip that

724
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,311
Delightful

725
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:17,919
It's really important

726
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:19,199
Through

727
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:23,551
I'm Alex's journey in 2015 where he comes to identify with Trump

728
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:29,183
Becomes like interlocked with his goal is

729
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:34,559
You can see in 2017

730
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:36,351
He's really desperately trying

731
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,631
To do that to his audience

732
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:39,679
In this clip

733
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:42,495
And remember when they say Donald Trump

734
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:48,639
Trying to get me to identify

735
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:52,735
When I see Trump

736
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:54,783
They think

737
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:59,391
Average American black wise Fantasia

738
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:01,951
That's that's

739
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:03,743
Manipulative nonsense

740
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:10,399
Fake billionaire liar who is a sociopath who's trying to get us all killed

741
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:12,191
Gun owner mass shooting

742
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:17,055
It is making those more likely

743
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:21,663
Absolutely what makes them more money than mass shootings

744
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:25,759
Yeah like that's the reality of it of course the NRA wants mass shootings

745
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:31,135
Continue happened they make a s*** ton of money when they do

746
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,671
Amy and the Bee

747
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:33,951
Gets even worse

748
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:40,351
One Bastion halfway left

749
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:45,215
The globalist minded Hollywood minded

750
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:50,079
The Midwest City

751
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:52,639
Oh boy

752
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:57,503
Whitening strips

753
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:01,599
Oh or what didn't things mean to him

754
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:07,999
But you got to look at it in the rivers Christian mean wife and white means Christian Middle America means white Christian normal

755
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,535
Trump means white Christian

756
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:19,775
We have plenty of but we have evidence that there is at least one black white person completely f***** up

757
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:23,103
What there was a clip I meant to pull and I didn't get it sucked

758
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:25,663
He there was one caller this lady called in

759
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:26,943
Straight up

760
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:28,223
She said

761
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:30,015
Hey you don't want Obama

762
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:35,135
Bring the country together why didn't they play up more that he was half white

763
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:46,143
Lady

764
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:48,447
Her idea is that

765
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:51,007
By his being biracial

766
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:53,055
That's how he could have done it

767
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:55,615
If a plate up he is both black

768
01:14:55,871 --> 01:15:02,015
Michael Jackson videos

769
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:08,415
One of you white people trust me I'm halfway

770
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:13,791
There's definitely no historical precedent for mixed-race person

771
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:17,631
Horribly as someone who is otherwise

772
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:19,935
Entirely black

773
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:27,359
Exposed

774
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:31,967
From the Rogan podcast

775
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:36,831
You're really smart you're on top of it

776
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:42,207
It's f****** Christ that makes it very clear look at this last clip in here

777
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:47,071
Nichols interview f****** exhausted me

778
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:48,095
But

779
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:55,007
Alex talks about that something I don't know I don't know I spent a lot of time in my youth

780
01:15:55,519 --> 01:16:01,407
Contextualizing

781
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:06,783
Support the good little church the song the truth

782
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:15,487
All these big mega-churches are swinger clubs

783
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:21,631
Just like that.

784
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,423
I did not know that

785
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:27,519
Everybody that goes to him knows that

786
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:29,823
Ice weather stupid

787
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:33,663
Good riddles

788
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:36,479
I like I love that everyone knows that

789
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:40,319
Or they're stupid

790
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:46,719
I didn't know if I wanted wanted to swing could just go to a megachurch I went to a megachurch

791
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:48,767
And I will tell you it was not

792
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:55,167
Swingers club

793
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,703
Finger-bang

794
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,727
If you're not finger banging

795
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:02,079
I was throwing up

796
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:08,991
I don't feel like I got what I wanted but

797
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:12,575
I also expect

798
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:19,743
I suppose with all I was really hoping for was to get him to drop that b******* for justice

799
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:22,303
Just one second of just like

800
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:25,375
I'm just him stopping and looking for a moment

801
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:27,167
But he's still good

802
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:30,495
Just f****** rolling with it if you don't believe me that's

803
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:33,311
And you don't believe me that's on you I don't need to follow up with

804
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,359
Anything

805
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:37,919
You know there's just so many little points

806
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:38,943
There's a

807
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:43,039
There's a whole celestial sphere made up of these

808
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:45,599
Little names and little details

809
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:48,159
Snowpiercer

810
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:51,743
I did like finding out that he actually thinks he was

811
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:54,303
The leader of a Nicaraguan drug running

812
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:56,607
That's fun

813
01:17:56,863 --> 01:18:03,007
Did not want to do that no

814
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:06,591
You can't come at me

01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:15,039

Alex

01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:32,607

For this whole thing right here this whole interview with Larry Nichols

845
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:33,792
Larry Nichols after I talked to him earlier in the day he gave he gave this guy a call

846
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:34,560
