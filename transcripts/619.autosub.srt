1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Air Jordan

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for its knowledge B

3
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,832
Stripe.com

4
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,536
A little bit about

5
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,072
Alex June

6
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
Quest

7
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:15,776
My birthday is possibly uncharacteristic

8
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:20,128
Maybe people wouldn't take us to me cuz I don't like violent video games sure

9
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,688
Other things like Donkey Kong Country and maybe you know

10
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:30,368
Games where the violence has you jump on somebody

11
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,696
Cartoony stuff

12
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:40,096
But V I just saw that Grand Theft Auto 3 Vice City and San Andreas

13
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,376
Released on the switch

14
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,656
And

15
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:47,776
Over the Moon the Moon

16
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,544
The ship

17
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,568
Out of those

18
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,616
When I was younger

19
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,408
17 on word or whatever

20
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:59,808
And there's just something about it I don't really like the violence aspect of it as much as I can

21
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:03,392
Unnecessary violence

22
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,160
But dear

23
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:07,744
Such a great like open-world but not too big

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,768
Right

25
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,816
Kind of vibe I like

26
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:15,424
People telling me what to do like going on Mission and stuff it's fun

27
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,448
Fun

28
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:22,848
Yeah I remember playing those games and being like well but I've seen my friends play this and they just commit violence all the time

29
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,640
I'm going to walk to my next message

30
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,112
I think also I've started on three

31
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:37,696
There are some criticisms of people have it

32
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:42,560
Some of the aesthetic of the original version on the PS2 are are gone

33
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:48,192
I kind of agree with that like it's stylistically a little bit different visually but I don't mind

34
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,752
I don't mind that too much

35
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,616
Just get a thrill out of finding a hidden package

36
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:04,832
Active great you're running around like why am I on this rooftop oh haha that's why

37
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:08,416
Did my bright spot is a little bit of a Twilight spot

38
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,488
I'll tell you what begins with breaking a commandment

39
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,768
1st and

40
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,560
Since you've gotten his desk

41
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,840
I have coveted

42
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:21,216
I've covered it either later this s*** out of this desk told you was a nice day

43
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:25,824
So I was like I'm not proud of this but I had to get myself a new.

44
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,640
I want I didn't want to I just couldn't

45
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:33,248
Look at my own old desk I understand more right so I got it

46
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:38,112
And as you know about how I buy things I

47
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,648
Found my price range

48
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:47,328
And then just ordered it no real consideration no no it's probably the first thing check it off like I don't care what

49
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,352
So it's

50
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
Huge

51
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:55,520
Way bigger than I thought it was you got to be careful about that complicated wow

52
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,056
I'm so proud of myself

53
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,080
I completed it

54
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,128
And then the next morning

55
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,432
I opened the drawer and the whole thing

56
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:08,320
The whole drawer fell apart as if it was just like a guitar to Absolute cartoon

57
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,600
So my bright spot was

58
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:16,000
Successfully putting that thing together does feel good it's a great spot is that it is already falling apart

59
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:22,399
Another bright spot

60
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,799
So Jordan today we're going to be going over about her and Day episode about November 16th

61
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,503
Can't remember what the real fast

62
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,903
Furious line is and what the wrong one is that I've talked myself into that one.

63
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,231
Too early to care

64
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,791
Doesn't matter anyway

65
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,815
It's

66
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,935
Bucked up

67
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:01,055
Also Alex premieres a bit of his interview with General Flynn

68
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,079
General Mike Flynn

69
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:06,175
Scott answer will be taking a brief detour to go over that interview

70
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:12,575
And I'm excited to get that business

71
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,879
Where's James

72
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:19,743
James Gregory

73
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:36,127
And from Arkansas

74
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,503
Are you very much Randy and candy

75
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,087
Octopi

76
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:51,487
I don't like I don't like some of the content that we're going to end up talking

77
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:56,863
That's been going on I'm kind of f***** up it's just

78
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,191
Today Show

79
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
Yep

80
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:14,271
So we're going to start here actually not on the episode but we're going to start with a little video that Alex put out

81
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,063
Where he is

82
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,463
Really embodying his current spirit this is a little little video

83
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
Infowars

84
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,607

You got to write it on the phone

89
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,575

90
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,647
They want to take us

91
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,695
We've got to

92
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
Fight this in court

93
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,255
Go to the jury trial

Default

95

96
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:07,775
So I can't

We're banned everywhere else

115
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,039
The fight for the neck

116
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
Never issued

117
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,111

Stand up for you

Jennifer America

121
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:11,263
Rich people cough cough Elon Musk Joe Rogan amazing I love it

122
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:17,663
I love a good appeal to rich people's sense of dignity and their love of the First Amendment

123
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,711
The First Amendment so goddamn much

124
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,503
This is what Alex.

125
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,879
He has absolutely no standards and doesn't give a f*** about how his actions and words affect other people

126
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,671
Total dick

127
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,207
Every now and then he gets

128
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,231
Himself into trouble

129
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,791
He milks left trouble for all the free press that he can

130
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,119
You get out of it presented himself as a persecuted victim the whole time

131
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:43,263
If he's allowed to he ends up settling any makes quiet apologies to get himself off the hook like you did with James alefantis

132
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,543
And Hum Dil Kya

133
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,591
Well that's not an option or

134
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,919
You know someone important Infowars end up owing a lot of money

135
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:53,759
You better believe that an emergency money bomb is coming right around the corner

136
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,807
Oh yeah we call that pretty

137
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:00,159
It was not a not a ambitious prediction

138
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,439
Pretty obvious

139
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,511
Anyway you did not require any psychic powers

140
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,791
Merely deduct

141
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:12,191
This doesn't have anything to do with Alex being able to afford appeals or fight the good fight to clear his name

142
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,007
Defend the First Amendment a rubber Bowl shade he thinks he's

143
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:15,775
Doing

144
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:21,407
This is trying to trick the audience into pay and what he's going to end up being ordered to pay for losing the suit

145
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:28,319
This is basically the equivalent of being a teen and like bacon your parents to give you money to pay off a speeding ticket you got when you were Joyce

146
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
Riding

147
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,367
Alex wants someone else

148
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,159
The face the consequences for him

149
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:38,303
So we can continue as flagrantly irresponsible bulshit that'll end up leading to more consequences of the audience at the bail him out of them

150
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:42,655
Don't sleep very sad and childish and I hope you out in southern fall for it again

151
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,959
But I think they might not

152
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:51,359
I think they might not be totally convinced you think so I went to the Gibson to go pay how's it going to destroy two million.

153
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,431
And I weep gifts ended him

154
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,199
Percent of it

155
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:59,039
Set time

156
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,599
To find their way to that page

157
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,879
To donate

158
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:08,511
That's okay that's a Gibson to go do not pass go do not

159
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,559
Collect

160
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,887
You might have banged this Kong too many

161
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,959
You might be fishing in a dry well

162
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:21,055
Yeah and I think that the audience sees the idea that like

163
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,639
Joe Rogan just got 100 million dollar contractor Spotify

164
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,967
If you believed what Alex says and really think that this is that important

165
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,551
To millions of drop in the bucket that from Rogan

166
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,599
Easy

167
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,903
The people who are going paycheck-to-paycheck or

168
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:42,303
You're good people in the audience why do why you trying to build them a broken nose it's b******* to

169
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,327
Nobody wants

170
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,607
To pay for it

171
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
Anyway

172
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:50,239
Good luck I'm excited to see how this one goes

173
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,287
Dirigo can start off on the 16th

174
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,079
And here's Israel

175
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,919
It's really huge and got me having butterflies right now

176
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,063
Having a really big ones today

177
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,671
Go down

178
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,463
Because I have butterflies

179
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,255
Never been this strong it's like

180
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,303
On fire right now

181
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
Coming

182
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,567
Madison

183
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,639
That is some energy right there there's some big stuff

184
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,687
So a big stuff

185
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:39,391
If you present yourself that way

186
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:45,791
The world is right around the corner

187
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:52,191
I got to have to guess that all the world's nuclear powers are going to start a war against each other immediately or I'm going to

188
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:58,591
Lose all of my money I don't know which one what you don't understand is me being rich is the only thing that is holding back he had

189
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:04,223
I would not be surprised if he believed that on sublevel

190
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,295
Alex's

191
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
Is high

192
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,855
But he's high on fighting

193
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,183
I'm high as a kite fighting

194
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:18,815
I would not be anywhere else.

195
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
More I don't back down

196
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,399
Justin Moore the Universe album.

197
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,959
It's just things I could never even imagine

198
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,479
What is hat on

199
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,015
Did the show Myspace

200
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
Top your head blows off

201
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,463
It's just so

202
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,023
Amazing be in the quiet place the most high

203
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:54,143
Like the philosopher dolls Berkeley I mean

204
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
Like

205
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,031
Little boy let's just start with Cee-Lo

206
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:06,175
Merry Madagascar

207
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,223
I was looking over his

208
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,015
Is Wikipedia page

209
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:14,879
This pattern of him saying horrible things

210
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:21,279
On Twitter and I just have terrible thoughts

211
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,863
I want to enforce upon people and then I don't want to face any consequence

212
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,519
Cut this clip cuz it was too long

213
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,567
I don't really care that much

214
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:38,175
The next commercial break he comes in with crazy and he's just like

215
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,247
Just singing along for

216
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:47,647
Oh boy Let It Go For Me Maybe I'm crazy

217
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:53,023
I would like to see the upper end of Alex's register

218
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,303
Probably not great

219
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,863
Alex gets to this clip

220
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:01,215
Of Mike Flynn the interview

221
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,775
Let's go ahead my friends

222
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,079
Very important mineral short Club

223
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,199
The intro of the hour-long

224
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,247
Interview with General Flynn

225
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
Crowd of 5,000

226
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,463
And we're also on Thursday

227
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
Welsh

228
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,351
Patrick

229
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,655
The interview

230
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,215
That really is people listen to it

231
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,359
Just the battle plan of victory

232
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:43,455
Plays this little clip it's like a Sizzle reel kind of this interview

233
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:47,295
The Flint review is I'm going to call it don't you dare come on I'm taking it away from

234
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:52,927
The part that's hilarious about this is that the overarching theme of the clips that Alex plays

235
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:59,327
On his show saying that Alex was right all along

236
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:06,495
I didn't get any indication that the interview was a battle plan for victory as much as a preview almost entirely

237
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:13,151
That doesn't surprise me since he's a narcissist and having people talk about how great you are as kind of the road.

238
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,943
Anyway I didn't

239
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,295
Feel like I got a good sense of what the interview was about from the sizzle reel so

240
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,319
Like I said

241
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,855
Let me watch the full version

242
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,647
See what I could learn

243
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:28,767
And I was really particularly trying to figure out like where is the battle plan

244
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,815
Right cuz that's what I was saying this is

245
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:37,215
There's like useful information moving forward as how we're going to achieve Victory we need to divide

246
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:41,311
The certain groups we need to flank them etcetera etcetera black battle

247
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,871
It's mostly complaining

248
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,247
There's a lot to complain about

249
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
Text a little bit

250
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
People that are

251
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,647
You're following what I'm doing or what's happening

252
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
In my life and ever

253
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,743
With all of this

254
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:00,767
Stuff with the

255
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
January 6th

256
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
That quality

257
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
The yeti

258
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:05,887
Insurrection

259
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,655
And crucifix

260
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,215
Because that's what it is anyway.

261
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
Local sunset

262
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,263
Nancy Pelosi

263
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:12,799
Pilot

264
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,103
Operation that they are

265
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,127
Doing

266
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:16,895
To basically

267
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,175
Steal away

268
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,711
All of the

269
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,247
The other ask

270
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
What's happening

271
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,295
Across this country

272
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,087
Do you like you got the Durham report

273
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,367
Never comes out of that the

274
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,439
It's been a lot of things drop

275
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
A thing dropped

276
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,511
Recovering

277
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
That stuff up

278
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,863
Did anybody try and s*** on Pontius pilate's death

279
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,191
Not that I'm aware I don't think there were I don't think he had a desk

280
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,983
That's a good point

281
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:48,639
Hi I'm trying to follow this metaphor

282
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,455
Who is Jesus

283
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,295
Are the Oaks

284
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,575
Keepers Jesus

285
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,111
Collectively

286
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,951
Who's who is Nancy Pelosi

287
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:07,327
I mean did somebody bring something to Nancy Pelosi that she said washed her hands of

288
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,863
Like did somebody say

289
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,399
Hey

290
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:17,055
Nancy we want all of these insurrectionists to be free or whatever cuz they're the Messiah

291
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,591
She was like nah dude

292
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:24,991
Wait no that's even back when she would have been the one saying no everybody here is fine but don't kill them qanon

293
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:30,367
Brabus then the crowd is chanting for Mike Pence's death

294
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,927
But she saying don't kill my my face is Jesus

295
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,695
Wait

296
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:41,375
This is this is a little confused I understand the desire cuz Insurrection rhymes with crucifixion

297
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,191
I appreciate that word play

298
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:49,567
I understand why you want to get as biblical as you can for the audience

299
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
System

300
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:54,431
I don't like it when people get both reality

301
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,967
And unreality wrong

302
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,575
Speaking of things that are questionable

303
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,599
In terms of reality

304
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:06,207
Do you think that Michael and thinks that the 2020 election was stolen

305
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:10,815
A boy that seems too obvious a question over to go with

306
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:17,215
No actually it if you guys but then I'll follow up question

307
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,543
You think the 2016 election

308
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,871
You got that right

309
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
2016

310
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,431
I believe

311
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:29,759
9 months

312
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
That I believe

313
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
Mastiff

314
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
They just didn't have

315
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,439
Balance

316
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,487
Send machine

317
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
2

318
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,559
Donald Trump

319
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,375
Ran the table

320
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,679
The outdid the algorithms

321
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
I know this word everybody's

322
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
The algorithm

323
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
Beat the odds

324
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,335
And then four years

325
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
They tried to take

326
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,175
Everything

327
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,479
Stories

328
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,247
Still being

329
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,295
Until what they decided

330
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,343
Right after the

331
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,207
We're never going to

332
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:11,999
Another

333
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:12,767
Election

334
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
We're not going to

335
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
Control the out

336
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
And so

337
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
10 covid

338
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,471
Covid

339
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
Control

340
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
Very very smart

341
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
Military

342
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,431
At its finest

343
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,711
And what they did was

344
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,015
Kobe King

345
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
To bring into

346
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,207
So yeah we got this whole plan

347
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:42,975
Yeah

348
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,999
Very elaborate

349
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,791
Of course

350
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,559
16 election

351
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,119
Was stolen but Trump did so well

352
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,447
Dover Road to the the voter fraud which is

353
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
Meredith

354
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,055
Because they're like

355
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:57,823
Bach

356
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,103
He's too good

357
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,919
What we didn't we didn't consider this

358
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,479
When we were rigging the election we didn't consider that it would be

359
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:10,879
Be possible that someone could be so popular that they would overcome all efforts to

360
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:16,767
So we have to get covid-19

361
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,607
That if you've started invalidating even the election

362
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:24,191
Since You've Won your argument is let's never hold elections

363
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:31,615
Kind of plan ends up getting towards in this interview as well

364
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
Young Kim

365
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,943
Yeah and

366
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:41,343
In Virginia and he's basically saying that that was the same thing they were trying to steal it

367
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,671
Even if we win it's stolen is this is this is not

368
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,999
The good a good path for us to go down there is never away

369
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,023
No Alba

370
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,351
17 minutes into this interview

371
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,911
That's probably 35 minutes long

372
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,727
All day

373
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,031
Alex finally

374
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,567
What can we do to fight back

375
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,103
So maybe this is

376
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,127
The battle plan

377
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,455
Here we go twins response

378
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,735
Might be a little cliche

379
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,271
What are some basic

380
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
The American people

381
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,343
Congress

382
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,120
What can we

383
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,168
Moving in the right

384
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,752
Concussion

385
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:32,800
So first of all

386
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
Courage is it

387
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,640
Decision

388
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,176
What

389
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:38,944
Courage is not so

390
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,504
DNA

391
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,528
It might be

392
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,808
What

393
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,440
So tell me it's possible that courage might be in your DNA

394
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:54,048
Explain to me how courage is both a decision and something you were innately born with

395
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:54,816
I don't know

396
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,888
Okay that's good well I think it's just a cliche thing that sounds fun

397
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,680
Courage is a choice

398
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,240
Honor is a choice for life

399
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008
Station

400
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,824
A poster or something

401
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,408
In there

402
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,968
Almost entirely boils down to like

403
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,016
I think locally

404
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:18,880
I don't have Global ramifications basically

405
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,952
More cliche nonsense people

406
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,744
Some truth to it but it's

407
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
Kind of

408
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,560
Idea that a lot of people in

409
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,096
Organizing

410
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:33,984
I've already known for a long time

411
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,776
Secret number 56

412
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,800
I'm

413
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
With stupid

414
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,616
Yeah it's

415
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,384
It's trite

416
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,408
That very least

417
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,176
And

418
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,712
Not groundbreaking

419
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,808
So one of the ways that you can act locally though

420
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,368
You got to get in there to those School Board me

421
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,464
It's so fun with it

422
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,536
School board meeting has there been

423
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,816
So much

424
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,120
Visibility about school

425
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,912
School Board in school board activity around

426
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,960
You kind of said yourself

427
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,752
School Board

428
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,032
Part of it is is

429
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:08,800
Is that we have taken

430
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,152
Take it take it

431
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,176
For granted that all

432
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
No Alex

433
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
The sky Alex

434
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,320
And who is he what is his background

435
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,344
All the sudden

436
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,160
Democratic Socialist

437
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,440
That are honest

438
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:27,744
Educate

439
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,512
Haitian system

440
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,280
Is the way to

441
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,560
Entire culture

442
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,888
Country

443
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,912
Been talking about it for decks

444
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:36,960
Open that happened

445
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,240
Donald Trump

446
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,520
Been going on

447
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
For decades

448
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,848
It's not so much that there is

449
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,664
Something different going on with school boards as it is

450
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,712
People have figured out that they can get

451
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,016
Viral videos really easily like

452
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,808
Yelling at school boards

453
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,576
People just

454
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,600
Stop them

455
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:59,744
Twins getting any stats about socialist on school and what he's doing

456
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:03,072
This is just an attempt to encourage more intimidation and chaosity

457
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:06,400
School board meetings because they're the perfect Target for right-wing education

458
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:13,056
School board members probably aren't going to argue with you you just get to yell whatever you want for a few minutes then you get to post a video of

459
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:16,896
Yourself which encourages more people who want attention to do the same thing

460
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,688
It's a self-perpetuating cycle

461
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:24,064
Another important people who share Alex influence politics

462
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,160
Don't have sway in most school boards because they took their freedom for granted

463
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:31,488
They don't have sway there because they don't care but the actual work that

464
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,512
School boards do

465
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:37,632
And their politics would actually advocate for the elimination of public schools and the school board

466
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,424
Here

467
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,496
Yeah and I mean your argument is is more like

468
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:47,616
Hey this teacher wants you to read and you're like oh well that's it, socialist

469
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:54,272
People who are drawn to servicon school boards generally are power-mad socialist there people who care deeply about the community they live in

470
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,344
Often dedicated to educational issues

471
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:01,952
This is slightly idealistic on my part and obviously there's some folks who aren't

472
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,000
Like high-minded and totally altruistic

473
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:07,840
But being on school board generally means putting in a ton of extra work that

474
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:11,168
Sweetly thankless and generally poorly compensated

475
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,984
According to the National School boards Association quote

476
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,800
75% of small district school board members

477
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,336
Receiving no salary

478
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:23,456
A lot of school districts have elections for board members to so that's an added hurdle the people left

479
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,992
The clear in order to get on the board

480
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,016
It's not

481
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:30,112
You weren't paying attention for a long time and you can give a f*** about the fact that you

482
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:33,184
You could have voted for somebody else to be on the school board you dumb

483
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,952
Dumb dick

484
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,720
I mean

485
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,488
Is your

486
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,280
The problem is their argument has

487
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,048
To be like

488
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,864
All of that time that we when you weren't paying attention

489
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,912
All this evil stuff was happy

490
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:46,240
Not like the reason you didn't have to pay attention is because

491
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,008
Everything was fine

492
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,288
You know

493
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,592
So now it's like I've been doing this all in

494
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,408
Secret despite the fact that if you were to go look at it you would like

495
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,968
I haven't cared about my school board in my town

496
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:02,112
40 f****** years I didn't go to school here I don't know any of the kids here

497
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:05,184
School Board

498
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,792
I'm some a****** who's doing nothing but I think I'm going to go bother the school board

499
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:14,144
Dreadlocks dreadlocks weirdo can go scream at the school board

500
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,776
Could have done that 10 years ago

501
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:26,176
That big a deal

502
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,712
The flavor does your right now

503
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,528
Bright Eyes this is bad

504
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,808
Slim

505
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,088
You jerk

506
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,112
Anyway

507
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:37,184
The best most of his battle plan is like

508
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,048
Fuqua School Board find out who owns your local paper

509
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:48,704
I don't know if there's a battle plan

510
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,568
I think a lot of the what Alex wanted out of this interview is he wanted

511
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:57,664
To get Flynn to say that he was going to run for president

512
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,432
Girardi travel

513
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,088
And I just

514
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
Accelerate

515
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,440
Declare

516
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,720
America first

517
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,656
Morbid

518
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,544
But I

519
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:25,824
Just can't wait to be

520
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,736
I like that

521
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:36,576
Part of the discussion about like come on you should stay running for president is like

522
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,136
You know Trump wouldn't think you're betraying him

523
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,184
Healthy

524
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,464
Hey Hey listen

525
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,744
We want you to run

526
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,048
A president not full well you will not weigh

527
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,840
It's a waste of your time

528
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,608
And

529
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:51,680
And at all the end of this your main job is to

530
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,240
To give all of the stuff that you have worked hard for

531
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,800
Does somebody who has literally never worked a day in his life

532
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:03,712
Sounds good yeah that's good stuff

533
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:08,832
So we get back to the episode proper and Alex has hope you know he's always right about that

534
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,856
We've heard this

535
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,160
Predictions about where we're going

536
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,952
I would covid vaccine

537
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,536
Living in denial is only what this take place has so many people

538
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,144
I got about 7 to 10 a year

539
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:30,080
AR 1 hour

540
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:30,848
Saraland

541
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,200
One-Shot Superbad

542
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,296
Chad they're just normalizing

543
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,184
What they're doing

544
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,488
I guess the conservative estimate that he's making

545
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:51,072
7210 covid vaccines a year

546
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:55,936
Maybe one a day one an hour

547
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:59,520
Exaggerated 65 *

548
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,544
24

549
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
Right

550
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,872
So that's why you're sleeping

551
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,176
That's a good question

552
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:12,832
You have to wake up in the middle of the night and give yourself a booster

553
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:17,440
Alright then the 365 is only * 17

554
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:23,840
Right but you got to take one shot in the middle of the night just to hold you over so I have to change it to like a

555
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,912
A broken up sleep schedule

556
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:32,800
Sleep 3 hours at a time let's call that 19 shot cuz you got one before you go to bed one when you wake up and then one

557
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,824
To boost yourself

558
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,592
Before your morning

559
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:39,456
Or possibly the government will mandate you can only sleep in like 20 minutes chunks

560
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:45,856
Sure that DaVinci sleep cycle and let me throw this out so you could take a shot every hour

561
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,136
Every room

562
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:53,536
Is altered to be like a Indiana Jones booby trap room where if you step on

563
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,816
On a certain tile

564
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:58,144
30 vaccine shots get your

565
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,240
Or it could be like the hatch in lost where the counter

566
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,800
Cooking down to an hour if they cash out

567
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:11,456
Browse the electromagnetic anomaly you offered crash a plane

568
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,248
If you want me to get the shout out.

569
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,552
Stupid

570
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,392
Anyways he might be fear-mongering a little bit though

571
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:25,792
Okay so what are the side characters in the story of Infowars that I think doesn't get enough play

572
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:30,144
Definitely does come up more than you'd expect is Alex's wife's tennis partner

573
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,984
How much it comes up and

574
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,008
Better comes up at all

575
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:37,568
We've not heard from this tennis partner in a while

576
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,848
Here's an update

577
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,664
This one was bragging to my wife yesterday house

578
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,992
Can you take a 7 and 10 year old

579
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:48,576
Getting worn lady she said well it's just Darwinism she wants a killer kid

580
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
Coshocton

581
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,352
Where We Are

582
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,144
Okay

583
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,168
Got cut off by the brake

584
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:03,936
That's very

585
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:04,960
Yeah

586
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
That's very funny

587
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,288
Imagine Alex's wife

588
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,824
I didn't even warn her

589
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,384
Yeah

590
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,712
She was talkingshit

591
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,248
She was just

592
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:20,576
She was just showing off that's what her husband doesn't

593
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:23,904
Run an outlet designed expressly destroyed

594
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:30,304
Children does it mean to brag about your children getting back

595
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,424
Strange phrases

596
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:39,264
So we're going to get into a little bit of Alex talking about

597
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,544
How many abortions

598
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,312
If you paid for

599
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,920
Somebody's doesn't quite match up with some of the other comments he's made of the pasture

600
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:49,248
Timeline issues certainly come up that'll happen

601
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:50,784
But

602
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,808
I always

603
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,880
I kind of after the initial shock of him

604
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:58,208
Admitting on are that he's paid for overtime

605
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,744
Abortions

606
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,792
Shock of that

607
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,584
I don't want to talk about that too much

608
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,144
Cuz I don't want to give the appearance that

609
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,704
I would be in anyway judgmental of someone

610
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,728
Making that decision

611
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,776
Yeah we have no moralization

612
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,336
Possibly be Michigan

613
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,104
Construed

614
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,384
In this case

615
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,968
You kind of got to bring it up cuz of where the conversation goes

616
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,528
This is a mess

617
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,552
My bad boy

618
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,624
My first Access TV shows 28 years ago

619
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:30,464
I planted what I was a Christian but that I wasn't a bible thumper

620
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,768
Judging people

621
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,584
Explain how the left when control

622
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:42,752
Women and men that had taken part in abortions by saying you're a sinner you're going to hell you killed the baby

623
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,384
And then they commit and hardened their hearts instead of hey

624
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:53,760
God will forgive you you got set up you got lied to that was a human life you know your heart

625
00:32:55,296 --> 00:33:01,440
Just ask God for forgiveness the Holy Spirit come in the ass and you'll be freed of this weight of what you were involved at I know I paid for

626
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,464
Quite a few abortions

627
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,024
And I and I

628
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,560
Shotgun facing

629
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,752
So you're sorry to those children you killed

630
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:18,336
I need to get on your knees and you need to ask forgiving I did

631
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,128
Taken away from me and then God said

632
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,408
Here's your mission

633
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,432
I was like

634
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:28,832
17 years old

635
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,136
You're going to go to work and I was like

636
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:38,816
Yeah that timeline doesn't quite work out for me based on other comments he's made in the past I mean

637
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,864
Wow

638
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,936
It's if it's that young I guess his Dad paid for 10 of worship

639
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:49,824
Plus I think I was already understood I believe so

640
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:54,688
Seems like his dad doesn't feel too much guilt about it he's not on the record

641
00:33:54,944 --> 00:34:01,088
Speaking about this headspace that he's in he's like I killed these kids oh no

642
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:05,184
That leaves him to confess to murder again

643
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,584
And

644
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:17,984
Murder

645
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,176
What

646
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,576
And then God said well.

647
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,328
Body parts

648
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,352
I'm a sinner

649
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,984
Tell you something God

650
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
Forgave me

651
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:55,360
So you trying to give this impression that God has forgiven him and then all the

652
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,640
The guilt is gone and

653
00:34:57,152 --> 00:35:00,224
You know all this but like that is absolutely not true

654
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,504
No he is

655
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,320
Intensely motivated by some kind of a

656
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,624
The guilt that he feels about this

657
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,416
I mean it would be hard

658
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,976
To think to yourself after listening to that

659
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:11,744
Oh

660
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,768
Repentance

661
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,304
Gives you

662
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,096
Clear thoughts and

663
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,632
Calm of mind

664
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:24,288
Free of heart that allows you to see everything clearly and your motivations or are just totally above board

665
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,848
Seems more like I'm going to throw this out there

666
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,384
I bet he is

667
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,272
Daily by his past and it tears him apart inside leading him to do and commit terrible thing

668
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,064
And exaggerated

669
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:42,464
The Sims what he's committed like I've murdered people

670
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,488
For you at all

671
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,512
If Alex

672
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:50,912
Is the embodiment of repenting I would say that it's a bad thing

673
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:56,032
Yeah but forgiveness is good it's good to forgive yourself forgive yourself

674
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,992
The devil put pressure on you and use them against you

675
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,552
Manipulate

676
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,368
That'll wipe it out

677
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,904
Doesn't mean you're perfect

678
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,696
Those weights are gone

679
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,000
Sure they are using an allergy of

680
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,072
Christmas story where

681
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:26,496
It was all bosses

682
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,776
Carry on his back

683
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:28,800
Fraternity

684
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,568
Not a Christmas

685
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,872
Feel that way when you committed

686
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,896
Crime in sand

687
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,992
Get rid of it it's a long way back from hell

688
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,064
You don't want to cross that line

689
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,112
Glenn Danzig

690
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,232
What is happening

691
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:52,864
He's quoted the philosopher Glenn Danzig and Gnarls Barkley on this episode

692
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:59,520
Okay alright oh yeah it's on his playlist today so that was A Christmas Carol

693
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:02,336
Talk about Jacob Marley

694
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:05,152
And I believe if I'm not mistaken

695
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,944
The chains represented his wealth

696
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,296
Representative being obsessed with business

697
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:15,392
The more money he made the heavier his chains were

698
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:21,792
Not really about sins La Alex's describe the heads and their ironic punished

699
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:22,816
Yep

700
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,840
So

701
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,656
Alex is a is on one

702
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,192
As you can as you can

703
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,728
Can see he's rambling about

704
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,264
Killing people

705
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,616
And how he has done that in the past you are sure which is great. Start sure

706
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:39,968
Gets into talking about how the man needed to get him off

707
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,736
Off-air

708
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,272
Because he was giving too much truth

709
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:45,856
I hope I have a few thoughts about this that I wanted to

710
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,672
Okay we knew this day was coming

711
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:55,840
We know what's going to happen because we got operation lockstep and we had sparse 2023 2025 and we had

712
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,144
All different in-game documents

713
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,472
We know that they were going to scare for disease X

714
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,592
12 years ago

715
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,176
But they would bring out the virus

716
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,224
Lockdown

717
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:17,088
Play Bring Out up a vaccine passport global

718
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,368
Travel passport

719
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:22,976
An internal passport that would have a carbon tax attached to it

720
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,536
What in the document

721
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:32,192
Right around that same time China started developing and social credit score and infowars.com

722
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,496
And prisonplanet.com

723
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,032
Infowars

724
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
At the time

725
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,640
The time

726
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,992
The first report on all of this

727
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:48,320
Special

728
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,928
We've done the research we've been the tip of the spear

729
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,256
That's why the enemy so upset that's what they wanted software

730
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,328
Ago

731
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,680
Finally banned on Twitter 6 months

732
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:09,824
About to release lockdown

733
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:13,664
Bring ID out of the system here's the documents

734
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,296
What do you think they thought when they saw that they said get him off now

735
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:23,648
Shut him up how the hell does he know all this well you guys brag about it

736
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:26,208
Is a fun story but it is not it's not real

737
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,256
That's not that's not accurate at all

738
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,816
The beginning we're all

739
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:34,912
Not real operation lockstep not a real thing

740
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:37,984
Nope just various documents and

741
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,776
Scenario exercises

742
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,568
Completely making s*** up about

743
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,640
This is this is what I want to get to

744
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,688
I don't

745
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,456
Think

746
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:52,320
The idea that Alex has been yelling about them releasing a virus

747
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,880
Sense 1998 right

748
00:39:55,136 --> 00:40:01,280
Give him any credibility against

749
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:07,680
His credibility what at it cuz I can see her again at your argument is if somebody just keeps saying something

750
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:11,008
Think that might happen and then when something similar happened you just

751
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,032
Takes credit for you

752
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,336
Sure that sounds suspicious like maybe

753
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:19,200
He doesn't know anything you just saying I like the way that you constantly talks about a coming

754
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:25,344
Economic collapse

755
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:30,464
It doesn't actually is it cheapens the prediction

756
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,536
If you add that to all the

757
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,560
Somebody's made that have

758
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:38,656
Not come true to the globalist nuking American cities

759
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:43,008
Rides a big one that he was pretty obsessed with

760
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:45,312
That

761
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,872
Wrong about that you just ignore

762
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:50,944
I'm using s*** you shitted predicting things

763
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,968
Let me throw this out

764
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,504
Because this

765
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,528
Conspiracy theory

766
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,808
Is going to

767
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,648
Break the case wide open alright I'm interested so

768
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,928
Alex is right about ever

769
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:01,952
But

770
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,976
The globalist

771
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,768
Knowing that he's right

772
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,864
Don't do it when he says they're going to do it over and over and over again

773
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,216
To make him look insane but actually that is what Alex believes

774
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,264
Yeah cuz he's talked about like

775
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,408
Occasional maybe maybe they won't do it because we've talked about it we publicize their plan

776
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,176
Exactly

777
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,200
I don't know

778
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,736
It's ridiculous

779
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,272
It's not it's almost

780
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,040
Painful

781
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,320
It really is

782
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,344
Now

783
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,880
Also painful

784
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,160
Is Alex's

785
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,464
Deep-seated hatred of women

786
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,512
Yeah yeah that's in the

787
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,792
Boy listen to

788
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,840
Statistically women are

789
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:43,680
10-20-30 X putting on the study more likely to get in a van

790
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:47,520
When a man that pulls up and get in

791
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,312
Both mental just run or fight

792
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,872
Cuz I know it's scary

793
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:55,967
Courage because they're not naive genetically

794
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,991
Men

795
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,527
A program to fight

796
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,599
Women

797
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:04,927
To try to

798
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,719
Get along there buddy and try to

799
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,487
You eaten

800
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:11,839
He's back a little bit sokoke sure don't hurt me everything's okay

801
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,375
And then she ends up

802
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,679
You know what a basement tortured for she's killed

803
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:20,799
You know you really really gotta believe

804
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:23,359
Inherently genetic trait otherwise you have to been

805
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:26,687
Deal with the fact that we actually live in a society that suppress women

806
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:29,503
For so long and so brutally that

807
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:35,903
Fbe that just acquiescence seems like an almost natural state of being as opposed to constant and

808
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,927
Near Weber

809
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:37,951
Just banana

810
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,255
Genetic

811
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:44,863
We can't do that

812
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,143
Yeah

813
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,447
I'm baffled

814
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:53,567
Constantly end up in in situations are listen to the showtime like

815
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,871
Kimball I'd listen to that

816
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:58,175
Hundred thousands of hours of a show

817
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:58,943
I still like

818
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:05,855
Can't believe you believe that you believe that women are genetically subservient or something

819
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:08,159
Acquiescent what about

820
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,951
Slipped and I'm going to throw this one out

821
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:12,255
Cuz cuz we could easily bring up example

822
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,791
You know you could easily bring up like

823
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,071
Greta Sundberg

824
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:17,631
Or like a Sonia Sotomayor

825
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:24,031
Something along with someone more in Alex's laying maybe a park

826
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:27,103
That's anecdotal that's not enough to prove that

827
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,127
Genetically

828
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,711
Maybe we're not dealing with Sally's loves anecdotal s***

829
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,479
Say

830
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,503
There was a time

831
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:39,135
When women weren't allowed to vote right and the only way that they could get the vote was if a lot of them got

832
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,671
Together

833
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,695
Yeah

834
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:48,095
What would be possible cuz genetically they can't do that

835
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:54,239
Nevermind I was wrong about this the whole time

836
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,287
This is pretty gross

837
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:00,127
Women and children are way more likely to go to Stockholm Syndrome

838
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,967
And maybe that's a survival at maybe it's best sometimes

839
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:09,343
The Romans every other ancient empire with a takeover area would kill men above the age of 10 or 11

840
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,903
Women and girls

841
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:15,231
Because the women and girls would sell them for Saint each other

842
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,327
Within a few days

843
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,911
Tututututu make their children survive

844
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:26,495
Her husband

845
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,775
Cut up and tortured to death

846
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:32,895
Going to give those Roman centurions the best b****** of their life that evening

847
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,199
Kill her children

848
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:43,391
Real men need to come in

849
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,927
Chapters

850
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:45,951
This is BS

851
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:46,975
Yikes

852
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,535
There was a look on your face like

853
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,327
Maybe halfway through that

854
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:55,935
Tablo JetBlue shop

855
00:44:56,191 --> 00:45:02,335
That one was like wow really going to do it huh really really really enjoy the I'm sorry I have

856
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:07,455
To talk like

857
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,247
Accurate

858
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,015
And dumb

859
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:16,927
Illustrate that point without the b******* that's very unnecessary

860
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:19,487
His description of Stockholm syndrome in this case

861
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:22,815
Works but almost in the opposite that he likes

862
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:26,143
Come syndrome actually describes the phenomenon where your

863
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,679
Traps as the

864
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,959
Vacation

865
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,495
Stockholm

866
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:33,823
You're trapped with people who are in your socioeconomic

867
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,591
Status

868
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,871
And then the cops are evil

869
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,663
And you are like oh I guess

870
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,967
In this situation

871
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:44,319
His way of getting women out of Stockholm syndrome is to walk up to them

872
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,343
Scream

873
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:55,327
Which would suggest that they should stay where they are with the people who are not scream

874
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:59,423
Yeah I do think there's a couple things first I don't

875
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,447
Know if

876
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:02,239
Stockholm syndrome even a real thing

877
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:05,055
But it's not

878
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:07,871
It describes the phenomenon of cops being assholes

879
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:08,639
Second

880
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,943
Alex seems to be

881
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:11,711
Saying

882
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,247
Inglot women are weak

883
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,551
Damn they are susceptible to

884
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:20,671
The Stockholm syndrome because they want to give b****** to Centurion to protect our children

885
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,439
Now

886
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:25,535
I think that his solution to this is

887
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,071
We need to control

888
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,375
Aggressively

889
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:32,447
Threatened women to do what we want them to do

890
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,751
Dissolution

891
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:39,103
You do you catch more flies with screaming in their faces that they're lied to

892
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,151
So Alex

893
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,687
Believe that this is the end

894
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,711
My friend

895
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,991
Godzilla

896
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,783
Everything perhaps because

897
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:47,807
Videos a lot of money

898
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:48,831
Soon

899
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,111
Going to be fast.

900
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:53,439
But he likes to bring up this metaphor of like

901
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,463
You know it's

902
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:57,535
We're about to get pulled into Riptide right

903
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,815
Gets sucked under water

904
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:01,375
So what you need to do is take a big breath of air

905
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,655
And that's what he's all about

906
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,191
He's all about telling people

907
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,471
Get a deep breath in

908
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,751
Sure right

909
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:10,847
Bad stuff in the most more predictions what's to come

910
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:14,175
My job before they cut off all the communications

911
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,967
A cyber-attack

912
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:25,439
Wait people's informed so they know what's going on at Ocean you getting the riptide you feel it sucking

913
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,303
And it don't fight it pulls you under

914
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,375
Statistically it's going to pop you back out 30 seconds to minute or two

915
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,471
Going to pop right back out but

916
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:43,871
Joshua

917
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,463
I'm just here tell nobody

918
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,303
HD breath

919
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,911
I mean

920
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:10,239
They want us dead they want us out of the way they made the decision

921
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:20,991
Emergency exit plans during martial law they got their underground

922
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:21,759
Bass

923
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:25,087
Cards are going to kill him

924
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,159
Lcog system self

925
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:30,719
This is just the end of everything

926
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,375
Controller

927
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,167
Okay

928
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:39,935
So

929
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:45,823
Maybe there'll be a fake cyber-attack or maybe a real war right maybe they'll nuke

930
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,103
Again another new predict

931
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,151
Subliminal Russia

932
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:54,271
And then they'll get to all the Senators into their underground bases available access to

933
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,295
But it's all just

934
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,855
The trap to kill them both in their underground bases

935
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,903
To what end I'm not sure

936
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,183
Is it raining

937
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:07,839
Yeah I think so and that is because once ship pops off price editors become Dukes

938
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,751
They control

939
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,775
Parcelsapp

940
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:19,615
I would like I would like inside into the conversation

941
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,407
If we're down to two

942
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:27,039
Cyberattack on the others real war who's on the like

943
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,855
I know we could save just never attack

944
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,879
Be super easy

945
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:37,279
No one would die I mean a few people cuz you know cat you know who pacemakers but that's were evil so we're fine we

946
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:38,815
Or

947
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,911
We could kill billions in a real war which do you want to go with

948
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,191
I feel like that

949
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:44,959
Conversations

950
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:48,799
What but do you don't understand how evil the globalist are and how much they liked

951
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:49,567
The kill people

952
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:56,223
Extreme love to kill people but also are putting a heart attack medication as I see you.

953
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,527
Text when they get it okay great whatever

954
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,807
Okay

955
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:00,831
So dumb

956
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:03,647
Alex seems pretty mad

957
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:07,487
I wonder if you can guess what he's mad about

958
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:13,631
Oh man I just don't inhale executive branch

959
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,423
Oh boy

960
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,471
Then I'm going to go with the build back better at

961
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,007
No-oooooo

962
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:24,383
I'm going to go with the other legislation that's being proposed you you might

963
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,431
Real consequentialism

964
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:32,575
Important information I think that your first instinct would be to think that it was that he's mad that Kamala Harris

965
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:39,231
Would take over for a while while Joe Biden was under

966
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:46,143
Still racist to ignore how meaningless it is don't know but there's bigger issues

967
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,679
Pete budajudge had a baby

968
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:52,287
Weather in New York

969
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,079
American flag

970
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,175
We look at that do look what a, he is look what a traitor is

971
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:01,247
But you know the every photo is him just that fly

972
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:04,831
Why do they do that

973
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:05,599
Start my bike

974
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:10,975
Because they're now going to get ready to get ready him he's served his usefulness

975
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,607
Budajudge had a babies

976
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:19,935
In the hospital bed thought you were so dumb

977
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:22,239
Hospital scrubs

978
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:25,055
Look we had a baby

979
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,359
Haha

980
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:29,151
It's some kid that got

981
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,687
From somebody else

982
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:31,967
I mean

983
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:37,343
Multi-month

984
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,135
Do men have babies

985
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,671
Gaslighting

986
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:42,207
All of it to mind control

987
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:52,959
Oh my gosh I mean

988
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:56,543
I'm gay too. I need to be vice president

989
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,991
1518 hour work days

990
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:08,063
Shrugging of a slave's people living in

991
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,087
Container

992
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:11,135
But it's alright

993
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:13,183
Cookies what what's the answer

994
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:25,983
So one thing that's important to remember about the context

995
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:29,567
Clip is that that was not actually Ric Flair

996
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,407
Dating back

997
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:36,223
1517 years even

998
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:39,807
Conspiracy theory Protective Service

999
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:42,623
He's trying to take away straight people's children to grab them

1000
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,647
The gay couple

1001
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,671
So when you

1002
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,695
You hear him talk about

1003
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,999
Very against

1004
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:50,303
Again adoption

1005
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:56,703
This this is painfully homophobic

1006
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:03,359
Where is does Alex really think that the reason of the working conditions in apple factories isn't more tightly regulated

1007
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,895
Is because Tim Cook is gay

1008
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,431
That's

1009
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,199
Dumb

1010
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,479
I am deeply homophobic

1011
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:15,391
It's obviously the function of Industry more than it is cuz we can't regulate capitalism

1012
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,415
Cuz because

1013
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:20,767
I feel like you're saying that this might be a result of unregulated Kappa

1014
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:22,303
Right and I think you're wrong

1015
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,863
This is the

1016
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,167
It's cuz gay people

1017
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,751
I can get away with anything

1018
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,775
Pink

1019
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,567
We think that they

1020
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:35,871
Are telling us they actually had a baby

1021
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:42,783
I don't know cuz it sounded like he thinks that they have brainwash us into US thinking I don't know

1022
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:46,367
Really had a baby I don't know man had a baby

1023
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,135
I don't know

1024
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,671
Sounds like he that's what you say

1025
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:49,695
Blankets

1026
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:54,815
Close but I don't know man I just think he's really angry people

1027
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:57,631
But that's the problem

1028
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,935
All of what he said

1029
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,983
Just boil it down to just be like I

1030
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:06,079
Cuz otherwise it sounds like you're mad at a scattershot

1031
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,103
Nonsense

1032
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:10,943
Yeah what he saying doesn't make sense

1033
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:17,599
If you believe him to be tolerant

1034
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,391
You're a massive big

1035
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:22,719
Guy back on the show by the name of

1036
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,487
Seaperch

1037
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:26,047
I don't know if you remember this guy is an adventure

1038
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:32,447
The early also is

1039
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:39,359
Entirely convinced that Gavin Newsom was paralyzed by is actually what

1040
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:43,455
So Alex is going to have him back on to do that

1041
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:48,831
His face looking partially paralyzed as

1042
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:51,391
Horses that usually goes away about two weeks

1043
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:53,695
Children are vaccinated

1044
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:55,999
Pinkerton's written about that as well

1045
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,047
On his sub stat account but I wanted to

1046
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:01,631
I just all this cardiac news and information

1047
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:04,959
I coming out first but yeah that photo there you can really see that

1048
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:08,031
Book study paralyzes different

1049
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:10,847
Doesn't has the devil on the other side not on that side

1050
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,127
Really dramatic

1051
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:16,479
So there's a video going around that purported to show one side of Gavin newsom's face

1052
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:20,063
Drooping that's proving that the vaccine gave him like Bell's palsy

1053
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,599
Video was edited

1054
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:25,695
Manipulated by someone

1055
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:31,071
Fake first before editing is widely available even on newsom's own Twitter page

1056
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,607
The cardiac

1057
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:34,911
Stuff that they're talking about it's all just

1058
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:39,007
Stuff that he's misrepresenting there's data on

1059
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:41,567
Responding to again

1060
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,615
But this is kind of fun

1061
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,151
Steve is sad

1062
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:50,527
Oh no no no debate I don't know this is a complete disaster

1063
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,807
You don't should not be given to

1064
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:52,575
Anyone

1065
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:55,903
Under any circumstances nehme comorbidity

1066
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,207
Doesn't support that

1067
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:01,535
And nobody seems to want to debate me on this

1068
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,351
I have tried to debate anyone in the medical community

1069
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,679
Accuse me of spreading misinformation

1070
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:12,287
Just wants to debate me that's the best way to silence me as to debate me nobody

1071
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:14,335
No you'll be mainstream

1072
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,103
Academia

1073
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,895
Nobody in the CDC

1074
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,431
Nobody me a PA

1075
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:22,527
They all want to just ignore everything I'm saying because

1076
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:24,063
Cuz they don't want to confront

1077
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:24,831
What's going on

1078
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:30,207
Unfortunately you're not in any of those groups that Steve is

1079
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:35,071
I would say that because he's a weirdo

1080
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:38,399
Is that what you don't want to be seen with in public

1081
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:42,751
Maybe you ought to get into the mud with this this kind of

1082
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:47,871
Idiot I wouldn't do it now not mean I would do it but if I was one of them I wouldn't do it

1083
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:50,687
That's why I'm not one of them

1084
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:53,247
NYU be open Tuesday

1085
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,271
So

1086
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:57,855
Steve and Alex were talking about this the vaccine

1087
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:00,415
And they're saying like it's going to be

1088
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:03,231
Such a disaster for the medical community

1089
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,791
And no one will ever trust them again

1090
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:10,911
Right and the mainstream media no one will ever trust them but they realize we've had the vaccine for month

1091
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:14,495
Months and months are plenty of people are not dead

1092
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,519
That's true

1093
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:18,335
But I want to focus on this part of this

1094
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:20,383
They're talking about like the the

1095
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:24,735
Trust is going to be completely gone no one's going to trust the medical community or

1096
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,527
The mainstream media ever again

1097
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,551
Because of the

1098
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:29,855
The whole charade of the vaccine

1099
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:30,623
Chef

1100
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:34,207
I don't understand why they're bringing that up

1101
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:37,791
They don't want people to trust the mainstream media

1102
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:42,655
That's exactly what they want

1103
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:51,103
It's a good boy. It's a really dumb for them to be all like cono people won't believe you anymore exact

1104
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:57,503
Actually the outcome I rely on to make money

1105
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:03,647
Or take got off the board

1106
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,183
You're going to destroy

1107
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:08,767
Police and end in The credibility vaccines for Generations

1108
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:11,839
Destroy medicine you act like this

1109
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:16,191
Absolutely and that's exactly what they're doing but it's not just

1110
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:19,775
People are not going to leave her doctors anymore

1111
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:23,871
I said that's what's going to come out of this door knocking

1112
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:26,687
You're not going to believe anything that Congress says

1113
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:29,503
They're not going to believe anything that the mainstream media says

1114
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:33,599
And they're not going to believe any of the three-letter agencies the FDA the CDC

1115
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:34,623
In the NIH

1116
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,415
That's what's going to come out of this

1117
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:42,559
Those are all positive outcome for Alex

1118
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:48,959
Exactly you shouldn't trust doctors you should get these zinc and iodine supplement

1119
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:53,567
Vitamins all of this is exactly what Alex would want

1120
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:56,127
A little weird

1121
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,151
I I just

1122
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:59,711
Here's my vet I want an itemized

1123
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:00,479
List of what

1124
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:02,271
They do trust doctors on now

1125
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:05,087
Like they clearly they trust them on like

1126
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:10,719
Cancer right now just rub some dirt on it

1127
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:17,119
Like guys I I mean I don't know yet there are diseases and s*** that are unquestioned by these people it right they would maybe

1128
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:22,495
Broken arm broken Armada it somebody will set their broken arm for him right

1129
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:24,799
But why is that okay and not

1130
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,823
You know it's like

1131
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:29,663
It's All or Nothing if you think that the medical establishment is murdering

1132
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:36,063
You can't be like well I mean if they give me the vaccine don't murder me but obviously if I broke my leg I need to go get

1133
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:40,927
Mileiq think they're not creative enough to figure out a way to kill you with a broken leg

1134
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:50,911
These doctors are evil men of doing it for a long time but can kill you if toenails

1135
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,959
Problem

1136
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:59,359
Yeah I just think it's a little silly for them to pretend that they have any investment at all in people

1137
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,639
Having faith or trust

1138
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:03,967
Authoritative sources government agencies

1139
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:10,367
It's their business is to erode that trust and there's nothing they want more

1140
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:16,767
Rendered obsolete by a mainstream media performing exactly they want to live in a society

1141
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,303
Heidi where everyone is

1142
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:21,631
Comfortable and has no

1143
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:25,471
Bulshit flying around the people are profiting off of heavily

1144
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:29,567
Speaking of bulshit here's Steve disqualifying

1145
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:31,615
Himself as someone who should listen to

1146
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:36,735
I just read all these articles and studies

1147
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:39,807
Where people were shot

1148
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:41,087
Especially take a booster

1149
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,391
Meaning

1150
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:45,439
Before the shot

1151
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,023
Product to me

1152
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:52,095
Yeah if you look on the exposed

1153
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,631
Website

1154
01:00:53,887 --> 01:01:00,031
They did some really nice graph showing vaccine efficacy waning so we

1155
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:01,567
16 GPS to work

1156
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:03,615
And then goes down

1157
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:07,199
20 and then goes negative which means you're more likely to be infected

1158
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:14,111
If you get the Maxine amazing we talked about this at a previous episode this is a doctor said of his.

1159
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:19,487
If he's somebody who would find that to be compelling

1160
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:24,351
And not look into it a little bit further not recognize that this information has been

1161
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:29,471
Manipulated very transparently I don't think I'm going to trust him

1162
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,239
I mean

1163
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,007
If you give

1164
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,287
Give me any graph

1165
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:38,943
That clearly has white out on it this is crossed out

1166
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:41,759
Pizza Hut

1167
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:45,343
Permanent marker

1168
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,135
You don't ever get

1169
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:48,415
To get listen to again

1170
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:52,255
Ya-ya-ya among the many sins of

1171
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:55,839
That expose article

1172
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:58,655
Together did take out lines of data

1173
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:00,703
That didn't work for his

1174
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:02,495
That is

1175
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,263
Disqualifying

1176
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,055
It was wrong

1177
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:08,639
If somebody asked you for like some accounting information

1178
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:15,039
And you didn't want them to know the full accounting information so you took the let's chat brand

1179
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,831
The QuickBooks file

1180
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:18,879
And then gave it to another

1181
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:20,671
No do that

1182
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:23,743
If you're not

1183
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:24,511
Convince

1184
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,815
Jose things

1185
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:28,095
Shouldn't be

1186
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:32,703
You're not convinced by the fake video of Gavin newsom's face

1187
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,263
You will be convinced okay

1188
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,799
By Steve

1189
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:40,383
17 pieces of details and information

1190
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:43,967
What's targeting in the Newsom

1191
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:47,807
Yasso

1192
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:50,111
Look I'm not 17 different sources

1193
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:52,671
Different pieces of evidence

1194
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,207
And they're all consistent

1195
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,743
With the hypothesis

1196
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:58,559
Bad Gavin Newsom is vaccine injured

1197
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:02,143
So I went to his substack which I should say he's

1198
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:04,703
Heavily promoting

1199
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:06,751
I think that's the game

1200
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:11,103
But I found his article Gavin Newsom is lying about his vaccine injury

1201
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:13,407
And here he has his list of

1202
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:15,455
Point 1700

1203
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:21,855
It's grown to 19 what is the only do prime numbers must okay so I think it was probably like

1204
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:25,439
Qanon excited 17 no s*** better add a few more

1205
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,231
So here's the first one

1206
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:32,607
His kids were in school on November 1st through 3rd during the climate meeting when he was supposed to be there

1207
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:33,631
So what was it

1208
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,423
Excuse for not attending by Zoom

1209
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:39,775
It couldn't be to be a good dad since his kids weren't home so what was it

1210
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:42,079
Why didn't they explain it on November 1st

1211
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,615
Why do we still not know

1212
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:46,175
How come none of the fact-checkers ask this question

1213
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:49,247
Could it be the fact Checkers are biased

1214
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:50,783
Or

1215
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:54,623
Could it be that you never looked for the answers to that question

1216
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:56,159
Fuse number 3

1217
01:03:56,415 --> 01:04:02,559
Alex Jones reported his sources confirmed that his sources observe doctor's we're going in and out of his house during the

1218
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:04,351
The. The Gavin was out of sight

1219
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,631
So one of his

1220
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:06,655
Pieces of evidence

1221
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:07,679
Is

1222
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:08,703
A second

1223
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:15,103
Hand account of third-hand information, Alex and now he's using this article to make an

1224
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:18,431
On Alex's show that relies on evidence that he got from Alex

1225
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,735
You know that Ouroboros of far-right beliefs

1226
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:22,783
Adjusting penalty

1227
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,087
Quotes this is number eight

1228
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,879
Gavin had his bad

1229
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:30,463
Edcite away from the camera when he appeared the lighting was poor in the folk

1230
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,231
This was bad

1231
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:32,511
And the shots were law

1232
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:39,423
We never saw him walk on camera during his first public appearance after the recovery.

1233
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:42,239
I got your number 12 quotes

1234
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:47,359
Multiple Twitter posting suggested Bell's Palsy Oregon Beret syndrome

1235
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:52,223
Just multiple Twitter post adjusted that I don't know what that means

1236
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:54,015
Suggested

1237
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:54,783
Sure

1238
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:55,807
Here's number 18

1239
01:04:56,063 --> 01:05:00,671
Clearly I'm not the only one with suspicions here and then there's a hyperlink to

1240
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:03,231
Check out this meme page

1241
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,535
I want

1242
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:08,095
To see that episode of Columbo where he's like

1243
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,119
Just one more

1244
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:10,911
Check out this meme

1245
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:14,751
The last one

1246
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,799
There's some people who tweeted saying you did

1247
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,591
Deers

1248
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:20,383
Audi's list December 19th

1249
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:22,943
I have more but it would compromise sources

1250
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:29,343
What's the temperature

1251
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:33,951
Not fair. This is a really stupid list

1252
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:38,815
Oh man I want I want to go back to all those 1920s drawing room

1253
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:40,351
Now we get all the suspects

1254
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:46,751
Together and solve this together in the same room around the dinner table I want that but with this level of information

1255
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:48,799
I wanted to be like

1256
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:55,967
He's does Steely Dan over there he jumped up side and then we saw somebody from another town over whom

1257
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:59,295
Friend of his over there who said that maybe one time you did it

1258
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:05,183
I think it is Steve Kerr's is more Hastings than Florida

1259
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:12,351
This is bad so you don't have to believe Steve

1260
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,935
But he has another reason why

1261
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,471
Still right

1262
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,263
I'm now at

1263
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:21,823
The stage where I'm willing to risk some money

1264
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:25,919
Alright I'm rolling now willing to risk

1265
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:27,455
As of yesterday

1266
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,015
I just put on an offer to say

1267
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:33,087
Gavin willing to bet you a million dollars that you're a liar

1268
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:35,647
So I'm risking a million-dollar

1269
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:37,439
You don't have to believe me

1270
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:39,231
At all in my analysis

1271
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,767
And what the evidence showed

1272
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:43,327
All you have to believe is that there's some millionaire

1273
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:48,447
Who is willing to risk a million dollars that he's right so he probably thinks he's right

1274
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:49,727
And

1275
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,007
I can guarantee you

1276
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:53,311
Gavin Newsom is not going to take my bed

1277
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:56,895
No way no s***

1278
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:02,271
Wow what a great past the governor of California is not going to dignify this b*******

1279
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:04,575
Yeah I'm going to take home

1280
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:05,599
Billion Dollar Bet

1281
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:11,231
From now on anybody want to bet me anything for a million dollars this was on November 16th you said

1282
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,791
This got bumped up to 5 million

1283
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:15,583
And then on November 18th

1284
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:18,143
Is an update on his

1285
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:23,007
I've raised my offer to name your price in a private email to Jennifer Newsom

1286
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,799
No response so far

1287
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:25,823
Wow

1288
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:29,663
Unlimited money for a blank piece of paper I'm impressed

1289
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:34,527
We make the Guinness Book of World Records for highest price ever paid for a blank piece of paper

1290
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:41,439
Gavin newsom's wife he's harassing members

1291
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:43,231
I'll give you any amount of money

1292
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:45,535
Wow you know what in order

1293
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:51,423
Debate me order to disbelieve this you would have to have an operating premise

1294
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:53,983
With I mean I'm sure no evidence

1295
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:58,335
That rich people are willing to blow a lot of money on stupid ideas

1296
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:01,663
You would have to believe something so insane

1297
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:03,455
But no one

1298
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,479
Whatever believe

1299
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:08,831
Better rich person would blow their money on a stupid thing ever

1300
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:09,855
A boy

1301
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:12,927
So we won't last clip here and it's

1302
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:18,303
It says Steve explaining exactly how this bet would go listening to this

1303
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,583
Imagine

1304
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:22,399
Imagine a world

1305
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:28,799
Where is sitting Governor would engage with this bull

1306
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,847
This is how it will play out

1307
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,639
Imagine

1308
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:34,175
A governor of

1309
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:36,479
California deciding

1310
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:42,623
I'm going to get involved we're getting some great fanfic that's so dumb

1311
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:44,159
I'm offering a million dollars

1312
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:46,463
All he has to do is give me a piece of paper

1313
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:48,511
List all the doctors

1314
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:49,791
That he talked to

1315
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:53,631
For the purposes of discussing

1316
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:54,655
Vaccine injury

1317
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,959
From the time that he got vaccinated

1318
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:58,239
21 days later

1319
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:00,031
I don't want to know anything else

1320
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,591
That's it just a list of doctors

1321
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:06,431
On that piece of paper is the permission

1322
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,479
Becky G to those doctors and

1323
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:11,039
He orders those doctors to discuss with me

1324
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:14,367
Any conversations relating to vaccine injury

1325
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:17,183
If Gavin Newsom

1326
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,719
Is telling the truth

1327
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,535
Kill give me a blank sheet of paper

1328
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:25,119
And I will give him a check for a million dollars

1329
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:26,399
Now

1330
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:28,703
To me that's a deal that most people

1331
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:29,983
Shouldn't refuse

1332
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,263
He's reviewing

1333
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,287
Nothing

1334
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,055
About

1335
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:33,823
Any others

1336
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:35,359
Personal medical information

1337
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:37,151
The piece of paper is blank

1338
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:37,919
And Heat

1339
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:40,223
A check for a million dollars

1340
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:44,831
You got your well-known guy you got plenty of money so

1341
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,927
Well what's stopping is

1342
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:49,695
Him

1343
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:50,463
Not telling the truth

1344
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:53,535
And that's why he won't accept my bed because

1345
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:54,559
When he

1346
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,839
If he's telling the truth

1347
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,375
He's going to hand me a piece

1348
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:58,655
The paper that is not blank

1349
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:01,727
And the piece of paper isn't blank

1350
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,263
You know immediately

1351
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:04,543
That he lied to pee

1352
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:08,895
So basically not engaging with this stupid bet

1353
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:09,663
Is proof

1354
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,711
Perceive that he's right

1355
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,991
Ridiculous

1356
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:15,807
And essentially you know the reason

1357
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:16,831
You never

1358
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:20,159
Talk to you even talk to this guy.

1359
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:21,951
What he's doing is essentially

1360
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:26,047
Engaging in blackmail but without Leverage

1361
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:29,631
Give him a blank piece of paper

1362
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:36,287
That's not going to be the end of it you know in the same way that if you give in to the demands of a blackmailer they're going to

1363
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:40,639
Continue the blackmailing released

1364
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:44,735
This is going to be a thing

1365
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:47,551
I were to tell you I know you saw a doctor

1366
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:49,599
It's this f****** stupid

1367
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:51,647
Pointless to engage with this nonsense

1368
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:53,183
But it plays

1369
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:57,023
Her PR stuff in the right-wing media going to let you can say

1370
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:03,167
So if you have his conscience was clean you'd have no problem I give him a million dollars

1371
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,471
What's what's what about that is that

1372
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:08,543
Even a reasonable like conservative who

1373
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:10,847
Buys into this as being a good idea

1374
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,127
Would never take that bet

1375
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:14,687
It's a stupid person who's like

1376
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:16,479
Oh you're going to pay up

1377
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:19,807
You're not no hand to there's no strings attached

1378
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:26,207
You f****** liar

1379
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:31,839
In the personal they would never believe that even best case scenario it's still

1380
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:33,119
Not good

1381
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:36,447
Like okay you got a million dollars but you had to

1382
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:41,055
The public really engage and justify and sort of give credibility to

1383
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:43,871
It's the one like Steve as being worth

1384
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:49,759
Do your time and engagement oh yeah and that alone is publicity that Steve couldn't Buy

1385
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:51,807
Yep forget substack

1386
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:54,111
Which is why he would never accept

1387
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:56,159
Is it from somebody who doesn't have that

1388
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:56,927
To offer

1389
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:59,487
You know he's never going to accept this bet

1390
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:00,255
From somebody from this

1391
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:01,791
Cdcr the FDA

1392
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:05,375
Because why would he's going to give him the juice

1393
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:08,703
Frank Newsom or if it's somebody on TV or if

1394
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:12,287
Somebody like that who we can turn it into a spectacle around that of course

1395
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:15,359
Yeah that's what he's going to do

1396
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:17,919
Probably not

1397
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:20,991
Conceivably quite rich

1398
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:23,551
Clearly it does seem that way

1399
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:27,391
So this episode was gross in a number of ways

1400
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:34,815
I think I think you know you see you see a lot of pretty explicit chauvinism

1401
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:37,119
Homophobia

1402
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:38,143
I just

1403
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:40,447
Just outright bigotry all over the place

1404
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,983
Just really taking those box

1405
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:44,031
Yeah yeah

1406
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:45,823
It sucks

1407
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:48,639
It's hard to believe why people want him off the air.

1408
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:55,039
Hard to understand why people would be like you suck

1409
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,319
Oway

1410
01:12:57,855 --> 01:13:03,999
Jordan will be back for another episode in the near future but until then we have website

1411
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:10,655
Yes we are also we aren't underscore fighting that go to bed Jordan
