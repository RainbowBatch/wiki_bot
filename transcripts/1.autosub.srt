Alexandra Thurston color

00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:12,288
Boy

3
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:17,664
Welcome to knowledge fight that is our official opening theme song

4
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:18,688
I love you

5
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,736
I will marry you

6
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:24,320
The first time

7
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:27,136
This is a show

8
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,160
I'm going to

9
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,952
Have a little discussion with my friend

10
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:30,976
Jordan here

11
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,816
That's me

12
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:35,840
We're off to a great

13
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,656
Monkey off the top

14
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:41,728
Experience podcast

15
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:45,056
Yeah I've been doing this for years

16
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:51,456
Wonk City

17
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:58,624
Country mix

18
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:03,232
So I have for the last while been a bit obsessed

19
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,280
With I want Alex Jones

20
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,560
Infowars Fame

21
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,144
The world has turned

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,424
That's cool.

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,448
A soap opera title

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,776
I have become more and more aware

25
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,800
Then I want

26
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,360
To do a better job of covering what he does

27
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,176
It's kind of like a Chris Hardwick thing

28
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:28,832
Where is the Talking Dead

29
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:35,232
Around wondering

30
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,768
We're all dead

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,048
But

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,096
I want to I want to I want to say this

33
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:47,520
Off the top and I don't want those

34
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,800
Ever

35
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,336
Come up as a confusion

36
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,616
First thing

37
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,688
Iron no way want Alex Jones to be taken off the air

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,504
I think what he does is

39
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:04,672
What was the number one podcast next year

40
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,232
His continued success

41
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,072
Pink wooden does borders on entertaining

42
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,144
And on the other side of that border is irresponsible

43
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,680
But at the same time

44
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,704
I am

45
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,752
Supposed to censoring things

46
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,568
I want people to view him in contacts

47
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,432
But I would never want to shut him down or say like he can't do what he does

48
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
Because

49
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,480
That's an easy

50
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,016
Attack

51
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,296
Slippery slope

52
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:37,696
Who's next

53
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,000
Say like professionally say

54
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,536
Dumb s***

55
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,888
Sure if we exactly exactly

56
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,680
Recorded in Summit

57
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,240
Is there a very foolishly on my part

58
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:53,056
If we start going after those guys

59
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,592
Snacks that

60
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,360
We like

61
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,760
Subscribed

62
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,320
Say whatever you want as long as

63
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,088
It's not

64
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,928
You know advocating violence against somebody a threat reliable

65
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,280
Okay

66
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:19,168
Whatever I'm going to say and whatever you're going to say I want this to be super clear

67
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,032
There's a big part of me that really admires Alex Jones

68
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:29,664
He is you're an insane person is an amazing broadcast

69
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,456
If you really take

70
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,992
The tricks of Broadcasting

71
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,784
And apply him to them

72
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,600
He's insanely good

73
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,160
Did you could not say a lot of the stuff

74
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,232
He does without being really good at your job

75
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,536
I think that's something that will come out we will see

76
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,840
Point where you be at

77
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
He's great

78
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
Right I admire his

79
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,168
Still

80
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,448
I don't like what he does with

81
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:57,568
Well I think that's probably going to be the central

82
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,128
The central Battle of this whole podcast is

83
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,712
You trying to prove to me that I should admire him and

84
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,344
I don't think so I just wanted to make a VR off the top because it's

85
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:14,976
It would be easy for anyone listening to think that this is just going to turn into a beat-up fast

86
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,768
NBA

87
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,631
I don't think people who listen to him or stupid

88
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,679
I don't think his fans are stupid

89
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:30,079
That's actually on the way here that's something I was thinking about where are we on the

90
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,127
Stupid / evil

91
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
Personally yeah

92
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,967
I'm not not not you

93
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,807
Although we're probably more on the evil side

94
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,391
Most of the evil things I've done in my life have been

95
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,415
Accidents

96
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:49,791
Let's today you're not a premeditated murder, you're like a second-degree murder

97
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:56,191
Mega mega

98
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:00,287
A Rube Goldberg machine and a kill someone

99
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,847
What happened

100
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:09,247
Let's do this you okay we want to start with I want to start out with something a little bit fun and it kind of I think isn't

101
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
Decorative

102
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
This is

103
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
One day

104
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:18,463
In the Life of Alex or from the January 2nd

105
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,511
2017

106
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,327
Putting this out a couple days after

107
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,375
But we have to because of just like

108
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,143
We have jobs

109
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,215
I wish that I could just hire jobs are not

110
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:34,079
The brain battle as much as I wish it was

111
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
I wish

112
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,407
Then I could just sit around and isolate these clips

113
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,943
Illuminate on them but

114
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,319
Occasionally dropping out

115
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,927
Every episode we may change the name of this podcast

116
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
So

117
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,767
For those of you who don't know who Alex Jones is

118
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:57,119
He is formerly a wild conspiracy theory broadcaster

119
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,911
Aventurine

120
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,703
2A

121
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,983
B of A preacher

122
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,031
And then now is

123
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,311
Basically just

124
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,591
Super into Trump

125
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
Because he believes

126
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,895
The Trump is going

127
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,431
Destroy the globalist

128
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,455
Okay

129
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,991
Who are the

130
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:19,135
It's a nebulous job

131
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,279
What about the article

132
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,815
MS.

133
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,703
The globalist are but they are the ones

134
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,543
He's again and we know some of the characters

135
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,847
But you'll throw out these people who want

136
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,895
There to be more

137
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
Trans

138
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,735
Atlantic Partnerships

139
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,879
Philosophically opposed to

140
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,951
In principle

141
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
But

142
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,839
Small aspect

143
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,191
I might actually agree with him

144
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,239
Is it was just

145
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,287
Curon bile

146
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,103
All day everyday for 3 hours

147
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:17,503
Commercials commercial

148
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,295
Start with one of the things that I think

149
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,319
Is

150
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,367
Spectacularly indicative

151
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
Of

152
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,671
His style of broad

153
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,487
A couple of twists

154
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,023
From

155
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,559
This day's episode

156
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,839
That highlight

157
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,863
Attendance

158
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,887
See within him

159
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:40,799
Want to tell you things but not want there's this like

160
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,847
Music given take

161
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,383
That he does

162
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,247
Let's go back to the expert broadcasting thing there's an amazing like ability to

163
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,111
Tell you things and not tell you things simultaneously that's that's good

164
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,671
Bojangles

165
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
Let's

166
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,743
Let's talk about the central

167
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
What kind of idea of the spot

168
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,839
And Infowars obsessed

169
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,703
And I

170
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,495
Euro

171
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,567
Totally accurate by your description

172
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,591
I'm fat

173
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:18,431
Alright I believe that there's a certain responsibility the people have

174
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:22,527
Do you like my ex-girlfriends I'm just

175
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,295
Fascinated

176
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,879
Recent actions that don't involve me

177
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:27,903
Haikyuu Hinata

178
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,487
Bring up me and Alex's past relationship

179
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
Really

180
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,327
Brutal

181
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,631
Install your bike

182
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,191
All My Ex's Live in Texas

183
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,495
Also one of my favorite things

184
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,567
Is he says the opening of the show and talked about how he's

185
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,127
Deep within occupied Texas

186
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:56,831
The only occupied Texas Missouri

187
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
The first clip

188
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,439
In this one

189
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:06,047
It also showcases what I would describe as

190
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,327
Glaring

191
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,119
False humility that he has

192
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,679
Because honestly I don't think

193
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,519
Many of us are going to be able to hear you during those very near future I

194
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,847
I honestly believe that

195
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:25,503
Reading that I'm calling is my personal view on what I think is happening and like I said

196
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:32,159
Assassinated

197
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,327
Personally has a long-haul truck driver at this point I'm considering

198
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,863
Putting my dog going home

199
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,287
What I'm doing

200
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:54,943
So what's this caller is describing these paranoid fantasies about how someone's going to murder Alex jump

201
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,735
Alex is sitting there making a

202
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,087
Before before we get into it

203
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,391
The response crazy nonsense he's about

204
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:09,279
Here's the thing I wonder about right-wing people who are always assuming that

205
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:15,679
Crazy right-wing people are going to be assassinated

206
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:22,079
Always Harvey Milk or Kathie Gifford the mountains

207
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:22,847
Do good

208
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,127
Because

209
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
Liberals

210
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,431
And progressives

211
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,711
Ultimately

212
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,551
I think that's really what it is

213
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
Spin

214
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,855
Maybe I don't know

215
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,951
Operation

216
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,999
You know it's the globalist

217
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,815
Staking out the progressives in order to create social chaos

218
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,607
It's this sort of logic

219
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,679
You can't really get out of because it just becomes circular

220
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:53,055
This caller has raised this concern about how Trump and him are going to be taken out

221
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,079
And here's Alex

222
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,831
Imagine the media together

223
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,927
Just because

224
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,511
I don't need to warn people in person

225
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:20,191
I'm at the point where I just know that

226
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,055
This is so serious I'm like I can do more here

227
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,247
That I don't even care about me

228
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:35,807
Okay

229
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,623
Alright you remember bunker my man

230
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,695
He's in he's in the bunker

231
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,999
An occupied

232
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,535
The Infowars Studio

233
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,559
Right

234
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,863
The delightful people like Rob do

235
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:52,447
And Joanne McAdoo

236
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,751
Lee Ann McAdoo sounds like a made-up

237
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,335
These are people who I don't want to talk about

238
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,151
Some folks are going out digging in Dallas

239
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:07,551
Yeah podcast Network spin-offs

240
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,623
Owen Shroyer

241
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:16,255
We're going to we're going to be so busy we're going to hire different hosts

242
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:20,095
And at Age 3 it's going to start on the Alex Jones's kid beat

243
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,911
That's that's a good at raising raising up soldiers

244
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,471
Play three-year-old son

245
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:30,335
Will start covering Alex Jones 13 year old son who is a correspondent for

246
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,431
Equivalent

247
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
Open 203

248
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:41,599
Beat up on him he seems like a good kid

249
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,879
Avoid is

250
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,927
Adjust talkingshit

251
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,999
Who don't deserve it

252
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,583
I would say

253
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,167
In the name of those churches that we don't really look back on Van

254
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,495
I remember there was a see what the flag

255
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:03,359
We like the celebration we're before-school everyone gather up and pray at the flag

256
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,895
Pray for our

257
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,919
The horrible culture

258
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:11,039
Oh I remember doing that cuz I blocked it out of my

259
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:17,439
I apologize for no

260
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
My friends

261
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,743
And I really regret that now

262
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,559
And I feel similarly for this kid

263
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,375
Right like Rex Jones I don't know

264
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,679
Do like 8 if you believe

265
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
God bless you

266
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,727
8:30

267
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,007
Like no one

268
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,847
No one should believe what they will believe as an adult at 13

269
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:41,247
Never find a 29-year old man to be like

270
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:45,087
Time somebody took this thirteen-year-old down to pay I also wonder if he's paying him

271
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,671
New paying a song for these reports absolutely

272
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,231
Absolutely

273
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,399
I think indicated this beautiful thing that Alex does where he wants to tell you

274
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:05,311
But he was invited to have a meeting with drops

275
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,527
But then that wasn't enough so the end of the clip they had to explain

276
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,439
Another time that I think is

277
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
Pretty amazing

278
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,023
But this is actually

279
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,559
A little bit longer and start

280
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
What's with

281
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,375
What I can only describe

282
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,911
Amazing

283
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,935
Fanfiction

284
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,983
About political intrigue

285
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,775
I was hoping for Twilight but let's

286
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,543
Let's move on

287
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,335
Just changed couple names

288
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,687
The personal email server do face Glee have

289
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,223
Bella and Edward

290
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,503
Alright

291
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,111
Describe Hillary

292
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,463
Underneath

293
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,999
Like other spies have done

294
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,583
For everybody in the world

295
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,655
And he would say where she stood on China

296
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,751
So they knew what she was about

297
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,199
Not as far as I can tell there's no evidence

298
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:19,551
I also feel like he doesn't know what Dropbox is

299
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,599
Are Housewives

300
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:26,463
He likes to go to park in movies

301
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:32,863
And then the reading real life they just go through garbage that's another late Motif it'll come I'm not on this episode but a lot of Thai

302
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,399
He does use movies

303
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,167
2A

304
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
Explain the real world

305
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,239
Like recently did a breakdown of

306
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,055
The new alien movie that's coming out next year

307
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:47,455
About how what the Illuminati really believes about the train

308
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:50,015
Knows the plot to the new alien movie coming out next

309
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:56,159
It's got to be have you got documents absolutely

310
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,695
Rebecca

311
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,999
She also had one-sided policy

312
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,559
Fees for the aliens

313
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
Dropbox

314
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,119
By the way that's been confirmed

315
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,239
Push it

316
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
Perfect

317
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,527
Us intelligence

318
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,807
Stop

319
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,879
Double crossing Trump the next morning

320
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,439
Old Trump

321
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
Coming after you

322
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,407
Everything I said

323
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,455
How could they

324
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,831
But let me see

325
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,743
Alright

326
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,279
So it looks let's

327
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:11,679
Tear this apart piece-by-piece end up being a little bit long because

328
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,215
Before we start recording I want

329
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:17,055
I explained to you that I don't want to play Things wildly out of context

330
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,359
Unfair game to play

331
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,383
That is the best I

332
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
I'm going to

333
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,247
As fast as I can

334
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,551
I'm going to keep this deadly serious

335
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
Yeah

336
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
So

337
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,903
The point I think is that he talks to Trump

338
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:40,607
Well I think there's a few things that we get into there at the beginning is she's created

339
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
Digital dropbox

340
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,447
Yeah which is proving that is confirmed

341
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,727
Jeff just like

342
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
I feel like

343
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,543
Everybody

344
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:56,991
I have a drop box

345
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:01,599
Open app

346
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,391
He works for drop-off

347
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:08,511
Perry right there

348
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,583
We should keep a running tally of Goofy

349
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,191
Alex Alex

350
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,751
Right

351
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,287
Secret agent

352
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,823
For the Dropbox corporate

353
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:27,967
Okay so she created this Dropbox rather confirm find out what she's going to do to them

354
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,735
Right

355
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,271
I meant pay her to not do it

356
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
I guess

357
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,063
That's

358
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,879
That sort of the implication

359
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,415
Can't argue with that

360
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,695
How could you

361
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
Because

362
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:42,047
Beyond the realm of possibility

363
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:46,143
No why would you say that

364
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,471
First first

365
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,287
China is not a guy

366
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:58,687
It's not a guy before 1 billion Park

367
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:04,831
Together China as a as a

368
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,159
Like if you asked him to name the politburo in China

369
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,183
Do you think he could

370
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,487
I didn't know if that's a person or a building

371
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:16,863
States well it's a collective of the politburo 87 is from Russia

372
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,239
These are these are like

373
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,519
I don't know.

374
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:28,639
You could call them the Illuminati around and talk about what it is they're going to

375
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,455
They are not

376
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:37,343
100 likes and Altos active

377
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,415
Caillou

378
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,183
You know like

379
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,719
Inspire

380
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,887
Just lost Alex Jones

381
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:54,495
What episode is Alex Jones

382
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,055
Me zero lose because the

383
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,103
The fundamental Point Still Remains

384
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
That

385
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:06,271
The idea that you created a digital dropbox where people could find out stuff like that

386
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:09,087
As we keep saying digital

387
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:12,415
It's smart it's it's it's essentially

388
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,463
Grading of verbal hashtag

389
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,767
This is the End again

390
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,375
These are the elements that you have to take apart

391
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,423
Just be like oh this is what he's doing

392
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,823
In the same way as well

393
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,127
Is easily

394
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,175
Capable of sticking in your mouth

395
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:39,295
Like I said I know I can't get digital dropbox out of my head

396
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:45,183
If if somebody asked me to hey could you just put that in my Dropbox I be like

397
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:51,583
Underneath that park bench over there

398
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,631
But it is an Old Fashioned

399
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,423
Trick that oral tradition

400
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,703
Cultures would use

401
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,519
In the same way every time he talks about

402
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,543
The Chinese

403
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,335
He calls them the Communist Chinese

404
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,127
Right it's a it's a

405
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,407
Called using an epithet

406
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,247
And not necessarily like a negative epithet that but it's just using

407
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,551
Something to characterize a noun

408
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,111
Makes it stick in your in your memory more

409
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:17,696
And same way that they would always call Achilles rage-filled Achilles

410
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,232
Or Brave Odysseus

411
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,536
In in The Iliad and the Odyssey

412
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,584
It is a really good trick when you don't

413
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
I have paper

414
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,632
To get people to remember that

415
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,656
The mnemonic tree

416
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,936
And he uses that

417
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,216
So f****** well

418
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,496
Digital dropbox

419
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,776
Is probably not even in

420
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,568
Intended to be like that

421
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,592
But it still is

422
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,504
He's there was a deal made

423
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,064
Where is this

424
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832
Right

425
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,904
The only way for this claim to be proven

426
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,464
4

427
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,280
Some information with the digital dropbox

428
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,352
But it's been confirmed

429
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,144
Through unconfirm Channel

430
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,912
Or whatever

431
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:05,312
Yeah I know I feel like you can just find somebody was like oh yeah I put something into

432
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:10,176
That Dropbox has been put money in account

433
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,224
Where

434
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,624
Digital dropbox and islands that are the foundation to make a donation to The

435
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,392
Foundation

436
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:30,656
So I meant like the only way for it to be proven that they

437
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,704
Hillary Step Down

438
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,312
Immediately because she was afraid of this information of the digital dropbox coming out

439
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,872
They had overheard somehow Trump

440
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,896
Actually has

441
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:47,296
All of the intelligence agencies in his way and all the only way for that to ever come out is for

442
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,320
It to go down

443
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:55,232
Yeah I don't know if you know anything about the intelligence agencies

444
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,536
They kind of are on Trump's side

445
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:04,192
Pretty pretty

446
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,216
Fused me

447
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,240
Is that

448
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:09,312
He's insisting that Hillary and the Democrats

449
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,128
Yeah made a deal on Election night

450
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:17,504
He has very few details by which I mean

451
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,552
About what

452
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,392
We know there's a deal we don't know what that deal is

453
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,928
The next

454
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,464
They are betraying

455
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:32,352
Right we don't know how they're betraying him because we don't know what their deal

456
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:43,104
It makes no sense to make that deal to begin with if you're going to flip on it the next morning

457
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,152
I think it makes perfect sense

458
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,944
He doesn't in his

459
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,272
Beach acceptance speech doesn't lay out all this dirty laundry

460
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:05,888
And here's all the s*** I have on Hillary now I want to tell it to you guys

461
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,680
Until I got elected

462
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:12,544
If Only They had made a deal with Me 2 hours ago

463
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,944
Hey if they betrayed me tomorrow I would have been fine as long as this deal happen to me

464
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,576
They've betrayed him and the Democrat

465
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,744
Which I feel like I feel like

466
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,304
It is a guy in his mind

467
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,376
It's Schumer

468
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,400
They're all Chuck Schumer

469
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,384
That's who he thinks all that matters.

470
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,920
That's who he thinks they are

471
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,224
To our next clip

472
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,856
Actually it was the greatest segue in the history of podcast

473
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,392
Claim

474
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,184
To be a very Subs

475
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
Substantiv

476
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,512
Narrative

477
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,048
Is been going on forever

478
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,328
On his show

479
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,728
It's something that I really take issue with example

480
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,080
References it and just lies about what it says

481
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:21,920
So George Soros is essentially his big Boogeyman

482
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,712
He's his evil globalist

483
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,992
Madman

484
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,040
Here's a little clip

485
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,088
Do the Alex dark by George Soros

486
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,160
The minute

487
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,608
Hate juice

488
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,144
You're about

489
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,960
To get a big juicy taste in the Broncos win

490
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,968
Nazi Collaborators like George Soros

491
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,504
Chow Chow

492
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,160
Running

493
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,632
Alfaro said that he just can't stop

494
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,504
A couple of people all together on the same

495
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,904
So let's let's party

496
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,208
Contains one of my favorite things in the world

497
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,024
Which is everyone is always surprised by commercial break

498
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:44,608
They're never f****** ready for commercial break

499
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,168
But all of their commercials are just for their supper

500
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,704
It's all just for

501
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,776
Super male vitality

502
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,336
It's all the in-house Infowars pills

503
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:58,432
You have complained about

504
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,712
Take pills at the 1:30 mark

505
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:05,600
Who could possibly be their target with super awesome to is he often goes on Jags about how I keep

506
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:07,904
Like you don't

507
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,464
Beaufort dump

508
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,304
Only the only advertisers

509
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,096
Product he uses

510
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,632
Right

511
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:22,240
Is that cool

512
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:27,104
Velform illegal because he was on the

513
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,640
The gsm network

514
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,176
Which is the Genesis

515
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,992
Communicate ogcn

516
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,016
Communication Network

517
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,552
Did he leave them because they became

518
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,320
The genocide

519
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,088
Communication

520
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:41,696
Network

521
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,720
George Soros

522
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,048
For Netanyahu

523
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,328
Be

524
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:50,400
Gcn was owned by buy gold

525
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,168
Consortium

526
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,472
So when he was

527
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,752
Broadcast by them

528
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,568
But now they've shifted over to this weird health food

529
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,872
Stop talking

530
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,920
And now they sell all this

531
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,688
Weird

532
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,712
I like

533
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,784
You know all your body really needs is a couple of these minerals

534
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,064
Switch totally is

535
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,880
Right it's also by this guy named dr. Wallach

536
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,160
We've actually

537
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,976
If you actually look at 2

538
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,000
He's a veterinarian

539
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,072
Uno's

540
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:25,472
Better dog doctor

541
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,800
Veterinarian

542
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,592
If you look up

543
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,616
The people who

544
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:34,176
Used to sell gold their website now goes to

545
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,712
To his

546
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:38,272
Weird health food store

547
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:44,416
Doctor from 30 Rock

All over a hundred percent

549
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,304
Parsing alright

550
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,352
Be my favorite

551
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:56,192
My favorite thing that he said right there

552
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:56,960
Got a

553
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,728
Taste

554
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,056
From WWII Nazi Germany

555
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:07,968
He got a taste of rounding up Jews

556
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,016
Are you aware of where that comes from

557
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,064
Where that where would he

558
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,832
Referencing

559
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:17,696
No okay so is he is all the time and in the same way when he talks about Nazi

560
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,232
Collaborator George Soros

561
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,304
Okay sticks in your head

562
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,632
Years ago there was George Soros

563
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,400
Was interviewed on

564
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,752
He was being interviewed by

565
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,520
What's this guy's name

566
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,288
Croft

567
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:38,176
I remember him from the cross Nixon

568
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:38,944
Interview

569
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,224
Steve kroft

570
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,296
Bothering him I will read you the transcript

571
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,600
Play the audio

572
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,672
I just want to pull up more s*** but I don't have ready

573
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,976
You're a Hungarian

574
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,024
Who escaped the Holocaust

575
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,816
By posing as a Christian

576
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:55,840
Right

577
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,888
Have you watched lots of people get shipped off

578
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,656
Camp

579
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,424
Right

580
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,960
I was 14 years old

581
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,264
And I would say that that's when my character was made

582
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,800
In what way

583
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,080
That one should

584
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
Think ahead

585
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:10,176
One should one should understand and anticipate events

586
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,456
And when one is threatened

587
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,504
It was a tremendous threat of evil

588
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,808
I mean it was a very personal threat Aviva

589
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,112
My understanding is that

590
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:18,880
You went

591
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,160
Went out in fact

592
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,184
And helps enhance

593
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,720
Application of property from the Jews

594
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,000
Soros

595
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,024
Yes that's right

596
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,792
Yes

597
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,072
I mean that's

598
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:31,680
That sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to a psychiatric couch for many many years

599
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,960
Was it difficult

600
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,496
No not at all

601
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,264
Not at all

602
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,056
Maybe as a child you don't

603
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,336
You don't see the connection

604
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,360
But it was

605
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,664
They created no no problem at all

606
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,200
No feeling of guilt

607
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,224
No

608
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,504
For example.

609
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,272
I'm Jewish

610
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,576
Here I am watching these people go

611
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,368
I could just as easily be these

612
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,416
I should be here I should be there

613
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,184
None of that

614
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,464
But his response

615
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:55,744
Well of course

616
00:30:56,256 --> 00:31:00,608
I could be on the other side or I could be one of one from whom the thing is being taken away

617
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,912
But there was no sense that I shouldn't be there

618
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,936
Because that was

619
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,472
Well actually in a funny way

620
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,496
It's just like in the market

621
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,520
That is

622
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,872
Of course I wasn't doing this but somebody else would

623
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,920
Would be taking it away anyhow

624
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,968
And it was the whatever

625
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:19,040
Whether I was there or not I was only a spectator

626
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:23,136
The property was being taken away so the I had no role in taking their property away

627
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,416
So no sense of guilt

628
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:26,976
Okay

629
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:28,768
This

630
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:31,840
Interview

631
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,656
Alex Jones

632
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,216
Survival Story

633
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,752
Yeah

634
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:41,824
It seems like Soros clearly dissociated

635
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:46,688
From his own personal identity as a measure of

636
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,224
He survived

637
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,784
Heroin

638
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,320
His father hit him

639
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,600
With the Christian

640
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:58,208
Gentleman who was responsible for when Jews were taken away

641
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,768
They would catalog their belongings

642
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,072
Leaving

643
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:06,400
Or whatever but if you're a fourteen-year-old kid

644
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,448
Your primary concern is making sure

645
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:10,496
No one finds out you're a Jew

646
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,056
Right because you will be murdered and also

647
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,080
Where do UMass

648
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,616
Sure Corp

649
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,384
Yeah

650
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,712
Beyond that is different and they found out

651
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
FedEx

652
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,552
Do different

653
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,088
Circumcision is

654
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,624
Is the main

655
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:33,280
Selling selling selling point

656
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,560
Something

657
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,912
There's another quote that is about that time

658
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,728
His life it was actually probably the happiest year of my life

659
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,520
That Euro German occupation

660
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,824
For me it was a very positive experience

661
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,104
It's strange

662
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,896
I think you it says stage but

663
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,944
It's strange it's a strange thing

664
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,992
Because you see incredible suffering around you

665
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,552
And the fact that you're in considerable danger yourself

666
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:58,880
But you're 14 years old and you don't believe that it can actually touch

667
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,928
You have a belief in yourself

668
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,464
You have a belief in your father

669
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,024
It's a very happy making exhilarating to.

670
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:08,352
So people Alex Jones in particular take

671
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,120
These quotes

672
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:09,888
2

673
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,168
Twisted

674
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,216
To be like the happiest time in his life

675
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,752
Was when he was helping

676
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,800
Hitler Round Up Jews

677
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,824
Which is

678
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,616
Both on two counts

679
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:22,432
And I don't believe that Alex doesn't know that

680
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,296
These things

681
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,880
Yeah

682
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:35,232
It is my first reaction on hearing.

683
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,024
Crazy

684
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,816
And

685
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,888
Clearly he's Rich enough to be honest

686
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,168
Which

687
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:49,056
If if he was not written like imagine him as an actor playing that nonsense

688
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,104
He would be pilloried for

689
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:53,152
Weeks undoubtedly right

690
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:57,760
So he's Rich enough to be like hey this was a hugely formative experience in my life

691
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:01,088
It is one of the best I ever had

692
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,136
And somehow

693
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,160
Because of those

694
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,464
Stances that I was

695
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,512
Wound up being a positive

696
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,280
Experience for me

697
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,560
Okay

698
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:13,376
Clearly means

699
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:19,264
That he was in cahoots with Hitler himself and is trying to destroy the Jewish state

700
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,080
Because he was so happy then he wants to recreate

701
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,104
Well

702
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,872
A hundred percent

703
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:30,528
I mean I remember growing up whenever I was being beaten regularly

704
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:36,928
It was exhilarating experience definition

705
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:40,256
Can I constantly try and recreate it psychological

706
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:44,608
Unimpeachable logic that we have in our lives often if you have

707
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,680
Undergone some analysis than therapy

708
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:52,032
You don't necessarily think of them as horrible times in your life bumps and bruises make you

709
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:52,800
You stronger

710
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,360
They there are tons of people who asked

711
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,128
Valve

712
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,664
Let me know you're not you're not

713
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,432
Responsible

714
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,992
Often for the cards you're dealt

715
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,272
Put you in a

716
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,600
Sure

717
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,672
Episode

718
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:12,768
If someone doesn't after-show of our after show they're going to take that clip

719
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:15,072
Well I still think that's

720
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,888
You can take it or leave it

721
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,704
So did this really bothers me quite a bit because

722
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,472
Most of the

723
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:24,032
Stand up for George Soros

724
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,312
Is the best man in the world

725
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,128
The collaborator is

726
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,408
Is incredibly irresponsible

727
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,688
And the fact that I'm

728
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,480
Hundred percent sure

729
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,248
That Alex Jones

730
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,016
Watched

731
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:34,784
Eclipse

732
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,088
From that.

733
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,368
I've seen these things

734
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,136
He knows what he

735
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,184
He was talking about

736
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,208
To paint it as

737
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,256
He was helping Roundup Jews

738
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,536
Means the keys

739
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,816
Finding a false narrative

740
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,584
For a reason

741
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,120
Is that bothers me

742
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,544
Okay so that puts us into lying territory verses

743
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,080
Deceiving

744
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,872
Yes propaganda terrorist

745
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,152
Right

746
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,688
The other part of this

747
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:07,552
I I love about him and you're absolutely right about him be

748
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,368
At no point

749
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:13,440
In his entire show I'm imagining

750
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,744
Does he ever actually get into why

751
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,512
He would want this

752
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,888
Barely as ever he leaves it to your own imagination to make these connect

753
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,936
Clearly

754
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,984
If you survived the Holocaust

755
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,544
He also wants it

756
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:32,896
Which is also a great movie title surviving the Holocaust and loving it

757
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:35,456
Dracula

758
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:39,296
Leslie Nielsen as a slapstick

759
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,112
She went to Young that's

760
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,976
Now he's a great actor

761
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:47,744
Thank you Dad

762
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,816
So

763
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,120
He be even better at it

764
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,960
Before before we get

765
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:00,032
Because we already got

766
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,920
We already got sidetracked on to the nonsense he said responding to

767
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,456
The nun

768
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,248
You noticed that on the way

769
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,576
Soros there was like

770
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:17,184
Oh there's 30 different mismatch

771
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,232
She throwing shade at the wall to see what

772
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:23,584
The stuff that he was talking about Bibi Netanyahu

773
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,400
He's the best apparently there are police

774
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,680
I questioned him over to

775
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,448
Corruption

776
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,984
Stuff

777
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:32,032
That day on the on the 2nd

778
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,824
I'm having difficult times

779
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,360
Finding

780
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,408
Independent corroboration of that being any

781
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,432
Furious

782
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:43,040
It's difficult to say but it does feed into the narrative that they already have built up with

783
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,064
The United States

784
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,600
Turn their back on Israel

785
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:52,000
With the the sitting out of the UN 3830

786
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,024
A billion dollars

787
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,912
And military aid my position on that is Israel's incredibly complicated

788
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:01,472
Situation that I don't understand all the ins and outs of

789
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,008
Right I do believe

790
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,544
Palestinians have rights

791
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:11,200
How about that cuz I grab you feel like you're wrong there

792
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,248
George soros's against rounding up

793
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:19,648
Also

794
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:25,536
Go beyond that also globalist

795
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,560
Are islamist

796
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:33,216
Cuz that's how is everybody knows islamist

797
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:37,312
Are all for Global relations

798
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:41,920
Sort of narrative pieces of it is

799
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,688
To create their own

800
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,224
Like axis of Evil

801
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:50,112
In order to make Russia okay

802
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,392
The axis of Evil

803
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,696
That's a big tip off at the club blister like

804
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,720
Oh we're totally

805
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,680
I feel like he doesn't know dr. evil aspects

806
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,288
He's giving me the the doctor evil doesn't know he's fictional vibe

807
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,152
The alliance there

808
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,944
In order to make Russia okay

809
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,736
Right China

810
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,760
Saudi Arabia

811
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,784
North Korea

812
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,904
But those are the ones that are like a big problem

813
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,672
Especially

814
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,696
Communist China

815
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,256
Those are the people we have to be worried about

816
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,048
Just so Russia

817
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,888
Just want prosperity

818
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,216
Country is

819
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,240
Turning into a s*******

820
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,544
That he's he's

821
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,152
Rampantly doing everything you can to direct every possibility

822
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,176
A wave

823
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:46,944
From the fact

824
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,760
Garbage right now

825
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:53,856
Toilet

826
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,136
The deflection away from

827
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,416
Russian tampering in

828
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,488
How can they do anything they have

829
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,768
GDP of Italy

830
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:04,352
Alright growing up with that salad that's a solid to flex

831
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:10,752
Yeah but also probably has like 200 billion dollars is a lot of money

832
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:15,872
I can imagine she is that low doesn't mean that there aren't the resources

833
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,920
Like there's a lot of dark money

834
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,248
Some of that money that week

835
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:25,088
To that Olympic stadium and the roads that were never actually better

836
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,624
Somebody got all that money

837
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,696
Communist China got all that money

838
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:33,536
Communist China in Saudi Arabia

839
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,816
Conspire

840
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,168
With North Korea

841
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,728
Olympic I guess I don't know

842
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,848
Communist China and Saudi Arabia

843
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:54,016
Did he plan to say that he said that before

844
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:57,856
Nothing ever combined communist China and Saudi Arabia

845
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,648
I only if he doesn't like

846
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:02,720
Like I don't I think of you mad libs that one

847
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,768
Yeah he had to adjust

848
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,632
Irene

849
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,680
I think it was that the spirit got good too

850
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:14,752
And he was just like you like alright well

851
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:21,152
These words are coming out whatever which is a perfect transition to this next whip

852
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:25,504
So I might be one of my favorite clips

853
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,040
I don't want to do any setup

854
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,208
Well here it is

855
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:38,304
I told you

856
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:42,144
They're really thinking about

857
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,472
That's not diarrhea

858
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,520
Now that got dropped

859
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,479
Amarillo

860
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:00,319
Zero Hedge

861
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:07,231
Why you talk about Canary in the coal mine

862
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,871
Good bad ugly

863
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,247
Bet your bottom

864
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,271

This is this is on air

871
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,999
Obediently like

872
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:16,351
They put his hand over his face and makes he acts like he's going to cry it's astounding

873
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,471
This is so freaking out of control

874
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:31,199

Please

877
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:37,855
Somehow stop evil forces of trying to stop

878
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:43,231
Israel

879
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:46,815
Start World War 3

880
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,935
Reach out to those that are still in darkness

881
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,543
Jesus Christ God direct us on

882
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,591
I don't do that

883
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:14,719
Well you might be sweating in 65 degree temperatures because he's too much goddamn super male vitality

884
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:21,119
But today after publicly

885
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,143
Is I don't do that

886
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:24,191
For sure

887
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,727
Literal show

888
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:29,567
You're doing that for sure

889
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,663
Would listen to end

890
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,295
It's time to pray what's Showman

891
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:45,695
I don't mean to beat up on religion I don't I don't want to box

892
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:48,767
Someone just for being religious religion is a great thing

893
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:55,167
Like it does bring a lot of meaning to a lot of people's lives and hooray but I do take great issue with the idea that

894
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,703
It's being used to

895
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,239
Basically

896
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,543
Yeah well I mean

897
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:15,647
I'm so sorry about abortions

898
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:18,975
Will dentist a stream-of-consciousness ranch

899
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:22,047
Gorgeous gorgeous

900
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,071
Why is

901
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,375
Netanyahu the canary in the coal mine

902
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,423
Because once they come for Israel that mean strength

903
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:30,239
Why would you go for Israel first

904
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:32,799
Never explain

905
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:38,175
So you're coming for Netanyahu because he's got all the dirt

906
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:42,527
He knows good and bad things that everyone's done so you got to take him out first

907
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,063
So you can't spill the beans

908
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,087
Again

909
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,623
The Good The Bad

910
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,391
The ugly

911
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,415
You got all of

912
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:51,743
Yes where why and how did he get any

913
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:58,143
He's been around the game forever so he has all of it just say I've been around the game

914
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:01,471
So I noticed Every Nation on the planet

915
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,007
Yeah but you can

916
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,031
If no one

917
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,591
That's a good point

918
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,175
Hear it here is the fundamental disconnect

919
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,455
Is that

920
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:13,759
I feel like before I say something

921
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:18,879
I should have at least the barest understanding of why that thing is

922
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,159
Haha

923
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,951
It's like when you make a public claim

924
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,815
Relatively uninformed

925
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,607
I've got a reason for

926
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,143
You know that you're saying it is a joke

927
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,215
Even even then

928
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,007
Well before we go any further

929
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:41,663
Soundrop

930
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,455
I love you

931
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,087
What I was watching

932
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,111
This

933
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,903
I lost my s*** work

934
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:54,207
At that moment like I was just like

935
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:59,327
If I were writing a character I couldn't come up with something funnier

936
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,143
Then yelling about that World War 3 is coming

937
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:13,151
Torreon

938
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:19,551
Amazing what is a 100

939
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:20,831
Genuine

940
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:25,439
Me to Prague moment you ever

941
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:30,047
Also that's a super professional wrestling

942
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:34,655
You can see somebody walking into the ring and being like hey before we wrestle

943
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,983
Don't have to be like

944
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:42,591
The Undertaker

945
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:48,991

Salud isolated clip

951
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,031
Anytime

952
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:15,615
I'll just pull that up on my phone

953
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:25,087
You're there coming for Netanyahu first and if they get to Netanyahu first

954
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:31,231
That's not going to be enough to destabilise everything

955
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:31,999
Right

956
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,791
Why are those two connected

957
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,071
Or how are those

958
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:41,471
I don't know why reactivate have they ever met

959
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,751
Of course

960
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,055
What

961
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,079
So they've never met

962
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:48,383
Has Trump ever stated

963
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:52,479
Positive feelings

964
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,271
He spoke at aipac

965
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:57,599
Favor of Israel

966
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:03,999
Huge favor of Israel negative things about

967
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,023
Obama's handling

968
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,815
Of you know like

969
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:09,119
Backing away from Israel

970
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:12,959
Hold tight

971
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:16,543
Everything's going to be different after the 20th

972
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,079
Which was

973
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:20,895
Both in reference to Russia and

974
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:24,479
Which is it is nice that

975
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:27,295
They have the luxury of being like

976
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,111
We can we can weather the next

977
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,391
20 days because

978
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:32,415
Eventually

979
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,719
We've got Trump who's just going to do

980
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:41,631
Whatever it is undefined variable

981
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:51,103
Here's the thing

982
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:55,455
So they kill Netanyahu

983
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:59,551
JB this thing

984
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:05,695
That you could just Shanghai

985
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,719
I'm somewhere

986
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:10,815
You could just rendition his ass arrested on corruption charges

987
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:17,983
You trumped-up if the whole thing is that he's got tons of dirt you would have to kill

988
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,775
Tell him right I mean based on what

989
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:25,663
In order for the narrative Alex Jones Dropbox

990
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,223
Take out his neck

991
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:31,039
Like just don't feel

992
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:33,855
Okay I can see that like like Roadhouse

993
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:36,927
What else you want

994
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,999
I mean unless

995
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:42,303
He has access to a computer

996
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:48,703
Where are a lot of possibilities, Japan

997
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:54,335
You can learn how to write with your feet they're in League with the Saudi Arabians

998
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,639
In the movie Aladdin

999
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,919
But

1000
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:01,503
You also then have to remove his eyes because some people can

1001
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:05,599
Text to type with their

1002
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,879
Remove those

1003
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:13,279
Fortunate

1004
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:17,887
I miss that thinking about the the Mayhem from Alibaba

1005
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:24,543
The Labyrinth

1006
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:27,871
Blankman

1007
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:29,663
Looks looks

1008
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:36,063
Call Alex Jones Angela go directly into this is about the movie Aladdin

1009
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,111
Alright alright

1010
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:43,231
So that but then we also have the technology now where we can read brain scans

1011
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:44,255
Turn that into

1012
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:47,071
It's still in infancy stage

1013
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,095
Just but I'm assuming

1014
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:54,495
If you know everything about everybody

1015
00:51:54,751 --> 00:52:00,383
I've got a murder baby

1016
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,151
Yeah

1017
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:04,991
Israel is

1018
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,015
What

1019
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:11,647
And so but but even then if they murder Netanyahu

1020
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:12,671
Who's the next

1021
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:16,511
L waiting in the wings

1022
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,303
Let me ask you a

1023
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:24,703
Alex Jones

1024
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:26,751
I'm not making any claims

1025
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:29,311
Frankly I don't know many of my Altima

1026
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:34,431
My representative

1027
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:36,223
Felt the need to call them

1028
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,247
That's a good idea

1029
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,807
If there's one thing that we can learn it

1030
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:41,087
Don't call Alex Jones

1031
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:44,927

1032
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,975

00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:02,335
There people calling any mention that

1036
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:04,895
Yourself about this time

1037
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:05,663

00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,479
People who need virility

00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:11,807
Certainly if you want a discount on boner

1041
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,855
Boner pills right

1042
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:17,439
Vitality

1043
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,975
It's about how like

1044
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,511
You get your libido going

1045
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,327
I don't know if it is

1046
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,095
I think it might be boner

1047
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:30,751
Cast

1048
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:35,103
And Alexa basically they keep

1049
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,663
Statistics on websites for advertising purposes

1050
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:41,759
Quote you're castrated

1051
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:42,783
Stuff like that

1052
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:44,831
I've done some research on

1053
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:45,855
What kind of traffic is

1054
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,135
His website actually gets

1055
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,911
If you do that

1056
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:01,471
Have like 200 300 thousand

1057
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:03,519
Hits a day unique hits on the website

1058
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:06,079
What you still great

1059
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:09,151
But then whatever like a cop is killed two goes up to about a male

1060
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:14,015
Of course you're getting all that Viral content out there you're reeling in the races

1061
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:16,319
Repeat dog cop killer narrative

1062
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,159
You can see spikes

1063
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,183
It is traffic

1064
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,487
Whenever in the

1065
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,535
See what happened is it okay

1066
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:27,071
That was that when

1067
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,607
You should like that

1068
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:31,167
Which was also a false flag operation

1069
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,447
Initiated by Hillary

1070
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:36,031
Absolutely

1071
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:37,311
WikiLeaks founder

1072
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,103
They all know that

1073
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:45,503
The plot to kill Netanyahu

1074
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,319
To put this all together

1075
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:51,647
And who is behind

1076
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:53,183
Soros Soros

1077
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:59,839
The Nazi loving Jew

1078
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,167
Also the Soros

1079
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:03,935
His claims to

1080
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,983
Be fun

1081
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,567
They they act like

1082
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:11,103
Because he gives money

1083
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,383
To help that cause

1084
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,919
That they're his Goons

1085
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:14,943
Squad kind of

1086
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:18,015
It's insane and very racist

1087
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,319
You're asking yourself this question who's list

1088
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,647
Next clip

1089
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,415
Who is

1090
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:25,695
Who's listening

1091
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:31,327
Doesn't Hillary know when she attacks me

1092
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:44,127
You still close to just making out.

1093
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:47,967
Call Buchan organization

1094
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:52,831
Saudi Arabia

1095
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:59,231
Like that

1096
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:03,071
Heathrow Media Matters under the bus if you want

1097
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,631
He's a catalog

1098
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,935
I will give him a

1099
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:11,007
I think those two things are also two related to pizzagate now

1100
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,543
I don't think he wants to touch that one

1101
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:19,455
Was was that his faults indirectly is that word did he start the whole pizzagate

1102
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:21,759
Figure out

1103
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:26,879
I think that after that guy showed up at that pizza place with a gun

1104
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:28,159
It was a hot potato

1105
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,695
And I

1106
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,463
There

1107
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:32,767
Clean the website of all of the mansion

1108
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:37,887
Well not all of it but it's all of their like main reporting on it

1109
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:41,727
All the stuff he was talking about it being something that needs to be investigated

1110
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,007
Citizen investigators

1111
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,031
Do something about it

1112
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:51,199
That magic

1113
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,223
Wish they had

1114
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,527
And the guy Joe Biggs

1115
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,831
Was the guy who used to work for him

1116
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:58,879
Around the same time

1117
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,463
So it's like there's a little bit

1118
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,231
Suspiciousness

1119
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:09,375
They've both put out videos talking about how late is I'm writing

1120
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:12,191
Maybe that's the case

1121
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,471
Close

1122
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:15,519
I got fired from the TV show

1123
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:16,543
You know I

1124
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,871
It was time for me to move on I feel like my future is

1125
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:23,967
Feature films I've already had a couple of meetings I will tell you there with

1126
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:27,295
But frankly it's really

1127
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:33,695
Just about me I've made all of my money Marvin Barnes I don't even care if I

1128
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,463
I meet with

1129
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:36,255
George Soros

1130
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,535
About producing

1131
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:44,191
The thing that made it stink to high heaven was Alex put out a video where he was talking about how talented Joe Biggs was

1132
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:46,239
Dude

1133
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:52,127
I know it's not true he has dirt on you

1134
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,151
Bratz

1135
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,735
Let's watch the rest

1136
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:57,503
This clip

1137
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,903
The people that

1138
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:04,927
The military

1139
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,207
The police

1140
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:07,999
Judges

1141
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:08,767
The lawyers

1142
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:11,071
The Congress people they are

1143
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,607
The Russian government list

1144
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,127
Because

1145
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,319
It's the only place you get it

1146
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,855
This strong

1147
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,903
This Focus

1148
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:36,671
Discontinued

1149
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:38,463
We don't take breaks

1150
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:47,423
I would like to point out after him saying he doesn't take breaks he had someone else host the fourth hours

1151
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:53,823
It's pretty routinely has people hoes 4th ourselves

1152
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:54,847
He's putting himself

1153
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,383
As the only voice

1154
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,919
Spuds

1155
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:02,527
Outlet other people say

1156
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:06,879
Specifically the Pakistani government

1157
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:10,975
Does he know anyone in the Pakistani

1158
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:15,583
Maybe one guy does he know the capital of Pakistan

1159
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,887
Cartoon

1160
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:24,031
That's the capital of something

1161
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:29,151
So there's no

1162
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,527
Larry said it's not racist

1163
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:37,855
I know I took a geography

1164
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,647
Every class in high school and I know like

1165
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,671
For state or country

1166
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,999
That's it I don't know Pakistan

1167
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:45,535
Not fun to say

1168
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,839
No Burkina faso's capital

1169
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,375
Ouagadougou

1170
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,399
That's pretty fun

1171
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,167
Cell phone

1172
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,959
That is funny Madagascar

1173
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:54,751
Antananarivo

1174
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:59,359
Antananarivo

1175
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,383
Honduras

1176
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,431
Tegucigalpa

1177
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:04,223
Really I might be

1178
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,503
That is good

1179
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:09,087
High School

1180
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:10,623
Like what

1181
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:13,695
Brazil is Brasilia right

1182
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:17,791
I mean like European nation

1183
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:22,399
Let's go to Paris

1184
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:26,751
You rolling your eyes

1185
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:33,151
I feel like people are like capitals Leon California is LA

1186
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:36,479
No Sacramento we all know that

1187
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:39,039
Some of us some of us

1188
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:43,391
That's true

1189
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,279
Can we go back to the list

1190
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,815
Just isolate the list

1191
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:55,423
I'm going to have to take note

1192
01:00:55,679 --> 01:01:00,543
How do you want me to play or you

1193
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,079
Judge

1194
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:07,967
The people who

1195
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:11,807
What is that what is that hanging out

1196
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:12,831
I hope

1197
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:16,927
Ifucking mean the people who do that

1198
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:21,535
Like I think you talk about string people up

1199
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:26,911
Yeah

1200
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:30,239
I wanted to send Alex when it's appropriate

1201
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:32,031
He wasn't going to say

1202
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:40,223
Yeah because I was I was pulling that that would be describing racism in a situation where he's just being

1203
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:41,759
Wacky you're absolutely right

1204
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,039
And he is wrong

1205
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:47,135
Yes

1206
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:49,695
Are the military the police

1207
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:55,583
So he starts with those as the people who do the bureaucrats the lawyers

1208
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:58,143
The government

1209
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:00,191
The Pakistani government the common

1210
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:06,335
When is Chinese who hate him bread

1211
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:11,199
Implication seems to me to be there like

1212
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,223
All

1213
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:15,551
10000 people who work in government listen to him

1214
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:20,671
No f****** way they get any work done if they listening for hours a day to his pill ad

1215
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:25,279
They have to listen to only place

1216
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,559
He doesn't want to say

1217
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,119
Buddy is the only place

1218
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:30,911
That gives it to you this Folk

1219
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:34,495
What I think is my favorite this Focus

1220
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,055
At all

1221
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:41,407
Rambling on about all the government

1222
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,687
If we keep doing that

1223
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:46,527
I will make a Supercut of all the times he says I've got to get to the story

1224
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:49,599
And I'm not

1225
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:51,391
10 times a day at least

1226
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:54,719
But see that's against another brilliant move

1227
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:56,767
Build You Up

1228
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:57,791
The same thing then

1229
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:59,839
Local news always does rats like

1230
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:01,119
This story is about

1231
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:03,679
Are your children

1232
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,519
Comedian named Ron Ramey

1233
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,055
Rhetorically on

1234
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,591
Who do like

1235
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:11,359
I got to go

1236
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:17,759
Like a sort of thing that he's like you can be leaving any minute.

1237
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:26,975
So it becomes like he's not going to leave but we like this

1238
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:33,375
Is the same thing as I've got so much to give

1239
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:35,423
Never get to it they just have more f****** pillow

1240
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,447
But listen

1241
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,727
I feel like

1242
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:38,751
You don't believe

1243
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:40,799
The people listen to his show

1244
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,847
Adafruit for your b**** ass

1245
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:45,151
Alex has some more words

1246
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,199
See where we go

1247
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:53,599
Well Chad Washington Post article mother editor

1248
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:55,391
Star Wars basically

1249
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,143
Russian

1250
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:08,191
Everything they do

1251
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:20,479
I want to take a break really quick to point this out that he says that all the f****** time which leads me to believe that the inverses

1252
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:26,623
Very ugly we're doing is what they're doing

1253
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,647
Kind of feels like

1254
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:30,207
Propose to you

1255
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:31,487
You're glue

1256
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,255
Yeah

1257
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:34,303
It reminds me of when

1258
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,607
My brother would do something when we were kids

1259
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,655
I meant accuse me of doing it to our

1260
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:42,495
Remind me of very adolescent bullying

1261
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:46,847
But he brings this up over and over and over and over again

1262
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:48,639
Fifth like idea

1263
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,663
The globalist

1264
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:50,431
Accuse him of the

1265
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,199
Things they're doing

1266
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,223
Insane

1267
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:52,991
Whatever

1268
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:53,759
Anyway

1269
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,039
So Trump reason for

1270
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:58,623
Trump reads Infowars to 10th of March

1271
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:04,511
Let me just go and tell the mainstream media cuz they don't seem to figure it out

1272
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,559
He's not just Flint

1273
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,655
It's all of them dummies

1274
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,191
I'm not bragging

1275
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:18,079
A couple website

1276
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:21,919
I spy cam

1277
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,599
I'm sorry

1278
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:39,327
The generals all listen stupid

1279
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,119
Define government

1280
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:41,887
Stupid

1281
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:46,751
Because they know we know what we're talking about

1282
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:50,591
Chanhassen theater

1283
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:55,967
He also says that a lot I wish I was wrong

1284
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:56,735
From an ego

1285
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,879
I wish I was wrong is

1286
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:07,231
Like almost like a hook on her ass rap song from the show is wrong

1287
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:11,071
I meant if you want two guys if you're looking to came to life

1288
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:11,839
Sing the hook

1289
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:16,959
Go to YouTube and just search

1290
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:19,007
Alex Jones failed predictions

1291
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:21,055
And there's wonderful compilations of like

1292
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,591
100 times he's been

1293
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:24,895
So f****** wrong about everything

1294
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:29,759
The idea of wish come true

1295
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:37,695
Also everyone with you hear my I don't want to play it on the show special episode

1296
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:41,023
Do yourselves a favor and go f****** listen

1297
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:43,839
Come to the Y2K episode of Alex Jones

1298
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:48,703
He's been doing this for how long like 25 years

1299
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:53,823
Whole goddamn s*** on December 31st 1999

1300
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:54,847
He

1301
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:56,639
Was creating a panic

1302
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:03,039
Accentuate wow yeah he was feeding into a lot of like

1303
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,831
Real horrible paranoia

1304
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:07,391
And what's interesting about how

1305
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,415
Russia is

1306
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:09,951
Good guys

1307
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:11,999
He's on board with Russia

1308
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:15,839
And we all know that

1309
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:17,887
Putin this guy Putin the ruthless

1310
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:18,655
Evil

01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:27,103
Number two

01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,151
Here is the here is my

1314
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:32,223
Favorite thing about the the Russian paranoia

1315
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,527
Because that is

1316
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:35,807
Like the

1317
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:37,855
Flip on that was so fast

1318
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,135
Weather

1319
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:40,159
Well I mean

1320
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:41,439
The right-wing

1321
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,231
Crazy like

1322
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:44,255
The moment

1323
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:47,071
The Cold War ended they wanted to start a nuke

1324
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:50,911
So now because of the whole tree

1325
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:54,751
Now Democrats are all on this

1326
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:55,519
Tamper with the

1327
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:57,311
And they probably did

1328
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,335
In some fashion

1329
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:01,151
Whether or not it was like

1330
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:01,919
Direct

1331
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:02,687
Saying word indie

1332
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:05,759
The one

1333
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,551
Problem

1334
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,575
Is that

1335
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:10,879
He says

1336
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:13,183
We've done

1337
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:15,743
America's Best

1338
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:20,863
Police Government Street

1339
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:23,167
Unjustified

1340
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:27,519
Banana Republic was not invented

1341
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:29,567
Wonderful clothes

1342
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:35,455
Overthrow

1343
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:40,063
Our Corporation

1344
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:40,831
Yeah

1345
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:46,207
Get I get where they're coming from

1346
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:47,743
To you

1347
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:48,511
It's such a

1348
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:50,047
Hugely hypocritical

1349
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:53,375
Well the difference is I think you and I would be fair about that

1350
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,911
Is recognized

1351
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,703
The government has done very horrible thing

1352
01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:01,567
It is worse that it's happening

1353
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:03,615
Because

1354
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:04,895
With we are gone

1355
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,711
Or if we're in some weird Flex

1356
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:13,087
A great deal

1357
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:13,855
You know

1358
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:17,695
Given the entire stretch of history and how long

1359
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,231
World

1360
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:23,071
Eventually the time of the world is 6,000 years

1361
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:29,215
We will have to go down at some point

1362
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:31,519
Right it's just natural

1363
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:32,799
No Kingdom

1364
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:33,567
Kum & Go

1365
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:35,615
Clearly

1366
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,151
Tearing ourselves

1367
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:38,175
As we speak

1368
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:42,015
Let me know what is the average lifespan of every sort of

1369
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:42,783
Kingdom

1370
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:44,063
For a big guy

1371
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:47,647
Colonial Powers about 200 years and it starts to fall apart basically

1372
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:51,231
Guideline

1373
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,279
I couldn't stay because

1374
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:55,327
The big histories are written

1375
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,607
In about people who laugh

1376
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,703
Even those ones have discrete.

1377
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:04,799
But if you want to go through the history

1378
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:05,567
Chinese guy

1379
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,127
One of the most Bass

1380
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:08,895
Fascinating

1381
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:11,967
Bo3

1382
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:15,039
The Joseph the chin like that's all

1383
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:17,599
Which we don't respect at all is history because

1384
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:19,903
No I don't like it

1385
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,439
Because it's

1386
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:23,487
Interesting but it's not about

1387
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:24,511
Right

1388
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:26,559
Right but because it is a communist

1389
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,327
Chinese

1390
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,607
If

1391
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:31,423
If you were to learn anything about history you would then have

1392
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,447
App to apply it

1393
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,471
Now

1394
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:34,751
And that would mean

1395
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:35,775
Changing a lot

1396
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:38,335
It also requires you to

1397
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,871
Load in a bit of empathy

1398
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:42,943
Play against that struggling

1399
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:44,991
Empathetic

1400
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:47,295
What they're doing

1401
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:49,343
Everything

1402
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:54,975
I would say that no matter what I still don't want us to go down

1403
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:56,255
Right now because

1404
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:57,279
Bavarian

1405
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,839
Yeah I mean

1406
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:05,983
Epinephrine is a part of

1407
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:08,031
Mortality where it is

1408
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:11,103
You know if I have to die

1409
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:12,895
Feel like everybody should go with

1410
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:19,295
I used to smoke a lot of weed me and a couple friends with sit around or one of the things we've always

1411
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:21,855
We're like super

1412
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,647
The idea of being able to

1413
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:27,743
Like what a privilege that would be to be one of the humans

1414
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:29,023
Sofia at all

1415
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:30,303
Yeah

1416
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:33,375
There's something to be said

1417
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,655
No

1418
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:35,423
Live

1419
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,471
Unicorn

1420
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:42,847
It would be good to already be dying and then everything else starts

1421
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:47,711
Here's another narrative

1422
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:50,527
In the same vein as

1423
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:51,551
George Soros

1424
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:55,135
Sorry

1425
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,719
Here is why Trump

1426
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:00,255
Reed's Infowars

1427
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:02,815
Was never an

1428
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:03,839
Nope

1429
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:04,863
He brought up

1430
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:06,143
Here's why Trump did the

1431
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:12,799
Quicksilver

1432
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,847
You know what you don't like

1433
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:16,383
Against the spirit got to good to

1434
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:18,431
Yeah it's this thing that gets in here

1435
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:24,831
The Boogie Woogie band it comes in and takes over literally any

1436
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:31,231
Explanation you know that everyone listens

1437
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,255
Okay that's Jame

1438
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:34,303
You dumb dumb person

1439
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:36,863
But he could have made up anything and because

1440
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:37,631
Trump

1441
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:39,167
Probably would have been

1442
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:41,471
At the very least entertains at

1443
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,311
Free password

1444
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:48,383
Yeah not even that just like you know why you listen

1445
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:51,199
Because everybody's got to read something on the toilet

1446
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:53,759
I don't know that would be a

1447
01:12:54,015 --> 01:13:00,159
Real disappointing reveal

1448
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:06,559
The mainstream media can't figure this out expected going to be something big

1449
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:10,143
You listen because everyone important listen everyone important

1450
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:16,799
Unless you're saying it's like a peer pressure thing

1451
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:22,943
I think you're being intelligent

1452
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:29,087
Obviously everyone does

1453
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:30,623
Let's go far

1454
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:31,903
The only person I have

1455
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,951
Evidence doesn't listen

1456
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:35,231
You

1457
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:40,351
From a very

1458
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:48,031
That's good is it really stressful

1459
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:49,055
Just a tiny bit

1460
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:53,919
Not very unfair but it's unfair because there's an implied answer

1461
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:57,759
Zerohedge

1462
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:00,063

Alex Jones

1465
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:05,439
Are the only people who give actual news

1466
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:07,743
Okay so that's why Trump

1467
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,023
Listen to m

1468
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:11,839
Yes he actually

1469
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:12,607
Lesbian

1470
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:15,679
Reply dancers really spell out

1471
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:17,983
He kind of Defense another narrative the

1472
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,031
I was going to go to

1473
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:21,055
To this other one about

1474
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:25,919
From the movie need to cover cuz I don't know yet play the audio

1475
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:29,503
He just basically like

1476
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:31,295
It's about Merrick Garland being put into the

1477
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:34,367
Record as a recess appointment only God

1478
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:39,487
I mean I think so it is the earliest have a fair shot

1479
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:42,303
I would rather it go be debated

1480
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,071
And what have you

1481
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:44,607
But

1482
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:45,887
The point is that it's

1483
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:47,935
Now we're talkin talkin about it

1484
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:51,775
Cuz I don't want to act like I'm putting words in it

1485
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:52,543

Institution was president

1502
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:34,271

01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:36,575
95

1505
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,183
He was

1506
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,207
He was a

1507
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,487
Still in the end

1508
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:44,255
Infancy

1509
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,023
He's making

1510
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,583
Because of rutledge's political views

1511
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:53,471
Occasional mental illness however the Senate rejected his nomination and Rutledge attempted suicide and resigned

1512
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:58,079
American history so much

1513
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:01,663
Beyond that New Jersey judge William J Brennan was appointed

1514
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:03,967
The Supreme Court by President Dwight D Eisenhower in

1515
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:05,503
6 by recess

1516
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:06,783
Never heard of him

1517
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:10,879
George h.w. Bush appointed Lawrence

1518
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:12,415
Eagleburger as secretary

1519
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,951
State during recess

1520
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:16,255
That was clearly too far back for our

1521
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:20,351
President Ronald recess appointment

1522
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:21,887
What's an average of 30 per year

1523
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:26,239
President HW Bush made 77 recess appointment

1524
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:30,079
Hw77 total

1525
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:33,407
Bill Clinton made 109 or 130

1526
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,175
Disappointment

1527
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:35,455
17 per year

1528
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:39,807
President George Bush made 171

1529
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:40,831
21 per year

1530
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:44,671
And as of January 5th 2012 President Barack Obama

1531
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:48,255
How to make 32 the least of anyone on this list

1532
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:54,655
An average of 4.5 per year does not matter but all the Obama inform

1533
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:56,703
Animation

1534
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:59,519
Obama's a dictator and he's doing this

1535
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:04,895
But it's always the least of anybody else that doesn't matter it doesn't matter beliefs recess appointments the least

1536
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:07,967
Vacation days

1537
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:11,039
Statistic

1538
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:13,599
Don't match up but the reason I've included this

1539
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:14,623
In terms of visible

1540
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:15,647
This list of

1541
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:19,999
A false narrative

1542
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:22,559
He can't not know that absolutely

1543
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:25,631
No

1544
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:26,911
Does not know about Reese

1545
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:29,983
Guaranteed

1546
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:34,847
You think it's like a you're telling us from Court Justice to go play Force

1547
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:35,615
REI

1548
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:40,735
Well tetherball did you did you say any like it was George

1549
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:42,527
Then who did the Supreme Court

1550
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:43,295
The first one

1551
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:46,623
Were there any other Supreme Court other than

1552
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:47,391
Eisenhower

1553
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:50,207
I don't know I didn't do a full

1554
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:54,047
Because he's clearly.

1555
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:54,815
2nd recess

1556
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:55,839
Appointment that's not this

1557
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:59,423
But you could do any cursory amount of research

1558
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,191
Can find these facts

1559
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:01,727
Yeah but

1560
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,007
Not going to

1561
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:05,055
He has a team

1562
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:10,431
He has a f****** team but they're not there

1563
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:12,479
Learn things

1564
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:14,783
To learn

1565
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:17,343
They're not there to develop a

1566
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:20,415
You do not even that

1567
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:21,183
There there

1568
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:21,951
2 developer

1569
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:24,255
So their entire job is to

1570
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:25,279
To filter out a

1571
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,047
Formation that

1572
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:26,815
It's a Portsmouth

1573
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:29,119
From information that doesn't

1574
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,911
Right I get what gets

1575
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:32,191
To Alex Jones

1576
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:33,471
Is

1577
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:35,775
Probably more the former than the latter

1578
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:40,383
Yeah but you undercut your you're a you're telling me

1579
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,175
That Alex Jones

1580
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:42,943
Is doing

1581
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:43,967
Any of his own race

1582
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:47,039
I hope so I hope some

1583
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:49,087
Genuinely

1584
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:53,439
You listen to the hardest question I've ever been asked

1585
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,487
The Alex Jones does his own research

1586
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:57,023
Maybe he did

1587
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:59,583
Way back when when you didn't have the the

1588
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:01,119
The All-Star team

1589
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:04,703
Yeah but now

1590
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:05,471
10 years

1591
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:09,311
It's tough to say I in my heart of hearts

1592
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:11,103
I have to believe he's done some

1593
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:11,871
But not much

1594
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:14,943
What was the when was the last

1595
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:15,967
Full book that he

1596
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:20,063
And I'm not saying that is like as like a dig for

1597
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:23,903
He does a

1598
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,951
Before our show

1599
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:27,231
All day

1600
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:29,023
I very much doubt he has

1601
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:30,815
Time to really go through all of this

1602
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:34,911
It's probably none dare call it a conspiracy

1603
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:35,935
Books

1604
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:42,335
Radicalized him and Junior College

1605
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:45,151
And his team's research

1606
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,431
Yeah

1607
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:47,967
Are they researching

1608
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:51,807
Historians or they are aggregated information

1609
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:52,831
That is on the

1610
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:54,367
And they're going to get yelled at

1611
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,159
They come up with something that doesn't fit

1612
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:59,999
Oh absolutely

1613
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:01,791
I think they won

1614
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:07,935
Sing the doesn't fit the narrative

1615
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:09,215
That is the

1616
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,751
That is the situation

1617
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:11,519
With bully

1618
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:13,824
If you once you get to a cert

1619
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:14,592
Certain point

1620
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:16,128
You're building a house of

1621
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:19,968
Support that Foundation

1622
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:21,504
Otherwise the whole thing

1623
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,552
If you just one piece of information

1624
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,600
That doesn't support the narrative

1625
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:27,136
And the whole thing goes

1626
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,416
Fret so

1627
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:30,208
Even if and again

1628
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,232
Even if he

1629
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:32,768
He did discover that

1630
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:33,792
In his Reese

1631
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:35,584
There is

1632
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,120
Almost always going

1633
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:38,144
Going to be a partner

1634
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:38,912
Is mine that

1635
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:39,680
Turns that

1636
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:41,728
Into something that actually supports

1637
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:44,544
I don't like that you're saying because I

1638
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,128
I hear this as a very positive

1639
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:49,152
Statement about him

1640
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:50,176
How so

1641
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:51,712
Because what you're saying is

1642
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,736
He doesn't know that he

1643
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:54,272
He's wilfully deceiving about

1644
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:55,296
Recess

1645
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:58,112
I would argue ignorance

1646
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:59,648
Is far worse

1647
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:01,184
In a broadcaster

1648
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,232
Situations bad Direct

1649
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:06,560
No I think direct lying is worse cuz that means you're doing it for a reason

1650
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:13,472
Like do you agree with me agree with me

1651
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:16,800
How much is making those f****** weirdo pills

1652
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:17,824
Truth

1653
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:18,592
Broadcast

1654
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,664
And this is the way it is on TV

1655
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:23,456
Nnn kind of broadcast

1656
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:24,992
Easter is

1657
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:26,272
Do any of their like

1658
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,344
Most of them

1659
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,880
Imply and some of them

1660
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:31,648
I have sad

1661
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:32,416
Get out

1662
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:33,696
Good day I believe

1663
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:34,464
40%

1664
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,328
That's the job maybe podcast

1665
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:41,632
Things different I believe pretty much everything I say

1666
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:44,448
Well yeah but we're we're not being paid a lot of

1667
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:47,520
Certainly not whatever it is worth

1668
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:52,128
I wanted to I wanted to make the premise of the show that we pretended George soros's paying up but

1669
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:54,176
It's too late now

1670
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:58,272
George Soros

1671
01:21:58,528 --> 01:22:00,576
Did commit the entire hot

1672
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:05,184
So it's time for a couple of

1673
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:11,840
Music for that we are going to be

1674
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:18,240
I'll buy a soundboard motorcycle Ohio

1675
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:20,544
End of this podcast we're just going to play with the soundboard for

1676
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:24,128
For the entire time I don't remember exactly what these two

1677
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:26,176
Two clips are but I know the first one

1678
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,480
So

1679
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:33,600
Mystery

1680
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:39,232
You know what I feel like we have to go offensive because we got to leave people with

1681
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:41,792
The mystery right oh no

1682
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:50,496
Most 2016

1683
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:51,776
I don't want to say

1684
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:56,128
But funding

1685
01:22:56,384 --> 01:23:00,736
Christian Christian

1686
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:03,808
Israel

1687
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:08,928
Would never stop killing each other

1688
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:15,584
Clean up your own house

1689
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,864
Before you run around

1690
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,656
Lecturing the rest of the world

1691
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:19,936
Muslims

1692
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:22,752
Wow alright

1693
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:27,360
Where was in contact here is the absolute problem

1694
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:28,128
With that

1695
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:31,456
Yes he characterized them

1696
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,480
Asthma

1697
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:34,528
Altogether

1698
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:36,576
Aggressively

1699
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:40,672
Muslims

1700
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:42,208
But the problem

1701
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:43,232
That's horrific

1702
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:53,472
Who's accent does not help his

1703
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,520
Texas accent

1704
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:57,312
But here is the

1705
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:58,080
The problem with that

1706
01:23:58,592 --> 01:23:59,616
Which there is a

1707
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:01,664
If you learn the history of is

1708
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:04,992
Tunisia

1709
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:07,296
Has been the source of so much fun

1710
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:09,344
Now whether or not

1711
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,112
That is

1712
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:10,880
Any difference

1713
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:11,648
From

1714
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:12,416
You know

1715
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:16,512
Prospect

1716
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,120
Decrying that

1717
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:22,144
But

1718
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:24,448
When did he

1719
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,472
The twist

1720
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:28,032
The Twist that he had was so genius

1721
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:28,800
WhatsApp

1722
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:35,200
Following the Muslims killing each other

1723
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:37,760
He had the perfect twist which was

1724
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,040
Implying

1725
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:40,576
That Obama was

1726
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,600
Funding

1727
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:42,624
Islamic

1728
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,184
Murdering Christians all throughout

1729
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:47,488
That's a big that's a big narrative

1730
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:55,168
So he's saying no vote was not necessarily anti

1731
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,192
Right

1732
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:57,728
But these

1733
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:59,776
Funding

1734
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:03,104
Murdering Christians all across the world is definitely anti-christian

1735
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:06,944
Which which is unrelated to the previous statement

1736
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:12,576
True I agree

1737
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:22,304
What's

1738
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,352
You got what you are correct

1739
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:25,376
CenterPoint

1740
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:27,424
So so we got that

1741
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:30,752
Then we switch immediately back

1742
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:36,384
Yep no vote is certainly anti-israel which as we all can guess

1743
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:44,320
What is a very complicated

1744
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:47,136
That I mean

1745
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:50,720
Confusing no vote is absolutely the correct

1746
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:53,024
Abstaining

1747
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:58,144
Which settlement stuff is very

1748
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:01,472
They're killing as many

1749
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:04,032
Witch hazel

1750
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:06,592
So much of like

1751
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:08,896
The deep-seated psychological

1752
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:11,200
Issues there of Israel

1753
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,992
Potentially trying

1754
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:13,760
Naruto

1755
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:15,040
Palestinian

1756
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:16,320
Is so fast

1757
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:18,880
Yeah but because

1758
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:20,160
Cure

1759
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:22,976
To say irony

1760
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:24,768
But just like that

1761
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:26,048
That idea of like

1762
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:32,448
Now it's time to get them out of his cleansing

1763
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:37,056
It's but if you would it's like you look at the narrative

1764
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:38,592
From the

1765
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,384
Alex Jones

1766
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:41,920
Of it

1767
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:46,016
But none of them were Palestinian

1768
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:47,552
Right

1769
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:50,368
Destabilize

1770
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:52,416
George Soros

1771
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:56,256
All this stuff because parallel I have

1772
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:57,280
Which

1773
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:58,560
I think is

1774
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:00,352
Uninformed and

1775
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,120
At most

1776
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:02,400
Andover General

1777
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:03,936
Heard at least

1778
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:04,704
Andover General

1779
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:07,008
But the only thing I can

1780
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,032
Look up to

1781
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:08,800
Blaine

1782
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:12,640
The the Israeli takeover of Palestine

1783
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:13,664
The settlement

1784
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:15,456
The absolute unwillingness to

1785
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,224
To even

1786
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,016
Consider a compromise

1787
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:19,552
Is like

1788
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:20,832
You know how

1789
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:23,136
Sexual abusers

1790
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:25,440
A lot of the times windup

1791
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:26,464
Having been

1792
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:28,256
Sexually abused yeah

1793
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:31,072
That's the one thing that I can think of that is a

1794
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:37,472
Parallel that accept children of Alcoholics often end up dating alcoholics

1795
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:40,032
Exactly create the situation

1796
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:41,568
To make it right

1797
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:44,128
12 minutes

1798
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:47,200
But I don't know how that works as a society

1799
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:50,528
If you want if you want to call any

1800
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:53,088
Any unwieldy Nation

1801
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:57,184
As a collection of children Act

1802
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,208
Nothing half as smart

1803
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,232
The smartest of them

1804
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:01,536
I mean

1805
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:02,816
Conceited

1806
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:05,376
National identity

1807
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:06,656
Like America

1808
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:07,936
Regardless of what

1809
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:09,216
Side you are on

1810
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:11,264
In the two party system

1811
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,312
There is definitely a national identity

1812
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:15,104
Write the different from

1813
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:19,200
Most other European countries

1814
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:22,784
It's a ridiculous country that we have

1815
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:26,624
That's filled with so many like different regions that have

1816
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,160
Zero to do with the others

1817
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:31,744
One consistent

1818
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:33,536
National identity which is

1819
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:38,656
F*** the government

1820
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:47,360
Alright we're going random I really don't remember what this is

1821
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:52,992
I would expect

1822
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:56,064
Bunkers

1823
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,600
5 minutes

1824
01:28:58,112 --> 01:29:00,416
Almost

1825
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:03,232
The urgency of repudiating Obama

1826
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:06,304
Repudiate

1827
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:09,888
And all of these insane

1828
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,168
Out of control

1829
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:16,288
You just want to destroy Prosperity control

1830
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:20,640
Pause real quick

1831
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:22,944
Kissinger

1832
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,992
Who recently met with Mike Pence

1833
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:27,808
I feel like he does not know anything about kissing

1834
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:36,256
Pull their that's Saudi Arabia in communist China

1835
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:41,120
That's further on the tightrope

1836
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:42,656
Apparently

1837
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:47,264
I mean

1838
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:49,824
Kissinger is an evil mother

1839
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:51,104
It does seem that way

1840
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:55,968
You want people to come after me

1841
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:05,184
See this is another reason why up top I wanted to make clear

1842
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,744
No I Just Want to Have Fun

1843
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:11,840
Stanford

1844
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:15,424
To kick him off the air

1845
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:21,824
Well I mean our entire livelihood if you're listening to this

1846
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:22,592
Number one podcast

1847
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:24,384
On the planet

1848
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:27,456
I'm really curious where this is going to go

1849
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:28,224
Excited

1850
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:29,760
You just think we're going to

1851
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:34,368
And take it

1852
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:49,984
I swear to you I didn't Loop that

1853
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:54,592
Deserve a podcast award for perfect

1854
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:08,160
Hell's your problem

1855
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:27,360
I don't want

1856
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:32,480
Okay I remember now

1857
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:34,272
This is one of these great and I got to take

1858
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:38,624
We're not going to take it

1859
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,440
This is such a great example of Alex Jones

1860
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:44,768
The thread halfway through a sentence

1861
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:46,048
Trying to diss

1862
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:50,656
Destroy the trying to take me off the are the independent

1863
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:57,056
Also Madeleine Albright

1864
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:03,968
Now

1865
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:06,528
Time to really take Madeline off

1866
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:09,088
This is where

1867
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:09,856
Threadripper

1868
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:11,136
Like a loses it

1869
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:13,184
Entirely at the end of the sentence

1870
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:13,952
Is

1871
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:18,304
Well it's exactly like when you're

1872
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:23,424
It's exactly like you've been on this situation

1873
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:24,448
Insaan

1874
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:27,776
Too drunk

1875
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:29,824
Oh yeah and you're talking and you're

1876
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,104
Getting to the bed

1877
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:33,920
And then halfway through all the sudden your brain goes

1878
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:40,832
So you just start saying stuff because you know eventually your brains just going to least

1879
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:45,952
We're not going to take it

1880
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:48,256
If he does find a thread

1881
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:54,656
It's the wrong spread and he thinks he's going to find it again and he doesn't

1882
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:56,960
Just goes commercial

1883
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:57,728
How does

1884
01:32:58,752 --> 01:32:59,264
Turtle break end

1885
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:00,800
Amazing

1886
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:03,360
So he's just talked about how I can There Will Be Blood

1887
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:04,384
Competition

1888
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,152
Right

1889
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:08,480
I don't want anybody to succeed

1890
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:09,760
Walking on me

1891
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:23,072
By somebody sports car before that's super awesome

1892
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:31,264
No way

1893
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:34,592
Is the first Gardner-White commercial music

1894
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:46,368
Guy in a nice car pulls up a nice car and the guy in the car is like a sorry it's better than yours

1895
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:49,184
But like not being a dick he's being actually a man

1896
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:52,256
That is never f****** happen

1897
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:55,584
Then the negative

1898
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:59,168
Never happened you know what let's see where it goes

1899
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:16,576
They don't

1900
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,488
Turn off the commercial

1901
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:29,888
So the globalist are people if you were cold where that sentence started

1902
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:33,216
It had to do with people trying to kick him off the air

1903
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:36,800
If you want to be very generous

1904
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:38,336
You can say that the idea of competition

1905
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:39,872
He's competition to them

1906
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,456
I guess now they want to kill him

1907
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:50,624
Put the metaphor with a car is amazing

1908
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:51,904
Cuz it's not a metaphor

1909
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:55,232
That's supposed to be a literal

1910
01:34:55,488 --> 01:35:00,096
Never happen to him it's never happen to anybody what car looks like

1911
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:03,424
Also why does he Envy this car

1912
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,192
Then say

1913
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:05,216
I would never get one

1914
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:11,360
I want to get that car but I wouldn't

1915
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:15,456
I have one more clip that I don't remember what it is

1916
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:17,248
He is so he's

1917
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:20,832
Is he referencing that the Kurt Vonnegut short story

1918
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,136
Which one

1919
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:25,184
Do you remember the one where it's

1920
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:25,952
The

1921
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:27,744
The world is

1922
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:28,768
Changed

1923
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:29,536
To be equal to

1924
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:31,328
Is this dude and he's the name

1925
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:33,632
The short story is named after who

1926
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:34,912
And so he's

1927
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:36,192
Is perfect

1928
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:38,496
Because of that they have to

1929
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:42,592
Buddy else

1930
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:44,640
Giant bottle

1931
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:46,432
How do you say

1932
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:50,272
Self as somebody who's being

1933
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:55,392
Who people are trying to apologize for not being

1934
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:57,696
Specific about

1935
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:01,280
Communist China

1936
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:06,656
All the things that this area has really

1937
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:09,472
Complains about how there's a learned helplessness

1938
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:11,264
The mentality and liberals

1939
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:15,104
Right

1940
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:17,920
This weird

1941
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:20,736
I don't understand what the line is between like

1942
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:22,016
One version

1943
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:23,552
Paranoia and the other

1944
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:25,088
I'm not entirely sure but

1945
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:31,744
Mayonnaise

1946
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,792
Here's

1947
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:35,072
While we're talking

1948
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:36,864
The only thing that I can

1949
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:37,888
Tevive

1950
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:38,656
Is

1951
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:39,424
I want

1952
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:40,960
Eventually

1953
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:41,728
Try and under

1954
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:47,872
So that's why we got to keep doing this show

1955
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:49,920
Don't remember what it is but it has to do with them

1956
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:52,736
Georgia

1957
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:55,296
Looking to start over

1958
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:58,624
Break

1959
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:01,440
Georgia

1960
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,512
Alex

1961
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:06,560
This is where they want to

1962
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,376
Start World War 3

1963
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,144
In the plan

1964
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:11,680
I know they always have

1965
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:14,240
Sure having Hillary be elected would have been great

1966
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:19,872
You know they can do whatever they want

1967
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:28,576
Don't care it's because they're crazy and I think they're possessed

1968
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:30,880
First place

1969
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:32,928
Yep

1970
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,464
They're damn demon

1971
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:36,512
Their literal demon

1972
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:37,536
Possess

1973
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:38,560
Yep

1974
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:42,144
He often makes the claims with people who are against him are literal demon

1975
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:43,680
Or being paid by Soros

1976
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:45,984
Those are the two groups of people who are against

1977
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:48,288
And we can save 100%

1978
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:49,312
Neither

1979
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:52,640
Yes I would I would agree with neither

1980
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:54,944
I would say neither

1981
01:37:56,736 --> 01:38:00,064
Brilliant move is because you're never

1982
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:02,624
Is The Narrative of being

1983
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:03,392
Possessed

1984
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:05,184
But it could also be like

1985
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:08,000
No that was a metaphor for George

1986
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:12,096
Could be possessed

1987
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:17,472
The globalist

1988
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:21,056
He sells a shirt to that's like a George Soros as a goblin

1989
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:25,920
That's I don't know if

1990
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:29,504
I don't know you know what that's the next

1991
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:30,528
Right

1992
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:31,808
Is

1993
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:33,600
Harry Potter

1994
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:40,000
Hundred percent

1995
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:46,400
The Goblins at the Greene

1996
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:50,752
I like the one telling you right now

1997
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:54,336
Harry Potter you heard it here first ladies and gentlemen

1998
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:55,616
JK Rowling

1999
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:56,384
Possessed

2000
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,152
An incisor

2001
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:59,712
Just getting relics

2002
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:02,528
Well anyway

2003
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,320
Those

2004
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:07,392
Things that I wanted to tell you about Infowars today

2005
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:09,696
Let's let's close it with with

2006
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:10,720
This

2007
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:12,768
Makes me laugh

2008
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:14,304
Sohar

2009
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:18,656
And I hope you enjoy thank you for listening

2010
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:21,216
I hopefully will do more of these in the near future

2011
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:24,544
Little bit

2012
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,616
Over 2 hours thing is probably not going to work in our favor

2013
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:28,384
Nope

2014
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:39,904
Trey for whitening

2015
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:41,696
Play for Providence

2016
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,000
Defense and support

2017
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:46,304
And provision for Trump and for Infowars

2018
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:50,656
Ditto

2019
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:52,960
Because of Duty

2020
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:56,800
You can see it

2021
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:02,944
We are the people resisting

2022
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:10,368
Special just even more

2023
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:12,416
Until Wednesday night

2024
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:14,464
Free shipping for wine

2025
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,792
Turn off everything

2026
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:22,400
Why supplies last the problem is

2027
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:40,320
10%

2028
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:42,880
Superman

2029
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:46,208
We got 30% off on those

2030
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:48,000
Excuse about sell out

2031
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:55,680
We have the liver

2032
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:56,448
Cleanse liver
