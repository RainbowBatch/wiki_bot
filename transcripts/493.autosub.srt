1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important sweat it

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect but knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,808
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
What's fight.com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,696
Acknowledge

6
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:06,560
We're couple dudes like sit around and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

7
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,376
Jordan

8
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
What's up

9
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:13,984
My bright spot is

10
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,336
Splurged on a little investment for the show

11
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,896
Impress watch I'm touching right now

12
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,200
See a little button maker

13
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:28,320
I think that Sensei was a much younger man I've always been really interested

14
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,600
I didn't realize

15
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,880
Is this is very deep

16
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:34,208
Buried subconscious thing

17
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,256
I think the

18
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
What I was young

19
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:45,472
Was jealous of the punks up if they're cool buttons

20
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,520
Man has buttons again

21
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,568
Magical

22
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,616
Weather leather jacket

23
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,688
Super cool buttons on her but I'm just sitting there like a dork

24
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,248
It is it is really kind of bug drink

25
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,784
Give the Podcast Addict to realize that

26
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,344
Half of the time they're just in their basement

27
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,624
Pumping out buttons

28
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,696
Someone is

29
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:10,304
He's goddamn the nerdy one is making a bud everybody else is pretending to

30
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,400
Disarm instruments

31
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,680
You're the button guide

32
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:20,800
I can give to listeners and stuff

33
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,104
Could be really fun to be able to

34
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,384
Just sit around while I'm doing

35
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,456
Work listening to Alex

36
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:31,552
So you got some we got some updates about that forthcoming in the near future

37
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,088
Any other thing

38
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,112
The other thing was like

39
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,648
So who's got the all the punks with the butt

40
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:38,976
Jingle

41
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,256
This commercial jingle

42
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,560
I think from back when I lived in Hawaii

43
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,864
You sure I don't know what business it was

44
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,888
But it was but

45
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:49,216
Buttons who's got the buttons

46
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,520
There's like a button company

47
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:56,640
I feel like it was like eight or nine

48
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
Final thing

49
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,944
Lighted buttons

50
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,968
Are really cool

51
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,760
I like going to antique stores

52
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,040
And looking at these like

53
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,112
A weird old like Mayoral race button

54
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:12,512
We were in whatever the other day and I was staring at all these like JFK and reggae

55
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,536
Buttons

56
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,608
There's something really really cool about button

57
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,448
And I didn't realize how exciting it would be to

58
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,240
To have a button press

59
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,312
I think it's I think it's a paradox

60
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,104
In some ways because there is also something

61
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,896
Deeply uncool about

62
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,664
Buttons

63
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,016
2020 interesting

64
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,296
Fun fun things

65
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:39,392
Well I'm going to hold onto it as bright spot

66
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:45,792
For me it is open mike Eagles just released his new album and it is absolute

67
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,560
Incredible

68
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,120
I do know what it reminds me so much of a

69
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,400
The Green Room conversation

70
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,192
Like I the comics have

71
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,008
Where is like some dude will be telling you

72
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:55,776
The

73
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,336
Worst thing that ever happened in his entire life

74
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,896
And there's like four comic sitting around with him

75
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:05,248
And everybody is hearing this story and then there's a riff that happens

76
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,296
And everybody started laughing hysterically

77
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,320
And then it stops

78
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,648
And it goes back into the saddest story and that's just how it works like

79
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,952
Just how we deal with that group conversation

80
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,488
And it's dark

81
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,768
Darkly funny about

82
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,047
What is divorced and all that stuff

83
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,119
It's also extremely sad about the worst things

84
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:21,887
That ever happen

85
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,935
How's he dealing with

86
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:28,031
The fact that in the age of the covid-19 there are no more open mic

87
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,311
He's doing a great job with

88
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,871
He's moved on from those

89
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:35,455
He kept the name play move out

90
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:40,575
Big Lots middle eagle

91
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,879
Oh that's great I have to check that out there

92
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,415
Next time mr. bike

93
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,975
I do like his work no that's it that's all

94
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,583
We're going to be tucking

95
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
About

96
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,143
February 16th

97
00:04:54,399 --> 00:05:00,543
And 24th 2016 2016

98
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:05,407
Got to hear I support that this is now my autonomous of time mazzone

99
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:12,831
I wouldn't listen to talk what are we up to today we're covering this for a specific reason

100
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,647
And actually there's a myriad of reasons

101
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:20,767
Is that I tried to cook up a Project Camelot episode but the episode I listen to

102
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,047
Unfortunately by the

103
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,119
The time I got through the interview I Was preparing

104
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,703
I realize this person is not someone who I can make fun of I don't feel

105
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,751
Comfortable about they're thirsty

106
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
Of mind

107
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,079
And honestly Jordan

108
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,663
Yeah I believe that after our last episode the end of last week

109
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,711
Where we heard Alex's long

110
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,759
Racist songs

111
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,063
I do I just feel like

112
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,415
Present-day Alex might need

113
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,463
There needs to be a Punisher

114
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,023
I feel at least

115
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,375
You know how you're not supposed to yell at your cat you're supposed to misbehave

116
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,143
Sort of like

117
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,191
Ignore it for that day

118
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
The satisfaction

119
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,031
Yeah it's kind of how I feel right now without

120
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,759
So I will get down to this episode here from February 20th

121
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,063

Mortlock

129

William Neff

130
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:50,111
William nephew next disembodied spirit

00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,463
I get very much to somebody Spirit of knock

132
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,535
Also that doesn't knock wanted me to ask

133
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:02,911
Do you if you had a chance to try that whiskey that got sent in by the disembodied

134
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,703
I think that's revealed I think that's revealed

135
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,239
Yes I did and it is

136
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,263
Very very

137
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,311
Do you have any like that note

138
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,383
Vanilla or hickory or any

139
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,783
Any pretentious the Somali a notes

140
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
Describe whiskey

141
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:23,391
I honestly have this relationship with whiskey where it's like

142
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,927
You should be both

143
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,463
Surprised and delighted by the tail

144
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,535
Anything other than that if you have any other flavor

145
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559
Situation

146
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,863
I'm like a little bit

147
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
Put off by that

148
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:38,239
Alright I'm writing down after notes it is it has a little bit of

149
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
Good taste

150
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:46,431
The next on behalf of Katherine events

151
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,967
I'm a policy wonk

152
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,319
Next this is confusing and

153
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,111
Berry not Berry

154
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,951
Barry not a r r y

155
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:03,839
I don't know how to pronounce one differently than the other but Berry not Berry thank you so much

156
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,167
Barry

157
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:11,263
And finally cargo the cogitator

158
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,103
Very much cargo

159
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:20,479
Also I'm not sure I can't remember now if Alex calls himself a couch

160
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,503
Potater Orcutt

161
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,039
Couture

162
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,831
How to say either way

163
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,135
I would cut the tating like a

164
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:27,903
Cogitate

165
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,951
I want to say is

166
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,975
Agitator because

167
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
He thinks

168
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:39,167
Name is thinking about the tater

169
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:46,591
What you can do is

170
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:52,223
Little cupboard there maybe you're not feeling too generous pull open a very lovely

171
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:56,063
Bottle of whiskey and discovered that it is actually the

172
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,855
Spirit of generosity itself

173
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,903
You taste take that spirit

174
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,207
And bring it to a local charity or bail fund

175
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:06,303
That was smooth that wasn't bad

176
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
Expensive

177
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,167
Think that by now I would at least improve

178
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,191
Slightly

179
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:16,287
Jordans

180
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,335
63 we're looking to this for a reason

181
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,895
Then and I will get to that reason as we get through

182
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,199
But here's where we start

183
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,759
Alex covering the big news of the day

184
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,295
And we've got our

185
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,367
David Knight show big fan

186
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,159
Camera crew as well

187
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,695
Now down at

188
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,231
The scene of where Scalia

189
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,351
Of natural causes an anonymous phone call sad

190
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:46,239
And they'll be no investigation by any of the media or the government and will be no autopsy they made sure to announce the next day

191
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,287
Cuz there's nothing to see here

192
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
Just go to sleep go away

193
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,615
Took the big news on February

194
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:58,015
16th 2016 was that Antonin Scalia who twice

195
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,039
Why not

196
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,087
He has passed away

197
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,927
At the Illuminati Ranch

198
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:11,071
Murder She Wrote episode where we're going to find out who killed Antonin Scalia by the end

199
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,375
We're going to find out something okay

200
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:19,775
I will say that Alex has not developed by this point the Illuminati Lodge

201
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:25,919
Okay that is definitely something that I've got that got tossed around

202
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,223
He believes that

203
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,015
Obviously murder

204
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,295
Duh

205
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:37,695
But David night out there on the scene

206
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,511
Great good tea

207
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:44,351
What's going to happen according to Alex

208
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,399
Scalia real okay

209
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
First Amendment

210
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,959
Critic

211
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,007
The nomination

212
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
For this

213
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
Supreme Court Justice

214
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,127
Attorney general Loretta Lynch

215
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,919
Course they're banning

216
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,711
Building

217
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,247
Change your name

218
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,295
Associated with lynching

219
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
Who cares

220
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,671
Attorney General

221
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
Match

222
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,463
Our

223
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,999
General Loretta

224
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:16,351
Racist name hanging black people hurt my feelings

225
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,191
Attorney general Loretta Lynch

226
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,215
Has publicly

227
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,287
First Amendment to another

228
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,823
But very

229
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,359
Yikes

230
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,943
Alright okay

231
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,711
Alex

232
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,479
Expedia

233
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:37,599
You know I was great whenever somebody is so racist even attempting to be non-racist

234
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,623
Incredibly race

235
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,951
Spell there's nothing there's nothing racist about the name Lynch

236
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,999
Friends

237
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,535
Growing out the outside

238
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,095
Marshawn Lynch

239
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,519
For like the extra-judicial hanging

240
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,799
Does come from

241
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:03,199
Gso it's named after either William or Charles Lynch figures of early

242
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,247
American history who

243
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:09,087
Lynch's law

244
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,391
Game if you will

245
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,975
I don't know point of trying to make other than like Alex

246
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,023
Play wait remix

247
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,559
I don't know

248
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:23,423
Loretta Lynch is going to be the new Supreme Court Justice which we all now know is

249
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,703
Definitely

250
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,287
Totally accurate

251
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:33,151
You just went to the bench so Alex has he believes that he's

252
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,687
Become he's been Vindicated

253
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:38,527
Immediately when Scalia died

254
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,087
Some predictions about how to tell if it was murder

255
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
It turns out

256
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,439
It's my job.

257
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,463
Text the heat Anderson

258
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
Natalya but my gut

259
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,071
+ 2

260
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
And not be a coward

261
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:57,215
That's why I came out Saturday hours after it was announced he was dead did my research

262
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,823
Natural causes

263
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,615
Anonymous phone call

264
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
Artifact

265
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,175
It's in the middle of nowhere in this

266
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,991
This owner of the Ranchos a high-level democratic

267
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
Bed

268
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,903
They are instantly saying no foul play they'll be no investigation

269
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,951
Watch if there's no autopsy

270
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
I'm here that

271
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:23,071
Quickly we know there's major alarms going off in a course the next morning

272
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,607
The judge came in on a Sunday

273
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,959
Tell Alex has been proven right

274
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:34,591
Preconditions of how he will be proven right

275
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:39,967
And nothing has been proved it's really great Whenever you set your preconditions after the precondition

276
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,503
Preconditions of already been met

277
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:48,671
It is like a c man I was proved right if you say something like if there's no autopsy

278
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,743
Then it's you know it it's just

279
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,583
If there is an autopsy

280
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,351
The question

281
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,543
If the Sun rises

282
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,311
Tomorrow

283
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,127
Oh man it was murder

284
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,687
This is

285
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,455
Nonsense

286
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
You know

287
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,551
There could have been an autopsy sure

288
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,087
If Angela

289
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:22,207
Skooly is family wanted one

290
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,511
When there isn't foul place

291
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:29,887
I suspect even if the person is a high-profile individual so what you say

292
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
Who had

293
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,727
Like a connection or a reason to request

294
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,007
The autopsy

295
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
Makoto

296
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,079
So your family Within

297
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,919
Yeah that's what I'm pretty sure you know what you just told me is that the

298
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,455
The family killed Anthony

299
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,015
Scully I think Alex might be working on that

300
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:52,415
By the end of the month tomorrow

301
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,975
We know cuz we looked at 25th

302
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,511
Steve quite a bit that Alex

303
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,559
Becomes a big Trump fan by

304
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:03,167
Mid December of 2015

305
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,215
16 he is he is jumped

306
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,263
He has conveniently forgot all of

307
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,311
Of the crimes that he remembered right committed

308
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,847
Just a recent bit

309
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,431
That's small potatoes compared to the fact

310
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,223
The Trump is trying to talk

311
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,759
About how bush

312
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:21,087
I'll let 911 happen. I'll do it I was really excited about that

313
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:25,439
Playoff baseball 9/11 planes doesn't know the facts

314
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
Clinton fall

315
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
Clinton worth

316
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,631
Call home by Saudi Arabia

317
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,703
There's something really interesting that I noticed his listen

318
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,287
Like he doesn't accuse people being owned by China

319
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,615
He doesn't know he knows everybody

320
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:47,455
The Chinese took over for this outing

321
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:53,855
That is basically how it sounds if you go back to give us to this

322
00:15:54,367 --> 00:16:00,511
He talks about Saudi Arabia in the same way I mean not definitely not the same way

323
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,839
In terms of who owns the globalist

324
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:08,703
Who's running 85

325
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:15,103
Okay pretty quick it is kind of

326
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
Also

327
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,431
Accurate

328
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,735
Many of these politicians can be bought off by

329
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,551
Many different people at the same time if they would like to

330
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,087
You know

331
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,367
I mean obviously he's full

332
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,183
Call chat about all of that but it does maybe point

333
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
Deeper tryst

334
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,535
No I mean not a deeper truth

335
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,607
I think I think anytime

336
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:41,727
There are special interest that has undo it

337
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,007
Influence

338
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031
Manar

339
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,823
Our political process that something

340
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,615
The tribute we should be careful about

341
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:54,271
But no I don't think there's an underlying to see what I think Alex is

342
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,575
Choosing enemies based on

343
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,111
That could be true

344
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:04,511
Much like Bill Gates is part of the 12 and then he's middle-management hasil part of the ruling Elite group of Ariel

345
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,327
There is that Trump is come out

346
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,095
Consumption

347
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,143
About jab because he's

348
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,423
Rim primary again

349
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,495
Text Chad

350
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,287
You stupid a******

351
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,383
And Alex believes this to be like expert

352
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,175
Games

353
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,735
What is just laying out the facts

354
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,111
The Daylights out of them

355
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,135
The guy has Myra

356
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,415
Totally now

357
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,511
He's incredibly bold

358
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,351
Ron Paul or smile like that

359
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,375
I mean

360
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,447
People like Matt Drudge

361
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,215
And Clarence

362
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,567
DIA

363
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,383
What happened there

364
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,175
I mean trumpet didn't

365
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
Exposed

366
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,735
I don't think he did

367
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:00,319
Alexa is presenting this is like yeah

368
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,111
He's talking he's talking this s***

369
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:08,511
And then they're going to call him a 9-11 truther and then he's going to prove himself right on the grandest stage of them all

370
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:13,119
None of it happened none of it ever happened

371
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,935
Everything that they say is going to happen doesn't

372
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,007
The only thing that happens is be a rosian of Rights for the rest of

373
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,079
Trump though

374
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,615
Better than Bernie

375
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,455
What's interesting about this

376
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,991
Is that until

377
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,807
Literally recently before this

378
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,343
Looks like bird

379
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:39,743
Because he was like with the Paul's only people who

380
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,023
Who is interested in like

381
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,095
Federal Form

382
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,703
Couple years before this a year before this

383
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,543
He says he's a socialist but you know he's got

384
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,871
Some good stuff and he hangs out talk to Rand Paul

385
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,407
Okay

386
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,175
Spell

387
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,455
He forgets all of those

388
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,015
Problems that he has now now you f****** hate

389
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,551
Of course he hates burn

390
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
And

391
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,343
Should tell you

392
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,927
Bernie didn't have a job until he was 40

393
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,463
Alex

394
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,303
Nice

395
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,839
He was he was elected

396
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,887
Mayor when he was 9 years old

397
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:18,911
Not important

398
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,679
Scream

399
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,703
Didn't have a job

400
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,727
Until he was 40

401
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,519
Alex Converse Lake

402
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,079
Protected over the toilet

403
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
Alex

404
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
Jordans

405
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,407
Mike down to this

406
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,943
Alex was forced into

407
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,735
The child labor

408
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,271
At the age of 12

409
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,623
Says a lot of good things and I don't want to see her to be enemies

410
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,951
Conservatives because they're a million light-years better than

411
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,999
Bernie Sanders who has now emerged

412
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,047
Never had a job till he was 40

413
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,071
I mean

414
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,887
I'm 42 I have a job when I was 12

415
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,519
Are child labor laws

416
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,079
Summer

417
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:02,431
I already know some yards and stuff he said he was at the bunch of baloney

418
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:05,247
You go down to Walker Marina which is a mile

419
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,087
And you will ask those old guys in there and tell him

420
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,391
You want a job you work for whatever they give you

421
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,439
Maybe I could do the job you'll get a raise

422
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:17,023
Do you have to keep doing that you don't have a job there years later to be a manager

423
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,303
Another time

424
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,607
2 years of passing the marina

425
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:24,191
Manager at the marina when I was like

426
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,751
Boats

427
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,031
Stop

428
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,823
Cleaning boat stalls

429
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,615
12

430
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,407
Sprint hourly wage

431
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,455
When you don't want to be doing that

432
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,343
Clean that stuff up and I'll give you a rich man

433
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,903
Stuff that's good

434
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,671
Good stuff

435
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,695
I love it

436
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:52,095
Totally right there are child labor

437
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:58,495
The nine-year-old should be feeling our jobs put him down in the marina that's me what is it going to be cold again

438
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,775
No that's dirty.

439
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:06,175
Nothing cleaner than Marina twelve-year-old

440
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,503
That story is not uplifting now

441
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,063
512

442
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,159
Modes of laundromats headset f*** you get down there and get a job

443
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,976
You'll be a manager by the Tigard 7th grade

444
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,024
I'm sick of the 1%

445
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,328
Marina Labor Ready

446
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,352
We've been fighting

447
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,168
20 years now

448
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:33,568
Alex was a scab but the SS Marina

449
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,616
Kidnapped so Alex

450
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:39,200
I would say that my sense of him is

451
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,224
What he does is

452
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,784
He gets on air and he just says bulshit

453
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,552
Sure

454
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,576
Because that's

455
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,856
What I experienced

456
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,880
Strum listening damage

457
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:50,720
The guy who gets on Aaron says about Chipotle think I would agree with you yeah

458
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,024
It's kind of like just buy it

459
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
Extinct

460
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,608
The knee-jerk reaction kind of his make stuff up

461
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,264
Conspiracy identified during his deposition in a lawsuit he did say that he had a bit of a

462
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,336
Psychosis that he developed or you just thought that everything was fake

463
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,128
You got into that

464
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,944
But you should tell you that it's not actually

465
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,736
That's not actually true

466
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,016
I don't just

467
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:14,784
Default

468
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,112
And Shay

469
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,744
You think I'm happy

470
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,560
Is about a 98% chance that killed Scalia

471
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,608
You think I want to be the one that breaks

472
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,144
I want to be the one

473
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,424
Runs over the top

474
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,192
Totally

475
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,008
The first one to go up Against the Machine Gun Nest

476
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,568
I'm telling you this

477
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,592
Something does happen to me

478
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,944
Bummer to save your family

479
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,968
Alright

480
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:47,552
Okay that's alright okay if they come back

481
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,832
For me for this

482
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:52,416
Blockbusters Scalia news

483
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,440
Val Kilmer

484
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:58,048
And then they'll come for you and random listener

485
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,328
Okay

486
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,656
I would say that I was absolutely

487
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,424
Needs

488
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,032
This to be a conspiracy the idea of

489
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:11,104
Antonin Scalia dying of old age or heart condition

490
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,384
Natural causes

491
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:18,016
Did Alex get to s*** with that know and it's unfortunately a very reasonable thing at the time

492
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:22,880
Yes 100% Alex's Lane

493
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,696
In terms of news and broadcasting and everything

494
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:33,120
Actor held like a tragic event like someone dying or however you want to look at the Aventador

495
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:33,888
Marble

496
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,704
Maybe sad maybe newsworthy event

497
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
That just happened

498
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,312
There's no spin to that now needs to be a

499
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:44,128
Villain

500
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,200
Family needs to be aggrieved a murder.

501
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:53,600
Does Alex yeah no way for this to be processed by the

502
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:04,352
Ivan gets a very lucrative thing to do exactly

503
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,376
You know what

504
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,168
I would probably think much

505
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:07,936
Less of him

506
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,472
If you didn't

507
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,240
Just like

508
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,264
I mean he's got

509
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,056
People who have his back

510
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,592
We're saying the same thing

511
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,128
Experts

512
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,968
It's all over the place Michael Savage says

513
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:20,992
He was murdered

514
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,320
What is Michael Savage

515
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,184
Billions of dollars in real estate nutraceuticals

516
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,208
Best-selling author

517
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,488
Launch the entire

518
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,536
Organic food

519
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,840
Under another name another number to Plum

520
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,008
Listen Alex Jones

521
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,336
What is an you have to do with whether or not Michael

522
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,872
Tell

523
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:53,248
Thoroughbred look at a news articles if it was murder

524
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:59,648
IQ you can solve mysteries from afar with no information then everything that Alex said is accurate

525
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,464
Yeah yeah let's not listen to Michael Savage

526
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,744
He likes organic

527
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,512
Food

528
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,048
Yeah okay

529
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:11,936
Are you giving me a lot of qualifications and get none of those was murder investigator

530
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,496
That would have been a really good one if you would have been like

531
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,568
200 IQ and also 20 years ago

532
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,104
Investigative experience

533
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,872
That's a whole different

534
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:25,504
Matlock is based on Tracy the lawyer who's a detective

535
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,808
I'm telling you Murder She Wrote

536
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,832
Stabler

537
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:38,816
Alex doesn't like the the European

538
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,096
Absolutely not

539
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,680
So Alex is appealing to Michael Savage

540
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,448
Thinking that it's

541
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,984
Possibly murder

542
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,800
I'm tired of people thinking that

543
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,568
He himself

544
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,104
Alex Jones is a coup

545
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,640
Because he has the best

546
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,408
Sources

547
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,200
Alright well one of them is Mike

548
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,224
Michael Savage so that's not

549
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,016
Well yeah but I mean

550
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,576
When CBS

563
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,440
You don't have anything but this honor

564
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,464
And the fact that you're

565
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,000
Scum

566
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:46,656
I think this is really fun because I can tell who almost all those people off

567
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,240
Noah's Ark real services

568
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:53,568
What he doesn't understand is that yes

569
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,224
Part of the job of a journalist is cultivating sources who are near the primary

570
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,552
How do you know people who eat dinner with Supreme Court Justices

571
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,856
Probably if that's what they cover

572
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:12,512
That was Matt drudge and Alex's said that you'd only talk to drugs that one time you shut up Studio game

573
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,792
Interview

574
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,608
And now Matt drudge's on the outside

575
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:19,168
With the UB trumpy and World there

576
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:23,520
Ben Steven there you got

577
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:27,616
Green Beret I think is my bracket

578
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:34,528
Stuff so stupid

579
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,808
No lieutenant colonel

580
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,832
No

581
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,392
No you should have dropped in like I know

582
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,928
300 lieutenant colonel

583
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,024
I think that a lot of those military ranks and stuff that he does like

584
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,792
Chiefs of

585
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:52,448
Just on the Fly

586
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,032
It's just random AI suspect

587
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:01,920
Trump Alex says that he's he's on a suicide mission to save America

588
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,224
But you know he's also a little bit of an egomaniac

589
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,296
Call Eniko maniac

590
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:10,112
And the people that have testing said he's a good egomaniac

591
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,392
He's the type we need

592
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,560
And I just admire him so much leaves are high-level government people

593
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,888
Input children together CIA United

594
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,192
And I mean

595
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,008
Last generation actually overthrew government

596
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,824
Actually did stuff on the ground and just play around about the nsa's

597
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,616
Spy gear that's Steve again

598
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:37,504
I really don't understand why you're taking the overthrow governments as a point of

599
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,040
Right here

600
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,344
The government's that Steve pieczenik

601
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,392
Quote-unquote helped overthrow

602
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,928
You like driving

603
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,464
He should be against

604
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,232
Whatever

605
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:50,560
The thing that I really enjoy going back and listen

606
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,120
Alex is so simple

607
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,656
Again

608
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:59,264
Like he like characteristic

609
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,312
Phrases epithets are used in

610
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,080
In like

611
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,640
Homeric poetry luckily are the Odyssey

612
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:08,480
Alex does the same like overthrows countries that she always

613
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,576
Unifier

614
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:16,160
Ridgefield pechenik

615
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:20,000
Bridgeville Botanica

616
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,560
Took over countries and killed Aldo Moro

617
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,840
Agamemnon

618
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,520
Yeah I think that's really fun because you can just go back and listen to this be like I know

619
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,592
Your friends are dumb

620
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,872
How do italics

621
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,920
Yelling here and it felt really like

622
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,688
This is

623
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,456
This is like

624
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,736
What

625
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,552
Spoiler alert

626
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,112
But

627
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,416
I felt so much more like

628
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,696
You know what you're doing

629
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,232
Better

630
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:56,864
The good

631
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:00,192
It's because people know I've been around 20-plus years

632
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,728
I know where I came from

633
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,008
They know who I am

634
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,104
We're as American As It Gets

635
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:15,040
And we will never sell out anybody we will never screw over little people

636
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,600
For freedom

637
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,304
What I'm asking you right now because

638
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,632
We have succeeded waking up a lot of

639
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,568
And this is a serious battle

640
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:45,760
I want to get into the restaurant eleven isn't back into school yeah I haven't even got into it yet

641
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,416
Thunder operation right now

642
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:55,744
That feels like that feels more like

643
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,792
That's Alex's wheelhouse

644
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:01,632
Yelling about the America I love riding a battle.

645
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:02,912
It doesn't it doesn't

646
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,936
DeLand

647
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,216
Near I mean it's gross

648
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,496
Somehow it doesn't

649
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:11,616
Feel the same growth as best present day stuff done now maybe it's the lack of

650
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:18,272
Sure there is this not specifically kill Scalia

651
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:24,416
Human actors 222a possibly done it on their own

652
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:29,280
Yeah yeah there's there's no demonic nonsense there's no everything goes back

653
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,816
To China everything

654
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:37,216
It's it did the show makes more sense if you was more grounded in reality in the in the same way that everything

655
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:40,032
Is nonsense and crazy

656
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:44,384
The trumpian influence that made everything insane

657
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:49,504
Expediency

658
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,272
16

659
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:56,928
I just can't get the idea of Alex Jones in like that drawing-room murder mystery

660
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,464
Gathered you all here

661
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,000
At this dinner table

662
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,280
To eventually solve

663
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,840
The Prime with all of you again

664
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,984
If you're going borrow then it's I mean spoiler alert for the murder on the Orient Express

665
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:16,128
Alex could be 40 in that because the solution is everyone dead

666
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,152
Alex

667
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:23,552
Everyone to go out I was thinking more Nick and Nora where there's about three different red herrings until somebody just randomly

668
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,320
Tulsa Gun

669
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,368
I'll get to

670
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:30,464
Why we ended up doing this episode

671
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,024
Takes a little bit of the randomness away

672
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:37,376
Larry Nichols

673
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,240
Knows what

674
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,032
Ocean Washington on record

675
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,848
New York Times are scared of Larry Nichols

676
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,896
I figured I needed to talk

677
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:51,200
Scalia's death

678
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,552
I don't know if he's going to get to this on air yet

679
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,344
But it is just over the top

680
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,136
Stop and I just I wish I could

681
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,744
Larry Nichols is who Alex gets

682
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,072
The comments and have some

683
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,120
Some deep insights on the death of Aunt

684
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:09,888
Pensacola

685
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,984
One thing I want to make abundantly clear before we get into anything

686
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:19,360
If you listen to that clip it's clear that Alex's referencing something Larry has told him off air

687
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:24,224
Alex and Larry will go out of their way to pretend they did not talk off air

688
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,040
But Alex is very clearly saying that they

689
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:32,672
Did Scalia died on a full moon because that is when witches have their greatest Power Idaho this

690
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,232
I know this for a truth

691
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,792
So it only makes sense that you would call Larry Nichols

692
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,840
You got a call I've got to call Larry Nichols

693
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:43,936
One thing is made me really sad lately is

694
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:46,752
In present day

695
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,056
Just passed away not too long ago

696
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:52,384
And I'm not sure if it happened on some episode that I didn't

697
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:58,784
See or maybe during his Marathon at like 3 in the morning they did a 21-gun Street

698
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:05,440
But I haven't heard hide nor hair of rest in peace Larry Nichols any kind of memorialize

699
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:12,096
I'm sure on some weird YouTube channel that I don't know of and bio put on by someone I've never

700
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,144
Hurry up before I

701
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,728
Is eulogizing Hammond in some meaningful way

702
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:24,128
But I know that I touched on this a tiny bit but I really resent it really bums me out to me

703
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:30,528
YouTube yeah I just want to texted you earlier that we have to memorialize Larry Nichols it's feels weird to me for somebody to have

704
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,320
I'm such an outsize impact into

705
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,088
Go with

706
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:39,488
No Fanfare yeah I don't want to turn this into some kind of thing we're making a joke of the fact that he passed

707
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,608
I want to recognize

708
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,888
Like Scalia

709
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:50,240
Acknowledge him for who he was

710
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,776
You and he mattered

711
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:54,592
Goddamnit like yeah

712
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:59,968
Look I don't even look at the world as it is obviously is it you know it

713
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:04,576
Is the Scooby-Doo Nichols isn't the most famous person on the plane that went down

714
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,368
You know so I get why it's like

715
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:10,208
If this was a slow news day maybe somebody digs out

716
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:15,584
You know like right as did here's what he ruined do you know all that stuff but

717
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,632
To have nothing from

718
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,424
People who are like his friends

719
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,264
If you were somebody with a couple of good albums and you died

720
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:29,664
The same here as Bowie and Prince like you're never going to rank in the retrospective

721
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,432
Perhaps

722
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,736
For our show we like look at Alex

723
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,016
Stop

724
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:37,600
Larry Nichols is such a huge part of Alex's

725
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,136
Career his history

726
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,696
From the 90s when the

727
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:46,048
Clinton's are actually in play president

728
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,656
Through the times of our listening to it like a 2015. Where

729
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,448
Larry's talking about witches

730
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:57,568
Most memorable things on our show have come from like

731
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,592
Haha

732
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:04,480
I'm actually very sentimental about a girl

733
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,760
Call Larry Nichols

734
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:11,648
Yeah it was referencing to Wayne Madsen story

735
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
Sanders

736
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,256
Yeah it sounds like some of the things that have been the most

737
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,024
Funny

738
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,816
Have been things like when

739
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,584
Larry threat

740
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,400
Heading to Blackmail Robert Butler

741
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:26,496
Larry Larry goes into a Hall of Fame

742

All-time big swing

743
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,896
Obama wants to

744
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:39,296
Crash the entire world so you can be king cuz if you're the president when everything goes down you can come

745
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,088
And everybody

746
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:43,392
Who's hitting Congress because Dukes

747
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,416
Secret

748
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:52,096
Oh man just hard rice off rice like listening to Larry Nichols lied about

749
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,376
Space about hard drives

750
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:56,704
Softer ice Adam Schiff to Egypt

751
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,152
Here

752
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:09,504
He brought a lot of joy in terms of being somebody who's so desperate

753
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,528
So craving

754
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,576
Such a real s*** head

755
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,904
Parent liar

756
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,696
It was pretty easy to mock

757
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,720
A lot of the things

758
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,280
Yeah but like you're saying it's

759
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,072
It's a result of the big

760
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:23,840
Sweat

761
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:31,776
You know if that guy will miss that there are plenty of episodes from past week

762
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:35,872
I wanted to check in on

763
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:39,200
One of the times that we had

764
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:41,248
Alex

765
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,528
So I called and Larry

766
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,088
Story

767
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,368
For a big story

768
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:51,232
And I don't know baby Alex couldn't get ahold of Steve

769
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:54,048
Maybe

770
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:57,632
Scalia we got Larry Nichols Memorial house down to Grand Prix doing

771
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,680
The Aptoide

772
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:06,336
So earlier in the episode Alex had said that it was 98% chance yes Kalia was murdered

773
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:08,896
I was going to going to downgrade that just said

774
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,480
And I reporters on the ground in Southwest Texas

775
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,248
First mission

776
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,208
Cheyenne

777
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,000
People begging the media

778
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,792
Level

779
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,584
And they are

780
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,352
Are concerned

781
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,728
Obviously your folks see this for what it is it's

782
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,056
97% chance of receiving skill

783
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,080
Love it

784
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,664
Thank you for being more specific

785
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:46,016
Alex Jones is a master of lowering estate

786
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:52,416
Waterford what percentage down because establishment journalist are only afraid

787
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,976
I did not confirm 98%

788
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:55,744
Liberty Clinic

789
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,280
97 Brothers

790
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:04,192
Look I rounded up from 97% to 98% as we all know normally do

791
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,216
That was great

792
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,008
Imprecise imprecise

793
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,056
So stupid

794
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,336
I like it

795
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,104
But it's dumb

796
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,664
Alex plays a little bit of Georgia

797
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,528
Straits coming out of commercial alright and I both like this

798
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,448
George Strait bringing a sham of an oldie but a goodie Amarillo by Morning

799
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,752
I'm from San Antone

800
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:44,128
And we are joined the next 30 minutes by Larry Nichols

801
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:47,200
That is just two different shows right there

802
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,480
I'm coming in

803
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:50,784
He's just

804
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:57,184
Got the wrong job traffic on the 22

805
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,976
Wrong with that just keep going

806
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:03,840
It's it's a it's a guy coming in for a talk show that

807
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:09,728
Just boring and nothing is going on at the beginning and then we're going to talk to Larry Nichols for half hour

808
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,056
Difference

809
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:19,456
Straight right now a traffic on the 94 with Kennedy is moving a little bit slowly but other than that

810
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:25,856
We got noted conspiracy theorist in wacko Larry Nichols come on in here you might be asking yourself what exact

811
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,136
Play does Larry bring two

812
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,416
To the table

813
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,440
Supreme Court Justices

814
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:31,488
Just passed away Horse Casino

815
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,792
What is the topic what are we going to be talking about

816
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,584
Is a tough old egg

817
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,632
Joins us on clearance

818
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:39,936
Thomas

819
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,240
Endanger

820
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,032
And I'm just going to leave it at that

821
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,312
Let's see what he has to say about it

822
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:48,384
And how that ties into

823
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,664
This Kaliyah

824
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,432
Situation

825
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,200
Now

826
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:51,968
Here's

827
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,504
The game that's being

828
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,272
Play

829
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,160
They are insisting

830
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,696
Clarence Thomas

831
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,488
Cold Larry Nichols

832
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:06,048
Awesome inside baseball information

833
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,072
But yes

834
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,608
Larry can't

835
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,912
Confirm or revealed

836
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:14,752
He talks to Clarence Thomas and Alex give up

837
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,544
The game but he also knows

838
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:21,408
Probably b******* and he wants Larry just to say it

839
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:27,552
Clarence Joe Thomas doing

840
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,160
Like the game that they're playing is that both of them need the audio

841
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,440
To believe all this

842
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,464
Information is coming

843
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,792
From Clarence Thomas

844
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,608
Sabbath right right

845
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:48,800
Of course he does

846
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,336
Cuz it's.

847
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,640
The dancing around like an idiot like this

848
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,175
So Larry wants

849
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,199
To be clear

850
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,223
Right out of the gate

851
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,271
It doesn't have any proof of any

852
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,111
I had not

853
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,415
Anyone and I would call Shanaynay

854
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,183
Everyone

855
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,535
You know true definition

856
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,327
Patriot I believe Alex

857
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,375
True

858
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,911
And I wanted to

859
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,679
Be certain of

860
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,447
The truth

861
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,727
Before

862
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:20,543
I did the same with you or anybody else

863
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,823
Korea

864
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,431
Just about an hour ago

865
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,991
Nation I'm getting

866
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,319
Gas station

867
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,623
I'm not saying

868
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,391
Diabetes

869
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,927
Okay

870
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,143
Now Patriot is somebody who's interested in

871
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:50,239
And the truth and I didn't want to come on your show before I knew the truth an hour ago

872
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,031
Clarence Thomas called me

873
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,055
This thing stinks

874
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:58,431
I don't know anything about the truth

875
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,015
But I'm seeking it out

876
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,039
I'm a patriot

877
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:06,367
How does it matter if I'm right or not I do notice it doesn't matter if you

878
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,903
You get the truth you just say

879
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:14,303
Speak it out I'm going to do everything in my power to prevent Clinton a murderer

880
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:21,471
I can't breathe

881
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:26,335
Hold my feet to the fire

882
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:29,919
This dance of life

883
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,223
Considerate but also I refuse to be defended

884
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:35,039
What are you a military specialist on CNN get the

885
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,391
We're in a situation where Scalia to wear

886
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,927
This thing burning out of control

887
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:43,999
Who did it why did they do it

888
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,279
It was done

889
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,607
Is usually

890
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,399
When it walks like a duck

891
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,167
Quiet

892
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,543
I'm afraid that's where we're headed

893
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,847
Forget one thing

894
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,407
Important things

895
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,455
Career

896
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:06,015
The future of the welding to remember whatever

897
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,623
Appointment

898
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,415
Supreme Court Justice

899
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,183
I forgot the

900
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,743
You tell me

901
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:17,791
Does it look like to you

902
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:18,815
Ducks

903
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:19,583
Who

904
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:22,911
So we have

905
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,447
I don't know the who

906
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,983
I don't know the

907
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,031
I don't know if it happened

908
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,311
But if it looks like a duck

909
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:33,151
What if what looks like a duck

910
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,503
Nohu water if

911
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:43,135
But if it looks like a duck but it was murder

912
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:50,559
I like it I like it because he has no bones about it

913
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:52,095
Just look like everybody else

914
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,119
Pretends they have

915
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,167
Any like proof for it needs is like

916
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:58,495
I don't know what's going on I don't know why it's going on

917
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,519
Probably murder

918
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,287
Probably

919
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:03,871
It's probably an Arkansas side of course

920
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:13,599
Absolutely proven definitive most prolific serial killers

921
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:18,207
You will kill again maybe 1,000 people

922
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:20,767
The murder she's committed yet

923
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,815
Remember what we used to do

924
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,631
The Arkansas

925
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,239
Committed suicide

926
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,103
But at the same time

927
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:38,175
Who was the only person that benefit

928
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:39,967
Teavana

929
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,503
Now

930
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,527
Look at this case

931
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,343
Are the only people that

932
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,111
Benefit

933
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:48,671
Nobody

934
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,511
I'm telling you

935
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,559
It's starting to look bad

936
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,095
Starting to look bad for

937
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:01,215
Even if you just take Larry based on that clip his standard Hood being a narc

938
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,751
Inside fails to be met

939
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,823
He said that I have to be like an impossible suicide

940
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,591
Which it was

941
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,895
So that classic feature the Clinton murders

942
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:12,735
Not present well then there's the question of who stands to gain or

943
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:13,759
Call Alex

944
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,039
Qui Bono

945
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,319
Smart guy

946
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,623
What would naturally think

947
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,927
The queen who stand to Bono sancak

948
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:25,023
Conservative justices dad and Obama's president so we can replace Scalia with a Progreso

949
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:28,863
Idiots the plant been looking back

950
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,143
I would have to conclude that

951
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:33,215
No one was interested in following through with that

952
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:37,823
Is there some kind of a conspiracy that involves the murder of a Supreme Court Justice which pays off with a

953
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,127
Appointment of a new more liberal Justice

954
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,151
Kind of make

955
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:42,687
For the group

956
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:46,783
To be powerful enough to pull off the hard part and completely fuk up

957
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:52,415
Easy almost procedural Parts insanely easy part as we are now discovering

958
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:56,511
What possible explanation could there be for this group have gone through with the killing of

959
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:59,071
Scalia then when it's time to replace

960
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,863
Into a congressional standoff

961
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,167
The explanation can't be that the

962
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,191
The GOP opposed

963
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:04,959
The globalist

964
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,495
Because at this point there's

965
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:09,055
Still very much a trump creepy picture

966
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:15,711
At the time this episode The GOP primaries still ongoing with Ted Cruz Marco Rubio Ben Carson and Jeb Bush

967
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,759
All still having activecampaign

968
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,807
Carly fiorina

969
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:22,623
Chris Christie had dropped out there of the race within a week

970
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,159
From this report

971
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,975
The deal. Not yet bend over backwards entirely

972
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,255
And there was a large

973
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:30,047
Ted Cruz

974
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,607
Pepper is winning the Iowa caucus

975
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,399
Competitive showing on super Tuesday

976
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:37,983
Which actually hadn't even happened by the time of this route

977
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,519
What I'm getting at is that it's

978
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:43,615
This point the GOP is still the Blueblood never Trump Republican party that Alex

979
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,895
Isn't league with the global

980
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:50,015
Mitch McConnell who spearheaded the blockage of Obama Supreme Court nomination process

981
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:55,391
Wouldn't even endorse Trump until May and in June he was quoted in the New York Times of being open to

982
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,671
Rescinding that Dorsett

983
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,439
Course

984
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:59,743
Is there was anything to the globalist

985
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,791
Conspiracy to kill Scully and replace him

986
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:04,863
Then based on the political alignment that Alex has established

987
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,935
There's literally no reason why McConnell in the GOP should be getting

988
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:08,959
In the way of that plan

989
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,775
Miss big hole in the theory of the Qui Bono

990
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:14,847
In this case no one went

991
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,639
There's a part of me that wants

992
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,431
To that wants to respect

993
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,735
Mitch McConnell for pulling off one of the most

994
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,295
Blatantly bulshit things that ever happened

995
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,855
But the more I think about it the more I realized

996
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:29,183
888 was just he was playing against the stupid Epona

997
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:35,583
Like all he did was make up some b******* and got people to believe it it was thought there were rules because

998
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:42,239
Do work better when there are rules part of the rules they are just willing to accept rules that are made

999
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:45,567
For them to deal with its varied it's very pathetic

1000
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:50,431
Well I'm more disappointed with the with the people who continually allow match

1001
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,199
McDonald's

1002
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,527
He's figuring bulshit isn't

1003
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:57,599
Saying yeah it is unfortunate then people

1004
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,879
Just continue to take

1005
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:01,183
Something like that seriously

1006
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,767
Piano 8 look

1007
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,303
Some elements

1008
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:10,655
Scalia's death that maybe could be taken as a message well as family care

1009
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,447
Well I don't know if that's

1010
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:14,495
It's true but there was a pillow

1011
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,543
Beautifully dyed in bed

1012
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,823
The pillow

1013
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,895
And immediately it was reported that it was all like on his face

1014
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,175
But that is not accurate

1015
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:29,343
I was just on his head because he was laying in bed

1016
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,111
But this is a mess

1017
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:30,879
Okay

1018
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:31,903
The pillows on

1019
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,719
The face is that a messaged everybody though that he's awake

1020
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,023
Bank

1021
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,583
I think they're trying to let us know

1022
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,631
I think they're trying to let someone

1023
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,911
I know Alex and Ani

1024
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,215
Maybe.

1025
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,543
Maybe the other

1026
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,103
Judgeszone

1027
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,919
Court judges you talk to him

1028
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,199
Yes

1029
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,223
That

1030
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:04,415
Just f****** Clarence Thomas

1031
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:09,791
The idea that if there was a pillow on his face

1032
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:10,815
It was Nae

1033
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:11,839
Tous message

1034
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,375
Do people who are awake

1035
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,935
Because if you're awake

1036
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:19,007
Don't put the pillow on your face into pillows under your head

1037
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,311
Then you're fine

1038
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,615
Clarence Thomas

1039
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:28,735
Illuminati Lodge in the middle of Texas

1040
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,271

1041
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,807
Anyway Larry safe

1042
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,343
Because he's at home

1043
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:36,415
Yes and he's got a big old knife

1044
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,463
With which to hide off a cliff

1045
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:40,511
Every time

1046
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:42,303
Clinton's get nearby

1047
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,351
People going

1048
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,447
This is not

1049
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,263
And this won't be the last

1050
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,055
Universalis

1051
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:55,103

No

1057
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,743
From everything I say

1058
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,095
Message

1059
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,119
What the

F*** are you safe

1061
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,519
Am I saying it was a hit but I asked

1062
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:29,407
Slippery a******

1063
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,735
Every did it did it happen

1064
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:33,759
I don't even know

1065
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:35,039
A Scalia dead

1066
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:35,807
Not

1067
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,599
I can't prove it but however

1068
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,135
It smells fishy

1069
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,927
Message message

1070
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:42,463
Someone already

1071
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:48,095
Next clip starts with the lyric I'm just going to diffuse this out

1072
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:55,263
I can't imagine a scenario where

1073
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,567
An old man in poor health

1074
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,847
With an 18in knife

1075
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,175
Could fight off whatever the clintons

1076
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:07,807
I assume the place now where I am assuming they think that Hillary does it

1077
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:13,695
It must be Ava and then like

1078
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,487
Covered head-to-toe in one of those play

1079
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:21,887
Plastic I had a really good idea for a product

1080
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:27,263
Balaclava in the shape of a looks like baklava

1081
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,311
Arosso with a baklava

1082
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:35,967
What is a balaclava mask but it looks like baklava

1083
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:38,271
In the shape of a

1084
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:40,063
Someone's made think so

1085
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:40,831
Anyway

1086
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:41,599
Diffusing gas

1087
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:44,927
Larry starts this next clip talking about how butts or puckered

1088
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:45,951
With fear

1089
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,743
Connect mic down for this because

1090
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,279
Everything goes

1091
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:50,815
Very obdurate

1092
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,679
Mine right now Anderson

1093
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:59,007
I'm going to walk my dog

1094
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,031
Is a big

1095
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:00,799
Black

1096
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:04,895
SUV that is pulled up I'm on a walk make sure

1097
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:06,943
Bet they're not

1098
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,479
Inside this house

1099
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:12,319
I know what you told me 20 minutes

1100
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:15,647
I can't stand her in the stuff might be able to talk about it

1101
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,719
Which doesn't believe that for us

1102
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:22,047
No

1103
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:27,423
0 if that were true even if he thought it was even a little

1104
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,215
Oh who do you think

1105
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:31,007
You could be not even that just

1106
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:32,287
I heard what you said

1107
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,055
I'm sick of it

1108
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:36,383
Larry's got a van outside

1109
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,431
And

1110
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:41,503
You heard him.

1111
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,551
You heard him

1112
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:47,391
Still sitting. I'm going to head over to the door

1113
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:53,791
Well I actually a really certain that there's not anything going on outside his house for a reason

1114
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:56,863
A little bit out there

1115
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:03,519
Apparent allegedly he looks out there

1116
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,079
He audibly

1117
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:08,383
Continues to sit.

1118
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:10,687
But the van

1119
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,527
And then turns out

1120
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,295
Devan

1121
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,831
Makes a reappearance later

1122
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,903
Saturday morning I don't know what I was like four other times

1123
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,719

Hell's about to break loose and we're all here

1126

For 7 hours

1127
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:30,911
Broken leaving no cuz I was in my conference room

1128
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:35,263
Screaming saying something Big's about to happen I didn't know this it happened yet

1129
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:36,799
The SUV back

1130
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:42,175
There

1131
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:47,551
Don't worry

1132
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:50,367
I got that 18 inch knife

1133
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:53,183

And a lot of people have it

1137
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,959
Because of the death of us

1138
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:10,591
Quickly makes this van up hearing

1139
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:13,151
Has to do with the fact that

1140
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,175
Got a call from

1141
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:16,991

1142
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:19,039
Tell me what it is

1143
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:21,087
Just found out an hour and a half

1144
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,647

I mean

1147
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:53,599
They didn't even

1148
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:54,367
Bothered

1149
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:55,903
Cover the shop

1150
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,463

Maven

1152
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,143
Vineyard

1153
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:09,215
So it is a murdering you do know that

1154

00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:15,103
What is the story

1156
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,383
Everything

1157
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,943
What do you think the story is

1158
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:19,711
U-Pick

1159
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:25,343

1160
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,159
The people that kill you

1161
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:34,559
He's exhausted with the idea of trying to keep this going

1162
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:41,727
Those guys who are outside your house right now tell you

1163
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:47,615
Outside of your house heater

1164
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:52,223
War of the Worlds but he's just like

00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,231
Call Betsy

1168
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:06,559
I mean

1169
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,607
I have to eat my hat

1170
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,631
Because there's

1171
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,655
Proof okay

1172
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:13,727
Barnacles is weather for holding him over he did on his show

1173
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,079
That

1174
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,455
When he comes back out

1175
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:26,271
But it was pretty clear

1176
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:29,855
Larry trying to hold

1177
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:30,879
Scream

1178
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,415
Close you can

1179
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,439
In front of

00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,975
Your face in an inning forward

1181
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,255
Towards the camera

1182
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:38,047

1186
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,479

00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:08,511
Toca Toca videos

1190
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,047
Darius

00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:13,631
Is so hilarious it's like Alex

1192
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:19,263
Clearly frustrated video video is Larry sitting in his living room

1193
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,799
Holding a flip phone

1194
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:22,335
Oh my God

1195
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,639
What are we doing

1196
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:25,663
Lexus

1197
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:30,015
Self figure it out to be a problem

1198
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:30,783
Because if

1199
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:35,647
Obviously even Larry and Alex realize like no one believed

1200
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:37,695
Yeah

1201
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:40,255
When I had it is the SUV still there

1202
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,559
Get up get up

1203
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,351
Backup

1204
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,191
No one second

1205
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:50,751
Go out there were going to stay with you

1206
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,847
Drive off

1207
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,407
Nearest Wells he's not

1208
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,431
He's not be icing

1209
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:02,271
Cbs's job

1210
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:07,903
Now if you would need to say that if I wasn't already convinced that he was only being full of s*** yeah

1211
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,183
If you notice

1212
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,719
Larry's dog bark

1213
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,487
Oh yeah

1214
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,255
There

1215
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:14,303
Tells you is that

1216
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:19,423
The dog wasn't barking earlier there was a van there people were out

1217
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,959
It was very threatening

1218
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:23,775
The dog had no interest

1219
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:26,335
Yeah

1220
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:29,407
Leary's feelings about scalia's death

1221
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:34,015
Let me let me search back through my

1222
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:36,063
Pictures to find that picture I suppose

1223
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,599
Italy just took right now

1224
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:40,671
I'm not going to come down on the two hard for that because it is a flip phone

1225
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:47,071
And those things were really difficult to navigate to

1226
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,095
Larry had my phone

1227
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,631
So

1228
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,423
He was still using a Motorola

1229
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,447
At the time

1230
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:55,007
So they do eventually flash up what's

1231
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:59,359
Supposed to be a picture of the van in Fry

1232
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:01,663
Phone videos

1233
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:04,223
Anything definitive proof

1234
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:06,527
I can see the plates

1235
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:09,343
It's when my mind's eye the clearest

1236
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,623
Picture ever

1237
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:14,463
Of someone in a van to taken with

1238
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:20,863
I still do pick up crew Getty Images

1239
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:22,399
Alex

1240
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:25,983
I wish I was there or wish I was there to protect you

1241
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:27,775
I confront that trance

1242
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,823
Oh I wish I was there right now

1243
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,383
Do you have any family that's home right now

1244
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,431
No just me

1245
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,199
Me and you

1246
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,807
And your bulldog in the millions watching and listening

1247
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:43,135
For folks that are in

1248
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,927
Arkansas right now

1249
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:55,167
Alex tells like truckers who are in the area to show up at Larry's house

1250
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:04,383
Look at the number

1251
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:10,527
Let's see if people around will stop by your house I guess I wish I was there Larry I have to act like I care

1252
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:12,063
If Alex likes

1253
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:15,391
Sincerely believe that Larry's life is endangered

1254
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:19,743
Because he's talked to Clarence Thomas who is told Larry that it's

1255
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:23,583
Head now there's a black van outside Larry's house that's going to kill him

1256
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:27,167
They should not stop the interview for anything

1257
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:29,727
The only thing it's protected lyrics

1258
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:32,287
Alright lyrics

1259
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:35,359
We're going to let you go hope you survive buddy all right we'll see you later

1260
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:41,759
The weirdos at a trump rally

1261
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:47,391
Much like the pillow

1262
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,415
Is a message

1263
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,183
Okay

1264
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,231
What is this all about

1265
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,583
They're sending a message

1266
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:01,983
Have you looked outside your building

1267
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:06,335
Really worried about it

1268
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:18,879
This is like Larry you're full of s*** and I'm not worried the games up

1269
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:22,719
The radio theater

1270
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:26,303
Game is up Larry come on

1271
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:32,191
I think you know what sucks to is like I think of Alex or more of a giving partner

1272
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:33,727
I think that they could make this work

1273
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:40,383
Yeah I think of Alex were acting actually concerned or scared or anything like that he could real

1274
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:42,943
Lehighton this into being something that like

1275
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:50,367
I don't know I think Larry is the reason that we're we're not getting anything good out of this cuz whoever's just coming with two big

1276
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:52,415
Swing with the van and the lies

1277
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:55,487
It's perfect with you

1278
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:57,279
If you're trying to be like

1279
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:01,119
Of course there is an outside

1280
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:03,423
Yeah there has to be

1281
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,007
DirecTV

1282
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,031
I don't know who did it

1283
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:11,615
I don't know what happened and I don't know if it even happened at all

1284
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,919
That's not what's going to get you killed man

1285
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,455
You say an hour one

1286
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:19,039
Okay Diana is to

1287
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:23,647
Basically treat this like a hostage situation where you taking Alex's show hostage

1288
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:29,023
Pictures of an outside cat live

1289
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:35,423
When you bring it home all right and I didn't know what was going on

1290
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:39,007
So I see a sequel to Stockholm syndrome on this one right here

1291
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:42,591
Did they make a third Speed movie

1292
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:49,503
You have to keep your b******* playing at less than 40 miles an hour otherwise

1293
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:53,599
I hate I hate to say this

1294
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,391
That's like his kind of like

1295
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:56,671
I don't know

1296
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,975
Disrespectful people's reality but

1297
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:01,279
This isn't real

1298
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:03,071
I could have written this way better

1299
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:06,655
If I were a producer Infowars I could have been like guys

1300
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,679
This is just

1301
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:14,079
One week away from being interested if you guys are just embarrassing The Shadow

1302
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:15,871
Yeah you got to sell it

1303
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,919
Yeah you got to sell it they're not selling

1304
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:20,735
Steak should be in Orem

1305
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:28,159
And if you're presenting this as Larry has really really super deep important information that he's gotten

1306
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:30,975
Salvador

1307
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:33,279
You have a responsibility to

1308
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,303
To give something

1309
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:36,607
And I'll tell you what that thing should not be

1310
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,399
Just the fake van

1311
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:39,935
The fake vegan

1312
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:40,959
Not going to do it

1313
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:41,983
But it's important

1314
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,311
Is important is a looming threat

1315
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:49,151
Sure you need you need your a story to be strong

1316
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:55,039
And then the van is a great Beast or protagonist antagonist

1317
01:04:57,855 --> 01:05:00,415
To be a little bit more thought out than this

1318
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:01,951
You need the actors

1319
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:06,815
Alex and bleriot yeah be a little bit more invested you need them like Alex

1320
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,583
Seems to

1321
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:10,143
Poo poo in be almost the entirety

1322
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:16,543
Of this well I mean it's too it's really transparent Larry like we do

1323
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,335
Yeah there is that but that's

1324
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:20,127
I think again that's Larry's fault he's

1325
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,919
Instead of the who what if

1326
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:22,687
Alright

1327
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:24,735
You got to get least give me if

1328
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:29,087
You know like he's not even willing to commit to it was a murder other than being like

1329
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,879
It looks like a murder

1330
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:37,279
Like that the Alex needs you to give him something in order to get excited as possibly Beaver Larry

1331
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,303
F****** Nichols

1332
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,607
Clarence Thomas said that his family killed

1333
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:43,679
Clarence Thomas found the body

1334
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:49,567
You saying it if you saying the Clarence Thomas said it which is obviously it's like there's no in

1335
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:52,383
In court there like all this is Libor something and it's like

1336
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:54,687
It's Larry Nicholson Clarence Thomas said that

1337
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:57,503
His family killed him what are you going to call this

1338
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:58,271
What are we doing

1339
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:01,855
Yeah public figures

1340
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:06,207
And I would say I don't believe that there is an actual relationship

1341
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,487
Between Clarence Thomas

1342
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,511
And Larry Nichols

1343
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:12,607
To be protected

1344
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:17,215
Absurdity of Clarence Thomas

1345
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,007
Giving Larry Nichols

1346
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:19,775
Call

1347
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:22,591
Just by itself while goes bye-bye

1348
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,151
Up

1349
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:25,919
So

1350
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:28,991
Why don't we make fun of the idea that

1351
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,783
You know if you're president when

1352
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:32,319
Chico's Downey become king

1353
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:36,159
Congress you become a duke or Duchess that is something we met

1354
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,231
Larry says it a lot

1355
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:42,559
This this election will be the last presidential election

1356
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:46,143
Actually made me a little bit sad

1357
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,167
Because it is true

1358
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:49,215
Did not make it to

1359
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:52,287
The 2020 election

1360
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,823
The last election he got

1361
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:54,847
Pig farting

1362
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:56,895
It is

1363
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,175
I'm sorry it is

1364
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,967
I want to tell you something

1365
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:02,015
We've never had

1366
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,575
Do we have right now

1367
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:08,159
Applications that are running for office

1368
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,463
Run

1369
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:14,815
This country

1370
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:20,703
And they want to be there Alex

1371
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:24,031
Of the Centrist

1372
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,335
That's left over

1373
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:27,871
And I know

1374
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:31,967
They're out

1375
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:32,735
Forever

1376
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:37,599
And then they then they can be prosecuted so there

1377
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,463
2018 midterms didn't

1378
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,743
No they

1379
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:44,511
They didn't

1380
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,559
The new other people got in

1381
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,375
Surrounded

1382
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,143
16

1383
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,959
But that they ran on make me your Duke

1384
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:55,263
Rose where most of the campaigns that I heard

1385
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,335
Duke of Chicago

1386
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,639
Is the

1387
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:02,943
I don't want Dick Durbin to be my duke

1388
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:03,967
Get the f*** out of

1389
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:10,879
Duke Dick Durbin that's annoying I would that's the only reason I need a really good Saturday

1390
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,647
I can't do.

1391
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:15,743
Urban

1392
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,535
Yeah

1393
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,815
Silly silly nonsense

1394
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,863
Hillary Clinton

1395
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,399
She's going to run

1396
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,167
Sharky is Ronnie

1397
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:29,055
I actually was listening to this I thought how funny it would be if like

1398
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:30,335
Larry

1399
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:31,359
Passes away

1400
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,127
Atman

1401
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:33,407
Hillary Clinton

1402
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:34,943
Does run

1403
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:47,487
Tragic that would be sad

1404
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:49,791
16 or else there'll be consequences

1405
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:53,631
Does for her you understand now just win or lose for

1406
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:54,655
Either she gets

1407
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:56,447
Be what she wanted to be

1408
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,727
Patient she was 4 years old

1409
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,031
President of

1410
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:01,311
United States

1411
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:03,103
And pan

1412
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:08,991
She goes to

1413
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:11,295
Jojo

1414
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,575
Chile game

1415
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:18,207
If you look at some of the decisions being look

1416
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,999
Supreme Court

1417
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,303
Thank you Sissy

1418
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:24,863
Aaliyah

1419
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,655
So you're saying it was Hillary

1420
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:30,239
Yes I'm pretty sure he's saying it was Hillary Clarence Thomas

1421
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:33,055
It's called him an hour before this show

1422
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:35,615
I said that Hillary killed Scalia

1423
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,919
That sounds true

1424
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:40,479
Music that's the sense that you probably would get

1425
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:43,039
If you were an Alex Jones listener anywhere listen

1426
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,575
Coming to this complete

1427
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:45,343
Nothing

1428
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,879
They're doing

1429
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:49,439
Because they're not giving any information just like all of this

1430
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:51,487
Like nutty insinuation

1431
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,815
It's not even really speculation

1432
01:09:55,071 --> 01:10:01,215
It's it's it's not even like analyzing any of the information involved no literally just saying I think it looks bad

1433
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:03,519
I don't know why I don't know how

1434
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:07,103
It's creating a narrative and then also

1435
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,895
Constantly saying like

1436
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:14,527
This is annoyingly pointless

1437
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,831
You know

1438
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,879
I always enjoy it when you left

1439
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:19,903
Listen to a podcast

1440
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:22,463
Maybe one of the hostesses learn

1441
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,023
Something new to our you know it's like

1442
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:30,143
Mind blown. Larry has just learned something

1443
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:31,679
Alex

1444
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:32,703
About that

1445
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,727
Until this weekend

1446
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,287
2012

1447
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:37,567
Call Mama sunshine

1448
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:38,847
Residential specialist

1449
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:42,175
And a hundred miles on either side

1450
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,711
Border to the north

1451
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:44,735
Canada

1452
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:47,039
Hundred miles either side South

1453
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:47,807
Mexico

1454
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:49,343
Atlantic

1455
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,367
Ocean

1456
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:51,135
The Pacific

1457
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,975
Is considered or called

1458
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:55,743
What's it called

1459
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:56,767
No

1460
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:59,071
The tution song

1461
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:00,607
Absolutely

1462
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,703
Can you make no comments

1463
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:09,823
Constitution expressly prohibits

1464
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,359
Miles from

1465
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,895
The border is the No Flex

1466
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:15,455
True

1467
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,223
You're not wrong

1468
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:23,135
Kind of a real thing although it's not like I mean it's not the same as what they're saying

1469
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:29,535
Think about the dhs's ability to operate even though there are federal agents yeah yeah

1470
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:30,815
Caption for search

1471
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:34,399
Within 100 miles of the border which is just

1472
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,423
Certified by

1473
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,471
A reasonable distance from the borders

1474
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:38,751
Customs and immigration

1475
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:40,543
I have that kind of leeway

1476
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:47,199
Which worked out great for us thanks Obama I'm sure that's never going to be abused by some other admits out and they come

1477
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:49,247
Then immediately after the problem

1478
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:54,623
You're buying into Larry's bulshit Obama didn't do that he didn't know he didn't create that

1479
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:59,999
You didn't find an article from Wired from 2008 about hubby ACLU was fighting

1480
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:02,559
To curb the use of this as a police search tool

1481
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:04,863
Predates Obama's time in office

1482
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:08,703
Hey something it's always existed as an exemption for Border searches

1483
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:11,519
And it was codified into law in 1976

1484
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:13,311
Text but after 9/11

1485
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:19,711
The definitions of what specific area around the Border could be this kind of jurisdiction Organics

1486
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:23,551
Real issue it have solutely it and it's something

1487
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:26,111
You know someone who Alex pretends to be

1488
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:28,927
This figure in the space that he

1489
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:30,975
Likes to fancy himself

1490
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:33,279
Talking about importing out

1491
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,303
But it's

1492
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:39,679
Just pointless to pretend that Obama did in the game that Larry wants playing

1493
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,447
That's bulshit

1494
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:46,591
Also Congressional Democrats introduced legislation to reduce the area from 100 Mi to 25 back in 2019

1495
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:48,639
But baptized legislation went nowhere

1496
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:53,503
Announcer probably say was just them trying to flood the country with undocumented immigrant

1497
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:55,551
He probably be in favor

1498
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:58,111
How's this hundred-mile No Flex Zone

1499
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:59,135
Yeah nothing

1500
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,671
Anyting

1501
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:05,535
Exhausted particularly exhausting about that Isabel like okay what you're talkin

1502
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:06,303
Sing about

1503
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,327
We could both

1504
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,863
Be opposed to 4

1505
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:10,399
Completely different reason

1506
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:12,703
Larry Nichols could both be again

1507
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:16,543
Answer this hundred-mile quote-unquote no Constitution Zone

1508
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:19,871
But we would never we should never

1509
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:24,735
Be able to work together on the issues we actually don't I mean

1510
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:26,527
Thing about that though is

1511
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:28,319
Even if we come to it from differin

1512
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,087
Perspectives

1513
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:31,647
That does mean that we could just

1514
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,415
Stop it

1515
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,207
You know

1516
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,999
Like I can just stop doing it

1517
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:41,119
That's the thing that they boggles my mind all too often with this stuff is like

1518
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,143
Yeah Larry

1519
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:44,959
Let's f****** get rid of that 100 miles bulshit

1520
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:47,519
I'm with you so let's all just do that

1521
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:49,311
But it never be

1522
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,847
It's just one of those

1523
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:54,175
Political inertia things where it's just like that seems like too much work

1524
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:55,199
Wow

1525
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,479
Anyway

1526
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:58,527
We have one last leap year from the 6

1527
01:13:59,039 --> 01:13:59,807
And it's

1528
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:00,575
Alex

1529
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:02,111
Fixing the issue

1530
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,135
Embarrassed

1531
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:06,719
Larry will be killed by the people in that van

1532
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,511
Who will Larry Nichols call

1533
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:10,559

01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:06,879
From Death doesn't mean I still can't

1559
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:07,903
Can't plan for the future

1560
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:11,231
He's not on the Nightly News

1561
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:12,511
Evening February

1562
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:16,863
The next time that Larry's name shows up in the episode description

1563
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:19,423
For Alex's

1564
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:22,239
And this is the next time that Larry was on

1565
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:25,823
And I wanted to know what the fuc

1566
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:26,591
Clarence Thomas

1567
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:29,407
You're sure because I listen to that whole thing

1568
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:31,967
There was nothing nothing was just a fan

1569
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:32,991
Nothing

1570
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:33,759
Nothing

1571
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:37,599
Wearing a gold Platinum solder doesn't need any introduction

1572
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,135
I'm interviewing him for 20 years

1573
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,927
21 years

1574
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:47,583
And he's a conference live inside of The Clinton Chronicles all of it couldn't be done without him to Larry's on

1575
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:48,607
Let's talk about it

1576
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,655
Let's talk about this information

1577
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:57,567
Now I know early on in the Clinton ministration I tried to destroy certain people that will be nominated to Supreme

1578
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:03,711
And they became an early Source on the internet for a lot of fun

1579
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:04,479
Dog shelter

1580
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:11,135
Annie battling cancer right now she needs your prayers that's another issue but one resentment almost last few days

1581
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:16,767
To get ahold of

1582
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:21,375
I imagine he's busy being a Supreme Court Justice and not asking any questions then

1583
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:23,423
In General trying to destroy the world

1584
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,959
Yeah so I mean hey

1585
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,007

Got Back

1589
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:36,223
In touch with

1590
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:37,247
Justice Thomas

1591
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:38,783
Who they

1592
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:40,575
Refuse to just

1593
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:43,903
Be upfront about it could be any Supreme Court

1594
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:53,119
Larry's go back on Alex

1595
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,143
Because the audience

1596
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:58,239
Naturally I completely agree the audience's reaction based on my listening

1597
01:16:58,751 --> 01:16:59,263
60

1598
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:01,823

Haven't they told you

1608
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:23,327
Discuss

1609
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:25,375
Let's start with the black

1610
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,655
Sedan last

1611
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:28,447

This is how hard

1617
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:49,183
This is how I farted

1618
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,207
No but it's

1619
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:53,535
Yes it is half-hearted

1620
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:54,559
But it is

1621
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:57,887
Double humorous

1622
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:07,359
What are nipples supposed to come on and give Alex a big

1623
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:09,151
Scoop or at least take

1624
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:11,967
Paquete for some kind of bulshit narrative something

The foundation was there

1628
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:26,303
Larry refused to play ball Lanza playing all you got to do is land the plane look at that van out there isn't that scary

1629

Text me and I told the police here

1635
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,639
But they had no jurist

1636
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:44,479
Pretty much

1637
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:45,247
Let them

1638
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:47,295
Leave that I had a one-way ticket

Not how I end up

1646
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:07,775
In the middle of this drunk Alex I never can

1647
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:08,543
Figure out

1648
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:11,359
All-you-can-eat

1649
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:13,151
Jamaica.

1650
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:17,759
I loved that moment for two reasons

1651
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:19,807
What does do we got to do if you feel for me

Cocky cocky assholes which I love

How do I find myself in the middle of these six

1655
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:36,447
Record scratches

1656
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:40,287
Play ended up becoming entrenched in Clinton

1657
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:41,311
Conspiracy theories

1658
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:43,615
Because I made up a bunch of bulshit

1659
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:44,639
A

1660
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:45,407
Khalid

1661
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:47,455
How do you like being here again

1662
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:56,159
They said that I mean

1663
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:03,071
There's no way there's no spelling out what was going on

1664
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,607
Other stories

1665
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:07,935
I actually got another bit of news for you

1666
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:11,263
The Republican hierarchy this tab

1667
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:13,567
They have decided

1668
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:15,360
Go fighting Donald Trump

1669
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:17,664
Dragon fighting

1670
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,432
Wow

1671
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:22,272
Wow it's not quite what you think

1672
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,832
Haha they're not going to fight him

1673
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:31,488
At the convention they're going to f*** it okay that makes sense contested convention

1674
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:32,768
Get screwed

1675
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:36,864
It's pretty boring

1676
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:39,424
And far more

1677
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:43,008
Tristan is Larry trying to rationalize why

1678
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:45,568
Obama hasn't just put in

1679
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:47,872
A Supreme Court Justice

1680
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:49,152
Dictator

1681
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:52,992
He's a tyrant yeah yeah we based on every

1682
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:55,296
Recharacterization that they've ever had of a lollipop

1683
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:04,256
The only reason the Republicans are blocking the hearing

1684
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:07,584
In the hearing is

1685
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,120
Used to get them through this election

1686
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:09,888
Incycle

1687
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:14,496
Winston November

1688
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:16,288
Situation with Obama

1689
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:19,104
Put in Spring Court Justice

1690
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:26,272
Legislature or the next Congress Obama keep saying into time people want it now he's going to wait till after the election

1691
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:29,088
What shows is a deal going on

1692
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:30,624
Exactly

1693
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:35,744
Now this happen

1694
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,816
Nope just making it up

1695
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:39,584
Honestly

1696
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:42,400
I think I would have preferred that happen

1697
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:48,288
It's an interesting rationalize why the GOP is acting like

1698
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:50,080
An adversarial party with

1699
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:52,896
Your entire worldview depends on them being the same

1700
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,944
Yeah yeah it is

1701
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,248
Is an interesting way to walk around that

1702
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:58,272
Although

1703
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:01,600
In every way

1704
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:03,392
They're still

1705
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:06,208
Discuss

1706
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:07,744
Larry and Alex discussed a bit

1707
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,048
2015 and that was that Obama was going to

1708
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,352
King For Life sure sure

1709
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:14,144
Discuss that here a little bit

1710
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:16,704
They steal it from from

1711
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,496
There's going to be civil unrest

1712
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:20,288
And maybe that's what Obama wants

1713
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:23,104
He's got his black lives matter group

1714
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,664
Fallout ready to activate

1715
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:27,968
You know that's

1716
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:40,256
Nothing better

1717
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:42,304
To get cheated out of

1718
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,632
Direction to there to be an uprising and then boom

1719
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:46,912
You don't have to worry about it

1720
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,192
KB

1721
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:49,216
Qbking

1722
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:50,240
Forever glitched

1723
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:52,544
We know how King

1724
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,592
Do that they just get done

1725
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:58,432
Exactly the situation that Alex

1726
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:00,224
Describes all the time where it's like

1727
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:02,016
I know that's what they would do

1728
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:08,672
That's what I would do like listening to them describe all of the stuff that Trump is actively trying to do

1729
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:14,560
Feels like he's there's that's one of the things that makes me always be very like hyper

1730
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:16,352
Cautious about foxes

1731
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:17,376
Like that

1732
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:18,912
Am I succumbing

1733
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:20,704
Two similar feelings

1734
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,984
As like what Alec

1735
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:23,008
Sure

1736
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:25,568
And if Obama had

1737
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:27,616
And I'm going to be president for another

1738
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:29,408
12 years I think there's a difference

1739
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:33,760
Situation that really piss people off

1740
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:36,576
Yeah it's not similar at all but it is

1741
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:37,344
Lititz

1742
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:40,672
Did you have to check in on it

1743
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:41,952
Ryobi router

1744
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:45,536
Right and the other things really interesting here is like you hear this

1745
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:46,560
Alex is like

1746
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:48,352
Obama got his black lives matter

1747
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:49,888
Exact same thing

1748
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:52,960
This is so four years in the past

1749
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:54,496
But

1750
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:55,776
One glaring difference

1751
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:02,944
How to know about antifa even though he's

1752
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:09,344
No mention of that or demon it seems like that would be really important about antifa

1753
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,648
Teamed up with black lives matter and the devil

1754
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:13,184
Right he should have warned us

1755
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,208
Call Rebecca 26

1756
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:16,512
16 G is already about to

1757
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:18,560
Started

1758
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:20,352
16 about Plan B

1759
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:24,960
Help out with Plan B

1760
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:27,264
Tell me one last leap year

1761
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:29,312
From Larry's appearance on the 24th

1762
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:32,384
I will say that my son

1763
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:33,920
From listen

1764
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:34,944
Sing to these interviews

1765
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:40,576
Is it Larry wants the audience to believe that Hillary Clinton is behind the murder of Antonin Scalia

1766
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:41,856
That sounds right

1767
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:43,392
Seems to be

1768
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:48,256
He's making point he's a little OneNote when we get down to it every everything

1769
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:51,072
Wines of getting back to Hillary Clinton trying to kill

1770
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:52,864
There's another clip I wish I would have got the

1771
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,912
But there is a point where Larry

1772
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:59,520
Seems to think that it's going to come down to him and verse Hillary

1773
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:02,592
Like a matrix situation

1774
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:04,384
Like Hillary is Agents

1775
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:08,736
Smith and he's Neo and they're going to do battle is 100 calories

1776
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:14,368
Alright that makes sense now

1777
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:17,696
Do you like not like that belief system

1778
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:20,000
I think that that is what he's pushing

1779
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:22,048
As the thing that he wants the audience

1780
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:24,096
To believe the Clarence Thomas and told him

1781
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:26,656
He doesn't want the responsibility of having to be on the hook

1782
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:28,448
For any of your charger yet

1783
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:31,264
Observer Lee makes me pissed off when he says something like this

1784
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:33,568
Let me say it this way if you know Alex

1785
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,848
I have never said

1786
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:44,576
Talking about Hillary

1787
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:45,856
HEB

1788
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:46,880
The kind of person that

1789
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:48,672
Problem

1790
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:50,464
Saying off the guy

1791
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:52,256
Do it in a second

1792
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:53,280
In a sec

1793
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:54,304
That's

1794
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,328
So

1795
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,400
Unbelievable thing that I've made my

1796
01:25:58,656 --> 01:26:00,448
Higher career out of

1797
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:07,104
You know I've never said anything like that no I've never killed anyone

1798
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:12,224
But I know for about a bit but she wouldn't be up yet

1799
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:17,856
Why would you do that

1800
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:18,880
Why would you

1801
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:20,416
Abused Us in that way

1802
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,208
What is

1803
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:24,512
World class

1804
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:25,536
Deckshop

1805
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:29,888
Anyway I don't care to

1806
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,680
Mock the Dead

1807
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:33,472
But I do think there's something

1808
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:35,008
Still very fun

1809
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:36,544
But celebrating the life in

1810
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,312
Career

1811
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:39,616
Somebody who

1812
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:43,456
Was this transparent of covid-19

1813
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:47,296
I need somehow made a career out of it. I believe

1814
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,832
I mean we talked to Larry

1815
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:53,440
You talked to him a couple times

1816
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:54,464
2A shooting

1817
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:57,024
Ozium on various shows

1818
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:59,840
And I I don't I don't think you would be have a problem

1819
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:02,400
Amethyst laughing at him no absolutely not

1820
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:05,216
If I were him

1821
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:06,240
I would expect

1822
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:07,776
Yeah

1823
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:10,848
No I think I think based on our conversations

1824
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:13,152
This is it absolutely

1825
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:15,200
Something that he would Delight him

1826
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:21,344
Probably like when we talked to him and he was spitting his bulshit you could tell he had a bit of a smile on as we were like

1827
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,136
You're foolish it and he's like

1828
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:24,928
Believe what you want

1829
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,256
He's like yeah we both know that we do believe that either.

1830
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:29,536
Stop it

1831
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:35,936
I mean no disrespect to his family members who who who survived him and

1832
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:39,520
Like piss on a grave or anything

1833
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:42,080
Do Daleks type terms

1834
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:45,408
I do I also think that

1835
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,944
I want to take a moment Direct

1836
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,504

1837
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,296
Live Science

1838
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:54,112
It is a momentous

1839
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:55,136
Mobile weather

1840
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:57,440
Alex will accepted or not sure

1841
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:04,352
David Mayer

1842
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:06,144
Who I should go check

1843
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:09,216
This is one of those things where it kind of feels to me like

1844
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:10,496
This is the

1845
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:12,032
Cutthroat world of

1846
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:14,848
Right-wing propaganda is once you stop being useful

1847
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,640
Whether you're alive or dead

1848
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:17,408
You're just

1849
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:23,552
I worry about that too and I worried about that too

1850
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:25,088
Definitive statements is because

1851
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:26,624
There are episodes that I haven't

1852
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:30,720
Listen to Richard maybe two minutes of one of them is Alexei

1853
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:32,256
Rest in peace Larry or something

1854
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:35,072
Based on the import

1855
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:36,864
Ancillary nickels to Alex

1856
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:38,400
That's not good enough

1857
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:39,936
There should be

1858
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:43,264
Like Alex a commission to Musical

1859
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:46,080
Or something about this great guy

1860
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:48,384
Yeah you should have done

1861
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:54,528
24-hour the greatest hits Marathon or something

1862
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:55,808
It's still

1863
01:28:56,832 --> 01:29:02,208
Weird that it's weird that were like not to make fun of his death or not to mock

1864
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:03,232
The family and yet

1865
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:06,304
We're like the only people who are really paying attention to it

1866
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:07,584
In the first place

1867
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:14,240
It seems like they're dealing with it

1868
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:16,288
Is is weightless it it feels like it is

1869
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:20,384
Infuriated I care more than Alex

1870
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,944
This is a brother-sister problem for me

1871
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:27,296
Everyone is disposable to an extent like we saw how

1872
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:28,832
Ignore Alex

1873
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:33,184
Turn his back on folks likes Tulare if there

1874
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:37,024
Their momentary brand of propaganda isn't what he dies

1875
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:40,096
There's so many people who used to be

1876
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:42,144
Affected experts who now we're just

1877
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:43,680
You know not

1878
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:45,728
Welcome

1879
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:48,288
In the Infowars fear and then

1880
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,616
You know it's it's a bummer it is a bummer because

1881
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,664
It makes

1882
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,200
It makes things very transaction

1883
01:29:55,712 --> 01:30:00,576
Like with Trump you know there's just no loyalty I don't understand why these people come

1884
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:02,368
Some sort of

1885
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:03,904
Loyal Rewards

1886
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:04,672
The Bel Air

1887
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:05,440
Just going to be tossed

1888
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:06,464
Decide when they're useless

1889
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:08,000
Until they come up with something

1890
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:09,024
Cool

1891
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:14,144
Egyptian sex party

1892
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:16,192
Recipes Larry

1893
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:18,240

1894
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:21,056

01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:41,792
I was driving that black van

1901
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,424
