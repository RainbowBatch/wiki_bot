00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Air Jordan

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
MoneyGram

4
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
Fight.com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Acknowledge

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,840
About Alex Jones

7
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,888
Jordan

8
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,168
What's up

9
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,704
What about today

10
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,104
Well I mean obviously there's only one bright spot for me

11
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,968
Possible bride

12
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:24,992
Snow delay mean

13
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,272
The experience of watching

14
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:30,112
It was only it was fairly long

15
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:36,512
Significantly longer

16
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,304
Matches that are going over 2 days

17
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,096
Yeah but

18
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:47,520
Rafa and Djokovic played the

19
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,568
Going in my mind through the greatest

20
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,384
Mismatches in all of tennis history and

21
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
Djokovic and Rafael played

22
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,968
The greatest clay-court match

23
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,504
In the history of jazz

24
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,576
Without question the third set lasted

25
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,392
An hour and 40 minutes

26
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:06,720
That is the length of most Rafa on Clay match

27
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,536
And that was just a Thursday and it was just

28
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:15,680
Spectacular shot medication for it was impossible shots

29
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,216
Left and right

30
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,544
Truly incredible and Djokovic one unfortunately

31
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,824
B i

32
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,848
I mean there's no

33
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:29,248
There's no shame there 33 points Go a different way and Rafa win 6-3 6-3

34
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:34,112
Blues

35
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,672
Totally there's nothing to be said for like

36
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,208
You are able to go that

37
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:44,096
You were able to go that hard enough French Open

38
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,120
Pens for people to think

39
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
He's pretty good on

40
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,424
He's one of

41
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
Whew that's what I've heard

42
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:53,568
Alright on play for solo for so long but well it was just

43
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,848
It was incredible to watch

44
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,384
Well I'm happy for you

45
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,968
But you got to watch that

46
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:04,832
6. I'm not joking I got that from your Tech

47
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
Indignant

48
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136
Hence emotional experience

49
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:11,232
My bright spot is actually kind of a athletic thing as well

50
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,792
Recently the switch

51
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,584
At the Nintendo switch

52
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,192
Updated it start the game so you cannot play Mario parties with people

53
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,984
In other places

54
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,800
Yeah and so I've started playing some Mario Party

55
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,360
With folks who live in other states

56
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,152
Some friends of mine and

57
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,432
I am

58
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,456
Essentially

59
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
Beat It

60
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,696
I accept and I understand

61
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,512
I understand all these things

62
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,560
But yeah I've been

63
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,584
I've been killing it

64
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,376
In the Mario Party game

65
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,192
I don't think there's anything wrong with getting confirmation as a

66
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,216
An adult that you could

67
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,496
Defeat children at something

68
00:03:54,752 --> 00:04:00,896
Yeah you know Life's good sometimes you see kids do stuff in your like there's no chance I have

69
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,224
Competing with that makes you feel bad cuz you're an adult

70
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,528
Really beat the s*** out of kids

71
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,832
You can sometimes be well maybe that's too far

72
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:13,440
But really beating him can feel good one of the one of the fun things to about this this Mario Party

73
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:14,976
This iteration

74
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
Another game is

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,280
It's a tablespaces where you can

76
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
Can get a friend

77
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,143
So you'll just have like I always plays Waluigi

78
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:28,543
My friend follow me

79
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,079
Fun

80
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,407
Anyway I Jordan today we have an episode to go over will be back in

81
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,223
The present today a little bit

82
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,015
It is weird

83
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,319
2821 B

84
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,719
Maybe maybe that's

85
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
So

86
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:57,727
It's a Monumental day in a lot of ways it is also a day of

87
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,007
Walking through

88
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,543
Knee deep mud

89
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,311
Yeah

90
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,335
Alex

91
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:06,687
This content

92
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,735
Yeah

93
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,575
Things like whether or not we're all going to die

94
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,135
Is dealt with quite

95
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,463
At length I mean that seems pretty important

96
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,511
I must be answers know in which case

97
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,047
It's not very important at all is it

98
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,095
You put that on the back burner ablation

99
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:29,983

Stream everybody else there's nothing that is behind very hard

106
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:57,375

107
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:04,031
Onyx from my brother Ben

Correct yes

123
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,959
You accidentally said policy

124
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:11,359
Oh I'm sorry I didn't want anybody to Twitter messages

125
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:17,759

Shove

128
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,487
Jordan we have to do a little signal before we getting

129
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,279
Today's episode

130
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,071
Is taking the World by storm

131
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,887
Giving someone life is giving someone death

132
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,215
You can say that

133
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,311
Life is death

134
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,335
You can

135
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
That's true.

136
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:47,455
Who is the best cat uncle and snail dead

137
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:52,575
Write a birthday on the 6th happy birthday good night also

138
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,623
Is it this is a this is a weird one

139
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,671
So Sarah sent me a message

140
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,767
It said her friend Joe has a birthday in June here

141
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,815
Happy birthday Joe

142
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,607
Sarah also told me

143
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:11,519
The Joe will not say when his birthday is

144
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,055
I like this a great deal

145
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:17,151
I am conflicted

146
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:20,479
One level I enjoy people retaining some mystery in their life

147
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,807
Course but on the other hand just tell your friend when their birthday is

148
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,903
If you're not on Facebook they might not remember anyway

149
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:34,303
Reminder birthday

150
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,607
If somebody doesn't want to tell you their birthday then you have to

151
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:43,007
To surreptitiously Discover it in anyway but follow them to the DMV one right

152
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:48,127
And then be in the corner just with a little pair of magnifying glasses

153
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,919
Eyeglasses if you well something along those

154
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:56,575
Yeah you have to do something

155
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,671
Tell Sarah what day your birthday is the parents

156
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,999
There their they're ready and waiting to give you

157
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:08,095

00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:54,687
Alright well

00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,415
Alexandra hope you have a great birthday

173
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:09,535
Boy born

Is the condition that leads to death

175
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,679
Life is a disease that ends in death

176
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,471
Happy life is death Day to all of you

177
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,239

If you were anybody but himself

188
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,591
Sure since he is himself

189
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:58,431
Is regular more I would describe it as a pretty normal Personnel at the gym

190
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:03,039
I've been saying this a lot before the shows just because all I do is tell you how I feel

191
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,671
That's a really great wave

192
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,231
Now this is really

193
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,303
Starting to set in on me

194
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,935
Around around

195
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,751
And I was already ready to date

196
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,031
To come on air

197
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,103
All members of the

198
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,895
Preston is amounts of young people

199
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,479
I have a heart attack

200
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,527
From the so-called covid vaccine

201
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,319
And then

202
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,367
I was sent a

203
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391
A big Twitter feed

204
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,975
My good friend of mine a national talk show host

205
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,583
The Twitter feed

206
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,399
Medical documents

207
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
And

208
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,775
Ashley got dizzy almost passed out

209
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,591
Alex almost passed out cuz you read a Twitter thread

210
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,151
Yeah it's

211
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,431
It's a little much

212
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:09,087
It's kind of amazing how accidentally self-aware that first bit I do is get on the radio and tell you how I

213
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:15,487
I feel such a great like yeah man you got it but identified the problem

214
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:20,351
Nailed it all YouTube people

215
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,375
Yeah I did

216
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:26,751
It's somehow we really cathartic to people who are really angry

217
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,335
Oh God no that's me isn't it

218
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
Yeah I am

219
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,503
Interested in what was going on here what was up with this Twitter thread I wasn't so interested in his like

220
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,319
I'm so angry I can't do the show and

221
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
Body hurt

222
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,903
Happens all the time

223
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
Time

224
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,951
The present day is like

225
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:51,839
So boring with something that's so interesting like anybody else

226
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,607
Doing this

227
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,887
Would be

228
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,423
Good ground break

229
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,823
Anybody got a boss acting like oh my God

230
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,663
Fire this is how TV shows start

231
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:09,759
And then they get worse from what the first episode you like

232
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,319
Alex Alex talked a little bit more about

233
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,367
Do you have that effect

234
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,391
Women

235
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,927
When you're overwhelmed by something and

236
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:17,951
Just passed out

237
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,535
And that's really the point

238
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,327
Nothing

239
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,655
Rolling forward I was reading

240
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,263
About 100,000 people getting sick from the shots that are young

241
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,055
Are children

242
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,127
It just pisses me off it's on my brain says

243
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:42,527
Go out and you know do you know what people are doing this

244
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,183
What is overwhelming

245
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:52,511
I looked up the most recent information on the cdc's website

246
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:57,631
And there have been reports of 5208 deaths of people who have gotten

247
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,911
The covid-19 vaccine

248
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,679
Alright

249
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:05,823
This is Alice 302 million doses administered which represents 8.00 17 death rate

250
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:13,503
Even if you assume the ridiculous absolute worst-case scenario that all of the dancer even related or linked

251
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,575
To the vaccines at all it would be a p0017

252
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:22,207
I thought Africa too dangerous for a vaccine Dan and the truth of the matter is that they are not all

253
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:28,351
So so it's too dangerous to even hear about the vaccine I guess so

254
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:34,751
It's also there is something that's been happening lately there been some more more reports of younger people

255
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,543
Having some inflammation

256
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
They could be connect

257
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,383
To do vaccinations

258
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,783
And it's something that needs more study there have been 623 reports of myocarditis or

259
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,575
Pericarditis in persons aged

260
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,367
30 or under post-vaccination

261
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,719
These are primarily males and I'm through review of medical records

262
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,743
The CDC was able to

263
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,767
Looking for a 200

264
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
68 of these

265
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,863
None of these cases have resulted in deaths in only 50

266
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,143
Teen ended up hospitalized

267
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,727
With 41 of them experiencing ongoing unspecified symptoms

268
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,543
This is not good obviously

269
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,127
And it's something to CDC is investigating in one they have Morgan

270
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,175
Information will know a bit more about it

271
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,967
Dealing with the story is

272
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,991
Is just sensational

273
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:17,759
The point of

274
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,039
Being dangerous

275
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,135
Makes me want to do you know what

276
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,415
Yeah I thought about killing

277
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:30,815
It is it is amazing he's he's exemplary he's he's doing part of the trolley

278
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,887
Ethical question where he's like you know

279
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,167
We can't

280
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,215
Hurt one person

281
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,751
With a vaccine

282
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,543
To save five other people's lives

283
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,079
What we need to do

284
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,383
Is throw that person in front of the

285
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
The train

286
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:50,527
And then having the train run over the five people after that and then I live happily ever after

287
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,343
Throw in front of the train as a doctor

288
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,367
Exactly

289
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,743
I'm going to get all of these people killed and then I'm going to jump on top of the train and fly

290
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
Yeah

291
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,095
So the first hour I would say is

292
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
Meandering

293
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,679
It's a bit me every

294
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,495
Because as we as we learned in this

295
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,519
Play squip

296
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,055
Alex is so much news

297
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,591
So big

298
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
Like its balls

299
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,895
He's getting chills

300
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,967
Years ago out of 100

301
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,271
Article her seller might be one really big one

302
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,135
I have more than 50 devastating reports

303
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,415
Better confirm

304
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,207
Send chills up my spine

305
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,231
Lightning round

306
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,375
Real realization of how screwed

307
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,447
I walked outside

308
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,031
Oh my gosh

309
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:49,407
That happened a thousand years ago

310
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
I think I like that

311
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,527
Because

312
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:58,111
Something in motion that is the plan organize total collapse

313
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,903
A civilization in math

314
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,695
But I was in a bad mood

315
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:08,607
There's something happening we're all dead

316
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:15,007
Definitely doesn't seem to be much wiggle room.

317
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:23,967
For all of us are we we didn't few minutes the plant explosion into a red giant Earth is still gone man

318
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,551
Yeah yeah and that the way you speaking about this is obviously meant

319
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,343
To be like there's nothing he could do or I'll f***

320
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,415
I mean

321
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,975
It's certainly not inspiring

322
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,631
Over-the-hill man

323
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,655
Charge

324
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,727
That you necessarily want

325
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:50,079
I know that Patton but he was giving me some of his sort of famous

326
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,615
Speech is generally black

327
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,431
We are f****** bedworth screwed

328
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,991
Rachel fight them on the beaches

329
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,295
It won't matter you're all f****** dead

330
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,343
I thought that's all you blow up

331
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:09,535
So I think the sun blow up metaphorically one of the things you might want to do is run away to a bunker

332
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,071
You know

333
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:17,471
I mean if it's the sun I would just lay down and be like let's do this man there's no hope at this point that's why I said

334
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,239
Metaphorically

335
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:23,103
Metaphorically might want to run to the Hills

336
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,151
It's the end of civilization

337
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:30,271
Selfishness but my very cell

338
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,855
Get out of Austin get your family out

339
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,159
I know the most remote area and dig and now

340
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
Go

341
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,487
But if we do that the globalist went

342
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,815
They're going to accelerate their collapse and finally dig us out of our holes later

343
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:49,983
Every movie every show is not coming out with dystopic

344
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,079
Planetary extermination robots killing us

345
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,711
Conditioning everyone to accept that

346
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,831
The video games the movies

347
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:08,927
What about movies from like the 60s about robot

348
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,207
No no

349
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:17,119
Battlestar Galactica never happened every movie is now

350
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:23,263
No that's true and it's so funny that we're also in the past

351
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,287
And he's like

352
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:30,943
I'm pretty sure that Saddam is in the United States did Russia or Australia and then he's like they're going to come

353
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:36,319
What's up out of our holes and I'm like why you don't even know man OU's in the past don't even know

354
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,647
Some people get Dugout a-holes buddy

355
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,975
Yes Alex is pretty pretty doomed heavy

356
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,791
Here even actually kind of more so than usual

357
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,095
Like I think a lot of the time he doesn't descend

358
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,119
This deeply

359
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:52,447
Into that Abyss

360
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:56,287
It was a medium

361
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:02,431
You got to ease me into that it was a media have two going over commercial breaks to like

362
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:07,551
Person when he come back he was still doing this alright alright

363
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:13,951
So we're in the word full on the the guy in The Watchmen shouting for the end of the world territory

364
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,743
That's what was what's going on

365
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,023
Here's the situation

366
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,095
What do you have been like let's say

367
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:23,423
I don't know convicted of a horrible crime in your put in front of

368
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:24,959
Squad

369
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,263
They'll put a little

370
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,543
Blindfold over you

371
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,431
Alex is doing the opposite

372
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,711
Aiden is next clip

373
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,735
Do wonders

374
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,015
If maybe he shouldn't

375
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:42,111
Do the opposite maybe he should allow people to just have a blindfold

376
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,207
This is not a deer in the

377
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
Watch moment

378
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,607
It's almost obscene

379
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,447
To even tell everybody does it is kind of like

380
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:59,263
They put a blindfold on somebody who's in a firing squad

381
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,335
Watch themselves because

382
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,175
And I got to give you a cigarette

383
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:06,943
Maybe a little

384
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,711
Brandy

385
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,735
Before

386
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,783
Also polite

387
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,367
So you know what

388
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,024
We kill our babies

389
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,608
So I guess

390
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,680
I just guessed prepared everything collapsed

391
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:28,960
And

392
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,984
Destroy

393
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,800
Guess that's just really yet

394
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,336
Prepare to die

395
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,872
Seems to be Alex's message

396
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:40,736
That's what day was

397
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:45,344
The 10th was Thursday right before the weekend

398
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,440
Port Arthur Dent he just never got the hang of Thursday's

399
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,328
What's up you know it's like everybody's working

400
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,864
Can for the weekend

401
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,632
It's just rough

402
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:01,728
Yeah Loverboy was also pissed off as hell about Thursday

403
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,056
So there might be an answer

404
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,592
Maybe

405
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,152
I'm listening to the B2 I don't know if

406
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:12,224
This is exactly the message you're going to take away from it

407
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,248
Maybe

408
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:16,832
The answer is blindly accepting whatever Alex wants

409
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,600
You to do

410
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,136
And not questioning anything

411
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:19,904
And just do it

412
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,464
Wow to be what you think

413
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,256
Will solve all the problems

414
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:27,072
In the world Visa V the global estate starting a religion

415
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,096
Maybe

416
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,656
Because this mad scientist evil

417
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,704
Posthumanist evil

418
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,544
Has figured out all the angles

419
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:41,152
The only way you beat it is recognized

420
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:44,736
Full spectrum salt and then do the exact opposite

421
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:50,112
But instead the public likes to debate and argue Annex Ilion

422
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,928
At the low-level

423
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,000
And if you do that we have zero chance

424
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,536
And we just woke up

425
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,352
God said to do

426
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,960
This evil just evaporate

427
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,920
Everybody can feel it

428
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,504
Everybody can see it

429
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,696
That's just what it comes down to

430
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,256
So here's what I'm going to do

431
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,400
Make sure we stay on here

432
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:38,752
Make sure that that's dealt with at your own house is in order

433
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,336
And then I'm going to come back and I'm going to head on the stairs

434
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,408
It's best I can I'm just going to cover it then that's going to yet

435
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,200
What

436
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,672
Maybe next two segments you can't put stuff on screen because

437
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,048
People in New York

438
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,096
Saying we want to wear masks forever

439
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,400
We don't want to take them off we like them there are blank

440
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,848
Painful to look at

441
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,176
Right on the edge of just

442
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:19,968
Plus

443
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:23,040
It becomes a distraction

444
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,600
From what I'm already covering what I'm doing

445
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,560
And the proof of your other shows or something

446
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:37,376
I'm going to go back to reading articles and sub remote because

447
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,168
Because I can't look

448
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,984
Look at the mascot

449
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,848
We already did what's going on

450
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:50,432
Okay so if I understand correctly here is how the show is going so far

451
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,992
Also that clip is

452
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:56,576
Very indicative of how the show is going so so

453
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,112
Please

454
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,392
If I had to say correctly

455
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,416
We're all dead

456
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,464
Call already

457
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,000
We need to prepare to die

458
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:11,680
Bye crew put up a picture of Joe Biden and people supporting him so I am going to throw a

459
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:14,240
I'm going to go off the air

460
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,288
Viet

461
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:22,688
I don't even think it's going to go off the air it's that I'm going to I'm going to threaten to just do radio now cuz I'm too distracted

462
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,712
Directed by images

463
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,736
That's banana

464
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,040
That is unprofessional

465
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,832
To a level of like

466
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:33,184
I think technology the wrong problem

467
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,072
I was too distracted by pictures to do my job

468
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:43,424
And therefore get rid of the pictures

469
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,848
If somebody Jangles plastic keys in the room I can no longer function as a human being

470
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:54,176
Just get rid of all plastic he's everywhere Dan it makes perfect

471
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:59,808
That does make sense unless jangling plastic keys are a major

472
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:04,672
Where is that that is a problem I do work at a jangling keys FAQ

473
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:09,792
There are a lot of decisions that you might have to learn

474
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,584
How to

475
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,120
Focus your attention

476
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
Better

477
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,680
You could change you

478
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,984
That was possible I'm just passing that up

479
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,008
Yeah yeah

480
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,080
Think that that also

481
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,104
The idea of like

482
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,920
If you just saw all the Angles and all of this

483
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:27,968
We would just be able to defeat the New World Order

484
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,528
That's just your code for like

485
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,552
Is everybody good

486
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,856
Thought the exact same way I did

487
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,880
Oh yeah

488
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,184
If we all just did what God told us to do

489
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,768
Who's telling me what God is telling me to do I only asked you that question

490
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,584
That's a really important question

491
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,352
That sounds right

492
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,656
So the vaccine side effects

493
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,680
There's something that Alex's

494
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,472
Greatly exaggerating

495
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,496
And not dealing with

496
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,264
Seriously

497
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,056
And

498
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,336
You need any more evidence

499
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,104
That

500
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,152
You're the worst

501
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,456
Ranalli Federal documents

502
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,504
Now they know

503
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,552
By Design

504
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,088
Shots now they're going to mess up

505
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,880
Rivers in brain

506
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,952
Alarm for life which is not to be very long

507
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,072
I knew this while they're doing it

508
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,960
I just thought killing you

509
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,592
It's a sacrifice of the uterus and that pleases our God

510
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:30,688
And also it's going to lay down and hurt their families and cost

511
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,968
English and their families

512
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,504
Cuz you're supposed to bury your

513
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,320
Now you see you see

514
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,600
These vaccines

515
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,928
BBB side effects that some people might experience

516
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,464
Are a sacrament to Satan

517
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,744
Right

518
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,024
Right

519
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,792
Right

520
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,096
I just

521
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:51,424
Can't disagree with any of that

522
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,752
It's just airtight you're not supposed to bury your parents

523
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,312
I mean the other way around

524
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:00,384
I've heard that said ye had supposed to bury the trash

525
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,456
And then if that makes sense

526
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:08,832
I assume that all the preceding arguments have to make sense as well

527
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,648
The problem for Alex

528
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,440
Because his whole thing is about like

529
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:20,352
Dealing with people who aren't in a trance

530
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:25,216
But as he was arguing earlier maybe just let people stay in the Tramadol blindfold

531
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:25,984
Icing

532
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,544
Alex's essentially admitting failure

533
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,312
Because

534
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:34,944
His self-appointed role is that guy who yells and wakes people up out of there

535
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:38,528
Exactly so if he's primary complaint is a people are too much

536
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:43,136
That means that you are ineffective at the job you have given yourself

537
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:44,928
So

538
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,256
I don't know but I don't know if I'll be proud of this Nextbook if I were out okay

539
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,328
See the public mesmerised

540
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,656
Into a trance watching their Sports

541
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,192
Video games

542
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,776
And I can't join the global is because that

543
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,848
That's evil and I don't want

544
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,896
And then most Republican

545
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:07,200
He says predatory Layton

546
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,344
I guess we're just here to tell the truth

547
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,160
But people make a decision for themselves

548
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,952
Don't work out God's plan

549
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:29,216
I don't know what it is I'm supposed to do

550
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,520
Everything I'm doing

551
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:34,848
Your job

552
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:38,688
Or something we're supposed to do right now the way.

553
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,344
Guilt

554
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,160
You should know that. Feel a lot of guilt

555
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:03,008
I have stacks of government documents

556
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,568
Richter scale

557
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,456
Just some person nearby just needs to be like

558
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,248
Alex just

559
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,784
Do your job

560
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,064
Just shut up

561
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,696
Do your job talk about how well you could do your job

562
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:28,096
Don't talk about how is everybody else's fault you can't do your job little annoying

563
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,496
I would argue that it actually is

564
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,776
Calculator

565
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,568
Good thing that Alex is doing

566
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,872
And not necessarily because he decided

567
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,408
To get on there and act like a weirdo

568
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,200
It's Vicky didn't prepare

569
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:47,808
It was not to get ready to do his show

570
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,880
At all if we have to fill time rambling about nothing

571
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:58,560
You can't just come out and say sorry I have to burn an hour cuz I've only got two

572
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:01,120
I have too much news

573
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:01,888
To get over

574
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,424
I have to talk about all of this

575
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,752
I'm going to kill a third of the show saying

576
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,568
Complete horseshit nothing

577
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,592
Got to do that

578
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,896
I got to do that to really get into the news

579
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,688
I don't know what else he has to do

580
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,480
Predict things

581
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,296
Will be sitting here in a year or two

582
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,064
Weather

583
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,368
110k to raise money

584
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,672
Cuz you know all the neurological problems

585
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,464
Don't have movie stars up there

586
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,488
Together

587
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,680
Poster signing on to volunteer to be euthanized

588
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:38,496
Is another too much of a weight on society

589
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,592
Extra money and it's

590
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,712
That's the plan

591
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,504
This playing

592
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,136
We got a lot of plans. Lot of lives up in the air all the time

593
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:59,232
I don't know I don't know if I can handle this many plans I don't seem like complimentary plan

594
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,536
Yeah so then

595
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,096
Two years celebrities will be doing

596
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,912
5K charity thing

597
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:09,472
I would assume that's true not necessarily

598
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,240
For people who

599
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,056
Like we're hurt by a vaccine side effects

600
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,336
From covid-19

601
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,872
You know there are certainly

602
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:18,432
Experiences of people have had about long

603
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:22,272
Covid you know there is our like there are things that we will learn

604
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:25,088
Moving forward they were not aware of now or we're

605
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,880
Starting to become aware of now

606
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:27,904
I could see

607
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,696
Celebrities doing fundraising

608
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,232
A some sort of a charity

609
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,024
In that line

610
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,816
10 years from now

611
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:37,120
I would believe there will be so many people

612
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,656
Who have been hurt by the

613
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,936
Covid vaccine

614
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,472
Right there will be

615
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:46,336
Euthanasia drives going on where you get to party

616
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,104
Haha

617
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:53,248
Have you

618
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,296
So that's a little bit like Looper

619
00:32:55,808 --> 00:33:01,952
Is that kind of what we're dealing with here we're dealing with you sign a contract for about 10 years and then you get killed like I did

620
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:08,352
Like suicide bombers but without the bomb

621
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,704
Predictions that Alex is going to forget

622
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,568
Who's going to run the 5K 10 years from now when are we've got all these euthanasia Drive

623
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,872
I've going all the runners will be dead

624
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,944
Who made the first to go

625
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,784
So when you were worried about like who's going to be

626
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,088
Interpreting the words of God

627
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,880
And I told you was a lie

628
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,672
Yeah I tend to be worried about that too

629
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,232
I believe that Alex primarily because

630
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,000
He seems to think

631
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,280
The churches are all full of

632
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,560
Betrayers

633
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,584
So this is

634
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,608
The Day stuff

635
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,032
I just want to have a good time

636
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,568
Lot like churches on

637
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,592
Stop

638
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:57,504
Satanic

639
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,064
The real betrayers weather to make sure

640
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,088
There would be at church.

641
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,440
So I'm sorry folks

642
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,208
I'm real sorry

643
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,328
We're being judged

644
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,352
But this is going to be

645
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,888
My church

646
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,520
Whatever silver

647
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:22,336
F****** parties at my church

648
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,640
All the time

649
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,736
GameStop party we did have it our church weren't fun

650
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:33,344
No we didn't even have communion wine we run out from so many f****** party

651
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,440
Sweetheart youth group we had like every ever

652
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,232
Is every Sunday

653
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:42,304
Do you have evening Sunday evening

654
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,584
Just youth group

655
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,864
Services or whatever

656
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,680
Afterwards it get to Papa John's Pizza

657
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
Right

658
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:51,520
Yeah but you had to pay first one

659
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,056
That's not fun

660
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,336
Let's have a party

661
00:34:55,104 --> 00:35:01,248
In the church yeah man you realize Jesus would have run in there and started throwing Pizza Oliver

662
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,272
Around the place

663
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,904
Flipping a pepperoncini box

664
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,512
It was not fun

665
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,304
Jesus and I don't like Allah

666
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,840
Episode

667
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,120
Is just

668
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:17,888
Amass

669
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,192
Like the whole first hour is

670
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:20,960
Is this

671
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,264
These outrageous like

672
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,408
It's even worse once I would start trying to explain why he's feeling the way he is

673
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,712
Just such b*******

674
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,832
But it's crystallized

675
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,536
And then

676
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,752
Because the forces they told me not to

677
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,336
Michael Allosaurus

678
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:02,432
Information can't get out

679
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,712
If you got any other

680
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,296
Before they start to work they're doing but

681
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,368
The major Counter-Strike to all this in the works right now

682
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,416
My job

683
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,720
It's been confirmed the documents have been seen

684
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,256
But this is a killed man

685
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,536
Accuplacer

686
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,096
Okay

687
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,120
Alright

688
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,656
So yeah I went to the source

689
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,960
Buddy can't give up

690
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:25,984
Speaking

691
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,008
Because the source

692
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,824
It'll blow their cover too high

693
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,128
Still working under Undercover

694
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,152
I guess

695
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:38,784
Alex talking to Steve again agent situation is this somebody in the government whose

696
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,832
Viewing the kill plan documents

697
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,952
Anybody who actually has access to anything would never talk to a dick like this

698
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:52,608
You thought I already talked about how we're all going to die for an hour to get to go fishing

699
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,144
I really call a Alex

700
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,192
I've got to get your brain in on this

701
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:03,104
See this is why I just can't be allowed to be part of the government because I swear to God I would crank call

702
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:09,504
Call Alex at least once a week and be like I've got some documents for you I'd send him pictures of bulshit it would

703
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,576
Never not be hilarious to be for them to show up the neck

704
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:17,952
Text Dave yeah just never not be fun I'm not certain that you have to work in the government

705
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,720
To do that

706
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:22,816
Get yourself a protonmail address

707
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,912
You could probably a plant some story

708
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,216
Lieutenant colonel

709
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,496
Bolesse hit

710
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:35,872
Protonmail.com

711
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,944
My grandpa service

712
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:45,856
Under you and which one did your grandpa serve in the North or the South which one was it

713
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,952
Okay okay okay I got you

714
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,232
I guess Alex

715
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,024
Was sent into a tailspin

716
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,328
Before the show

717
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:58,144
Because of some secret information that he got from the source

718
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,168
Orator

719
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:02,752
Twitter threads that almost made him pass out

720
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,032
Norwich

721
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,104
It is but maybe it secret source is this Twitter thread

722
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,128
I don't know

723
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:14,528
I mean I understand being thrown off by what would be relatively Petty things like one thing that threw me off during that

724
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,064
Clip with literally going like

725
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,368
Why don't I remember the theme song

726
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,136
Talespin

727
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:24,512
And then I realized it because every time I think about the theme song to tailspin I go

728
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,792
Did it tailspin

729
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:32,192
I think I did the exact

730
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:34,240
Same thing that you did at night

731
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:38,080
I think that it might not have had lyrics I remember having

732
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:41,664
Loud drum Sagittarius theme song didn't have clear

733
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,944
I think it was just

734
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,552
Interest I'm not sure but I did do the DuckTales.

735
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,624
So we got to kill plan on her hands not entirely sure

736
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,648
Exactly how this is going

737
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,416
Going to play out

738
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,208
Who do you think is

739
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:58,304
Person-organization

740
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,352
What's the organization

741
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:06,752
So if you're asking me it can't be the UN that seems too obvious I'm asking you because we've been listening to this show

742
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,800
For all the times

743
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,568
The covid has a

744
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,336
Existed

745
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,104
And

746
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,640
You should

747
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,408
No

748
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,688
By now

749
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,224
Who's running all day

750
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,528
Oh if there's a kill plan sure

751
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,552
Who's running

752
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,320
The devil look

753
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,600
No.

754
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,368
China

755
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,136
No

756
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,416

No no

759
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,792
Bfr

760
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,144
Brazil

761
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,752
Official government plan

762
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,520
Haha

763
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,544
CIA

764
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,360
Major foundations

765
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,128
Oh

766
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,576
CIA run by the Carnegie endowment

767
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:55,648
Determination plant I mean

768
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:58,464
Final Solution World dead

769
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,744
Wow

770
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,792
You guys are really evil

771
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,840
I know they were evil but

772
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,656
It's bad enough Wonder Wipeout 3

773
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,776
They don't have jobs futures

774
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,568
Any of that I'm not sign on to kill him

775
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,664
Whoa that got weird at the end there

776
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:20,480
That is such a bad writing

777
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:26,368
That's just bad writing to all of a sudden come up with a brand new villain at the very end to swoop in and got

778
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,952
The end of Scooby-Doo episode they took the mask off and they're like

779
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:36,352
Terry from three towns down the street what are you doing here to go just do this time certain that Alex has never been

780
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,632
Big on

781
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,424
The Carnegie endowment

782
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,496
That was not some organization that's come up as

783
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:48,128
One of our even in the mix players

784
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:54,528
Johns Hopkins is constantly a villain

785
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:58,368
Icfr obviously the Rockefeller

786
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,392
Foundation

787
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,208
Yeah I don't know I

788
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,232
I mean The Rock

789
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,512
Child's are always in the myth

790
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:08,608
The Rothschilds in the Carnegie endowment

791
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,680
Boo

792
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,472
You do what you have to do to destroy the world

793
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,520
Actress practice practice

794
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:21,920
Also f*** Alex were saying that stuff about people in the developing World they have no future

795
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,224
I'm so Alex has the source

796
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,016
Instead of told him about the kill plan

797
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,296
He doesn't just

798
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,576
Believe these source

799
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,600
Until you

800
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,880
He does just

801
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,160
Believe the compactor

802
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,256
I see I just got stuff like that going on

803
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,352
I don't just believe people that have seen the documents

804
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:43,680
I can see the document

805
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,728
Everything I was told

806
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,032
Individual to stop this playing

807
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:53,151
Event 201

808
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,943
The planets

809
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,735
The plan is all there

810
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,319
But but specifically they reached the point now

811
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:01,855
Recruiting

812
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:04,927
Level deep in the government corporations

813
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,975
Operational now

814
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:12,095
So they're even telling people the plan to get them onboard hey like you know

815
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,631
You and your family are going to live

816
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:17,727
500 million that live

817
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,031
Georgia Guidestones

818
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:22,079
You better get on board right now

819
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,615
Space your fam

820
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,663
During the collapse

821
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,711
Deeper

822
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,759
This is what these individuals

823
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,295
It's exactly what they

824
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,319
Call Vista

825
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,879
They believe all humans must be gotten rid of and

826
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:38,719
Above that there's not much knowledge but everybody including top pentagon

827
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,743
Four Star General

828
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,375
Small group

829
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:51,007
Everybody's dead

830
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,359
I mean

831
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,151
It's true

832
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:03,039
Yes there's nothing really we can do right I mean if you make a deal with aliens

833
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,855
That's out of my that's above my pay grade

834
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:08,415
Four star generals

835
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:13,023
Then we got to get new generals

836
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,839
Yeah that would be good

837
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,119
Via

838
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,143
Deal with it

839
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:21,983
Atlas only to be 500 million last we made a deal with aliens it's a real bummer

840
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:25,823
What is the aliens other deal was like

841
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,847
We kill everybody

842
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,871
That's good deal

843
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,687
Compared to

844
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:35,807
Yeah compared to the human extinction we live in a scenario where there is

845
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:39,135
Kill everyone or kill all but 100 people

846
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:43,743
Obviously KB 100 people is a preferable option to make everybody dying

847
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,559
Yeah I mean it's all made up

848
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:49,375
Opso

849
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:53,471
Trolley problem just feeling bad

850
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:56,031
Ferris 7.7 billion people

851
00:43:56,287 --> 00:44:00,383
In front of a train we've got 100 we can save I think it makes perfect

852
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,431
So you got this get right with God

853
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,711
Cuz everybody's going to die

854
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:06,271
He's giving very little hope

855
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,295
At all

856
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:10,111
In this first hour sure get right with God

857
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,647
Do the aliens know God

858
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:18,047
It's debatable whether they're actually aliens they might be demons

859
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:21,375
You're right so you got to get right with God and Alex introduces a guess

860
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,399
Rusty's going to have

861
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:27,263
My town for this cuz he honestly sounds a little bit pissed that you going to be interviewed

862
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,055
And the Dominos are falling

863
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:32,639
EDD program has already started

864
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,919
The countdown is here

865
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:38,015
I don't know what to do I just get right with God that's all I can say

866
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,855
Instead we'll talk to my pillow guy

867
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,975
Kevin Hart

868
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,791
Wow

869
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:56,703
Get right with God instead of my pillow guy here the assignment

870
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:02,847
Talk to the f****** my pillow really know I heard it I heard the f****** that was not spoken to

871
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:08,223
So this is the episode of Mike Lindell from my pillow comes on for his first appearance on Infowars

872
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,527
That's like that it's his first appearance

873
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,575
Save-A-Lot

874
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,879
To go from

875
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,159
Limerick

876
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:20,255
Soap man to s*** talking the my pillow guy

877
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:23,327
I'm just saying maybe you're getting above your britches

878
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,607
Is there buddy

879
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:27,167
Thinking about like what the Dynamics are here

880
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:27,935
B b b

881
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,703
Like

882
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,495
Not super happy about this

883
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,031
I think why Mike wooden

884
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,055
Be super happy about the

885
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:33,823
Is either

886
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,847
Is is because

887
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,639
Neither of this is neither of their fur

888
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,407
First choice

889
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:41,247
Alex probably don't want to talk to him cuz he's not

890
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,295
He sounds

891
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,367
The potential to drag Alex into litigation

892
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:49,439
With 1000 slanderous

893
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:54,303
He thrown around like water

894
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:57,375
You know you could you could end up getting

895
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:58,911
Dragged into court

896
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,447
For having

897
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,983
Too Close of association with

898
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,799
Particularly in this sort of asset

899
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,615
Interviewing them and allowing them to broadcast

900
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,151
Slanderous claims

901
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,687
About

902
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,711
Various things

903
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:16,831
It does seem like Mike Liddell comes along with the same

904
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:19,391
Producer is like a prank show

905
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:23,743
We're after you talk to Mike Lindell some lawyer just runs up to you real quick and he's like

906
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:30,143
Okay I just need to give you a quick interview you're going to need to sign this statement

907
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,935
And I also think

908
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:35,263
Mike can't be super happy about this either because

909
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,543
Cuban

910
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,335
In the Trump orbit in one of these

911
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,359
These people for

912
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,639
A while now

913
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:45,247
If you wanted to be on Infowars he would have been on there long ago long ago

914
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:50,879
He would have been on there when Rodger was on it when the good days were going yet and the reason that he didn't

915
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:53,439
Is because obviously no one wants to be on Infowars

916
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,487
The Last Resort

917
00:46:56,511 --> 00:47:00,863
Griffin for the my pillow Guy this is slumming it

918
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,399
Mike Lindell is doing this

919
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:05,727
Because he's not allowed on those other channels anymore

920
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:08,543
Because he's being sued by smartmatic and Dominion

921
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:10,591
And those claims are all he wants

922
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,359
To talk about

923
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:14,175
And this those networks just won't let him

924
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,967
Spread that s***

925
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:17,503
So yummy

926
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:20,063
Infowars

927
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:23,391
The TV networks are better lawyers than Mike lindell's

928
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,159
Lawyers

929
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:26,207
Because they're the only people who were like

930
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:26,975
No wheat

931
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:30,047
Can't have you talking about your case on air

932
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,839
We're going to learn the Mike actually just lost

933
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,607
His lawyer

934
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:35,935
A little bit later this interview

935
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:38,751
So Alex before he gets into the actual interview with Michael

936
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,519
Glendale

937
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:42,335
He's going to accept talk a little bit about how the last hour with

938
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,383
And it was

939
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:50,783
Pretty wild up last hour got to submit heavy issues I'm just telling you where the globalist want to take us give they succeed

940
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:51,807
They're going to fail

941
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:58,719
Please remember where listener-supported I think you all your amazing

942
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:05,887
The picture support we're still on air and still more effective

943
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:12,287
Mega immune support supplement

944
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:18,943
If you add Mega Euro you've already admitted you're done you know the moment you like this is our Mega health

945
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:19,711
Supplement

946
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:21,247
You're making bulshit up

947
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,527
Very much so

948
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:28,415
Interesting to me they were all dead everybody's dead

949
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,951
F*** it we're going to die

950
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,975
It doesn't matter

951
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:31,743
We're all dead

952
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:35,071
He's sort of tries to walk it back there was like

953
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:38,655
I'm just talkin about what the globalist want to do if they win their going to lose

954
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:41,215
Like as if to undo

955
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,263
Already did in the last hour

956
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,311
That could have been

957
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,591
Anything else then

958
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:47,871
Anything else

959
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,151
It was meaningless

960
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,199
Completely

961
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,735
I'm just a guy

962
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,015
Trying to get

963
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,295
People scared

964
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,831
M and hopeless

965
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,367
I mean

966
00:48:59,135 --> 00:48:59,647
Okay

967
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,671
So

968
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:03,999
What he did was spend an hour telling us that we're all going to die

969
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,303
And then his way of

970
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:11,679
Apology is like only if they win and they're going to lose

971
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,959
Now that

972
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,775
First hour be valuable if you were giving me steps

973
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,055
On how to make them blue

974
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:21,663
Because you you're giving me

975
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,623
I need to buy those Mega supplements

976
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,951
The destiny that we were on

977
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:34,719
Tired

978
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,743
Have a long walk

979
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:40,863
He works a lot

980
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,143
Migrate to

981
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:46,239
Sincere

982
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:49,567
You're a busy guy working twenty hours a day wow

983
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:56,223
I've been going all around this country trying to go

984
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,295
The selection full down and we will get a

985
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:03,903
Working 20-hour days trying to overturn the elect what are you doing

986
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,975
That's a really good question

987
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:11,839
I don't know what good why what am I to work there is to be done on this front

988
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,375
I guess writing letters

989
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,399
Could be

990
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:20,543
Traveling to another place and then writing letters because there's no lifetime limit on talkingshit

991
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:21,823
That's true

992
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,383
Brother is doing

993
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,919
It doesn't qualify as work

994
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,711
If no one's around to hear you talk

995
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:34,111
Is that our new like if a tree falls in the forest Mike Lindell is telling you about the stolen election and no one's around

996
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,903
If you're Your Own Boss

997
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:38,719
You can count that is on the clock hours

998
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:43,071
Got this argument about overturning elect

999
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:43,839
Action right

1000
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,911
Some arguments

1001
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:48,191
Maybe

1002
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,215
They're three of a kind

1003
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,519
Maybe there a full house haha

1004
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,799
Not Mike's argument

1005
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:54,847
Royal flush

1006
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:57,151
Pretty amazing because it's like

1007
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:00,223
You're sitting here with a royal flush in a poker game

1008
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,247
And we're just straightened

1009
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,015
Play it

1010
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:02,783
We're going to

1011
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,319
They don't forget to bring it to the Supreme

1012
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,855
Stream Court in July

1013
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:12,255
Every every person is country

1014
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:14,303
Getting it out there so the Supreme

1015
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,583
Courthouse pressure

1016
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,351
To accept

1017
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,375
Not a f***

1018
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:19,679
Can chance Supreme Court

1019
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,727
Has pressure to accept

1020
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:22,495
This case

1021
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,519
Not a f******

1022
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,799
King chant

1023
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:30,175
This seems to be the theme of what he's trying to get to his like

1024
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:35,295
We need to get everybody on board with this so the Supreme Court can't reject it

1025
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:36,831
I think he

1026
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,623
Probably isn't stupid enough

1027
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,391
To think of that

1028
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,415
Really how things

1029
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,183
Woodwork

1030
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:47,583
I think he knows that by the time people realize that the Supreme Courts are not going to take this case up we still will have

1031
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:55,519
Pretends to be the case it it does seem like you are always moving the date where we're going to get that royal flush

1032
00:51:56,031 --> 00:52:02,175
I know you're never you're never pushing it back you're never like

1033
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:04,223
You're always liked and now neck

1034
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:05,503
Month will get there

1035
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,527
And you know what

1036
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,671
Real fat

1037
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:16,511
Things are going great I've been be happier the way things are going in Ark

1038
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:17,279
Country right now

1039
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,583
Really

1040
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:26,495
Quarterbacking the resistance and

1041
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:30,847
I believe in you and I know you've been behind-the-scenes about all the folks you been working when I leave it at that

1042
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:34,431
President Trump a real president

1043
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:37,759
And now in his second term what's with the agent

1044
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:42,879
This weekend as you know

1045
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:47,487
House on the White House

1046
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,279
Sooner than you think

1047
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,119
He is really excited in

1048
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:55,679
He believes there's a strategy

1049
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:57,471
Tell us about that

1050
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:58,751
Boy

1051
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,311
Trump going to be president again in August

1052
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:03,871
Is a lot sooner than I was expecting

1053
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,199
That was sooner than I planned for

1054
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:07,967
Specifically

1055
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:08,735
This is such a

1056
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,271
God damn roller coaster

1057
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:14,623
It's like the first hour is we're all going to die and then Mike Lindell comes in as I

1058
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:17,951
No Trump will be president again within a few months

1059
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,719
Yeah

1060
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,487
Yeah

1061
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:22,815
Yeah the globalists plan seems very

1062
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,095
Easy to sightsee

1063
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:29,983
How how are you supposed to feel if you're on the secret to this show it's not

1064
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,543
Your dad in a year

1065
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:33,567
President-trump

1066
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:39,199
This is just how you go through this broadcasting Constance

1067
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:45,855
Stream of look I'm bipolar and this is f****** with Maya if if I took any of this

1068
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,903
Let all

1069
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,975
Based in reality I would have a very difficult time

1070
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:53,791
Emotionally surfing these waves

1071
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:57,631
Yeah I know one of the big things that I try and do to cope is is like

1072
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:03,263
Lower the amount of intense emotional stimuli that I receive I believe if I listen to one of these broadcast

1073
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:09,663
I would be running through the street that's green that's why the delegation of Labor is the way it is

1074
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:10,687
Only way this can work

1075
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,991
So what's the Supreme Court

1076
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,527
In July

1077
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,295
Get a hold of this

1078
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,087
They're going to rule

1079
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:20,159
920

1080
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:22,975
You understand me

1081
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,767
Unanimous

1082
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:27,583
Really think the best you're going for it 3:55 there

1083
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:32,191
Roberts is going to side with you guys I am zero

1084
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,983
When that when is supreme

1085
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,287
It's not subject

1086
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:38,847
So it's going to be 90

1087
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,151
Navigate to 1722

1088
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:43,711
It has to be 90 cuz this is

1089
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,503
Subjective evidence

1090
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,783
So they're going to

1091
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:47,807
Oldest Stone

1092
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:50,623
And now and now but everybody needs to know there's a cup

1093
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,159
Juanita's

1094
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,439
There were many.

1095
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:55,231
Down tickets to that were flipped

1096
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,351
Senators in Georgia

1097
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,911
Jason Lewis from Minnesota

1098
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,959
Many Congressmen mini gummy

1099
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:06,239
This wasn't just at the fair

1100
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,263
Presidential level

1101
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:11,359
And in our country I want everybody to know this

1102
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:14,431
There's no there's no statute of limitations

1103
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,223
Call Mama

1104
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,783
Well let me tell you some

1105
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,207
In-N-Out

1106
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:29,279
Every election in the United States history

1107
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,863
Committed

1108
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:37,215
I've got the other person one in anyway let's say it was just a mistake

1109
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:41,311
Backyard office

1110
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,591
And if there was a crime

1111
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:45,151
Anyone else

1112
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:51,039
Hundreds of times probably thousand times the smaller cases

1113
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,831
Were you find out the other team

1114
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,623
A cheetah

1115
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:55,391
The other

1116
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,415
Team cheated

1117
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:59,743
Hey then forfeit and then it's given to who they actually shoot again

1118
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:03,071
Do you notice how Alex used a sports metaphor instead of 8

1119
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:08,191
Example from the world of jalapenos seem like a sports metaphor has more opportunities

1120
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:13,823
Like if you're in a boxing match and it later comes out that your opponent was on the juice

1121
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,103
Or something like that

1122
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:19,967
You might you know that you might end up having the other person for fifth yes that's true

1123
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:23,551
I'm hard-pressed to come up with examples from

1124
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:26,367
The history of our court

1125
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:32,255
Close races

1126
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:34,047
After a recount

1127
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:36,095
You know you'd a had slipped to winner

1128
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,375
Something like that

1129
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:40,959
I don't know if I can think of any example of what

1130
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:41,727
Their talk

1131
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:42,495
Talking about

1132
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,775
Balance the top of my head

1133
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,847
I would I would say the thing that

1134
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:49,663
Most surprising to me about this whole conversation

1135
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:52,223
Is the idea that Mike Lindell was talk

1136
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:52,991
Talking to somebody

1137
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,015
About this was like

1138
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:56,063
We've got an open and shut case

1139
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,623
It's all done and that person responded with

1140
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:05,279
No it's out of the statute of limitation Glendale says there's no statute of limitations

1141
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:08,095
This person goes on

1142
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,631
Yeah

1143
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:11,679
In that case

1144
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:15,263
I'm going to re-litigate

1145
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:19,871
So like that 68

1146
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:20,895
To the beginning

1147
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:23,199
I don't think TJ one that elect

1148
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:29,599
That's what I'm going to go out there right now I think he stole you undo one of those pasta

1149
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:38,047
Everything at the chaos cuz what if it was a two-term president

1150
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:40,351
The whole country

1151
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:42,399
Custom reset from the beginning

1152
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:46,239
We dig up George Washington and we get them back in there

1153
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:48,287
Yeah

1154
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,103
I honestly think of that might be a better solution

1155
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:52,127
Do this

1156
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,407
Fanciful nonsense

1157
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:56,479
Like this isn't a better solution of Georgia

1158
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:58,015
Exactly

1159
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,039
Metaphorically

1160
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,855
Mike Lindell

1161
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,903
Let me be clear really clear

1162
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:04,927
None of us is going to have

1163
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:08,767
If you were to have incontrovertible evidence

1164
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:12,351
That doesn't like it was stolen by foreign powers or whatever

1165
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:15,423
Are you get to the Supreme Court they voted 9-0

1166
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,191
July

1167
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:20,543
I think the answer is it put drop back in office it's right in Yukon

1168
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,311
Institution

1169
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:23,871
Capri's failed

1170
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:28,223
Complaints figure something better out frankly we should already be starting

1171
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:28,991
The new Khan

1172
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,527
Institution process as we speak

1173
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:31,807
You know but

1174
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,623
Let's just take this country like an Etch A Sketch

1175
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,391
Totally

1176
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,671
Hold on to some of the goods

1177
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:40,255
Stuff for the protections and rights

1178
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,815
Anyway Mike Lindell

1179
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,607
Wingsuit fly

1180
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:48,703
I would even go so far as to rewrite that 13th Amendment to include prisoners

1181
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:51,007
And not you know just be like

1182
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:54,591
Slaves are bad unless they committed a crime one time

1183
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:56,895
Mike lindell's being sued by Dominion

1184
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,175
Smartmatic

1185
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,199
Over

1186
00:58:59,455 --> 00:58:59,967
Raclaims

1187
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:01,503
About there

1188
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:04,319
Computers and their technology being used

1189
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,391
Intentionally to

1190
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,439
Yeah that's a bit that's a big one

1191
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:11,999
Vicky's being super it's in the billion

1192
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:15,839
Yep I think punitive damages with

1193
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:16,863
Suggest that the good idea

1194
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,655
Now there's something you may not have her

1195
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:21,727
Mike Lindell is also suing them

1196
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:25,567
I have not heard that yet

1197
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:28,639
You got to watch his documentary

1198
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:29,407
I can't do that

1199
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,175
I'm sorry

1200
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:34,015
We'll talk about it anyway

1201
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:36,063
Another minor setback and that his lawyer

1202
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,111
Quit

1203
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,135
Apparently

1204
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:42,975
Apparently Georgia this is cancel culture

1205
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:44,767
Thursday

1206
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,791
This is really cute

1207
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,375
And smartmatic

1208
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:52,703
Through them in there too because they're all in cahoots together

1209
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:55,007
Billion dollar

1210
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:57,055
Didn't hear about that probably in the news

1211
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:59,615
Lawyers

1212
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,895
Conspirators

1213
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:04,991
Are lawyers

1214
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,783
Either lawsuits

1215
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:09,855
Writing letters to over 200 people in this country

1216
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:13,183
And at news outlets including Fox and whoever

1217
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,231
Everybody lives in fear

1218
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,255
I'm being sued

1219
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,815
But when I did that last Thursday

1220
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:23,679
Counseling Minnesota I got so many lawyers I don't even know their name

1221
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:24,703
But I got a logo

1222
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:27,775
Minnesota Minneapolis

1223
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,199
They were attack

1224
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,735
On Thursday night

1225
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,527
Controls

1226
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:40,831
Email Anna left

1227
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:42,367
Oshawott

1228
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,415
Turn on Friday

1229
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,439
Expired

1230
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,719
Lawyers

1231
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,583
Mike lindell's keys

1232
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:54,399
Reminder the attack

1233
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:55,935
It's just more can

1234
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:56,959
Cancel culture

1235
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:58,495
Cancel culture man

1236
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,519
Cowboy

1237
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:00,543
Adjust

1238
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:04,895
Just seems like maybe they the law firm was more like

1239
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:09,503
I don't think the billable hours is worth this

1240
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,271
Yes

1241
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:16,671
This is going to really be a drag we thought we could go under the radar

1242
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:17,439
I just

1243
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:21,023
Bill Mike Lindell for money at Mike Lindell book

1244
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:26,655
Bizarrely Rich for someone who has a pillow company

1245
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,191
But

1246
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:29,471
Not that rich

1247
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,519
We can let him go

1248
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:34,079
You got this new documentary

1249
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:37,407
I guess like things to be documentaries event like absolute proof

1250
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:39,455
Absolute collusion sure

1251
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:44,575
And now this new one is called absolute 90

1252
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:49,439
Everybody needs to watch this

1253
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,207
Video

1254
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:52,255
It's absolutely 90

1255
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:53,791
This is the Cyber profile

1256
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,423
It shows China attacking our country

1257
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:02,495
I like to give everyone a fair chance

1258
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,263
Text to be heard

1259
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,799
Sure I went ahead and I watch the

1260
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:07,103
Misspelled

1261
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,127
I was not

1262
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:09,919
Convince

1263
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:14,015
I think your standards of evidence are a little bit higher than the Supreme Court

1264
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:20,671
There's nothing persuasive in the film and it's honestly mostly just Mike talking into his phone

1265
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:23,743
Airpods are in

1266
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:25,023
He's talking to an alleged

1267
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:29,375
Cyber expert whose face and voice are distorted wearing automatic Personnel who knows

1268
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:31,423
What the f*** he is

1269
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:34,495
So we boil down to the mic is claiming that he has what's called

1270
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,519
Packet capture

1271
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:39,871
Azure the raw information from these computers that proves that votes are being chained

1272
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:40,639
Amazon Alexa

1273
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,431
He shows these long

1274
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,455
Scrolls of numbers

1275
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:45,759
Over and over again in the documentary

1276
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:48,831
Is it to insist that even though you can't read this code

1277
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,111
It's so definitive

1278
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:52,671
Trump is going to be president again in no time

1279
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:56,767
Mike does a multiple times that these girls are numbers are actually the package

1280
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,303
It captures that they're working from

1281
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:06,751
The Washington Post among others pointed out that these Scrolls of numbers are not packet captures and they're not even in the right

1282
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:09,055
Format that information would be found in

1283
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:14,943
This sort of data transmitted over the Internet is generally in binary where is this is all hexadecimal code

1284
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:16,991
So it doesn't even make sense

1285
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,271
What are the claims

1286
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:23,391
That are being made for him to jump at the Supreme Court

1287
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:29,791
He's got this kind of proof I don't know the post took a look at some of the code and translated into readable

1288
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:32,095
Letters is a piece of s***

1289
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:37,471
It appears to be the Pennsylvania voter roll which is publicly available information

1290
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:43,615
Okay might be a safe assumption to believe that this growth of numbers is it dumb propagandist

1291
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:45,407
Pixelated cyber expert is someone doing so

1292
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:46,687
Fun role playing

1293
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:47,967
This is just

1294
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:50,015
The bunch of b******* sounds like

1295
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,319
Man

1296
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:58,975
Inverse relationship between confidence in a set of numbers that a pillow person

1297
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:01,023
Cannot read and Troost

1298
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,047
Behind

1299
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:05,887
So Alex I don't know what it was like I think

1300
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:07,935
Mike Lindell was a little delayed

1301
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:10,751
He was like my pillow guy

1302
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,543
It might have been a situation where it's like

1303
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:13,311
He's late

1304
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:16,895
Shore for the interview in till like maybe that was it was frustrating

1305
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:18,943
Cuz I want to sing a number of positive thing

1306
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:22,015
He's being he's being pretty polite and positive and putting up with

1307
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,319
Clearly nonsensical things

1308
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,415
He's doing is he's chasing

1309
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:29,439
The contract at sonaca

1310
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:31,487
It's a little too late

1311
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:35,839
The cash cow for Mike Lindell getting some of his money is a little bit

1312
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:36,607
In the past

1313
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:40,703
Like a lot of those like oan or right side broadcasting

1314
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:43,519
They could get out any money they wanted from him I'm sure

1315
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:46,079
We saw all those those rallies

1316
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,895
There were just like the coverage for these Networks

1317
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:51,199
Entirely sponsored by ELO

1318
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,991
I think that Alex

1319
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,783
Maybe would want some of that

1320
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,319
I mean I would if I were him

1321
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,111
Easy money

1322
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:01,695
Yeah I think

1323
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:02,975
Billions of dollars

1324
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:07,071
When it comes to principles versus gaining money I think Alex is going to go for

1325
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,863
For gaining money every single time

1326
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,655
But that money just won't

1327
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:11,679
Be there for long

1328
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:14,239
Yeah I think it's too late use

1329
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,519
Fishing in a dry well

1330
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:18,079
But he does say some nice things about my

1331
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:22,431
And accidentally a my pillow commercial breaks out

1332
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:24,479
Alistair still on Trump album from

1333
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,367
But

1334
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,767
Do you know Michael and death

1335
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,583
Because it's an example

1336
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:42,143
People want action

1337
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:44,959
They want somebody to stand up and I don't Trump

1338
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:48,799
Lick his wounds get ready totally cut off a few months to

1339
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:50,591
Exercise lose weight from

1340
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:58,783
I'm not criticizing Trump when I hold up Mike Liddell

1341
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:01,599
I'm saying he's being example

1342
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,391
I'm putting it on the line

1343
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:06,975
Why do you bring this up now

1344
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:08,255
How do people

1345
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:09,535
Support

1346
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:11,839
The globalist

With your earplug election but

1349

How do people do that so they can

By the pillows and then Finance what you're doing

1351

Yep

1364
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,431
I want

1365
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:02,783
I need to sue for something for Alex I need to sue for like

1366
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,063
Extreme gaslighting

1367
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,623
For Alex insisting to me that Trump

1368
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:10,207
Lick his wounds by exercise

1369
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:13,279
Are there needs to be punitive damages for that

1370
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,303
Something

1371
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,583
Because you can't do that

1372
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,935
Carpe donktum is going to put out a

1373
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:24,287
Population of Lake

1374
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:28,127
Boxing meat hanging

1375
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:28,895
In a locker

1376
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:30,943
Show me example of him working out

1377
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:35,551
More masculine hero worship

1378
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,855
That's so disgusting

1379
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:41,183
So I think it's his next clip is one of the weirder things that I

1380
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:42,463
Heard happened on the

1381
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,487
Michelle ever

1382
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:49,119
There's things that are bizarre ideas that are bizarre Shore and then their thing

1383
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,655
It just happened that I'm like

1384
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:51,679
How did that happen

1385
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:52,959
That's weird

1386
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:59,359
And this is one of those weird idea I just don't know how this happened

1387
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:14,463
Irwindale stay there

1388
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:15,231
Stay there

1389
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:19,583
I was almost never does that

1390
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:22,399
He runs into the brakes all the time

1391
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,679
Whether it's like

1392
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:30,079
Skip this break that used to do that multiple times on this episode he's just in the middle of a sentence intercoastal

1393
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:31,359
That's so great

1394
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:35,967
Why would he interrupts Mike Lindell in the middle of the big announcement

1395
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:38,015
That's the best time to interrupt

1396
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:44,159
Right now

1397
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:49,023
You break in the flow a little bit I do understand

1398
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:52,095
It is a presentation standpoint you would want it to

1399
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:52,863
Be clean

1400
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:59,263
The full announcement will be back at break

1401
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,031
That makes sense

1402
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:01,567
Alex

1403
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:03,871
Pharrell

1404
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:05,407
No and I would

1405
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:08,479
I would assume that most professionals would know that Abby

1406
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:10,527
Big announcement was about to happen on their show

1407
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:11,551
If you

1408
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:14,623
Also

1409
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:21,023
I mean just from a professional standpoint as it is an interviewee if you're going to make a big announcement you should know

1410
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,815
It's going to be broken up

1411
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:24,607
Damn boy

1412
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:27,167
You ready let's do it

1413
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:30,239
We were going to break that a big announcement

1414
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,263
What is the big announcement

1415
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:34,591
Are the plan

1416
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,871
A big announcement is

1417
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:39,455
All the Cyber evidence I have

1418
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,135
Everybody

1419
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:51,487
Absolutely 90

1420
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:55,583
I got over the United States

1421
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:57,887
Schreiber

1422
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:58,655
White hat hacker

1423
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,543
Passing Bitcoin

1424
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,079
Sometime in July

1425
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:08,639
I'm going to get a dollar I don't care if it's USB

1426
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:10,687
Stadium

1427
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:15,039
Cyber

1428
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:19,135
And I wanted televised

1429
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,159
All of them

1430
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:20,927
Be there

1431
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,279
And I don't care if there's a hundred of these companies there

1432
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:30,143
On GB and everywhere

1433
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:33,471
Oh there it is hundred percent there it is there it is

1434
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:36,799
It's like showing a royal flush in a poker game everyone

1435
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:40,383
An election

1436
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:43,199
I'm not going to hold my breath

1437
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:44,735
On this event happen

1438
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,503
Yeah

1439
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:47,295
How do I get less like

1440
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:51,647
Showing people of royal flush while you're playing a game of poker and more like

1441
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:54,463
Instead of having cards you throw a dead horse on the T

1442
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,255
Lexi

1443
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,583
Well technically he would have something

1444
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:01,887
To show them I guess would be more like

1445
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,679
He's got a two

1446
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:09,055
The death card from a Tarot deck

1447
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:16,991
Nolan Ryan's rookie baseball card and a piece of naan

1448
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:21,087
Royal Flush Baby by the looks like cards

1449
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:26,463
I don't know I I would love

1450
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,231
For this to happen

1451
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:28,767
No I do think it would be

1452
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:29,535
Be chaotic

1453
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:34,399
It would rival the the

1454
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,679
Phil Landscaping

1455
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:36,959
Four Seasons

1456
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:44,895
Yeah that would be pretty delightful I was just thinking like I wonder if even if a ransomware company it if he would even

1457
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:46,175
Notice if his

1458
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:48,735
Computers were locked and he can't get into his busy

1459
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:51,807
This offer I love you paid 10 million Bitcoin he be like

1460
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:52,831
Oh no

1461
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:53,855
Edmund just

1462
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:56,159
Record on his phone but it wouldn't even

1463
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:56,927
Care

1464
01:11:57,183 --> 01:12:03,327
Yeah yeah for a would-be cancel culture

1465
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,119
And this is where I

1466
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,143
And I was kind of

1467
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:08,447
Getting a little bit worried that maybe Mike is a bit of a

1468
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:10,751
Christian zealot

1469
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,287
Everybody needs

1470
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,359
Michael Dell

1471
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:17,151
Everything he's doing

1472
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:19,967
Thinking I think everybody

1473
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:21,503
For your prayers and I believe

1474
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:25,599
I do believe that were in the greatest Revival ever people aren't looking for

1475
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,623
Open Nest

1476
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:30,975
We got through this it won't be once again one day when nation under God

1477
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:32,767
Biggest Revival

1478
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:35,583
Everybody right

1479
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:36,863
And we are out

1480
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:37,887
Prayers are answered

1481
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,823
Can you imagine if this would have been

1482
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:47,871
December

1483
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:49,663
You might have had a

1484
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,415
Temperature

1485
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:06,815
And whether you're democrat or republican it's going to be a laundry and it always your message. We win

1486
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:10,911
So I don't know I don't know if you quite grasp the saying at the end

1487
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,727
If Trump has been put back in

1488
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:16,031
Like right after the election or whatever

1489
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:20,895
Democrats would have been really mad but now Democrats all know the election was

1490
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:24,735
It was a scam

1491
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:27,295
So we will

1492
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:31,391
We will carry the Supreme Court Justices out of Chambers on our shoulders

1493
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:32,159
Chanting

1494
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:38,559
A cheering for three and a half more years of trump three-and-a-half

1495
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:39,583
4 years

1496
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:41,887
I think he gets time served

1497
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:45,983
I disagree I have to take that up with Mike

1498
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:48,799
I'll take it to the Supreme Court

1499
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,847
So Mike Lindell takes off

1500
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:52,639
Another guess

1501
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:55,711
For the last hour

1502
01:13:56,479 --> 01:14:00,063
It's a Halloween out

1503
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,599
Homeboy

1504
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:06,975
Mary prankster alright alright this bastard

1505
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:09,791
Rodger Stone has back

1506
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:10,559
And do you want

1507
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,095
Let's talk about the good old days

1508
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:14,399
Those were the days that he would like

1509
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:16,703
To talk about I assume yeah

1510
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,519
Governing philosophy

1511
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,871
Finances

1512
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,967
This is no longer the case

1513
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:30,271
Now we went to overthrow to micro

1514
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:31,807
America first party

1515
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:33,343
Under Donald Trump

1516
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,511
What abundant

1517
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:42,559
Pardeeville

1518
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:46,655
Harry Truman

1519
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:50,495
Character

1520
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:56,383
They don't connect considered generally

1521
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:58,687
Hey it wasn't like radical Islam.

1522
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:01,503
Defeats Truman is the headline he was holding up

1523
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:03,295
You know by Dewey

1524
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:08,927
Yeah I think

1525
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:10,463
I don't know I lose patience

1526
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,487
It's for people who

1527
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:14,815
Make these two arguments together they like there was a time

1528
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,351
When both parties loves

1529
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:22,239
The country show at now we have all coalesced around a charismatic leader with a America first

1530
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:23,007
Slogan

1531
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:24,287
Any other people

1532
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:27,871
Everybody else I co-opted by the copy

1533
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,199
No middle ground

1534
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:37,599
But although I miss the days when everyone is love

1535
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:40,927
Nixon the main thing

1536
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:45,535
Reaching out to the others Isle that's what we did

1537
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:48,351
Definitely what I was working with Reagan

1538
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:52,959
We reached out across the aisle to destroy those Union

1539
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,495
That was our plan

1540
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:58,335
Describe Rodger as a belief

1541
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,615
And that is the Trump is

1542
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:00,639
Is the greatest president

1543
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,407
Since Lincoln

1544
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:11,647
What do we do then

1545
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:13,695
We're just sitting here watching the country destroyed

1546
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:17,279
Civil War

1547
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:18,303
What do we do then

1548
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:25,471
You can go to Rodger stones to save america.com

1549
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:31,615
That's a little

1550
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:35,967
Get a Bentley or something

1551
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:37,503
Don't have a website that Rick

1552
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:40,831
Requires upon apostrophe that's what I thought

1553
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:43,391
It's too confusing through people you're trying to Target

1554
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,183
Especially for those

1555
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:52,863
Please check out my website ww.w. Rogers

1556
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:55,935
Just got to get back on track..

1557
01:16:56,447 --> 01:17:00,287
God I went to this website

1558
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,079
Just one of these

1559
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:03,103
Awesome

1560
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:07,199
Things that you just the people on the right to this all the time they're so good at this

1561
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,479
That is just a

1562
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:10,271
The donation landing page

1563
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:11,039
And

1564
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:13,343
I have a plan that will save America

1565
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:19,743
Put in your email address and I'll send it to you just to get back on his Hospital

1566
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:22,815
Cheesy app to transition back into being a

1567
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,607
Direct Market to people

1568
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,007
Jennifer Greenwald

1569
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:35,359
Working on that subject that might be that might be a good wife

1570
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:38,431
Priscilla to go Greenwald & Stone

1571
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:44,831
Manafort went down so greenwalls the next song

1572
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:50,463
If you got a you got a consulting firm of Greenwald would know how shity

1573
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:53,791
He's become if I really told him that he and Rodger Stone

1574
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:54,559
Equal now

1575
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:55,839
That be bad

1576
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:58,655
You might have some ideas about Greenwald

1577
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:00,703
Rogers got some ideas

1578
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:01,471
About fauci

1579
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,847
You will be remembered

1580
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:08,127
As Hitler

1581
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:12,223
Adolf Hitler

1582
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:15,295
Joseph Stalin and Chairman Mao is one of the Great

1583
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:16,575
Murderer

1584
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:18,879
And those you say already talkin about

1585
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:22,463
Millions of people have taken this vaccination it had no reaction

1586
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:32,191
Well I have been roundly outsmarted Rodger Stone

1587
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:33,727
I didn't think of

1588
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:34,751
Was that

1589
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:39,615
That's certainly not an argument paper

1590
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,895
Can be made about everything

1591
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:41,919
No no

1592
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:42,687
Know that one

1593
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:52,671
How about how about we just apply that to literally any and all arguments with Rodger Stone from now on

1594
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:56,767
Not yet

1595
01:18:57,023 --> 01:19:00,863
Not yet so now you've been defeated

1596
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:07,263
So what are the big things about Mike lindell's interview was the turnip is going to be

1597
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:08,031
President again

1598
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:08,799
Imminently

1599
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:09,567
You going

1600
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,359
To be put right back in that office

1601
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:12,383
Maybe a little bit later

1602
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:14,431
A couple months Maybe

1603
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:19,039
Maybe I'm a little bit off you never know how long is going to take with argument

1604
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,063
Casino

1605
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:23,135
There's literally no

1606
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,927
Protocol

1607
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:28,255
No I don't think we've ever done that one before

1608
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,279
So I would

1609
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:33,119
Think that there might be conversations it would last quite a while about that

1610
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:38,495
Anyway after Harding

1611
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,263
They were like

1612
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:40,031
Listen

1613
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:43,871
I mean this is too soon we're just going to redo it

1614
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:45,919
So that's Mike's big thing

1615
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:47,455
My Rodger

1616
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:48,735
Amazon right after

1617
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:57,695
He's not a doing okay context for this this next

1618
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:58,975
The eclipse

1619
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:01,535
Rodger is wife parently has

1620
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:03,327
Just recently been diagnosed with cancer

1621
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:06,655
That's awful. I hope the best for her

1622
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:07,679
Recovery

1623
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:08,959
Sucks however

1624
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:10,751
Alex

1625
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:12,543
Take that information

1626
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,080
And prized

1627
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:16,640
Turn Rodgers wife's diagnosis

1628
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:18,432
Into a vaccine talk

1629
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:21,248
Pinpoint wow I were Rodger I would be

1630
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,016
Furious

1631
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:25,344
Respect for Mike Lindell

1632
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:28,672
Who's doing extraordinary job

1633
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:29,696
How do you say

1634
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:31,488
Is money where his mouth is

1635
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:38,144
I would never do that

1636
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:41,728
Even then turning over the election will be very difficult

1637
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,520
I really hope

1638
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:45,312
I hope Mike window is right

1639
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:46,848
I hope the president's instinct

1640
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:47,872
Is correct

1641
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:51,712
At the moment I've got to be honest with you

1642
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:53,248
Cancer treatments

1643
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:54,528
Tsunami

1644
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:59,392
And the millions and millions of

1645
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:01,696
Phds and doctors

1646
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:05,536
Homeopathic Healers

1647
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:09,120
It is heartwarming

1648
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,656
It really is but it's also

1649
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:17,056
Overwhelming

1650
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:20,896
That's what all these scientists are saying

1651
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:23,712
Florida out of Palm Beach Post where you live

1652
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:28,320
You're not you didn't take the vaccine but did anybody

1653
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:29,344
El Cenote

1654
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,136
Take vaccine

1655
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:34,464
Well

1656
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:38,560
My wife

1657
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:39,840
Disgusting

1658
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:42,400
Was absolutely disgusting

1659
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:50,336
No but I can tell you that you're a disgusting monster

1660
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:51,872
Cancer diagnosis in

1661
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:55,200
Into a prop your own b******* and normally I'm

1662
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:58,784
Fine with that wife were talking about

1663
01:21:59,040 --> 01:21:59,808
You a******

1664
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:04,416
Yeah I mean he's brought up on this interview a couple times like I wouldn't pull clips of it

1665
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:05,440
The two discussed

1666
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:07,488
Private life in

1667
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,792
And that's very difficult

1668
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:13,888
Have have a medical condition like that

1669
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:17,728
And he's brought up a couple times but it seems like something that is

1670
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,520
You know kind of scary and

1671
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:20,800
Something that is difficult

1672
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:22,336
What's the deal with four even four

1673
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:23,360
Slimy fuc

1674
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:26,688
I would rather

1675
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:28,992
Make fun of his terrible position

1676
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:31,040
Legitimate

1677
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:33,600
Tragedy and pain that he's going through

1678
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:35,648
So he brought it up a number of time

1679
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:36,416
End

1680
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,952
Alex to now

1681
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:38,720
Do that

1682
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,768
Is so insulting

1683
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,048
It is so

1684
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:42,816
Exploitative

1685
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:47,680
Is Alex's listening to him he has to recognize it like

1686
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:48,448
This isn't

1687
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:53,824
Like Rogers polonium poisoning

1688
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:59,968
Here's the other hand I have for that which is just

1689
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:04,832
Rodger and Alex have both done this to so many people in the past where they be

1690
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:08,160
Exploited their personal s*** for their propaganda that it's like

1691
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:12,000
Hey you live by the sword you die by the sword of course this was going to happen

1692
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:14,048
I guess you know you care

1693
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:15,072
Rodger camp

1694
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:16,096
Feeling salty

1695
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:17,888
Without

1696
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:19,680
Wrestling with his own behavior

1697
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:24,800
I guess you know so I can feel itself it on his behalf because I haven't taken

1698
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:29,408
His wife nor my taking anybody's cancer and uses of broad

1699
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:31,712
It's just low you know like it slowed

1700
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:34,272
It's a real bummer

1701
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:37,344
It's a it's a it's a it's a real real bummer

1702
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,160
I hate both of these people

1703
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:45,024
But Alex is really edging out in terms of who I hate more in this interaction

1704
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:48,352
I can't I can't imagine what it would feel like to do that

1705
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:50,144
The way Alex is doing my to like

1706
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:51,680
Hey this

1707
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:52,960
This article is from

1708
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:57,056
Close to where you live

1709
01:23:57,312 --> 01:24:01,152
Did anybody you know who maybe just got cancer yep

1710
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,992
That day was your wife

1711
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:07,296
Please use your use your wife

1712
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:09,088
This condition is a is a way

1713
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:12,160
To make my narratives work better for me to make money off

1714
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:18,560
You're around cancer people now you go to the treatments all the time so you got to know a bunch of people with cancer tell me which ones to the back

1715
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:19,840
And then let's go

1716
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:21,888
Turn that pain into profit man

1717
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:24,704
Not yours

1718
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,520
Cuz nobody's going to get to your dumb URL you idiot

1719
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:31,360
Going to put that apostrophe ahead and get lost

1720
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:35,456
Sorry one last clip here and I really do think that this

1721
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:37,248
Is so indicative of like

1722
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:39,296
Present-day Alex and why it's

1723
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:42,368
It's just a bad person doing a bad

1724
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,136
Job

1725
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,160
Cuz you know it

1726
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:48,000
The beginnings of our of them just talk about how everyone's dad

1727
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:49,536
It just doesn't matter

1728
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:50,816
And here's what he says

1729
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:52,352
At the end of the show

1730
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:59,264
Sometimes I start the show The Best of moods in a bad mood that's robbed

1731
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:14,880
You'll make it a better world so I appreciate you all going through this

1732
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:16,416
Just like I'm doing it

1733
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,488
So many days

1734
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,792
Powerful stuff we had

1735
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:22,816
I haven't hit yet

1736
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:23,584
Because

1737
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:27,680
Got me pissed

1738
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:29,216
Man the news gotten pissed

1739
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:31,520
Wake me up to cover the news can't

1740
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:35,104
Convey the information that is the information part of the information War

1741
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:36,384
But he can

1742
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,920
Take his feelings

1743
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:41,248
And project them onto the audience and lash out like a little baby

1744
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,272
In a way that

1745
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:44,576
Reduce releases endorphins

1746
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:45,600
Courgettes

1747
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:46,880
Feeling better

1748
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:51,232
The one you was yelling about I had a migraine and then he called the pope this

1749
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:52,768
The devil and he felt better

1750
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:55,584
It's just that but with the audience

1751
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,144
He just needs to get his emotions out yeah

1752
01:25:58,656 --> 01:25:59,168
Bike

1753
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:01,728
This is I think any good

1754
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:04,288
Therapist or psychologist

1755
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:06,848
Would be able to correctly diagnosed

1756
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:09,920
Their relationship Alex has with his listeners as

1757
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:11,200
Incredibly abuse

1758
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:12,736
Parasitic

1759
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:13,504
Feel like

1760
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:19,904
What he just did and what we listen to of him telling me that everybody's going to die and then him feeling better at the

1761
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:22,720
The end of it and me being left alone with his feeling

1762
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:24,512
That is domestic violence

1763
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:26,560
If I feel abused

1764
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:28,864
F****** b*******

1765
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:31,424
It's obviously it's not

1766
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,192
That bad

1767
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:34,240
Because you and I at least know that he's full of

1768
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:35,520
Sure

1769
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:36,288
Affect

1770
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:38,848
That's in any way that we're taking what he says

1771
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:39,616
Seriously

1772
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,408
But like if you did

1773
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:43,200
You would be

1774
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:44,992
Being taken for a ride

1775
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,528
Alex would be

1776
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,576
Trying to make you feel his emotions

1777
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:50,880
And leave you holding the bag

1778
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,928
Toad of the bad emotions

1779
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:54,720
Let's just not cool

1780
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:57,792
I am getting my bad out emotions out of me and

1781
01:26:58,048 --> 01:27:00,864
I'm giving them to you because you deal with that and

1782
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:03,168
That last clip gave me

1783
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:04,960
Little bit of a hint

1784
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:07,008
Maybe he's a little bit

1785
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:11,872
Subconsciously aware that that's what he does a little bit

1786
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:13,664
And it could be that Rob

1787
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,456
Who has told him

1788
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,224
Specific

1789
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:20,064
And maybe that conversation was robbed was him trying to be like Alex

1790
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,344
You did it again

1791
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,112
Yelp

1792
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:23,392
Wow

1793
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:24,928
I want a fuckedupshit

1794
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:25,696
Cheese's

1795
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:26,976
I wasn't this episode

1796
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:29,536
There's something that's kind of like well that's a

1797
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:31,328
10th psychodrama

1798
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:32,352
It's going on

1799
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,376
Obviously

1800
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:34,912
And it's monumental

1801
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:37,472
That Mike lindell's my pillow guy is on

1802
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:38,752
On the show that's not happened

1803
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:40,544
Before is a meeting of the minds

1804
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:42,336
And

1805
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:47,968
Trump could be president again after a week

1806
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:48,736
We will see

1807
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:49,504
What yet

1808
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:50,528
Yet

1809
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:56,160
Looking at this in especially in Jacksonville station with a 2000

1810
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:56,928
3 stuff

1811
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:57,696
Like

1812
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:58,720
8 dozen

1813
01:27:58,976 --> 01:27:59,744
Feel like Alex

1814
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,792
Does taking his moods out in 2000

1815
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:05,376
It does not feel like he's just having a kind of

1816
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:08,704
Lashing out at a microphone

1817
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:11,008
And that's kind of why it's

1818
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:11,776
Better

1819
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:14,592
You can't I mean there's just no way to view

1820
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:18,688
Our time with Alex's anything other than watching a man descend into madness

1821
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:19,456
That's right

1822
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:21,504
Like we're doing a

1823
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:28,160
Apparently lucrative Madness 27-year Heart of Darkness situation

1824
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:35,840
That's what we're doing yeah maybe

1825
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:36,608
To Kurtz

1826
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:37,376
He dead

1827
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:41,472
Alex's

1828
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:42,496
Just a mess

1829
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:46,080
This is a been our adventure

1830
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:51,200
Matt Jordan

1831
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:56,576
Waze website
