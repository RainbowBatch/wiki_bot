1
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:21,248
Damned important

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:34,048
We are the bad guys

4
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Need

5
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,064
Knowledge fight

6
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

7
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,792
Everybody was acknowledged

8
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:12,192
Text Junior I have a quick question for you

9
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:18,592
We are recording with a new setup

10
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,360
It involves

11
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:25,248
Sort of a secondary bright spot that is a little bit of Letting Go on my part

12
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:32,160
And apologies a little bit the last couple episodes going on

13
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,696
Is that I think our equipment suck

14
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,280
Wow I've been very defensive about it

15
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:43,936
Oh no that discovered soundboard on the floor right now that's

16
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:50,336
That's the picture of Festival

17
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,920
I think there's something a little bit unexamined about

18
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,200
My attachment

19
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,760
To it to Soundboard a text

20
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:04,160
8 years or something you know

21
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,744
We just got to a point the last week or so that was just like well

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,840
We have ideas about things we want to do in terms of like being able to

23
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:18,240
Record some video and bring back some streaming

24
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:24,640
Difficulties of the stuff we were experiencing encroached into the actual sound of the episodes

25
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,736
It is the thing where I kind of had to like finally reached the moment of surrender and she like

26
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:35,648
Now I got to let go be like whenever we're still like there's something wrong with the

27
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:42,048
My finger in this hole-in-the-wall Wrightsville be a flood

28
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:48,448
You sort of gently pushing me towards that

29
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:54,848
Gentle approach bullying about like the packaged and you just have a Sentimental attachment

30
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:01,248
Manipulative

31
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:05,344
Are you fool

32
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,744
I hope that the sound is better on this episode and we won't really fully know until after we're done work

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,792
According to its kind of a double-edged sword

34
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:19,168
But hopefully that is the case and I'm excited about the prospect of like what this pretend

35
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:24,288
For the future in like what will be able to do

36
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:30,688
It has worked better well you're not hearing

37
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:42,720
Yeah I know a lot of people have been clamoring for things like bringing back some live streams that

38
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:49,120
I know that you and I have both talked a ton about various ways we could incorporate video and

39
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,912
Excited about the possibilities of like

40
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,728
Figuring out what ways we can take those things and

41
00:03:53,984 --> 00:04:00,128
Expand the product of what we do very excited

42
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,200
Running on like no sleep

43
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:09,600
It took out it's a lot to make this bright by happened I I would assume that your bright spot would more be the scent of a

44
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:13,440
Achievement that you had from putting together this Sandman I didn't want to brag

45
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:19,839
Because it might not work

46
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:27,519
The process of setting up his new sound system I received a few texts

47
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:33,919
Hours apart which means that I missed out on minute-by-minute updates of frustration

48
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,943
And fury

49
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:41,343
Late in the evening last night I texted you something along the lines of like the sheet isn't working out

50
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:46,463
Basically prepare you for going to workout

51
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,767
You did not really respond to that message

52
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,815
For a while and I got the message

53
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:57,215
Loud and clear

54
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:04,383
Activate an important ritual that we have if we are cooking try not to do outside stuff

55
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,527
Well that came across as

56
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:16,927
You made your bed now lie in it I'm sorry I didn't mean to tell you what your bright spot was

57
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,719
My bright spot is commanding

58
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:25,119
No my bright spot Dan is I finally on your your recommendation

59
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,727
I finally got to playing The Last of Us so sure and it is fantastic

60
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,007
Really good

61
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:35,615
It's great to watch it's got a very cinematic feel I enjoy it immensely

62
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:39,199
I have that recommendation is really a media

63
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:45,599
I told you maybe a couple of days ago because I just started playing as well

64
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:51,999
Well I mean I'm a very middle

65
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:55,071
In the middle I've gotten a few hours like the opening

66
00:05:55,327 --> 00:06:01,471
Movie thing with great story

67
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,519
Just a kind of like

68
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09,919
The care about the characters

69
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,223
Interested in

70
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,831
I am note on the streets is not a zombie guy

71
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,903
I have a lot of people who I've known to friends

72
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:26,303
You've been deep into zombie stuff and it's never really intrigue me much

73
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,119
And it's nice

74
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,399
2

75
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:36,799
To try try out a survival horror game and if you like that this is kind of fun I enjoyed

76
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:42,943
F*** around a player Resident Evil always a little bit bored whenever something is universally beloved

77
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,759
And one all these awards are going to try it and it's

78
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:52,159
Great that deserves everything I'm like okay fine yeah what's the point of me then I could just be anybody else

79
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
Out there

80
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:59,327
I'm supposed to come with a good taste

81
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:05,215
Uniqueness is gone or you love the thing everyone loves

82
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:11,615
Really good pizza is great good for everybody who has that we're all on the same team it's nice to be nice to be

83
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:17,247
An accepted member of the community I would love to have played more last of us but I can't

84
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:23,647
Because I have been

85
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:30,047
I was cooking dinner.

86
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,375
Video game

87
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:40,799
It was a it was a lot because

88
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:47,199
It's not that bad

89
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,247
Jordan is the debate coverage

90
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,135
Have Alex Jones Aldi in between

91
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:59,231
Answer that was a whole lot of territory to cover a lot on my plate

92
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,535
And I really am jealous of

93
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:08,191
Time that I used to have to play videogames all be able to get back to playing a little bit

94
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,751
And maybe hit somebody with a baseball bat

95
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:16,639
So we're going to get to this episode on here it's really silly

96
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:23,039
It's very stupid

97
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:27,391
So first casualty from Sweden thank you so much

98
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:33,791
Casualties to get it on Sonia's territory

Very much Mick Riley defense

105
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:03,487
O'Reilly

Thank you so much right now.

109
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,687
How's your 401k

110
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,527
What's the business

111
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,575
Money off that heroin

112
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,415
Freakishly large

113
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,583
Much adequate mousse

114
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:46,239
No moose are adequate above-average to me

115
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:50,079
Above-average

116
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,151
Well he's not almost at the small sample size there's one

117
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,455
Busy

118
00:09:55,711 --> 00:10:01,855
What is friends with a flying squirrel

119
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:05,439
That one is obvious that one everybody does this true of almost

120
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:11,839
If you're out there listening if they can enjoy the show and love moose I'd like to support these are very promo

121
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:23,615
You can do is take that generous spirit and you feeling about mr. Peabody

122
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:30,015
Leaving body now I'm now I've lost it

123
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:35,647
Through the Wasteland covered in fungus and take that to create the vaccine

124
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,975
Truth and Love and generosity

125
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,535
That will carry us all through this by going to

126
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,815
A local charity or belt

127
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:49,215
I feel like I executed that one you gave me no positive reinforcement

128
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,263
Wanted

129
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,359
Ferry golf shut up Edward Everett Horton

130
00:10:55,615 --> 00:11:01,503
The voices

131
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,039
Used to Know

132
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:07,391
Anyway Jordan today what we're going to be going over is too much

133
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,159
Time

134
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:14,559
North normally do which is really swing too hard for no

135
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:20,959
Answer they did ours of coverage before the debate tonight

136
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:24,543
Are we going to do right then did the debate coverage

137
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,895
So we're going to be looking at that and then we're going to be looking at September 30th

138
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:32,223
The day after the debate where Alex comes in and tries to

139
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:38,367
Suspend things I was going to say I assume their immediate reaction when the debate happened was that of the rest of the world which is just like

140
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,159
No

141
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:40,927
It's

142
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:47,327
Oh God I think all God no cated then that there is an element

143
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,143
Element that I think a lot of people who don't look at this stuff

144
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,495
Regularly would be surprised to know he's a piece of their response to it

145
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:59,615
And I think I understand fully and that'll probably be a large part of our conversation

146
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,151
Here is an out-of-context drop

147
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
From Today Show

148
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,223
Military

149
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,503
Turn off that's true

150
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,087
That's what I find the most difficult to argue

151
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:15,487
What about the military he makes a good point that is I mean is it a good point

152
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
I think it's a point

153
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,071
And it's a defensible what that's what I'm saying I don't know if it's a good one

154
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:23,167
I'm saying that I can't argue against

155
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:29,823
Here we start the free debate and I got real bad out because Owen Shroyer toasting the beginning of it

156
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,639
And it starts with

157
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:36,479
What appears to be taunting Joe Biden to debate

158
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:42,111
In the pre-show to the debate that Joe Biden is doing okay

159
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,007
I mean yes

160
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,567
Can JoJo come out and debate

161
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,847
Yes that is

162
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,871
That is

163
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,175
Time sleepy Joe

164
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,039
It's almost time sleepy Joe

165
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,855
Wake up from that nap

166
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
Sleepy Joe

167
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,415
Come out of that bass

168
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,439
Sleepy Joe

169
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:24,095
They've been doing this thing for so long where they're like this debate isn't going to happen

170
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:27,423
Themselves into like it is happening

171
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,239
You can't really talk somebody

172
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,055
When they've agreed to do the thing already

173
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,103
In the pre-show of it is starting

174
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,783
It's such a built-up narrative of like they're they're going to cancel the debate

175
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:49,183
Come on you coward

176
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:55,583
Debate me I agree two weeks ago I got we've already set this as it's been plan people have been advertised backstage having a

177
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,167
Week 2 dababy no I mean

178
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,191
Actually I am already

179
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:06,847
Talking to you and now that the debate is going to happen of course there have to be reasons why Joe Biden

180
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,871
Isn't

181
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,919
The character debate made him out

182
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:15,551
A candidate's kind of at an angle looking in maybe that makes it easier to hide Biden's earpiece

183
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:21,695
Where is the door that they're going to shuffle by Dan off to to give him a quick hit

184
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,743
Of speed

185
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,047
Or adrenochrome or whatever they are

186
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,071
Stored

187
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,143
For him to keep him alive for 90 minutes

188
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,823
Alright so get the earpiece narrative

189
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:44,223
I never understood why they think that's a good line of attack on Joe Biden

190
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,503
Taking drugs to get through this

191
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:52,159
Dude I'm taking drugs to get through this f*** yeah I do hope he's taking drugs everyone watching it home is ham

192
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,487
Oh no drugs

193
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
Phuc yea

194
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:02,655
I was in favor of Sammy Sosa taking performance-enhancing drugs you think I'm not going to be Pro the guy fighting again

195
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
Fascism hell yeah

196
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:09,567
I think I think that there might be something

197
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,127
Into that and then also they're just like

198
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
Who cares

199
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:18,783
Who cares if someone's on speed

200
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,087
What what you think

201
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:27,231
Your perception is decided he must be on speed drugs

202
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
Okay

203
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,327
Hulu no evidence of that

204
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:37,727
Owens trying to do whatever he can because there's no debate yet like it's still the pre-show inside

205
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
He's like

206
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:44,895
Trying to make fun of things like the podium and like crowd

207
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:51,295
Hey you the shirt is f****** sign over here they got

208
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,879
Stand up in front of a brick wall what is this place that kind of thing

210
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:58,975
Testing

211
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,767
Center there

212
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,351
For anybody who's going to be attending isn't

213
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,631
That nice

214
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,959
Oso

215
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,983
Brandy

216
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
Will it be

217
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,919
The flim-flam in the land

218
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
Will it be

219
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,783
The Slam in the land will it be the Sham

220
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,551
In the land

221
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
Orwell

222
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,111
Joe Biden get

223
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:26,879
Cleaved

224
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,647
In the land

225
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,975
This is Infowars

226
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,279
Presidential debate

227
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,559
Coverage mail.

228
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
Wolf

229
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:41,215
Yep really get clear in the land of a walk

230
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,239
Requires

231
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:46,079
A meeting in the office after you're off are just like come here

232
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,127
Let's review your performance here

233
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,687
I don't think so I think he was told to do that

234
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,783
Because he says cleaved in the land sure

235
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,855
It I think it's even in the title of like the

236
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:01,183
Video release

237
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:01,951
Something about

238
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,023
Cleveland Lance because it's so catchy

239
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:10,399
So catchy a lot of people say that you've been cleaved in the land before Cleveland

240
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
I got it

241
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,983
I got it

242
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:17,311
Anyway Joe Biden you be sleepy

243
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,127
I'm sure it's going to be a wild night ladies and gentlemen

244
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,663
90 minutes

245
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
Oh my God

246
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,247
Joe Biden

247
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,831
Gold sleepy Joe is he going to be able to make

248
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,487
He can't make it they've already admitted that he needs an earpiece and needs a

249
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,047
A nap nap break every 30 minutes

250
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,095
But are you can be president

251
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:48,031
This is there is nothing going on is brutal

252
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:52,639
Over cuz he decided to start taking some calls and get the caller who's like

253
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,943
This is this lady's trying to make a joke

254
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,527
Listen to How Great Owens improv chops are

255
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,063
And at the end

256
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,231
Well he doesn't even have a job though Biden even have a job

257
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,095
I was thinking about it

258
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,215
Yeah the old

259
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:17,983
Apprentice

260
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,567
Well

261
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,103
Are you crazy

262
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:24,895
Something crazy

263
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:35,391
Does anybody want to be there

264
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,183
That's not good

265
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:43,583
I like it on fire and then forget where it came from

266
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,351
From the

267
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,375
Reality

268
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,447
Apprentice

269
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:54,335
Did you hear my plan about cleaving to the land leave the land pretty good

270
00:18:55,615 --> 00:19:01,759
Owen as a feeling that this is going to be something that reminds us of another important debate and

271
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,551
History

272
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,599
A sloppy Joe Biden

273
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:10,719
Comes in against a well-put-together shining glowing Trump

274
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:16,863
It's very similar to another debate maybe the first ever televised debate

275
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,215
Now it's not about this is that Owen doesn't know who to put in that debate

276
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,495
I forget

277
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
What

278
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
The first

279
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,871
Televised presidential debate wise Hyundai

280
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,199
I'm trying to remember but it was because one of the candidates

281
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,271
The watershed moment in history

282
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
Unkempt

283
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,087
And in the other candidate was

284
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:37,855
Was

285
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,415
It was Nixon and the who is he again

286
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,439
My God

287
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,487
What did Nixon JFK Mixon and who

288
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:47,583
Your help me out here

289
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:53,983
So it hears a telling Pig here's a telling think this is a telling thing if you remember Nix

290
00:19:54,239 --> 00:20:00,383
Send but not who he was debating in the first televised debate right you're a fascist

291
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:06,783
I have some question if you also initially don't remember either

292
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,831
You probably shouldn't be working at a

293
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:15,231
News about family not going to trust your Thomas Jefferson quotes from here on out it strikes me as like that.

294
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:21,631
Should have coming speaker tackled him

295
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:28,031
Please Alliance alright let's talk about how the Indians is somehow not a racist name I don't know

296
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,335
Call from a funny person

297
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:36,735
And then s*** on their joke

298
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:42,111
Grease Infowars reporter Gregory Shore his on the seeing Believin Volant okay

299
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,231
Greg Reese

300
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,767
From Cleveland Ohio to side

301
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,327
The first presidential debate what are you expecting tonight

302
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,959
I do laid out all

303
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
Possibilities

304
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,287
Please

305
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,567
In Atlanta

306
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:02,847
Really

307
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:03,871
Stabbed

308
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,503
Ask Diddy

309
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,416
Reconnected here he's

310
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:20,000
Obviously right outside the venue and they probably have all kinds of

311
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:25,120
Stingray Triggerfish technology just destroying nnn sucking up

312
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,192
Any and all communication

313
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,752
Look it reconnected with Greg

314
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:34,080
Probably triggerfish

315
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,360
I've been to these things

316
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,128
Before folks

317
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,664
They're just all kind

318
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,456
And stop blocking signals and

319
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
An intercept

320
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,552
A lot of Infowars reporters have trouble

321
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:48,928
Yeah it's probably a scalar attack I'm going to go with if more than one invoice now

322
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:53,536
We only have two examples here Dad so that's not yet a pattern developing

323
00:21:54,048 --> 00:22:00,192
Have we ever had any more examples of Infowars remote people struggling to talk over the

324
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:06,592
I would say everyday okay so now I'm going to start going out on a limb and say that that pattern would suggested

325
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:12,992
Is actually the Infowars it does lead you towards that conclusion

326
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,832
There's more supporting evidence of a triggerfish

327
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:20,160
Do you like that today

328
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:25,280
Probably drone is there trying to intercept our communication

329
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,352
It's better than Alex

330
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:34,752
Gets mad

331
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:39,104
So he doesn't getting Greg on the line and the triggerfish

332
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:45,504
Apparently it stopped working call around

333
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,040
Miracle

334
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:52,672
And this is just two dudes who are like I really hope this gets canceled

335
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,768
I think I'm going to Green I think that your people just confuse him

336
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,816
Plus with the crowd and the light

337
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,840
Lights in the pressure I mean

338
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,656
I don't think the earpiece really doesn't any advantage is I mean

339
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,960
Unless they've been training him on it maybe

340
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,496
And they definitely want to drug him up

341
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,032
That's why they got to take the breaks

342
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:08,800
2

343
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,080
Hey look we still got

344
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,640
2 hours and change you never know by Timaya

345
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,176
You know he made flounder and just can't

346
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
Rafiki

347
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,088
Testing you test positive and it's

348
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,136
National Emergency

349
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,672
Who knows

350
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,208
Who knows who knows

351
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:32,608
Just spitballing who knows

352
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:39,008
You ever get hurt by a but maybe if he does know

353
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:42,080
Okay I got would continue their

354
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:48,480
Is incapable of Joy really don't understand what a debate

355
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,504
It is I feel like

356
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,576
They're hyping it up like they're actually going to fight

357
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,368
Oh yeah Alex Stars 2

358
00:23:54,624 --> 00:24:00,768
Like he talks about how like he used to watch Tyson fights and back when he was a kid

359
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:05,120
I'm with letting all these right-wing douchebags debate online for so long

360
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:11,520
Well that's what I'm saying like they don't understand that what we're supposed to be watching is a very boring

361
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,544
Conversation

362
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,944
About tax policy moving forward

363
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:26,368
Whether certain cap on wealth

364
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:31,232
You're a loser no that's not a debate

365
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,888
It's disappointing no but they were and

366
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:44,288
We've not talked a lot about our thoughts about the debate part of that is because we're going to get to that little bit

367
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
But later but

368
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,336
You want a spoiler

369
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,432
What

370
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:55,296
Whatever happened to being like I have a 2.2 trillion dollar spending plan

371
00:24:55,552 --> 00:25:01,696
Sir you're out of your mind I have a 1.8 trillion dollar spending plan to enjoy those debates

372
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,488
Actually kind of interesting.

373
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,144
Do you not know my policy walk that should be boring as hell like he should be MacNeil Lehrer

374
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,936
Come on

375
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:15,264
Speaking fingerboarding Owen

376
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,288
Doing this

377
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,056
Was it

378
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,872
Disaster it was so hard to get through

379
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,920
Thankfully

380
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:26,784
Our inner so Alex shows up and we start to get back into business okay

381
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,576
We are 2 hours out

382
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:30,880
From

383
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,648
Reality show

384
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
Donald Trump

385
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,464
74

386
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
Joe Biden

387
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
78

388
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,120
Joe Biden

389
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:41,888
Clearly has had

390
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
Bullfrogs

391
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,192
Abated

392
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,496
Welcoming onset of

393
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,032
Serious dementia and Alzheimer

394
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:50,848
Delirium

395
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:52,896
You're going to see

396
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,176
Something never before done

397
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:55,968
No one's ever run

398
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,504
At this level like

399
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,064
National Television

400
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
Confident person

401
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,184
And no one has ever stood up as Donald John Trump

402
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:13,376
Alex is really on that tip articulation of the way Alex Hasbro

403
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,656
Presented Joe Biden

404
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,216
In the months prior to the audience

405
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:21,056
If you're somebody who listen to Alex and take some seriously you have every reason to think like

406
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,640
Biden's going to come up there Derulo

407
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,176
He's going to call like

408
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,224
Trump mommy or something

409
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,272
It's going to be it's going to be a mess

410
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:36,672
That's bad to be Biden's this in the minds of an Infowars I'm confused as to why

411
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,232
They aren't doing preemptive damage control like

412
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:43,072
I would have gone heavy on the drugs thing cuz that's the only way to explain

413
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:49,472
That you obviously know your been full of s*** this entire time otherwise you look like you believe what

414
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:56,128
Bulshit you are selling well and he's going to go on stage in an hour and prove that he's fine there's the earpiece

415
00:26:56,384 --> 00:27:02,528
It's around like him and knowing showing the amphetamines that gets around 3

416
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,320
Do you like well he's usually

417
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,136
Mentally so slow

418
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,952
And Alex has a third thing that comes up later that's just

419
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,976
Remarkable

420
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,584
But I noticed that Alex seems a little slow

421
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,352
He's

422
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,888
Probably drunk

423
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,680
He should do performance-enhancing

424
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:24,288
But you might later this takes a really weird

425
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,848
We'll see okay

426
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:35,040
Alex is one of his complaint to the fighting to Liar right because he said that millions of people died of covid-19

427
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:41,696
Sure when in reality that clip italics played he cuts it off right where buy

428
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,720
Correct himself

429
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,536
Isaac has he had misspoken where's Alex

430
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,096
Pretends that he actually said the millions died

431
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
Just remember that

432
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,168
Damn thing comes out

433
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,728
At last

434
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,520
Suite 200 million Americans

435
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,312
Keepers of the population

436
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,080
Can Plus

437
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,616
Covid-19

438
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,152
It wasn't even 1/2

439
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,176
A 1%

440
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,456
It wasn't 1/10 of

441
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,224
1% yield

442
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:04,992
Lying

443
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,016
Glass rack

444
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,040
Now

445
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:07,808
That was

446
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:11,136
The first thing that I heard through this entire time there was a

447
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:14,208
Interesting to me what is a flask

448
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,352
Where do you think it is

449
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:26,752
Maybe maybe something from Ender's Game or childhood

450
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,520
Painting

451
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:34,432
Play Rags from

452
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,456
With a flat rag

453
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:41,600
You think it's like maybe an Elizabethan or Renaissance Tower

454
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:45,952
It's from Coneheads

455
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:58,496
What a nerd that's the only thing that I respect about him it's sometime

456
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,288
It'll come through where it's like

457
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:06,432
You and I are nerds bad don't don't tell me that you don't even like Star Wars if you're going to drop

458
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:11,040
Flat rag Star Wars you like

459
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,064
Conehead

460
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:18,464
Which no one appreciates now dad calls the daughter when he saying the cheese dress

461
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,048
Best to promiscuously

462
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:28,448
Call Zuri flat rag on payday so accurate is dowsing out supplies rag

463
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:34,848
What are you call it animology

464
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,896
Netflix

465
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:42,016
I appreciate I haven't watched it since way back when I liked it in the 90s

466
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:47,904
I mean I'm not I'm not mad at somebody liking it now I think it's silly for Alex

467
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:54,304
Call B in a flatbread 100% silly for Alex called Biden The Flash rag

468
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,120
Insult that sounds interesting in order comes up with his

469
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,400
LaFollette

470
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,192
Jesus

471
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,496
That's not great

472
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:07,872
That's a good reference for me that would be like I like that that's an obscure reference

473
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:14,272
It's a little esoteric and it has a fun sounding name to it I would use that in a bit if I could pull it off in a bit

474
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:17,088
It doesn't belong here no no that's my point

475
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,488
So Alex is talking about the eventuality or the possibility that Trump could lose the election

476
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,768
And if so

477
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,304
Blood in the streets baby

478
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,096
Caught up

479
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,120
We don't care so much

480
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,240
You take it for granted

481
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,008
Where were

482
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,848
Do you know if you got a hundred bucks

483
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,616
Fight

484
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,384
Your fighter loses

485
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:43,968
OtterBox

486
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,736
Waterbox

487
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,016
Call Gabby was at

488
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,344
Baseball whatever

489
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:50,880
That's true

490
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,160
We lose this

491
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:53,952
Civil War

492
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,000
Show me blogs

493
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,304
Don't think you do not set up

494
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:04,960
So anyhow it's it's explicit if you lose the election blood in the streets Civil War

495
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:08,800
Set up the precondition that they'd impossible to have a fair election

496
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:14,176
They're basically just saying like Civil War is going to start this winter

497
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:19,552
I'm bored with me I don't want a civil war to start but I would like them to stop with this

498
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,576
Teasing

499
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,600
Totally

500
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:25,696
This is nonsensical and frustrated

501
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,744
I would prefer

502
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,888
That they just showed up correctly edging me at a civil war

503
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:37,984
You've already said that there's no possible way he's going to lose

504
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,032
Which means you already know he's going to lose

505
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:46,432
He said if he loses that the election was stolen which cuz of you know he's going to lose in a free election

506
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:49,504
Most likely just started Civil War I'm bored

507
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,784
Well I Lord

508
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:57,184
I think that I don't want anyone to get hurt and I think the possibilities of what that looks like in the real world is

509
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,232
Like you know possibly

510
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:05,376
Lone Wolf type. Appearing actors

511
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,424
I would like this

512
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,728
Start the season 2 end

513
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,008
You know like this art

514
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:17,408
Realize whatever it is this building is intensity towards this Biz fantasized

515
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:20,736
Civil War I would like for the chapter 2 end

516
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:25,344
But I don't want it to come to fruition where there's an attempt or an actual star

517
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,648
I would just like for Alex to move on

518
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,720
To the next part where he's back to selling gold or whatever

519
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,792
Like this is annoying

520
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:34,816
Bored

521
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,120
Tinged with scared

522
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:42,752
I'm absolutely terrified especially since later on the debate Trump said that it's cool to kill us

523
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,568
Alex meixner

524
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:49,152
It is responsive that weird okay

525
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,200
How much money you think

526
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,504
Donald Trump got

527
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,528
From what

528
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,808
Total

529
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:56,576
All day

530
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,880
I mean net

531
00:32:59,392 --> 00:32:59,904
Or gross

532
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,464
Dealers Choice

533
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,256
I'm going to go with net

534
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:07,328
Negative several hundred million dollars

535
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,608
What am I gross

536
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,400
About 15

537
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:16,032
Dollars different figures

538
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,056
Is it about

539
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,104
Search for the truth

540
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,384
Donald Trump

541
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,664
Tama.

542
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:22,944
12 billion

543
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,480
Neri oxman is he

544
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,504
He's got a billion dollars

545
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,552
Billion dollars

546
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,832
4 years

547
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,112
While they shot his ass

548
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,416
Never been happier

549
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,256
I'm taking this fine.

550
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,536
Got the money

551
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,304
The money

552
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,072
Was only

553
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:39,840
About

554
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,120
Scrub system

555
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,656
Do not remember him saying that

556
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,424
Bring it back to

557
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,496
That's real Powerman

558
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:52,640
I would like audio of him saying that since I already have audio of him admitting to killing hundreds of thousands of people

559
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:58,784
Obviously all that is total nonsense but I think at the end there Alex is saying something that I find very interesting

560
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:05,184
He's talked about I drop doesn't care about the money the money is always about just fueling us fight against the corrupt system of the globalist

561
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:09,792
That's comically not true but it's exactly what Alex says about himself

562
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:16,192
When he's trying to sell his dump pills in food bucket to buy a product

563
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:20,032
Stately repeats he doesn't want money even like money

564
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,080
You will divide the globalist

565
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:28,480
Now in 10 minutes he was going to say that without money which he loves very dearly as well be able to he hates them

566
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:34,880
I need to fight the global yeah but he loves money without because of money

567
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,256
So what's going on here is that Alex is desperate to sell but in this case the product

568
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,536
What is Donald Trump

569
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,096
In order to picture supporting this

570
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:49,216
Completely unacceptable clearly aspiring dictator Alex needs to dress him up in the costume

571
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:52,544
Of Alex Jones's own idealized self

572
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,336
Vision of himself

573
00:34:54,592 --> 00:35:00,736
As being like he doesn't care about the money it's just about fighting the globalist huh that's the fictional ideal heroic version

574
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,504
Alex

575
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,808
But he sells to the audience what you need the money

576
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:10,208
He's just transmuting that onto onto Trump

577
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:10,976
Narcissist

578
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:14,816
Like that is so narcissistic that it's him saying like

579
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,840
To his audience

580
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:18,400
You need to vote for him because he's made

581
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,168
Wiley's

582
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:25,568
The person that I tell you about when I want you to feel good about me

583
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,384
Silly

584
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,248
Guy guy who's worth a billion dollars doesn't care about money just wants to play the globalist

585
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,040
Or in the other corner

586
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,320
Guy

587
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,112
Who is so evil

588
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:41,184
So evil they do evil is Satan told him to

589
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,488
Heat press a button and destroy the world

590
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,024
But a joke

591
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,072
Order

592
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,888
Turn it up so fast

593
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,168
It'll make your head spin

594
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,472
He is a

595
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,240
Pop it

596
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,032
Depop at you pop it

597
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,336
Again

598
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,360
Everybody better

599
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,384
Stop laughing

600
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,480
You're not looking at people

601
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,504
Talk

602
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,272
Baby will look like

603
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,856
Every damn one of them

604
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,904
Zombie because they are

605
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,952
There is not one

606
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,488
The god in them

607
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,024
They are the boys

608
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,816
The holy spirit is gone

609
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,352
Completely

610
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,888
And totally turned over

611
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,984
So at this point I was thinking that Alex was drunk

612
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,384
You know like he has a lot of Fairly, and drunk tones

613
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:38,784
And then also just kind of like guy gets into these weird

614
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,320
Tangential that's do I have

615
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:44,160
I'm at this is where I where I kind of really decided like

616
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,696
It's a yeah this dude

617
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,464

618
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:47,744
That's been a few

619
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:53,888
And a few minutes

620
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,424

This country and they built

628
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,040
This world

629
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,064
Technology we have

630
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,600

Joe Biden

658
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,616
Going to be drugged

659
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,664
Joe Biden

F****** crying

664
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,416
Talking fairy

665
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:26,816
Very traditional drunk Alex

666
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:33,216
It's not as fun as other times in the past like I'll just spoiled it there's no Hatchet Pro

667
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:36,544
But he's clearly like impaired in some way

668
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,360
He's talking about his dancestor

669
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:44,992
He gets off that topic jumps and talks about how Biden going to be drugged up

670
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:51,392
Sure

671
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,672

Been through this

675
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,656
You fought on the cuddle battery

676
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,984
Was that play everytime we

677
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,752
Save the Republic

678
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,288
The filth

679
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:09,824
Chris Wallace

680
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:13,408
Confederate loyalty is royalty

681
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,456
It just makes

682
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,296
The enemies closer

683
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,088
And closer

684
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,624
Play Closer.

685
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,488
You know

686
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,512
I knew

687
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,560
Ryder

688
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,608
Kurt Vonnegut

689
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,264
Call daughter

690
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:45,152
What was the cat's cradle about Alex Jones

691
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,944
It's alright

692
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,736
Yeah he

693
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:53,088
The story isn't very interesting Alex get used to call in

694
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:55,136
And would have been on the show but he hurt

695
00:39:55,392 --> 00:40:01,536
Bonaparte himself

696
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,816
Kurt Vonnegut Jr

697
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:09,472
The one who has 510 wrote books that's the one

698
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:15,872
Brilliant speaker good author beloved by guys who are not

699
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:17,408
What is interesting to talk to as you would help

700
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:23,808
Hahaha I love it it alright the guy who wrote A Man Without a country

701
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:30,208
Trait entirely around how awful George W Bush was and how disgusting

702
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:33,792
Who died before Alex was like really huge

703
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:40,192
He was big with a big 9/11 truther and stuff showing the timer

704
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,752
When Alex Trucking

705
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,520
Big

706
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,544
That's

707
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,336
Vonnegut was dead by then

708
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:52,736
Yeah I don't know man I'm weirder things have happened. Maybe Alex did talk to her Johnny

709
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,784
I get at some point but the beer is pretty boring

710
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,344
Anyway the reason that I kept that clipping is because I

711
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:03,744
You really seen this tangential thinking that he's going down like

712
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,048
So many times and it's so delicious

713
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,840
I knew cuz babka

714
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:10,144
Never tell you about that kid

715
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,168
Do you know what

716
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:15,520
As as somebody who has described himself as Confederate royalty

717
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,824
I have saved this Republic

718
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,872
Many times

719
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:23,200
And also I'm probably Norman mailer

720
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,992
Why not

721
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:28,320
This is supposed to be the debate

722
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:33,696
Pre-show talking about like you would think well Trump's favorite are it's where I

723
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:40,096
You think maybe they do not know what it's supposed to be

724
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:44,448
Here's something about this nonsense

725
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,240
Hiestand

726
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:47,776
Historically

727
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:48,800
Emmaline

728
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,336
I'm saying no

729
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,104
Royal

730
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,384
And no.

731
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,151
Royalty

732
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,431
And no the communism

733
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,455
And no

734
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:57,759
I pledge my

735
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,527
My my

736
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,087
My blood mites

737
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,623
Bye.

738
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,679
Then that pledge

739
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,823
What is going on

740
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:25,919
Who is this

741
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:33,343
We've been hearing from the campaign that Trump is going to come out and he's going to be real

742
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,671
Forceful on immigration and Law & Order stuff

743
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:39,231
And Biden is going to try and hit him on that

744
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,511
Also

745
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:44,863
When you devote your life to everything

746
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,495
Hi tradition of rejecting Kings and now granted

747
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:57,407
My employee just posted a picture of herself with the t-shirt that you selling that says Trump is my king

748
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:01,247
But who knows

749
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:04,319
Biden is

750
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:10,719
He's a soulless Shore husky works of the devil and we are inside but even though Alex said he

751
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:16,095
Probably would also press that button and people deserve it

752
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,911
So is the Democrats

753
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,679
Global

754
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,263
They're running Biden against someone is

755
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,031
Strong

756
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,079
Powerful As Trump

757
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,895
Because that in and of itself is ritualistic

758
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,687
Eric

759
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,967
The false aplomb

760
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,503
Delusion

761
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,647
A reanimated

762
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,415
Corpse

763
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,535
But then you realize

764
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,559
The enemy is about

765
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,583
Destroy Humanity

766
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,863
The enemies of Allah

767
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,631
Slave

768
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,911
Until the enemy does

769
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:51,935
Want to feel

770
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:52,959
Real

771
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,239
But you could be inspired by

772
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,775
It wants to feel something

773
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:57,567
Empty Hawk

774
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,847
The media gang up

775
00:43:59,103 --> 00:43:59,615
Onnit

776
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,383
Push that

777
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,151
Dead body

778
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,431
A real man

779
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,479
Can have that dead body win

780
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:05,759
Curaleaf

781
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,551
Exercise

782
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,831
And so what you realize

783
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,159
Gradual

784
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,023
Now you want

785
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,375
Do I

786
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:34,431
I don't know I just don't know

787
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:42,879
In the same way that a lot of people who are covering the debate we're kind of at a loss for words YouTube

788
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:46,207
I think a lot of people on news channels are people who are

789
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,023
Professionals share not weird

790
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:52,095
Probably you know they looked at that nor like well what the

791
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,911
The f*** I don't know what to do

792
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,191
Good

793
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,727
I kind of feel

794
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:04,127
The similarly about this like I don't know what you want to say

795
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:08,479
And then makes the exact same noise I do at the end of that sentence

796
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:17,951
So I just think his brain doesn't really tracking all that well if is beginning point

797
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,231
Of his his shift

798
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,767
And

799
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:25,119
I can tell that one of his main objectives though is like

800
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,911
Chris Wallace

801
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:33,311
Has got to go down the moderator debate

802
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:35,615
Movie preemptively presented as

803
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:39,199
Not only evil but perhaps the most evil right

804
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,735
What was the

805
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,503
Celebrated

806
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,271
Turd

807
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,063
I mean he is he

808
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,343
His father must be rolling over

809
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,367
Graham as father was

810
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,647
60 minutes

811
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,719
Clearly so why would you

812
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:51,743
Baby hat is

813
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,279
Hilltop with a

814
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,559
Weather

815
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,351
Richard Wallace

816
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,631
Mike Wallace

817
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:58,655
Chris Wallace

818
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,191
So that's coming up

819
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:00,959
Tonight

820
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:04,031
Thanks so much was our garbage you know one of the guys at

821
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:05,823
What are the debates

822
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,103
4 years ago was

823
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,127
Lester Holt

824
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,687
Lester Holt on TV

825
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,223
Did Alex Jones said

826
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,247
Kill the media

827
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,783
Murder the media

828
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,551
Gokil

829
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,599
TV show clip

830
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:19,903
He just said that

831
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,375
I knew mainstream media was dead

832
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,679
Tombstone

833
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,007
Please guys will do

834
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,127
Live Lau

835
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:48,063
What's even happened what is going on okay so Chris Wallace sucks

836
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,599
Mike Wallace

837
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:54,975
Do four years ago Lester Holt did it and then later he said that I said kill the media

838
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,279
That's when the tombstone is placed on

839
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,559
That media

840
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:04,447
Call it a 1-800 half through that from now

841
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,751
B2c is very strange

842
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:12,127
So he does take some calls and a lot of it is like what should Trump do

843
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:16,735
And Alex has a really clear idea of what it and it's basically

844
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:19,295
I just beat the s*** out of

845
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:23,135
That's what Alex wants to see

846
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:26,719
Who are the slightly different idea about like what these debates are supposed to be about

847
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,047
You can't even talk

848
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,071
Emblematic

849
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:35,423
I would like to hear him say emblematic as well

850
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,471
Democratic Party

851
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,031
People are going to vote

852
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:45,919
Wednesday

853
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:47,967
What is Apollo

854
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,599
A Carlos

855
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,135
Have a good evening

856
00:47:55,647 --> 00:48:01,279
Pause leads me to believe that Alex

857
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,071
It's a foreign concept

858
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:06,399
This should be about like their ideas about

859
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,447
Very policies at Lucknow

860
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:11,263
Just watching fire

861
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,799
Alright well in Dubai

862
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:19,199
Well Carlos is a long time caller

863
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:23,295
Got a lot of stuff and I think a lot of things he says are stupid

864
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:28,927
In terms of people who are in the Infowars fear he does sometimes bring up stuff like that

865
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:35,327
Much more than other colors will like come in with something like a this new people are voting for the toilet

866
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,119
Who win the fight yeah

867
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:38,911
Usually

868
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:45,567
Has no response I don't always I don't know if I've ever felt this way before but this is the first time

869
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,615
Listen to a caller on Infowars and thought

870
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:51,967
Oh that's cute I play the rest of his call you might not.

871
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:56,319
Finally we get a little bit of a sense of what Alex is thoughts are

872
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,343
About

873
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,439
The New York Times story short. Trump's Tax Act and

874
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,975
Sting response

875
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:06,815
40 years ago

876
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:08,607
Before they passed

877
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,143
They were first proposing

878
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,727
And we we know that if you're in real estate

879
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:14,751
You better run

880
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,799
Breakeven

881
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,079
Are you done on the property tax

882
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:19,871
And feet

883
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,151
Of course he has

884
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:33,183
It's pretty disappointing to hear what Alex's defense for the whole story about the taxes seems to be so what

885
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:39,071
Like I was just hand-waving the way the idea that someone could be a billionaire but pay essentially nothing back

886
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:41,119
The country did he supposedly loved so much

887
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,911
How to super lucky that is

888
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:48,799
Is audience is full of complete dollars

889
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:55,199
Alex has big problems of the globalist is that International businesses hide their assets overseas

890
00:49:55,455 --> 00:50:01,599
If I were out I would try to come up with something better than that people in business considering all the

891
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:05,951
Tim Cook don't pay taxes and that's evil

892
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:11,839
This guy isn't even trying anymore and honestly I feel it belongs and feelings and I listen to something like that

893
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:16,191
Obviously the first element is discussed and Alex's behavior is

894
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:16,959
Pretty

895
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:23,359
Gross for what it must be like to be lowered to the level of just spinning whatever outrageous thing your guy

896
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:28,479
God came does regardless of how much of your hard-fought career you have to contradict in the process

897
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:31,551
But the third part is resentment like I really resent this

898
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:32,831
That's really

899
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:34,111
Is really shameful

900
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,439
Tell me you love my country

901
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,255
And then tell me that you contribute nothing to it

902
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:43,583
Okay those two things can't happen

903
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,351
At the same time

904
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,911
It's tough

905
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,191
You know

906
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:55,103
I know there's that element of it but the element that I'm talking about more is the Alex element

907
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,639
For sure

908
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,711
There's not even like

909
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:04,575
Listen to this defense about dodging taxes

910
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:09,951
Is Dad

911
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,255
Weather for kids

912
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,583
How do you think you'll get around

913
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:23,775
Like his defense about accusations that someone was dodging the death taxes that's how you don't pay the death

914
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:25,823
That is

915
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:26,847
Not even trying

916
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:33,247
Internally contradictory at Lake complaint is you didn't pay that text

917
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,527
Is a response

918
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:38,111
Of course that's how I fit around nothing that time

919
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,647
That's just it's just

920
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:46,303
It's B Hammer over the head.

921
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,071
Least I found

922
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,351
And I don't know if you

923
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,631
I've seen the same thing

924
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:52,959
There's a certain amount of sport that most people take in like

925
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:55,263
Trying to pay all of their

926
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,055
You know like

927
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:59,615
I meant I will pay my taxes

928
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:06,271
But I'm going to try and shave a little bit off and if you guys catch me you know what you catch me but we're going to play this game

929
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:12,671
The American Experience I know that I've heard a lot of people talk about taking business meetings I should

930
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:16,767
Heard that before

931
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,631
Well if you're the president who loves the country is trying to save

932
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:24,959
So I noticed a shift in Alex Maybe

933
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:28,031
A b c half an hour 40 minutes into his

934
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,567
Is a pre

935
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,103
Debate Behavior

936
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,639
See if you can notice a shift

937
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:36,735
We are now

938
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:38,271
3 minutes

939
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,047

What's going on

949
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,503
In Kansas are on the Earth

950
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:16,159
It's completely different wow he is that is a person trying to act

951
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:21,791

You cannot be serious you cannot be serious what up man

958
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:46,111
Accuse people of doing the drugs and that's fine right

959
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:46,879
I'm good with that

960
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,415
But that brace

961
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:49,951
That's too much

962
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:53,023
Totally normal

963
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,071
2 countdown

964
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:56,095

30pm

968
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,567
9210

969
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:06,591
30pm

970
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:07,871
Eastern Time

971
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:09,151

2730

974
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,367
Coming up tonight

975
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:19,647
And the whole thing we are

976
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:20,671
Infowars

977
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,303
Okay love

978
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,327
What's going on

979
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:32,959
So I think there's two possibilities

980
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:40,127
But I think that's not as likely as like he's just

981
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:40,895
Drunk

982
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:42,431
And someone in the booth

983
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:44,223
Told him I pick it up man

984
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:45,247
Like if he was

985
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:51,647
And that's every that crying about ancestry and share share share

986
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:58,047
Passive aggressive Alex overdoing it the other direction

987
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:04,191
Just very Stark yeah it's it's a completely different

988
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,239
Transmission

989
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,007
Yeah

990
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,055
Counting on us

991
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:26,207
Or he might be on cocaine be a little weird

992
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:28,255
I'm not saying he's taking drugs

993
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:34,911
But I am saying I have known a large number of people who have talked exactly like that immediately following

994
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:35,935
I'm going to the bathroom

995
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:42,335
I have spent enough time around people who do

996
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:48,735
Possibility

997
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,527
I can't say with any certainty

998
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,319
What

999
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:58,719
Conclusion but I can't tell you

1000
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:07,935
So Deanna Lorraine comes into I do some time with Alex or she has some high hopes

1001
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:08,959
The the debate

1002
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:11,775
I woke up this morning like a kid on Christmas

1003
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:14,079
When is it going to be what am I going to wrap my presents

1004
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:16,639
And I feel like the night were on wrapping these presents

1005
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,407
We don't know exact

1006
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:22,783
What's going to happen in some crazy curved volume

1007
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,319
I know I did

1008
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:26,111
Is I hope that he is loaded with the

1009
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,391
These one-liners in these

1010
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,159
Acquit

1011
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,439
Cindy's witty comeback

1012
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:35,839
Singers

1013
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:42,239
It was a rap battle they would at least hopefully I'm hired some of my friends who are all out of work comics

1014
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,519
Yeah it sucks

1015
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:44,543
Wow

1016
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,591
I mean I didn't

1017
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:52,991
Here come again saying I'm very excited for the enumeration of policy or I'm interested to

1018
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:53,759
Hear about

1019
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,551
The Next Step

1020

Switzer covid

1021
00:56:57,087 --> 00:57:03,231
Sure I know it's I hope he has some good Burns singers

1022
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:04,511
To own the libs

1023
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:06,303
Nothing else

1024
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,583
Wow

1025
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:11,679
This is really sad get sadder

1026
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:16,031
Some calls and listen to this person

1027
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:17,311
Tonight

1028
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,335
I would like to

1029
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:20,383
All to pray together

1030
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:22,943
Father Ted

1031
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,711
What do I do

1032
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,247
Forget

1033
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:26,783
We should all pray for

1034
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:27,551
President-trump

1035
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:28,575
Fraud

1036
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,855
I totally agree with you

1037
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:30,623
My gosh

1038
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,391
30 minutes out

1039
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,159
We should do it

1040
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,951
You want to stay up you want a sandwich

1041
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,999
I do know I've been wind

1042
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:38,047
Calling for years and years and years and I've always

1043
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:39,327
I don't know but

1044
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,095
But tonight I see

1045
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:41,887
Call in nuts

1046
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:42,911
Anything else

1047
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:44,447
Despres

1048
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,215
Let's pray

1049
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:49,823
So it's time to pray it is literally time to pray huh

1050
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:51,871
Crying sweet thang

1051
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,919
We thank you for this day

1052
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:57,247
4shared fire

1053
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,271
The shared spirit that

1054
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,039
You getting off

1055
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,575
Sacrifice

1056
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,343
You made on the

1057
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,111
Croft

1058
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:07,743
So the last time someone called in and didn't extended prayer I brought it up but I am playing eclipses are there

1059
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:13,887
And now I'm getting to a point where this is happening a bit this is too much people praying that's not good to have to

1060
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,679
At least

1061
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:18,239
I mean that's a pretty standard opening

1062
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,287
To the prayer

1063
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:25,151
I'm not worried about it cuz it's a pretty normal prayer you here

1064
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:28,991
I think it's a little bit weird to imagine it on any other platform

1065
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:33,343
Like we're doing the pre-debate coverage and then someone calls in and we just have a

1066
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,647
Specific religious

1067
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:40,511
Ritual anyone read the f****** Bible

1068
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,559
Ever ever just ever

1069
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:46,399
Do you realize what the Bible says about praying in public

1070
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:49,727
Do know these people even bother with their holy textbook

1071
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:55,359
I'm furious with this we do this all the time why do I know more about the Bible

1072
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,687
Then people who won't shut up about it

1073
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:00,223
Anyway this prayer goes on

1074
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,527
Tonight above all Lords

1075
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:03,551
The crater Utah

1076
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:04,575
Let you know

1077
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:05,599
That we

1078
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,367
Reject

1079
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,135
Satan

1080
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,927
That we were jacked state

1081
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,207
Our

1082

1083
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:12,511
This world today

1084
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:14,047
Pray tonight

1085
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:15,327
That you

1086
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:16,863
And you're holy

1087
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:17,631
Spirit

1088
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,655
Come down on

InTouch president

And give him

1093
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:24,799

Righteous

1096
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:28,895
Fury

1097
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,175
This debate

1098
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:36,575
I mean like they're beginning other prayer was kind of normal and then it gets into like we were checked saving and also please help Charles A Witness

1099
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,343
Tobago

1100
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,903
I don't know it seems it seems weird

1101
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:43,743
The prayer ends it goes on a bit more than that

1102
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:46,047
And Alex's response immediately after

1103
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,327
Very weird

1104
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,119
Every time I'm clear in the morning

1105
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:49,887
God

1106
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,191
Ariana here Bagon

1107
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,215
Leadership

1108
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:56,543
An America with the Holy Spirit

1109
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:59,103
God and bring that in

1110
00:59:59,359 --> 00:59:59,871
I hate this right

1111
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:03,455
Are you guys

1112
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,479
From

1113
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:06,271
She hated it

1114
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:12,671
No cancel this caller is caller calls in and does a prayer and then immediately after Alex is like

1115
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:19,071
To do this down on this prayer I don't have the prayer capabilities right now

1116
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:19,839
I'm either drunk

1117
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:25,983
Or on speed and I'm fine with both Lorain and

1118
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:27,263
Shirley volunteered it

1119
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:29,567
Deanna's not

1120
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:34,687
Cheese to put out by the idea of praying but Alex does not join them then this gesture to Strange

1121
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,735
So

1122
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:40,063
Next caller calls in

1123
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,599
She's just overwhelmed

1124
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:43,135
By being on the line

1125
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:43,903
With Alex

1126
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,439
And Deanna Lorraine

1127
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,463
And then

1128
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,743
Alex takes a shot

1129
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:49,791
Oh my goodness

1130
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:50,815
Alexandra

1131
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:51,839

We love you love you

1148
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:26,399
Gentrification

1149
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:28,191
Here's the Shire

1150
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:29,983
Support Ubi

1151
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:30,751
Product

1152
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:31,519
We have

1153
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,567
Here's the show wow

1154
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:39,199
So is Char is a lady who's calling in and she brings up

1155
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:42,783
That she named one of her kids after Alex

1156
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,319
She named Hermosa

1157
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,343
The kid's name Everett

1158
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,903
Wow wow

1159
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,695
What the wrong direction there

1160
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:56,095
Really take any of the other stuff you saying

1161
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,887
You want to know more about her kids

1162
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:01,727
So he asks the names of the other kids and Mike down for this because

1163
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:04,799
This doesn't quite go the way Alex Watts

1164
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,735
They are

1165
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:14,783
Sauron

1166
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:15,807
Orange

1167
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:17,855
Or orange

1168
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:21,439
Yeah yeah

1169
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:22,975
To tell you he

1170
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,255
Hi and

1171
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:25,791
He loves you guys

1172
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,327
We love you brother

1173
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,215
Is Aryan

1174
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,287
I'm sorry what

1175
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:48,575
Call Ray

1176
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,599
Jesus Christ

1177
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:55,999
That's what's really fun about that is the progress

1178
01:02:56,255 --> 01:03:02,399
Prescient it takes because she's like our first son is our first child Zoran and Alex is like

1179
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:08,799
Like a news about to say Orrin Hatch realize like I don't know if I like orange or not

1180
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:15,199
You one of the guys who doesn't like Trump or was he cool with the Trump I don't remember I haven't complained about him in a while so I'm just not going to say

1181
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:20,063
Google we navigated those Waters okay that wasn't too bad

1182
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:20,831
Aryan

1183
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:28,255
The Kool-Aid man here where I had somebody say that

1184
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:30,815
Just makes a weird noise

1185
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:38,239
Mexican what was this kid's name Silas I think okay

1186
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:41,311
Tomatoes an enjoyable cuz you could tell even Alex was like

1187
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:45,151
What the f*** that lady come on

1188
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,943
I try not to

1189
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:50,015
Be that obvious and I'm bad at it

1190
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:53,343
So Alec six other call and disguise

1191
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,111
Really

1192
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,647
Hillary to Brandi

1193
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:57,183
Tell before they find that video

1194
01:03:58,975 --> 01:03:59,487
Dot-com

1195
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:00,767
Click on more videos

1196
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:06,143
Ultraman

1197
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:08,703
Just another Channel

1198
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:10,239
Just another Channel.

1199
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:11,519
Pull up Justin

1200
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:14,079
That was

1201
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,615
So what are you predicting tonight

1202
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,431
This isn't a real color

1203
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:25,087
This is just another four Fringe as right-wing inspiring media figures calling into Alex's show trying to get some clout

1204
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:31,743
Videos of himself at various Trump rallies and videos apparently explaining the Tom Hanks as a secret pedophile but also

1205
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:38,655
He has multiple videos on his page on YouTube where he's being interviewed on Infowars

1206
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:41,215
He's been on the War Room a bunch

1207
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:47,359
Look at this guy's channel it's super super clear what sort of message she's probably getting from the contents he creates

1208
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:54,271
Princeton see other video about our evil Bill Gates is that was released 5 months ago or so and it currently has

1209
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,295
71 views

1210
01:04:55,807 --> 01:05:00,927
That's a monkey apparently interviewed Barnes a video which has 235 views

1211
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:05,791
Conversely a video of him yelling at a Biden rally got him 66,000 views

1212
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:11,935
A video of him yelling at a Bernie rally got 19200 one of him yelling at Hillary got 31,000

1213
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:18,591
Yelling at Hillary one probably would have gotten more traffic except it happened in 2019 and yelling at Hillary wasn't the highest demand

1214
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:20,127
Product at that point where all right

1215
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:26,783
It's hard to look at this guy's Channel and not see pretty clearly how this defines the ecosystem that Alex

1216
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:27,551
What is a part of

1217
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,855
A apart of elevating as a media

1218
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:36,511
Sure that interview with Barnes is almost certainly stupid and worthless and terms of substance but interviewing someone still take

1219
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,279
Takes effort

1220
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:41,887
That's effort that is not rewarded by the audience of this media caters to

1221
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:48,031
But what is rewarded is when you go out and record yourself disrupting an event that someone you don't like is holding

1222
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:54,687
This creates a perverse incentive structure where a struggling Creator could easily be convinced to trying it sell

1223
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,967
Self is not worth it

1224
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:58,783
Because the things that get the most attention or the things that take

1225
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,831
They all just being a dick

1226
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:05,183
You just have to be a big enough dick ingested inappropriate enough situation

1227
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:06,719
And you'll stand out

1228
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:11,071
That's the economy of the Alex Jones media and it's pathetic

1229
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:17,727
But what makes this even more pathetic is this guy with his YouTube channel is calling in here to talk to his obvious role model

1230
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:22,335
The guy who paid people to do in 2016 what he's now doing for free

1231
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:25,919
And Alex has no idea that he's been on the war room multiple times

1232
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:31,039
Alex has no idea who this guy is he just kind of remember seeing a video of somebody yelling at Hillary and Biden

1233
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:33,343
And that Timothy Mark of a great American

1234
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,903
Who he'll stop caring about once this

1235
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:36,927
Call end

1236
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:37,695
Immediate

1237
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:43,583
What a bummer

1238
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:48,703
And they say they like each other all the time but they just don't care

1239
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,471
Nope

1240
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:53,823
Hard it where it's hard to be friends with people that also requires work you have to

1241
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:56,895
This guy exists

1242
01:06:57,151 --> 01:07:02,783
Person who made this video that Alex vaguely remember seeing not as someone who's been treated as like

1243
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:08,159
A guest on Alex's Network like this guy's fancies himself a creator

1244
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,695
In the same sense as

1245
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:11,999
F****** Deanna Lorraine

1246
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:14,303
He is not

1247
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,607
Which is a real sad realization

1248
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:23,007
He is usable when he goes out and he yells at someone else wants yelled at until the next time

1249
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,287
He will be forgotten

1250
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:29,151
The lot of talk has been done on this pre-debate

1251
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:31,711
Time about everyone getting these ballots

1252
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:36,063
Sure Three Rivers everywhere

1253
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,647
The other day

1254
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,695
I threw it in the trash

1255
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:43,487
Everyone's getting one it's all what

1256
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,703
I mean the ones that they suddenly

1257
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:54,751
Find are the ones that are dead

1258
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,287
Oh my God

1259
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:58,335
What is a Democrat ballot

1260
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:01,407
In the general election everybody gets the same ballet

1261
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:04,735
I don't understand what this is

1262
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:11,391
It's great they got the Democrats I'd like to push on this issue a little bit more but we're at a time the debate start

1263
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:15,743
Alright so Alex Goes to try to throw it to Chris Wallace who he hates

1264
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:19,327
Saab Indiana does not quite get the throw

1265
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:20,863
Closet

1266
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:23,935
Empty Soul on American

1267
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:26,495
I know right triangle

1268
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,519
Stack effect

1269
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:28,799
Trying to be

1270
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:29,823
Stuff you retarded

1271
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:33,919
What's what's going on

1272
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:35,199
Piece of on American Idol

1273
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:42,367
The garbage unbiased

1274
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:48,767
Deanna did not quite get the the way this works

1275
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:51,583
Audio or video

1276
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:57,727
Does not need you to double down on him not liking Chris Wallace eannace you're not ready for the game yet snow

1277
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:58,751
But it it's

1278
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:01,823
It's so clear like at the beginning of this that like

1279
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:03,359
One of the primary

1280
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:07,967
Is going to play out is attacking Chris Wallace

1281
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:11,295
I can assure you none of the questions has been shipped

1282
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:13,855
Weather today

1283
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:16,927
Disgusting swamp creature

1284
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,999
You want to die in a ditch

1285
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,535
Shield Healthcare

1286
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:30,239
Either huge swamp

1287
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:36,639
Yeah you get lost in his eyes by which I mean your feet get stuck in them and you lose your shoes as well

1288
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:38,943
Jordan

1289
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,991
I'll save

1290
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,783
I was

1291
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:46,623
Pretty disappointed by the debate as a whole like I think

1292
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:48,159
Did you watch it

1293
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:54,559
Yeah yeah I'm sorry I listened to it again through Alex

1294
01:09:54,815 --> 01:10:00,959
Even worse in terms of editing up this episode and getting the clips I had to relive it and it wasn't better the second time

1295
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:07,615
Are you sure yeah very disappointing and I think that a lot of people had some analysis of it some of it productive

1296
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:09,407
Some of it not so productive

1297
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:11,711
I would say that Alex Takes the Cake

1298
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:17,599
Legitimately the worst

1299
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:20,927
What did Isaac beard

1300
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,999
First of all

1301
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,279
Thank you for

1302
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:32,447
Never right

1303
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:36,543
Have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is that safe

1304
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:39,359
When they vote for a United States senators

1305
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,127
That's

1306
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:47,807
Unbelievable unbelievable what is the highest level of insight that you could get from that

1307
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:50,623
I agree with him wholeheartedly

1308
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:55,487
If you just did that through the entire door noises same thing same thing

1309
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:04,191
Really interested in his tax plan

1310
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:10,847
Just don't think so when that happen like that's what right at the beginning of the debate

1311
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:13,407
Just like oh no

1312
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:15,967
This is this is where we're going okay

1313
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:18,527
And what makes it worse is that earlier

1314
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:19,551
Alex

1315
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:25,951
Sad sad you know we'll just as little as possible maybe I'll make some fart noises

1316
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:29,791
Sure I thought that was not a plan as knows it was a joke

1317
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:33,887
That's why I didn't cut that clip out

1318
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:39,007
Make fart noises and you were serious earlier

1319
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:41,567
Who likes well there's no need to

1320
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:44,639
Pay attention to that I'll never need that information ever again

1321
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:46,687
A boy but turns out

1322
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:47,455
You do

1323
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:52,575
Play Electric

1324
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:55,647
Look up puppies faces too bright

1325
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:58,719
Clear

1326
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,607
Mister methamphetamines

1327
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,679
Is in the Supreme Court right now trying to do

1328
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:08,447
Get rid of

1329
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:10,495
The Affordable Care Act

1330
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:12,287
Which will strip

1331
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,311
20 million

1332
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:16,639
The B too good at look

1333
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:21,759
I had my fun and now I'm over with it you get one time with fart noises and then after that

1334
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:26,879
It's played out Alex keeps going yeah I think he realizes pretty quickly they bite

1335
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:30,975
Who is performing at 11 that is way out of sync

1336
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:35,327
With what he has built up in his audience dad as their expectation

1337
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:41,727
And so you do daddy something that needs to be addressed a little bit maybe methamphetamines is one way to go about it

1338
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,519
But there's also

1339
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,567
Like something else

1340
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:46,591
About Biden

1341
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:49,407
He seems more alive then

1342
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,175
You've

1343
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:56,575
Formally said that he is what did he not know that only an idiot would not know that you were lying about

1344
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:58,111
That would just look

1345
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:59,903
Fine

1346
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:06,303
You know you said that he would look like a desiccated corpse basically you know why he did

1347
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:08,607
Swampert

1348
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,143
Probably got about

1349
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:15,007
Okay

1350
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:22,175
You probably got five bags of blood in front building

1351
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:26,783
Celibate male

1352
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:33,183
Hello fresh

1353
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:36,767
Blood before the other grandpa Jordan over here don't know about Plumping

1354
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:42,143
I understand correctly

1355
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,679
Is that what happened

1356
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:50,079
Is Joe Biden was pumped full of more blood that is necessary for human being to survive

1357
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:53,919
10 bags 5 sandbags

1358
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:55,455
Large blood

1359
01:13:56,991 --> 01:14:03,135
Bleeding out his eyes blood

1360
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:05,695
Too much blood and you can only fit so much blood

1361
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:11,839
Yeah and that's heavy transfusion if you were to get 5 to 10 bags of blood

1362
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,631
That is a lot

1363
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:18,495
I would I would say dangerous probably

1364
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:20,031
Or

1365
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:24,895
Recreational Club I mean now I kind of want to see how it feels

1366
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:25,919
I don't

1367
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:28,735
Too much I want to

1368
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:32,575
If you're going to try pumping definitely get the consent

1369
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:38,975
Sure this becomes like Alex's new thing like this

1370
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:40,511
Blood bag B

1371
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:45,887
Superfund

1372
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:48,191
Why Penny and

1373
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:49,983
One of the big debate

1374
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:50,751
What is a dick

1375
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:53,311
Energy

1376
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,871
For sure

1377
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:56,895
Baby blood

1378
01:14:57,407 --> 01:15:03,551
Yeah okay I do enjoy this Deanna trying to be like a person having a

1379
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,575
What is a do

1380
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:07,135
Clubs

1381
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:13,535
Deanna how dare you applied basic human curiosity to a man who has no interest double bucket of blood

1382
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:20,447
You know this is the type of thing that should have made it very obvious to everybody why

1383
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:24,031
Well in advance of course the debates are going to be a shitshow

1384
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,567
But that's because Alex

1385
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:26,847
Is basically

1386
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:28,639
Acting the same way that Trump

1387
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:29,407
Always does

1388
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:31,455
The actor the exact same way

1389
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:35,039
So why in God's name would in a debate Trump not be like

1390
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:37,599
At your full blood your full your puppet

1391
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,367
Look at you

1392
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:44,767
Hey my tax plan is about

1393
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:50,911
Chris Wallace

1394
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:57,311
Neighbors

1395
01:15:57,567 --> 01:16:00,127
It's a little silly

1396
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,151
Look

1397
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,175
Point is

1398
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:06,783
Normally

1399
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:09,343
Beaches

1400
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,879
Gastric LaBelle

1401
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:11,903
He is deathly

1402
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,951
Only had blood transfusions

1403
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:16,767
Store

1404
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:23,935
Whatever Alex says something like iwatches beaches not just

1405
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:25,983
The gas that we cut out that is

1406
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:26,751
Towel

1407
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:30,079
That he just watches the gas that one of his insurance cuts out

1408
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:31,615
He's on blood

1409
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:37,503
Yeah that's he's on the bug man that's always the I'm not bragging I watch the full videos not just the clip

1410
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:45,439
You know what I thought was really interesting here is that after a little while Alex Indiana actually

1411
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:48,511
Shut up and they stop interrupting the debate which

1412
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:50,047
Sweetly threw me off

1413
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:54,399
I watch the Hillary Trump debates on Infowars with my boys far out

1414
01:16:54,655 --> 01:17:00,287
Whenever Hillary was talking in order to make sure the audience didn't get a different opinion of her

1415
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:02,847
Then the curated caricature that he's painted

1416
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:09,503
In this instance I was really shocked that Alex actually stop talking while Biden was on stage and speaking

1417
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:13,087
I can't tell what that was whether he's just drunk and Confused

1418
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:19,487
Or maybe he didn't feel the need to interrupt because he became confident at a certain point that Trump would do it for gas going to say

1419
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:25,887
Yeah I think they have my literal avatar on stage I'm ripping a movie that mst3k

1420
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:27,423
Is currently ripping at the

1421
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,703
The same time we're done.

1422
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:35,103
It was strange because there's long stretches where no one's saying anything it's just the debate

1423
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:45,087
Yeah that's a little disconcerting actually that's that's a horror movie like The Calm before

1424
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:51,487
Thesis statement here like what Trump needs to do cuz he's not doing enough

1425
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:53,023
That's apparently working

1426
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,559
Vital Farms

1427
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:55,583
Sponsored

1428
01:17:56,863 --> 01:18:03,007
He wants to see from his candidate even treat the questions as if they

1429
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:03,775
They were asked

1430
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,567
Just yell and attack

1431
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:06,335
Yep

1432
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:07,615
So cool

1433
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:09,919
Anyway that does

1434
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:10,943
Sort of happen

1435
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:11,711
Eventually

1436
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:14,527
This is the first like real outburst

1437
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:15,807
From Deanna and Alex

1438
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:19,135
Vice President Biden

1439
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:19,903
Smaller

1440
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:22,463
Pants with nobody will show up

1441
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:23,231
People with

1442
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:29,887
We're going to use that

1443
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:31,167
Wow

1444
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:33,471
It's kind of sad

1445
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:36,799
Alright so

1446
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:39,871
We have infrastructure issues

1447
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:41,407
To talk about

1448
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:44,991
We could deal with I don't know the large

1449
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:47,039
Just crisis that any of us have ever faced

1450
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:53,439
We can talk about that in the 2016 debates in the Republican primary Trump talk about having a big dick like

1451
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,999
We're done

1452
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:57,535
Oh well

1453
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:58,303
It was fun

1454
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:04,703
Alex is pretty disappointing singers in

1455
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:06,495
Fake version of Biden isn't there

1456
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:08,543
Great job

1457
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:11,615
Popped up

1458
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:14,175
He's definitely like you said on something he's able to talk

1459
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,735
Antrum is not dominating

1460
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,039
Swimming but as we talked

1461
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:25,183
Alex is Disappointment here is really interesting because by all accounts he should be loving this

1462
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:31,583
Is being an a****** he's interrupting all over the place and neither Chris Wallace nor Biden can really stop him or do anything

1463
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:33,887
To make this a conversation about policy differences

1464
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:39,775
Trump throwing out some singers that Alex is loving but at this point you can tell that this is not what Alex wanted

1465
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:40,799
Here's why

1466
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:45,151
Trump is not contradicting reality in the ways Alex needs him too

1467
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:51,807
Trump is arguing with Biden about when a vaccine will be available not about how the vaccine is actually a secret plot to microchip

1468
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:52,831
Japan kill everyone

1469
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:58,207
Trump saying that states should open up in masks R5 he's not saying the covid-19 is a hoax

1470
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:01,023
Some of the Democrats are trying to take over the world using it

1471
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:06,143
In the same way that this debate as the danger of revealing to Alex's cloistered audience that Joe Biden

1472
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:08,447
Can infect complete sentences and he isn't

1473
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:15,104
A man of the depths of late-stage dementia it also carries the danger of revealing that Trump is not who Alex's Bill 2

1474
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,128
Come up to me either

1475
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:22,784
Trump is a bully in an a****** he's an aspiring dictator and he's willing to use whatever support he's able to to

1476
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,600
But when the cards are on the table he doesn't give up

1477
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,880
A f*** about Alex's petkin

1478
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:27,904
Conspiracy theories

1479
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:32,256
He doesn't want to waste the political Capital it would take for him to yell about vaccines

1480
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:34,816
He probably rather try to find a way to make a buck off

1481
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,936
This isn't Stark opposition to the image that Alex paints of the man who was brought in by God

1482
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:40,960
The fight the battle against

1483
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:42,496
The globalist is there champion

1484
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:48,896
That was one of the things that struck me the most when I was watching the debate because I didn't expect anything other than a train wreck so has mostly

1485
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,432
Prepared for that aspect

1486
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:56,832
There wasn't a winner but ultimately Joe Biden probably lost the least or at least came closest to winning because his

1487
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:58,368
Campaign doesn't have a lot of

1488
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:02,976
You know it's not built on the enthusiasm about him as a personality sure

1489
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:09,120
If he comes out in fails to articulate left-wing position well that's not going to surprise anyone on the left

1490
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:15,776
As long as he manages to get through the debate without conceding to Trump he's going to retain the support that he has among the Democratic base

1491
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:20,384
And there probably aren't a whole lot of undecided voters to convince one way or another at this point

1492
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,432
On the other hand

1493
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:26,784
Has a lot to lose mostly because his base is made up of a whole lot of weirdos

1494
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,088
Was with wildly different beliefs about who he is

1495
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:30,112
And what he's doing

1496
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:33,952
Each of them is a mini Trump called that has their own version of the story

1497
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:40,352
4q people is that of a secret group in the government that's rooting out all the evil doers most of him or actually already

1498
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:43,168
The morati have been replaced by clones

1499
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:47,264
The weirdly Trump never seems to bring up any of this stuff or act like any of it's true

1500
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:53,664
People in the Infowars for Trump is a god-ordained ruler king who was brought to Earth exactly the right moment to be their hero

1501
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:56,736
I deliver them from the bondage of the literal Christian devil

1502
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:57,760
And his minions

1503
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:58,528
The Democrats

1504
01:21:58,784 --> 01:21:59,808
But weirdly Trump

1505
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:06,208
Fails to be on the same page with Alex about some pretty major elements of what's supposed to be the devil's plan Shore

1506
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:09,280
It's the key to defeating the devil's plan is exposing the hoax

1507
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:10,304
Covid-19

1508
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,608
And Trump has all the evidence that it's a hoax

1509
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:16,960
But it sure seems weird that he's bickering with Biden about how soon Avec seem to be delivered

1510
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:19,264
Military no less

1511
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,824
That's something Alex shouldn't like to heal that's not good

1512
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:27,968
I have a suspicion that this debate could have been a disaster for Trump but not in the way that rational people might expect

1513
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:31,808
Normal humans would watch that debating with a t on stages 1

1514
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:34,368
Complete raising a*******-in-one politician

1515
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:38,720
Assuming that the politicians policies aren't something you completely disagree with

1516
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:41,792
You probably vote for them over a raving a******

1517
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:45,120
Because that dude is a raving lunatic a******

1518
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:48,704
But I think the damage that Trump could have done to himself was in that he's

1519
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,984
Wasn't crazy enough

1520
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:53,568
Or maybe a better way to put it is that he wasn't crazy in the right ways

1521
01:22:54,080 --> 01:23:00,224
He'll be almost impossible to satisfy all the different communities of trump idolaters with their varying belief structures

1522
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,016
Make sense with no matter what

1523
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:04,832
Some of them would end up disappointed and disillusioned

1524
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:05,856
5S

1525
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:06,624
Babe

1526
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:07,904
I'm at kind of does

1527
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,952
Seem to be with Alex is experiencing

1528
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:11,744
No more flute

1529
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,024
Call Dad

1530
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,608
Call out

1531
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:17,376
The Flash

1532
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:18,400
Call out

1533
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:22,240
Don't play their game

1534
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,568
All out South

1535
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:26,592
Call out Bill Gates

1536
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:30,944
This is pretty tough

1537
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:31,712
For Alex

1538
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,528
Is it true that were aware that this

1539
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:36,576
Covid-19 is an elaborate hoax

1540
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:38,880
Perpetrated on the American public

1541
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:42,976
In order to crash the economy and put the population into slavery and then eventually death

1542
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:46,560
Kind of his responsibilities as president before right about that

1543
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:51,936
He wouldn't be very admirable thing for him to know about this plan and it's a plan to kill everyone

1544
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:55,264
And then just argue that he's done a better job than Biden would have done

1545
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:58,336
That's the sort of thing that makes you think that maybe he's not the same

1546
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:00,128
Person that Alex has told you that he is

1547
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:04,224
And you know what that should scare the s*** out of Alex optic

1548
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,248
Speak very clear

1549
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,296
It's one thing for Alex

1550
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:08,576
To turn on Trump

1551
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:13,696
It's another thing for his audience to turn on Trump while Alex is still licking food totally

1552
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:16,512
And I think they'd tell you run the risk of that because like

1553
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:17,280
You know

1554
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:19,328
Why would Trump debate

1555
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,608
About

1556
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:23,680
I've done a great job on the Coronavirus

1557
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:24,448
When

1558
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,752
He's supposed to be aware

1559
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:27,520
States

1560
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:29,056
Nothing right

1561
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:30,848
Manufactured to hurt him

1562
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:32,896
Write what he should be saying is

1563
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:36,992
There isn't anybody dying of coronavirus you guys all just made this up

1564
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:39,552
He's in front of me make me look

1565
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:42,624
Yeah and if playing along with the charade

1566
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,904
Is in effect

1567
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:48,000
Eating the globalists devil's plan

1568
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:50,304
Then why would he be doing that

1569
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:54,656
Raises those questions in your mind that are very tough and they only

1570
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:57,472
Conclusion you can really come to is that Alex has been

1571
01:24:57,984 --> 01:25:04,128
Creating fake versions of vitad trepanning

1572
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:09,504
I just had an image of me playing with my two Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figure yes

1573
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:13,344
The Raphael one where that has had popped out and I was great.

1574
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,624
That is what's going on

1575
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,976
Alex gets to talking about how the Democrats

1576
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:20,512
They want to crash the economy

1577
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:21,536
You know that right

1578
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:23,072
You remember who said that

1579
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:25,632
Do you

1580
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:32,032
Democrats wanted cressey, which which person who's about to crash the economy in order to punish Trump yeah but which person said that

1581
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,336
The Democrats

1582
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:35,104
Percent he did

1583
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,152
Lorraine

1584
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:39,200
And now they keep going back to covid you suck

1585
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:40,224
Call me wise

1586
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,528
When they said they were from

1587
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,136
The 100% and this was a ploy from the beginning is

1588
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,696
Is push this false epidemic epidemic

1589
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:52,000
Balsa push it as much as pause

1590
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:56,096
Say that this major serious thing and then have the economy crash

1591
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:57,120
A blame

1592
01:25:57,376 --> 01:26:00,960
Trump and hopefully don't remember that I mean bilmar all of them

1593
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:04,800
Sylmar Sylmar

1594
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:06,848
A boy

1595
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,664
So there was a raucous celebration

1596
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:12,736
When Trump gave out that singer earlier

1597
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:13,504
Sure

1598
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,528
Is great singer

1599
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:18,368
At this point in the debate

1600
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:20,416
Trump brought up Hunter Biden

1601
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:22,976
Leads to

1602
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:25,280
A declaration of victory

1603
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:27,840
The mayor of moscow's wife

1604
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:28,608
Gave you some

1605
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:33,728
Three and a half million dollars

1606
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:36,544
Micrometer

1607
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:39,360
None of that

1608
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:41,664
Take me to Plaza

1609
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:46,528
On the lot

1610
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:51,648
President

1611
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:54,464
It is not true he really?

1612
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:57,024
Russian agent

1613
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,560
Peapod

1614
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:00,608
But body is hot

1615
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:09,312
And disappearing as amphetamines

1616
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:10,336
The run-out

1617
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:14,176
His shot has run out

1618
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:15,456
So

1619
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,992
Basically

1620
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:22,880
This follows with my theory and they're like what they're celebrating is like how he got one of our narrative

1621
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:27,232
Yeah he is misrepresenting reality and the way that works for us right

1622
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:33,888
And they're pretty excited we got we got at least one that we can talk about tomorrow and be like Trump is our god-king again because

1623
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:40,288
Because he got this one right Let's ignore all the other stuff like how I guess he's fine with killing everybody I guess

1624
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:43,616
The Narrative becomes Joe Biden's drugs are wearing off

1625
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:45,920
And so they just get really excited about that

1626
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,200
We've never

1627
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:48,992
Mike ESPN

1628
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:51,552
At the races

1629
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,880
Close your eyes run with those nipples look like coming out

1630
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:57,696
Buffet of drug

1631
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:58,720
And bladder

1632
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:04,352
Julianus Medical vileblood

1633
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:10,496
Obviously

1634
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,776
This is ridiculous

1635
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:18,176
Was talking about the United right rally where people were chanting Jews will not replace us

1636
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:20,480
Anti-Semitism that was on display Al

1637
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:24,320
They're Alex's misrepresenting it and saying

1638
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:29,952
Sure I don't even understand why anybody would think that this is good analysis or like

1639
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:34,304
Why would anybody even if you are a crazy right-wing person

1640
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:38,144
And even if you're weird conspiracy theories she why would you think that like

1641
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:41,472
Alex can't follow what's being discussed

1642
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:42,752
And respond to

1643
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:45,312
Like he's incapable of doing

1644
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:46,080
This job

1645
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:48,128
Even if you're nuts

1646
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:49,664
Anime anti-communist

1647
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:52,992
You should be disappointed by this watch party

1648
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:59,648
This is like whenever a new episode of Mad Men was released in everybody's like let's get our friends together and everybody's like

1649
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:06,048
Looking for Don Draper did it has nothing to do with reality it's more off topic than that I think

1650
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:10,656
Watch parties or madman or a little bit better moderated

1651
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:14,496
That's probably true

1652
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:21,664
About Law & Order run

1653
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,432
You're allowed

1654
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:30,112
Chris Wallace he orders

1655
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:36,512
What is the point of these people it's it's just shut up it's outrageous there's no talking to you there's no point in you

1656
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:42,656
You talking nothing you do is good or worthy of even f****** just shut up and leave us alone

1657
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:48,800
So another thing is like so Alex has been painting Chris Wallace is like the most evil awful

1658
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:53,152
Part of this is like they're ganging up on Trump

1659
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:56,224
Is not asking Biden any hard questions

1660
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:58,528
Deactivating a hard question

1661
01:29:58,784 --> 01:29:59,808
This doesn't

1662
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:01,344
Will I get shouldn't work for Alice

1663
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:03,136
Have you ever called

1664
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:04,672
All the Democratic mayor report

1665
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:06,208
Or the Democratic governor

1666
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:06,976
Oregon

1667
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:07,744
NSAID

1668
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:09,536
Hey you got to stop this

1669
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:11,328
Bring in the National Guard

1670
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,352
Do whatever it takes

1671
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,144
Stop the days

1672
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:14,912
Months

1673
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:15,680
Violence

1674
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:16,704
In Portland

1675
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:18,496
I don't hold public office

1676
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,032
I am

1677
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:21,568
A former vice president

1678
01:30:21,824 --> 01:30:25,152
I made it clean.

1679
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:27,456
Right

1680
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:30,528
Another good question though I got to hang out a while ago

1681
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,064
The question now

1682
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:37,184
Weight doesn't that invalidate the idea that Chris Wallace wouldn't be asking any hard questions Jesus

1683
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:41,792
What is going on I hate all of this why are you guys dealing with reality

1684
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:47,424
This is the problem when unreality is forced to meet reality it looks incredibly stupid

1685
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:53,824
Yeah I think Alex is is is a little bit even on his heels a tiny bit related

1686
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:54,848
Might just be like

1687
01:30:55,616 --> 01:31:01,760
Is that what did I think this was going to be why did I think this was going to not be what it's so

1688
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:04,064
Obviously was going to be

1689
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:10,464
So we get to the point in the debate where Trump is asked about the proud boys sure

1690
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:11,488
Real interesting

1691
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:13,536
Alex seems pretty disappointed

1692
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:15,072
Are you willing

1693
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:15,840
July

1694
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:17,888
Condemn white supremacist

1695
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:18,912
And Melissa Grove

1696
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:19,936
And

1697
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:20,704
To say

1698
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:21,984
They need

1699
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:22,752
To stand down

1700
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:23,520
And not

1701
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:26,080
Add to the body

1702
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:30,432
Are you prepared

1703
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:35,296
Almost everything I see is from the left wing

1704
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:38,368
Not from the right but what do you want to do

1705
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:41,952
I'm willing to do anything I want to see peace

1706
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:49,376
Proud boys

1707
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:51,680
Stand back

1708
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:52,704
Can standby

1709
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:53,728
But I'll tell you what

1710
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:54,752
I'll tell you what

1711
01:31:55,264 --> 01:32:01,408
Somebody's got to do something about antifa and the left

1712
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:03,456
I know

1713
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:04,480
But he doesn't even

1714
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:07,808
I've been there

1715
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:15,488
He's really disappointed the Trump didn't say I

1716
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:19,584
Executive orders

1717
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,144
So don't ask me about the proud boys

1718
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,448
Or whatever like

1719
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:27,008
Deflection to get off the topic

1720
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:30,848
Instead he said something that everybody heard

1721
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:32,640
Terrifying

1722
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:39,040
Oh no he just told the proud boys to be ready to murder the left at any point in time I don't understand I don't think

1723
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:45,440
Alex heard it that way that doesn't sound like he realize that

1724
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:51,840
Said was it's okay for you and your friends to kill the love like you've always wanted to do I don't I don't know if Alex

1725
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:56,704
Took that message away from it Keith I think he's only guy

1726
01:32:57,216 --> 01:33:00,544
His reading comprehension skills are so low

1727
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:04,128
Even the guy who's telling him what he wants to hear

1728
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:07,968
He's unable to understand his reading of

1729
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:14,368
Trump's response there is an unwillingness to alienate like some of his passionate supporter

1730
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:18,464
Yeah I meant also he probably was trying to say

1731
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:19,744
Stand Down

1732
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:25,376
Whatever it kept saying stand back stand by Usher

1733
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:33,312
Freezing it that way allows that possible interpretation

1734
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:38,688
I find it all very tiring and and terrifying at-bat

1735
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:39,968
To that I say f*** off

1736
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:42,528
Also this is going to be a problem for Alex

1737
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:44,320
You believe

1738
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:45,344
Human

1739
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:46,880
Pollution

1740
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:50,208
God's greenhouse gas emissions most recent a rock album

1741
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:52,000
Play.

1742
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:54,304
Electronic said yes

1743
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,072
Uh-oh

1744
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,608
That's not good

1745
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:57,888
Oh man

1746
01:33:58,144 --> 01:34:00,960
Unreality is losing it every turn

1747
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:03,520
Yeah I mean if your Alex like what are you doing

1748
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:04,544
Trump says yes

1749
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,592
Human pollution is contributing to

1750
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:12,992
Climate and I thought it's supposed to be a Chinese

1751
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:19,136
To be a Chinese bio-weapon

1752
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:20,672
How man. These people

1753
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:25,280
So earlier I know who was in the first televised presidential debate

1754
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:28,096
Now we learn something that Deanna doesn't know

1755
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:29,632
Do we can get to

1756
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:31,168
NetZero

1757
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:32,704
In terms of energy

1758
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:33,728
Production

1759
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:35,008
My2030

1760
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:37,056
G59 only not costing peep

1761
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:38,592
People jobs creating job

1762
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:41,408
Creating millions of good paying jobs

1763
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,456
Not 15 bucks an hour

1764
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:44,224
But

1765
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:45,248
Prevailing wage

1766
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,040
By having a new info

1767
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:48,320
Structuralism

1768
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:49,344
Economy

1769
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:52,416
Obvious

1770
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:53,440
Prevailing wage

1771
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:56,768
New word

1772
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,560
What's good for you

1773
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:04,960
Good for you Deanna Deanna you should have learned about forever Bailey way did she is just fine

1774
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:06,240
Do you think she was like

1775
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:08,288
I should find a better job

1776
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:14,688
Getting paid 15 bucks an hour for this if you Google it you might

1777
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:17,248
Rethink your contract if Alex butt

1778
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:20,832
Yeah I think that's always that's always interesting when like

1779
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:24,416
Because it almost had the sound

1780
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:30,816
Thinking she had a gacha life and said something

1781
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:35,424
Henry audiology

1782
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,192
About

1783
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:38,240
Working issues stupid

1784
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:44,640
So they get really bored by this point cuz they've already decided like haha the hunter Biden

1785
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:45,664
Thingies

1786
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:52,064
Slowly losing his

1787
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:58,464
Pop-up time we should be dealing with the mercy rules Alex at this point

1788
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:00,512
Starts talking about corn Pop-a-Lot

1789
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:02,560
I actually

1790
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:03,840
Studied

1791
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:09,216
And it includes upgrading 4 million buildings weatherizing 2 million hounds of

1792
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:09,984
4 years

1793
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,056
Energy efficient

1794
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:14,080
Homes

1795
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:16,896
So the question becomes

1796
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:21,504
Who support the president would say that sounds

1797
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:22,528
I guess going to cost

1798
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:23,552
A lot of money

1799
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:24,320
What is

1800
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:25,344
Can do is going to Crate

1801
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:28,672
Thousands and millions of jobs

1802
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:30,208
Removed

1803
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,768
Push people into little smart cities

1804
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:35,328
Paying job

1805
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:41,984
Alex said let Corn Pop talk you might have noticed that his voice changed a little bit

1806
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:45,056
That sounded right

1807
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:45,824
Did he come back

1808
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:51,200
Maybe five minutes later

1809
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:57,600
It is like I got to get a drink I'm going to be right back he's either getting a drink or like he has to pee or something

1810
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:59,904
I don't know what it is but yeah you just leave

1811
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:05,536
Is Deanna doing by yourself not great I didn't they just mostly hear the debate

1812
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:06,560
With her gone

1813
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:10,400
Every now and again trailing wage a

1814
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:16,800
So they get to the topic of voter fraud in the debate Shore

1815
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:20,640
We won't know we might not know for months

1816
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:22,944
Because these ballots are going to be all over

1817
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:27,808
Take a look at what happened in Manhattan take a look at what happened

1818
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:29,088
Ford in Virginia and other places

1819
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:30,368
Losing

1820
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:34,208
2% 1 % which by the way is too much in election could be one of us for that

1821
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,488
Phyllis and 30

1822
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:36,512
And 40%

1823
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:38,048
It's a fraud

1824
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:39,328
And it's a shame

1825
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:41,888
Can you imagine where they said

1826
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:43,424
Tomorrow

1827
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:45,728
5 minutes

1828
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:47,264
Trump in Thoroughbred

1829
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:48,800
Domination proof

1830
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:51,872
Flammable

1831
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:54,432
Bring It On from Bring It On

1832
01:37:54,688 --> 01:38:00,832
Trump is creating the narrative along with the election is going to be stolen

1833
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:03,648
If he doesn't exactly what we needed

1834
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:04,672
Hooray

1835
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:11,072
That's the celebration the way it's experiences

1836
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:12,352
Exactly what we needed

1837
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:17,728
Yep and it's so weird how that is overriding

1838
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:23,360
All the very serious problems that have been introduced by the visuals of this debate

1839
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:26,944
The fact that Trump is not the person that you pretend to you

1840
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,992
The fact that Biden

1841
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:30,784
Isn't the

1842
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:33,600
Falling apart old man that you pretend to yes sure

1843
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:37,696
Like dubbed invalidation of so much of Alex's

1844
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:40,768
He's just undone by we got what we needed

1845
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:44,864
Things where he's just a aspiring dictator a******

1846
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:45,632
Like

1847
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:46,912
The things that

1848
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:48,448
Work for Alex

1849
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:53,568
Are the things that are completely explainable without Alex's conspiracy

1850
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:54,848
The parts where

1851
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:58,432
Alex's conspiracies and Trump's behaviors intersect

1852
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:03,552
There's not there's not as much overlap as Alex pretend

1853
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:05,856
It is a boy

1854
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:07,648
That was the most I've heard

1855
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:08,928
From the debate

1856
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:09,952
And

1857
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:12,256
I ate the picture I had my head

1858
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:13,280
Accurate

1859
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:14,304
Right on

1860
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,608
Well I think if you watched it

1861
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:18,144
I believe that

1862
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,960
Heroes my favorite snippet

1863
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:23,264
From the debate

1864
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,288
Saying something it's like

1865
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,336
This is this is like

1866
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:29,408
I don't believe

1867
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:31,456
What we're saying is

1868
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:32,992
They're saying is about to be a

1869
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:34,528
Smart by the

1870
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:36,320
By election day

1871
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:37,600
If I can get in

1872
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:39,392
Until the seventh eighth ninth

1873
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:40,928
It still should be

1874
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:41,696
Counted

1875
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:42,976
He's just afraid of

1876
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:48,096
Counting the votes

1877
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:50,912
President

1878
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:51,680
Skills music

1879
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:55,264
I love counting vote I love counting votes

1880
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:56,288
What are we doing

1881
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:02,944
What are we doing I don't know what are we doing I can't imagine any candidate that I

1882
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:05,760
I've ever been excited about saying something like that

1883
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:09,344
Meaning respect

1884
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:15,744
I don't want to die because of that a****** that's unfair

1885
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:22,144
Cruel and an insulting to me I have existed this long without dying

1886
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:28,544
Because of an a****** like Donald Trump into dime now that's too long after long

1887
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:34,432
That be fine I should be killed by an a****** like this when I'm 99 year olds are assholes like that

1888
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:35,968
Well if you're not lying

1889
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:36,992
You'll be too young to vote

1890
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:43,904
And if you're too young to vote then you won't be at the poles

1891
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:48,768
Trump is encouraging people in his supporters to go and to hang out

1892
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:50,304
And will you play

1893
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,072
Judge denied

1894
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:53,120
But you will not declare victory

1895
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:54,912
Until the election has

1896
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:56,192
Been independently sort of

1897
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:57,728
President-trump

1898
01:40:57,984 --> 01:40:59,520
Supporters

1899
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:00,800
To go into the pole

1900
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:01,568
And watch

1901
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:02,592
Very careful

1902
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:04,384
Because that's what has to have

1903
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:06,176
Happen I am urging them to do it

1904
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:10,528
As you know today there was a big problem in Philadelphia they went into what

1905
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:12,576
They will pick all Polo watches a very

1906
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:13,600
Safer nice

1907
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:16,416
They were thrown out

1908
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:18,464
You don't why does bad things have

1909
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:20,256
Philadelphia bad things

1910
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:21,792
And I am urging

1911
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:23,840
Imrg my people I hope

1912
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:24,864
It's going to be a fair election

1913
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:31,008
But if I see tens of thousands of dollars

1914
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:32,288
Was being manipulated

1915
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:33,568
I can't go along with

1916
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:42,016
Yosemite on 80 million

1917
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:45,088
These people aren't equipped to handle it

1918
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:45,856
Number one

1919
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:46,880
Nothing you

1920
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:49,440
They cheat they did all this

1921
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:54,816
Please paper basket created this with the coveted do it. They

1922
01:41:56,352 --> 01:41:58,144
If you're saying

1923
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:04,544
You know you want you want an election you want a good clean election and you'll respect the results of a good clean election but

1924
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:10,944
Unfortunately you can't respect a result and then your next sentences are

1925
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:16,576
Look at all this your kind of signaling something and that is that

1926
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:19,904
He will not view the election as being valid

1927
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:25,536
What time is it

1928
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:27,328
Before he leaves for the night

1929
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:30,400
And Deanna Lorraine and Owen Shroyer hose

1930
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:32,192
For quite a while band

1931
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:33,984
Connect

1932
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:37,568
Out of the first half

1933
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,616
He didn't do as well as I'd like

1934
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:40,640
I had

1935
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:44,224
Black Taffy just weigh out to

1936
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:45,760
Joe Biden Apple

1937
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:46,528
Troydan

1938
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:48,832
The on Lorraine will give you her tag

1939
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:49,856
Port Royal give

1940
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:51,136
Just remember

1941
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:52,416
Not a great credit working

1942
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:54,208
18 hours later bring you this

1943
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:56,000
There's no Independent Media like this.

1944
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:58,048
She has live coverage of this of the Infowars

1945
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,840
We are so blessed to be here

1946
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:02,400
No one has live coverage

1947
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:10,336
The debate was live it was broadcast live

1948
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:12,640
There's a number people who doing live coverage

1949
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:19,296
No just trying to get some money too we can do

1950
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:20,320
That that like

1951
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:26,976
I think he was in the first half-hour you know I think he was doing pretty good he's still one but not by much of the eye

1952
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:33,376
Look just say that he didn't do well

1953
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:34,656
Not buy as much

1954
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:38,496
Okay my team is down 16 points to the Jets

1955
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:44,896
But we're only winning by a little bit and then later you got to be more of an assholes and that excited

1956
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:47,200
I got to go to bed

1957
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:49,248
I'm tired of simple that's great analysis

1958
01:43:49,504 --> 01:43:55,648
That's a summation right there dance Alex comes in on the 30th

1959
01:43:55,904 --> 01:44:02,048
It's not really much going on quite frankly but Alex has now decided

1960
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:06,656
The Trump did great and there's a lot of people were saying that he did bad

1961
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:11,264
I either outright reason you were on the right well yeah maybe a mat drug type

1962
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:14,336
Hey man just never been in a debate

1963
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:20,736
When you're sitting in on your cell phone

1964
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:24,064
And you're 30 years old you're 40 years old

1965
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:26,112
34

1966
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:28,928
Chris Wallace

1967
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:33,024
Better

1968
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:36,352
I just know what it's

1969
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:39,168
I'm interrupting you

1970
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:42,496
Pretty much for that

1971
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:45,824
Presidential debate

1972
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:47,104
What people are

1973
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:50,432
Guitar

1974
01:44:56,576 --> 01:44:58,880
Like an adult

1975
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:05,280
Fluoride is not a good way to win debate it's definitely a good way to make people who don't book you on shows sound very

1976
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:07,328
Very sensible

1977
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:13,728
And bookings

1978
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:19,872
What would I like to do is whenever people bring me on their show I'd like to don't engage and acts like

1979
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:24,480
Their show doesn't matter to me if Alex Jones class

1980
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:26,528
And the whole thing was just like

1981
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:32,928
Exercises to make you louder

1982
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:35,488
Lalalala lalalala

1983
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:37,792
That's not cool

1984
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:42,400
Some people had some things today about Trump

1985
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:48,288
They're not they're not debating like Alex did with Piers Morgan or that guy in

1986
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:52,128
The UK where yelled at him about to do I screamed infowars.com

1987
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:56,992
Maybe look any criticism of trump is one thing

1988
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:59,296
Think about Biden bro

1989
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:04,416
He thinks he's better than

1990
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:07,232
Delaware

1991
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:09,024
Crooked Man

1992
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:11,584
And use people and steel

1993
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:14,400
Axillary

1994
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:18,752
Steak dinner

1995
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:20,032
You don't get fired

1996
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:21,056
Dollars

1997
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:23,360
Because you don't get a nickel

1998
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:28,224
Stop if you work for Trump you don't get paid

1999
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:33,856
That's true.

2000
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:37,440
Yeah I mean you should tip obviously but

2001
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:38,208
Kind of trivial

2002
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:40,000
Compared to

2003
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:42,816
What you see from that raving a****** Trump

2004
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:49,472
Dan Lyman from Europe Awards shuttle.

2005
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:50,752
Shooting on immigrants

2006
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:53,056
Just a little taste

2007
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:54,336
Literally

2008
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:57,408
And they basically work22 transport

2009
01:46:57,664 --> 01:46:58,176
Migrants

2010
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:03,552
Come in from other countries such as Afghanistan Iraq Iran Syria

2011
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:09,184
Into Europe and then the operation goes on from there to bring them down to Mainland Europe

2012
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:12,512
Al Jazeera

2013
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:18,400
Banana launch come on

2014
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:24,800
I think the plate last night had a couple of more drinks to kind of calm himself down

2015
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:25,824
Pop it up

2016
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:26,592
Alex

2017
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:28,896
It's dark in here on this episode about how like

2018
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:29,920
If he could

2019
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:31,200
He would run

2020
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:34,016
They run but there's nowhere on Earth you can't run from

2021
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:34,784
The globalist

2022
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:35,552
Cuz globe

2023
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:39,136
You know yeah that. All of it that does make sense

2024
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:44,000
And apparently his early career is meaningless

2025
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:45,280
It's coming

2026
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:46,304
It's coming fast

2027
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:47,840
Firefox

2028
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:51,168
50 years

2029
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:52,448
40 years

2030
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:07,040
Because when I was not as knowledgeable

2031
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:09,088
Well

2032
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:11,136
Will defeat the enemy will crush them

2033
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:11,904
In a fight

2034
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:18,048
There we go

2035
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:22,144
It's all a lot

2036
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:26,240
It's all a fraud it's all empty it's all pointless it's all stupid

2037
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:31,104
Don't you figure out other than entertain

2038
01:48:32,128 --> 01:48:32,640
Which real

2039
01:48:32,896 --> 01:48:34,176
Everything makes sense

2040
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:39,808
I mean I don't I don't agree with v there's a devil trying to ruin everybody's lives or any town

2041
01:48:40,064 --> 01:48:46,208
No issue with that conclusion but it

2042
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:52,608
Is when I was younger I thought I was doing something but I was actually fighting Shadows

2043
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:59,008
I would even draw your conclusion a little bit further along in your career perhaps all the way up until the present

2044
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:05,408
This devil of yours

2045
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:11,808
It's a shadow that you're going to have a tough time creating a bigger bad guy for seeing as there's

2046
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:18,208
You're already on the devil yeah what are you got

2047
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:20,000
Is over like season 1

2048
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:23,840
Your bad guy is Siler and he can take other people's powers

2049
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:30,240
These overpowered he is essentially infinitely powers

2050
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:32,288
Interesting cuz that guy

2051
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:36,384
Yeah so yeah it's Alex next season

2052
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:37,920
You've already fought

2053
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:39,200
The devil shadow

2054
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:41,248
I all I heard in that is just like

2055
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:43,808
I cannot learn

2056
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:45,088
Anythink

2057
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:46,880
Well I can keep escalated

2058
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:53,536
So we start off with fighting the the shadow that is that road in Texas

2059
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:59,936
How do you start fighting the shadow that is 911

2060
01:50:00,192 --> 01:50:06,336
Big shadow lady start fighting the shadow of what you imagine Obama is up to

2061
01:50:06,592 --> 01:50:09,664
A dictator who is going to send in troops to

2062
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:10,432
Plenty of

2063
01:50:10,688 --> 01:50:16,064
And you're right your guy Ron Paul was going to be who is going to take care of that shadow for everybody

2064
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:18,624
Because he knew about how to fight The Shadow

2065
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:19,392
It is

2066
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:25,536
The Federal Reserve all that business and then you accidentally start supporting Trump

2067
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:29,376
And you do that escalate Your Shadow

2068
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:32,704
Now Trump is in the seat of power that you were

2069
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:36,032
Yelling about you can't go back to local issues

2070
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:41,408
Abby and your primary focus like that road

2071
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:42,944
You have to escalate

2072
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:43,968
Now you have

2073
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:45,248
The Deep state

2074
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:46,784
Not least of which

2075
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:50,112
You have to know at least on some level

2076
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:52,416
The guy you think should be the king

2077
01:50:52,928 --> 01:50:57,792
Is himself worse than the Shadows that you have been fighting your entire career

2078
01:50:58,048 --> 01:50:59,584
Which is why your new shadow

2079
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:00,864
Has to be the

2080
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:01,888
Devil

2081
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:03,168
He is

2082
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:04,192
The literal

2083
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:08,288
Devil is the only thing worse than Donald Trump

2084
01:51:08,544 --> 01:51:13,408
Your enemy has to be the literal devil

2085
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:19,808
If there's like two pads that it's like like this is just the way his career has had to escalate like terms

2086
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:21,088
The recruit a bad guy is

2087
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:23,136
I meant simultaneously like

2088
01:51:23,392 --> 01:51:23,904
Yeah

2089
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:24,928
If it's a choice

2090
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:26,976
Between Trump or literal devil

2091
01:51:27,488 --> 01:51:29,792
I guess most people be like I guess Trump's just

2092
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:31,072
A dictator

2093
01:51:31,328 --> 01:51:33,888
And I like I guess I guess if that's snow.

2094
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:36,448
So far the devil seems way more fun

2095
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:42,848
He's got more interesting plans if he's got better s*** going on

2096
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:45,920
Its planes are terrible and none of them work of course I want

2097
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:47,712
Dialysis devil over drunk

2098
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:49,504
I'm comparing them to like

2099
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:55,392
The Pitchfork poking me

2100
01:51:55,648 --> 01:52:01,280
Take some calls and you disappointed

2101
01:52:02,304 --> 01:52:07,168
Trump didn't destroy the covid fraud or

2102
01:52:11,008 --> 01:52:14,336
The best job ever we whatever cuz I

2103
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:22,272
Why did he do that yesterday on stage why didn't he just come out and just

2104
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:30,464
Stock market

2105
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:35,584
Primal attack

2106
01:52:45,056 --> 01:52:46,080
We can be the attack dog

2107
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:48,896
Where is in some cases he can't

2108
01:52:50,176 --> 01:52:56,320
That's not what a surrogate mean

2109
01:52:56,576 --> 01:52:59,904
Also I would suggest that if the

2110
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:05,280
Two choices are crashing the dollar and the globalist plan to kill everyone

2111
01:53:05,536 --> 01:53:11,680
I got a crash that dollar is option number three the devil cuz so far he's

2112
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:15,008
Higher up on my list than I thought would have all very stupid

2113
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:21,408
Jim hoft from the Gateway pundit

2114
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:27,808
Just throw a brick through a window or something I got to make me a

2115
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:28,576
Fuc yourself

2116
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:33,696
Expose Joe Biden

2117
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:34,464
And

2118
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:36,512
And he absolutely

2119
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:39,072
Unhinged

2120
01:53:39,584 --> 01:53:40,096
Velux

2121
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:42,656
Flustered he was mean

2122
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:48,032
His his name calling was you know it subs hard

2123
01:53:48,544 --> 01:53:52,896
And and he also looks you know disheveled and

2124
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:59,296
So Jim hoft complaining or celebrating I guess that Trump exposed at Biden is mean and a

2125
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:00,064
Name caller

2126
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:01,600
Which is rich

2127
01:54:02,112 --> 01:54:04,672
That's pretty funny. I just

2128
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:05,696
It's just

2129
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:06,976
Do not

2130
01:54:07,232 --> 01:54:08,000
Just

2131
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:15,168
Know if your propaganda style is right the thing that your guy did and then switch out the names

2132
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:17,216
That's just that's just too much

2133
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:17,984
Search for me

2134
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:19,008
That's just too much

2135
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:25,408
Donald Trump being mean in a name caller is strategic Brilliance that's exactly what you need

2136
01:54:25,664 --> 01:54:28,992
An a****** and couldn't communicate clear thoughts

2137
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:32,064
Almost as if he were on some sort of drug

2138
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:34,880
Everything that they say is

2139
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:41,280
Can't deal with that I'll just put buying the name in there I feel so much nicer now

2140
01:54:41,536 --> 01:54:43,584
I don't know very comfortable with this

2141
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:44,864
Sorry

2142
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:50,240
We come to the end of debate Extravaganza 2020

2143
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:52,288
And

2144
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:53,312
I don't know

2145
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:56,128
Well I feel reassured

2146
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:57,408
I donate

2147
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:58,688
I'm overwhelmed

2148
01:54:58,944 --> 01:55:03,040
I'm honestly overwhelmed I mean about the real-world but also about looking at this like

2149
01:55:03,808 --> 01:55:05,856
I mean okay Owen Shroyer sucks

2150
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:12,256
That's not true that status quo absolutely on something sure

2151
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:13,792
Probably probably drunk

2152
01:55:14,048 --> 01:55:14,816
One way or the other

2153
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:19,424
And then either was acting like he was on Coke or was who knows

2154
01:55:20,448 --> 01:55:21,984
Super male Vitality who cares

2155
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:26,336
He was all over the place and really weird and

2156
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,920
Making fart noises during the debate that was pretty

2157
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:31,456
Right

2158
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:32,992
I don't know

2159
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:34,784
I don't know what it is

2160
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:37,088
I'm at a loss I'm at a loss

2161
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:38,624
I don't know what

2162
01:55:39,392 --> 01:55:41,184
For the first time in a very long time

2163
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:47,584
I don't know what's going on with this this was bewildering this is surreal

2164
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:51,680
Actually after I saw the picture of Lori Lightfoot wearing a costume

2165
01:55:52,192 --> 01:55:53,984
Lying to my face

2166
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:55,776
All day today

2167
01:55:56,800 --> 01:56:00,128
I'm just really starting to feel like all of you are f****** with me

2168
01:56:00,896 --> 01:56:05,504
Like this is where everyone is in on this I my conspiracies

2169
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:08,576
Go further than any look Global is f*** off

2170
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:14,976
Everyone you're one-hundred-percent this is me

2171
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:21,376
Manufactured to make a man lose his mind all seven and a half billion of you got together and we're like

2172
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:22,144
Like what if

2173
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:24,192
Jordan when insane

2174
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:26,752
That's the only thing that makes sense to me

2175
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:33,408
I was born in a cult with a prophecy to my name to make sense to me

2176
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:37,760
Why you might lean towards that conclusion but I'll assure you that

2177
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:44,416
Yeah you're right but even when you agree with me

2178
01:56:44,672 --> 01:56:45,696
Right

2179
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:52,352
I don't know I look for clarity hopefully to to set in over the weekend and we will

2180
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:53,376
We'll see

2181
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:59,776
Let's take some calls to voicemail

2182
01:57:00,032 --> 01:57:00,544
Love it

2183
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:09,248
Hi Troy

2184
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:12,320
I guess I have

2185
01:57:15,136 --> 01:57:15,648
Tangential

2186
01:57:19,232 --> 01:57:19,744
Slightly less

2187
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:27,936
So

2188
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:28,960
AR

2189
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:44,320
And

2190
01:57:45,344 --> 01:57:45,856
Translator

2191
01:57:54,304 --> 01:57:54,816
And

2192
01:57:58,144 --> 01:57:58,656
Bever

2193
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:09,664
He plays

2194
01:58:21,696 --> 01:58:22,720
Pretty good

2195
01:58:27,328 --> 01:58:27,840
Acting

2196
01:58:37,312 --> 01:58:37,824
Mine

2197
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:39,872
Choreographer

2198
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:43,712
He was also

2199
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:50,880
Menlo

2200
01:58:51,648 --> 01:58:52,160

2201
01:58:56,256 --> 01:58:56,768
Fairy

2202
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:57,792
Maybe

2203
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:06,496
Fascinating but unfortunately he hit The 2-minute One

2204
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:12,896
I didn't know this until like I heard some calls that hit the 2-minute barking

2205
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:19,552
Live limit I didn't set that it's just a Skype thing I guess the option to re-record your message

2206
01:59:19,808 --> 01:59:25,952
You can call back in okay I apologized

2207
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:31,328
Important information I really appreciate

2208
01:59:31,584 --> 01:59:32,608
Call

2209
01:59:50,784 --> 01:59:51,296
Anyway

2210
01:59:52,576 --> 01:59:58,720
Goodbye YouTube

2211
01:59:58,976 --> 02:00:01,280
Should be sad that there is a British person

2212
02:00:01,536 --> 02:00:07,680
Who as the outgoing messages record one and

2213
02:00:07,936 --> 02:00:09,984
I don't have the time

2214
02:00:10,496 --> 02:00:16,640
Also a lot of a lot of messages will end up starting with

2215
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:23,040
Mr. t What You Know friend of the show Mike Wiley used to have a GPS that he always had the MR2

2216
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:29,440
Mr. T voice on at every time a cameo

2217
02:00:29,696 --> 02:00:31,232
Do that on Maps

2218
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:32,768
Danny Jordan

2219
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:34,048
Hope everything's going well

2220
02:00:36,096 --> 02:00:36,608
Highway right now

2221
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:49,920
Hi Matt

2222
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:51,456
Illume

2223
02:00:51,968 --> 02:00:52,480
Eastern Washington

2224

Flipper blue and

2225
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:00,160
Make me laugh

2226
02:01:00,928 --> 02:01:01,440
You guys have

2227
02:01:02,208 --> 02:01:02,720
Quick Quack

2228
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:04,512
Play no man

2229
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:06,304
Feedback on it

Also

2232
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:12,448
I just pulled

2233
02:01:12,704 --> 02:01:13,216
Zucchini

2234
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:14,240
Out of my garden

2235
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:16,544
F****** Wild

2236
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:17,824
Picture later if you'd like

2237
02:01:18,592 --> 02:01:19,104
Alright hope

2238
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:20,384
Things are going well

2239
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:22,176
Take care

2240
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:27,808
I do not need a zucchini picture I have, I applaud you and your gardening

2241
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:34,208
I will say I have never played no man's sky but and I don't know anything about it but it is a name that I've heard people talk real

2242
02:01:34,464 --> 02:01:36,768
I don't know

2243
02:01:37,024 --> 02:01:40,864
I don't know what type of game it is I don't know what it's on

2244
02:01:41,376 --> 02:01:42,400
I have no idea

2245
02:01:42,656 --> 02:01:45,472
I've heard a lot about I've read a lot about it

2246
02:01:45,728 --> 02:01:51,872
Very it seems too intimidating to make because it has no man's sky

2247
02:01:52,128 --> 02:01:52,896
Is that it's like infidel

2248
02:01:53,408 --> 02:01:58,528
I like 80 itself creates a world for it so you can go around and you travel and

2249
02:01:58,784 --> 02:02:04,928
Like one of the reasons that it had such a rough launch was because you couldn't meet any other players be

2250
02:02:05,184 --> 02:02:06,720
Because you are in an infinite universe

2251
02:02:07,488 --> 02:02:11,328
So you would just roll around the f****** stars finding all kinds of weird s***

2252
02:02:11,584 --> 02:02:17,728
I'll be right back so I don't know Eve online it's not like

2253
02:02:17,984 --> 02:02:21,568
Gameplay-wise I don't mind

2254
02:02:21,824 --> 02:02:23,104
It's like an intense

2255
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:27,712
Like Universe unto itself and it's just intimidating to me and I can't

2256
02:02:27,968 --> 02:02:31,040
I can't jump in on it it's not something that you can dip your toe into

2257
02:02:31,296 --> 02:02:32,832
You know

2258
02:02:34,368 --> 02:02:34,880
Pronounced

2259
02:02:37,952 --> 02:02:38,464
Damn

2260
02:02:48,448 --> 02:02:51,520
Easy mistake to make we're not talkin about crackers like a wreck

2261
02:02:51,776 --> 02:02:53,056
Swimming about a quokka

2262
02:02:53,312 --> 02:02:56,384
That's that's it that's it

2263
02:02:56,640 --> 02:03:02,784
That's an interesting breathy tone for for this up and put them into soup

2264
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:05,856
That's what you doing

2265
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:06,880
Guaca guaca

2266
02:03:07,904 --> 02:03:08,672
Dan

2267
02:03:08,928 --> 02:03:09,696

Something great by the way

2283
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:49,120

Love you man. Thank you for helping out

2285

But here's what I'm going to do

2290
02:04:05,504 --> 02:04:06,784

Imagine that is the new city

2315
02:05:13,856 --> 02:05:15,648
Divide if

2316
02:05:15,904 --> 02:05:22,048
The world is suddenly populated by you and my plants and

2317
02:05:24,352 --> 02:05:29,216
We are the loud ones so tempted

2318
02:05:29,472 --> 02:05:32,032
To explore this but I also feel like

2319
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:35,104
I can't but then the alternative is a day Anna Lorraine book

2320
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:38,688
I don't know what to do it's very I think we have to become chimeras

2321
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:45,344
I think I've talked to my therapist about this we got to repopulate the earth when everybody's gone man what's with this next call I got

Hey guys

2327
02:06:02,752 --> 02:06:03,520
So I was in

2328
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:05,056
The Urgent Care reset

2329
02:06:05,312 --> 02:06:06,080
The Lakers I got like

2330
02:06:06,336 --> 02:06:07,104
Pattaya raccoon

2331
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:08,128
Well saving

Crimson.

2333
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:12,992
And while I was there I remember that they were putting like

2334
02:06:13,504 --> 02:06:14,528
Hydrogen peroxide on the

2335
02:06:14,784 --> 02:06:16,320
And I remember that whole thing

2336
02:06:16,832 --> 02:06:17,600

I got to get it

2348

Tricking people dog dr. Mercola

2351
02:06:51,392 --> 02:06:54,720
No good no matter what I just

2352
02:06:55,232 --> 02:07:01,376
Good good to hear that someone did that

2353
02:07:01,632 --> 02:07:05,728
I want from that is just to look on the face of a medical professional as they hear that

2354
02:07:05,984 --> 02:07:10,592
Only slow over the realization that you are not

2355
02:07:10,848 --> 02:07:15,968
Joking that this conversation is in fact happening

2356
02:07:16,224 --> 02:07:22,368
What did I do with my life app I went to nursing school got two kids

2357
02:07:22,624 --> 02:07:26,464
Husband through college in hydrogen peroxide

2358
02:07:27,744 --> 02:07:28,768
Hayden Jordan

2359
02:07:31,328 --> 02:07:33,376
Glycerin big fan from

2360
02:07:34,656 --> 02:07:38,496
You know the state where else

2361
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:39,776
And wishes

2362
02:07:40,288 --> 02:07:44,384
He was the horse she was riding on and then I got mad at his son for

2363
02:07:46,432 --> 02:07:47,456
Miserable

2364
02:07:47,712 --> 02:07:48,224
Anyway

2365
02:07:50,272 --> 02:07:52,320
Don't have a lot of fun to listen to

2366
02:07:52,576 --> 02:07:55,136
Podcast on muesli relaying information about

2367
02:07:56,416 --> 02:07:56,928
Itsfunneh

2368
02:07:57,440 --> 02:08:00,000
And tell me what comes up on summertime talk about dannemora

2369
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:04,096
KERO one of those guys is that

2370
02:08:04,864 --> 02:08:06,912
They just say it's a grifter grifters

2371
02:08:08,704 --> 02:08:13,056
For money and whatever

2372
02:08:13,312 --> 02:08:14,080
I always

2373
02:08:14,336 --> 02:08:16,640
I personally feel like that's a little

2374
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:20,736
Dismissive and I think it undermines the

2375
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:23,296
Seriousness of what those

2376
02:08:23,552 --> 02:08:24,064
People doing

2377
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:26,624
Stay in the problems that it caused

2378
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:27,392
Just wondering if

2379
02:08:27,648 --> 02:08:28,672
You guys had to take on

2380
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:30,720
Thank you love

2381
02:08:31,232 --> 02:08:32,768
Yeah I think

2382
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:41,472
Yeah the question of whether or not people are shills or grifting or whatever is

2383
02:08:41,728 --> 02:08:46,080
It's it's a it's a matter it it matters a real question

2384
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:48,384
No Kizzy

2385
02:08:49,152 --> 02:08:50,176
I think you approach

2386
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:53,760
Grifting and ideology ideological step a little bit

2387
02:08:54,016 --> 02:08:56,576
Currently in terms of how you might want to respond to it

2388
02:08:57,088 --> 02:09:03,232
But at the end of the day it doesn't really matter in terms of the consequences and the effect that

2389
02:09:03,488 --> 02:09:04,512
Somebody has

2390
02:09:05,024 --> 02:09:08,864
If you take this

2391
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:09,632
The

2392
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:11,680
Make a Koch brothers paying

2393
02:09:11,936 --> 02:09:12,704
People

2394
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:13,984
To promote X

2395
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:15,008
Like

2396
02:09:15,264 --> 02:09:17,312
They would only be paying that

2397
02:09:17,568 --> 02:09:19,872
But if it was effective and there was

2398
02:09:20,128 --> 02:09:23,968
Some sort of a policy or societal goal right that further

2399
02:09:24,224 --> 02:09:27,296
And that's kind of what's more important than whether or not someone's beliefs are so

2400
02:09:27,552 --> 02:09:28,064
Sincere

2401
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:30,368
It's always an interesting question because I get

2402
02:09:30,624 --> 02:09:34,720
Especially with listening to Alex like it's almost impossible to believe that he believed the ship

2403
02:09:34,976 --> 02:09:35,744
Right

2404
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:42,144
It's about always becomes very very interesting we like you making up that you believe in the devil Roar

2405
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:42,912
Actually

2406
02:09:43,424 --> 02:09:44,448
Something you believe

2407
02:09:44,704 --> 02:09:48,800
But at the end of the day the effect it has on the audience is really with more important

2408
02:09:49,312 --> 02:09:50,848
And trying to

2409
02:09:52,128 --> 02:09:53,664
Avert whatever damage

2410
02:09:54,176 --> 02:09:56,736
Can be caused by sincere or Griff

2411
02:09:57,248 --> 02:09:58,528
Propaganda

2412
02:09:58,784 --> 02:10:00,064
I mean I think

2413
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:02,368
One thing to always keep in mind is that

2414
02:10:03,136 --> 02:10:03,648
The Griff

2415
02:10:04,416 --> 02:10:05,184
Attract

2416
02:10:05,696 --> 02:10:06,720
Psychopathic

2417
02:10:06,976 --> 02:10:08,000
Monsters

2418
02:10:08,512 --> 02:10:09,280
You know like

2419
02:10:09,536 --> 02:10:15,680
You do have to remember that if you are grifting people you are essentially stealing their money and giving them nothing but

2420
02:10:15,936 --> 02:10:16,704
False hope and return

2421
02:10:17,472 --> 02:10:21,568
So so you have to then remember that the people who are on this graph

2422
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:23,616
Are 100%

2423
02:10:23,872 --> 02:10:24,384
4

2424
02:10:24,896 --> 02:10:31,040
Stealing people and giving nothing back so we are not they believe there

2425
02:10:31,296 --> 02:10:33,600
The current bulshit spewing from their mouth

2426
02:10:33,856 --> 02:10:34,624
That's who they are

2427
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:36,416
Yeah it's it's

2428
02:10:36,672 --> 02:10:37,696
It's important

2429
02:10:37,952 --> 02:10:40,512
I have a question but I think it's not the central question

2430
02:10:41,024 --> 02:10:42,304
I think that

2431
02:10:42,816 --> 02:10:44,608
Sincere or not

2432
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:49,216
These things need to be taken totally High seriously because of the effect right

2433
02:10:49,472 --> 02:10:52,032
Consequentialist to an extent by

2434
02:10:52,288 --> 02:10:55,872
It's not wrong to

2435
02:10:56,128 --> 02:10:58,432
Dwell right

2436
02:10:58,688 --> 02:11:01,248
Consider whether or not someone's running a scam sure

2437
02:11:01,504 --> 02:11:03,040
It's just not a reason to

2438
02:11:03,296 --> 02:11:09,440
Doug throw out whatever they're saying as meeting with

2439
