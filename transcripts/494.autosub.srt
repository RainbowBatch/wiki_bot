1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,304
Alex Jones

6
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,376
We are Dan Jordan

7
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,192
I've got it all right

8
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,776
My bright spot today Jordan is the word of the day

9
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,056
Oki word

10
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,592
Is forgiveness forgive

11
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,920
Alright I'm very hard on myself as very

12
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,968
Difficult for me to forgive myself

13
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,552
I let things go with other people a lot

14
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,368
More easily absolutely there's a middle ground

15
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,648
And that is cats

16
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:35,488
No I don't forget that

17
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,256
What about the Susa

18
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,536
I do forgive that

19
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:42,400
I've had to deal with resentment towards Celine my cat

20
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,704
For the better part of a couple days

21
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:45,984
Zion

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,312
I've reached the stage of forgiveness she can be a pill

23
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,592
Yeah yeah

24
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,128
I had

25
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,432
The room where I was growing some plants

26
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,528
Date setups

27
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,576
Yeah

28
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,648
And it was working pretty well between crafty

29
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,488
And so I woke up one morning and she had

30
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,512
Completely Des

31
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,072
Destroyed my pinto bean plant

32
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:17,472
And I was really mad about that cuz if they were coming along really nicely they look good and I thought it was really cool the process

33
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:21,312
Growing

34
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:22,848
You destroyed them

35
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:26,432
I thought that it was very cool that a pinto bean was growing

36
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:30,784
Express

37
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,552
True

38
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:35,136
I was pretty infuriated

39
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,672
Forgiveness

40
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,464
I understand that you didn't do it

41
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,488
B2B mean

42
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,256
No

43
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,048
Although maybe she

44
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,424
Yeah the attention I was given to these plants might be

45
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,472
Draws her ire

46
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,240
Starfall

47
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,568
I forgive you Celine Wherever You Are

48
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:57,408
You know danitsa it's better

49
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,176
Sweet spot

50
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:02,016
In some ways I met right song

51
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:08,416
It's no big my bright spot is very much

52
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,440
Related to

53
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:13,024
No keep saying it I want to try.

54
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:18,144
Cantaloupe

55
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,960
Time and I did a really good job well

56
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,496
It was going great

57
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,056
And then the first Frost took it out

58
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,104
Photo

59
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,504
It's sad because I was actually really trying to keep this one alive to my normal standoffish

60
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,272
Major towards plan

61
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,832
As you know I'm not a fan of the out-of-doors

62
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:40,160
That is true I don't know how to describe it as stand-offish

63
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:46,560
That seems like a little bit weird like you have a brisket

64
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:52,960
Care for them and their kinds of them and say all kinds of words to them and I very much want them to give me their approval how about that

65
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:59,360
Wow

66
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,408
The one-sided relationship

67
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:04,992
Plants could stand to be polite or to you I'll go with you

68
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:10,880
Well I'm sorry I'm sorry to hear about this I was partially invested in your

69
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,160
108

70
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,583
Stood longer than any plant that I've ever taken care of before and it's giving me like a nurturing towards plants that I didn't

71
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,143
Assertive progress

72
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
Progress

73
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:29,311
Forgiveness in progress

74
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:36,991
October 19th 2020

75
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,271
That was Monday

76
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,807
Monday Monday Monday

77
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,879
Tell most people start the week

78
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:48,255
And this this is a this is an interesting showing

79
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,535
Going today

80
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,815
I don't know

81
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:55,423
You shall listen to a bit of Alex's

82
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,703
In the recent past

83
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,263
And so much of it is just about Hunter Biden

84
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,287
And his laptop

85
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,567
And then

86
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,639
Weird conspiracies about Heather's videos

87
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:11,295
Of him torturing children the on the laptop which has been used to blackmail him and Joe Biden

88
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,087
Why not

89
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,111
Very little patience

90
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,903
For this storyline

91
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:22,303
The gate all over I'm really appreciating how the mainstream media seems to

92
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,327
Kind of been like

93
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,887
Not going to go with us

94
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,959
Let's see how this goes right-wing lunatic

95
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:33,823
But later in the story into they're covering it up

96
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,383
I find very little interest

97
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,991
And watching Alex go down those other things

98
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
2

99
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:49,439
To fill-in-the-blanks it wasn't just Alex talking about that laptop otherwise I don't know what I would have done

100
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,719
Very little address

101
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,535
Today's we get a visit

102
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,303
From

103
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,583
The surviving

104
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,863
Champion weirdo

105
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,887
Alex's

106
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,655
Is Click

107
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,935
What is the vagina

108
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:04,799
She shows up to give some words of wisdom

109
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,847
I guarantee you

110
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,639
You could never predict

111
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,735
What is solution to big tax I never would try

112
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:18,367
I've learned my lesson with pechenik he takes wings that I find heretofore unimaginable

113
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:25,279
Maybe we should make Melania Queen take

114
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:29,375
Mmm like in the ethers when you're capable

115
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,655
Can happen

116
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,983
Is the red wedding every single day

117
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,263
Anything can happen

118
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,175
To sign up for sports

119
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:46,527
First I just got out of rehab

120
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:53,183
I just got to rehab good luck Nikki

121
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,743

00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,895
I love it John Carlos Stanton

127
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,711
Mega Ball Millions

128
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,015
Jeremy m

129
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,767
Blue cheese yak

130
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,559
Thank you so much you are

131
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
Technocrat

132
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,359
Money off that heroin

133
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,967
Freakishly large

134
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,623
Thank you so much effort easyacc

135
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,975
Website.com

136
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:02,559
What you could do is

137
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:07,679
Take that generous spirits that you were given from your close friend maybe even your bed

138
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,703
Best friend take it home

139
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,727
Waterous

140
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,007
Feed it

141
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,287
This is gibbet

142
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,055
Light

143
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:17,407
All of those things you need to grow up and make sure that you

144
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,943
You take that generosity

145
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
To a local bail fund

146
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,503
Or charity

147
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,087
Before the first Frost otherwise it will die

148
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,367
And will leave you deaf

149
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,671
Attitude and lonely bittersweet

150
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,487
Sweet

151
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,047
October 19th

152
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,607
I will say Alex

153
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
He's not

154
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,215
Singularly focusing on the laptop

155
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:44,031
Quite a bit about it

156
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,823
Laptop

157
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:50,943
And the big Revelations of Hunter and and not just hookers and not just sex and not just cracking not to

158
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,967
Just math

159
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,247
Doing illegal things

160
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
Underage

161
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,599
Portland beating

162
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,135
Little Chinese girls

163
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
It's part of him

164
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
Initiation

165
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
Enter the time

166
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,839
Does everyone have to do that

167
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,167
Apparently

168
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:16,799
Yeah I don't know I could Alex has a very strong burden

169
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,127
Yeah here and I'm just

170
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,199
Story about this

171
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
Now

172
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
Here's a thing about

173
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,879
From what I've seen you could just go with like

174
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,415
What they are

175
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
Lying about

176
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:39,327
You don't have to then escalate it to Heights that are just

177
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,119
Silly

178
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,655
Jordan

179
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:49,311
Something is it worked last time even then it's like you can believe Hillary Clinton

180
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,639
Does that I don't know

181
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,735
I don't quite understand what the the

182
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
The deal is

183
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,551
I also think there's a real

184
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,575
Miscalculation

185
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,879
Just strategically

186
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,415
I whip with a way Alex

187
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,463
Does playing this game with the election

188
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,487
Because I mean

189
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:15,167
The pole and they were saying is accurate and that has a pretty solid lead will win

190
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:18,751
But I don't exclude the possibility that Trump could win again

191
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,799
Then what

192
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,359
The devil do you think I'm going to win

193
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:30,527
Trump is obviously going to win with 97% of the vote and that's how you know it's a free and fair election

194
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:36,415
And I don't understand this pulling the people or do I just think he's backing himself into this weird space where it's like alright

195
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,975
If you lose then

196
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:45,375
Do is start shooting right I'm not like the devil has just taken out

197
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,495
How potent is the devil's threat

198
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:56,383
Electorally

199
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
What does

200
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,831
I just don't I don't do that that's what a lot of people don't know about the fall

201
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:11,231
Is it the devil just lost re-election is God in the devil running for God

202
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,559
Extinguish the devil's torch

203
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:18,143
It's just it's just a simple big deal out of

204
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,191
Beelzebub

205
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,471
The tribe has spoken

206
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:27,871
Whatever God was elected the center-right took Park

207
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,759
I just want to bring light to the people

208
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
We are out of here

209
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:42,719
God has an alliance with gaea and they voted the devil or something I don't know

210
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,023
The devil lock the election

211
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,351
I don't know I think it's a bad move

212
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,887
I am but I do just

213
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,191
See shades of the last election

214
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,007
Some of those washed over strategies

215
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,567
Intel

216
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,103
Proof is presented otherwise

217
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:05,503
That's kind of the the ballpark I'm living at look like we're living through is like that

218
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,271
I'm going

219
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,551
Will it work

220
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:11,135
Last time and then looking around and everybody was seeing them

221
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,927
Like a little bit different

222
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,207
There they've learned

223
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:19,071
It is it is almost heartwarming to see that there is a small percentage of the population that is

224
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,351
Still capable of love

225
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,631
It's nice

226
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,655
It's nice

227
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,191
Alex

228
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,263
She doesn't she doesn't read

229
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,799
And it becomes very clear

230
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,895
And it goes on from there Sweden to start lockdown

231
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,431
Has the world 12

232
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,711
Highest covid-19

233
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
Yes right

234
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,271
Totally made-up Darvocet

235
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
In Europe

236
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:46,207
Alex accidentally read that headline did never spend for it to just head tonight

237
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:52,095
Play I disagree with it by going to end

238
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,631
He started it it was fascinated

239
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:03,871
Do you think every time we read headlines when he's off the air he has that rollercoaster ride of like

240
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,455
If he does I understand not reading

241
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,991
Yeah

242
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,039
Very intense

243
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:16,415
Exhausting day

244
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,463
Damn so we know that Alex likes

245
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,255
Thomas Jefferson quote

246
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,047
But here we get another quote

247
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
From a different person

248
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,631
Real

249
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
It's not all day

250
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:32,799
Trump knows he's going to win the election and this is now instead of

251
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:41,247
The threat is real

252
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:47,647
Waging War on corruption Alex Jones coming to you live from

253
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:59,167
The global Master Bank the genetic engineers

254
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,983
All the left devil worshippers worldwide

255
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,543
Radical Islam aligned with them

256
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
When they're great generals

257
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,127
Income and

258
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,455
Fusing together through a world fashion system

259
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
All these disparate groups into a giant

260
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,807
Got to destroy what's left

261
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,367
Only our slumber

262
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,391
Powers the devil

263
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,415
We must away

264
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
Born again

265
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,487
This is why is show sucks

266
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:28,607
And that's why they even go back to February 20th

267
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,143
16 episode where it's like

268
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:36,287
There's no devil

269
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,335
It is really annoying

270
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:43,199
It's really hard really hard to remember that I'm supposed to take Sarah

271
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:49,599
16 we are taking his political Viewpoint seriously exercise

272
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,879
On their own level

273
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,719
Approaching it from the position of is it possible to take food

274
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,303
Yeah there's Merit to almost always

275
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,887
Now it's almost impossible to pay that way it's literally

276
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:05,215
Like even for me to engage with him on

277
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
Possible

278
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,031
Ivan presupposed

279
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,055
Is that the devil is real

280
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,591
Right and then

281
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:17,247
Based on the plans that he says the devil has thousands of years back

282
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
Intent of

283
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,087
The devil

284
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,647
In biblical times

285
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,695
That's it it said it's your devil he had a plan

286
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,023
And the devil's play metal around

287
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,327
Yeah poke people's head for his

288
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,631
Create a really really hot

289
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
Resort

290
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935
Give me so high

291
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:39,775
Miserable Resort

292
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,591
The dropout rate

293
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,127
Then

294
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,919
The culmination of his plan is

295
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:49,247
Joe Biden running

296
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,623
It's hard to imagine that like

297
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,927
I know back in the days like the prophet

298
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,743
So now you know the Old Testament that be like

299
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,327
Yes the devil the greatest trick he's trying to pull off his

300
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
Center-right

301
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,959
Presidency

302
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:13,055
You get back to the the problem with making your enemy enemy imaginary

303
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,383
Is then the limit of your enemy are your own imagine

304
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:20,479
So what you accidentally reveal is how little you are capable of Imagine

305
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,759
Things like I am

306
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,039
Not afraid of this.

307
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,599
No the devil that I am afraid of

308
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,415
Powers beyond what I can even imagine

309
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,719
Simply because I imagined him to

310
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,487
You have those power

311
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,511
Not

312
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,535
Getting Joe Biden

313
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:37,887
Any devil that's worth being afraid of you can't be

314
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,679
Exactly

315
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703
It's the death

316
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,263
Turn off

317
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,823
Win against Eternal with

318
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,591
Joe Biden

319
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,663
Then there's nothing

320
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:55,039
Tramadol at The Ballot Box

321
00:16:55,551 --> 00:17:01,695
That's not a great day.

322
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,023
That's not a stalling quote

323
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,327
Stalin

324
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,607
It was a

325
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,447
Something very close to it was attributed to Stalin in

326
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,239
His secretaries memoir

327
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
Doesn't come out

328
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,055
Until quite a while later

329
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,103
And their existing

330
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,895
Formulations of this quote

331
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,943
They predate Stalin being

332
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
Manpower

333
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:27,039
And so I know that's just one of those fun anti-communist

334
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,831
Ism's that Alex throws around

335
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,623
I imagine that that

336
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:34,207
Sentiment has been around since like the 3rd election in Greece

337
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,743
Where somebody was like

338
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,047
Holding that motherfuker

339
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,423
That I wouldn't doubt

340
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,983
Something similar to that

341
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:50,847
I think that this next clip really sums up Alex's show if you just imagine

342
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:55,199
In the background of this quote there is a devil there's a literal

343
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,039
You're the moment

344
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,063
I'll start taking some calls

345
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,367
I got cute covid-19

346
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,903
That's got to be hit

347
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
So far

348
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,303
This segment all about me

349
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,095
Which I don't do on purpose

350
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:15,679
That to me is like

351
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,287
Yeah

352
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
It should be

353
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:26,943
Yeah that to me is like that's really distilled Alex

354
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,247
I'm sure there's a lot of big news

355
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:34,111
Two calls but that segment and I'm not going to take any responsibility for any

356
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:44,095
Censored online

357
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,143
Example of

358
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
Somebody who has

359
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,495
Has become of being kicked off

360
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,543
Facebook maybe Twitter

361
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
I'm not sure

362
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,359
You wake up in a totalitarian

363
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,175
Facebook user Jamie Allman

364
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,623
Does it take

365
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,695
I don't I don't know exactly what's going on with this situation

366
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:15,583
But Jamie Allman is a St Louis media figure who is no stranger to having his social media accounts locked

367
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:19,679
In 2018 Twitter temporarily suspended his account after he tweeted quotes

368
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:23,263
I've been hanging out getting ready to ram a hot poker up David Hogs

369
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
Ask tomorrow

370
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,079
Ha the st. Louis Post

371
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,359
Dispatch reported quote

372
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,663
The context for his comment was unclear

373
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:35,807
In the Fallout from this bizarre Threat all then lost a ton of sponsors on his radio shows

374
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,343
Ultimately led to him losing

375
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,135
Listen to St Louis media jobs

376
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,207
Then because you got a million chances in life

377
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,511
A conservative who's willing say horrible things

378
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,583
Holman was hired back in 2019 to morning radio

379
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:52,447
In April of this year nbc5 in St Louis investigated a leaking of

380
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,007
The personal information of hundreds of City residents

381
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,311
Hoots admitted tips about businesses not falling

382
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,615
Following covid-19 related help guide

383
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,687
Approximately 900 people at Golden tips

384
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,223
Under the condition of anonymity

385
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,759
According to the report quote

386
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,551
Someone reporting their bosses

387
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:13,439
These archetypes are technically public records so they are not they're not really they're not really

388
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,463
Automatically

389
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,487
But they are subject

390
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,511
The sunshine laws

391
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:22,911
Sure which Jamie Allman use to Doc's the St Louis residence on his radio show and on social media labeling them

392
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,191
Midgets

393
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,495
I mean

394
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,775
I don't disagree with

395
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,799
The characterization

396
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,567
Snitches

397
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
They are snitch

398
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,895
On the other hand

399
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
He can go f***

400
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:38,783
What a giant piece of s*** there's no reason to be a good person

401
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,063
Didn't you got this

402
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,087
F***** like

403
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:47,743
Roving around trying to scoop up any information Ikeda destroy you

404
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,303
Poker up a shooting a school shooting survivors ass

405
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,655
I got fired and then I got another job in the same field

406
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,471
Why should he ever have any fear of like

407
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,519
Any lingering lasting

408
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,335
I also why if you've hired him

409
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:06,687
Do you not immediately like knock on his door anytime anything goes wrong

410
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:11,551
Play Somebody leaked this information

411
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,599
He's leaving through the window

412
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:20,000
I've no idea what the deal is with his account getting locked this time but I'm not going to believe the version that's being pushed by Gateway pundit

413
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,024
That he just post

414
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,584
Video of black Trump supporters and it got shut down

415
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,656
I'm certain that there's more to this story

416
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,496
Don't care what a conservative troll did and is now poor

417
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:34,592
He didn't do good call and order to feign victimhood

418
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,128
So anyway

419
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:36,896
Jamie Allman

420
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:37,920
Another

421
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:41,248
Alex's pretending he's not like some right-wing media figure

422
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:45,600
Regional and Alex doesn't really give a f*** about Missouri so

423
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,880
That makes sense

424
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,416
He wouldn't know any

425
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:51,232
Anything about him he's not some private citizen

426
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,512
Is private

427
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,560
But he's also a media figure

428
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,096
Anyway

429
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,120
Alex

430
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,424
Gone on the record

431
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,960
And said that

432
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,520
The false flag

433
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,288
Admission

434
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,080
Malicious

435
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:09,920
Yes we were planning to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer

436
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,480
Alex has been

437
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,552
Media Matters George soros's group

438
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,088
This is Denise

439
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,112
12

440
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,136
2 weeks ago

441
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,184
Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones

442
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,464
Kidnapping plot against

443
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,256
Michigan Governor Whitmer a false flag

444
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,280
The Deep state

445
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,304
Shut up

446
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,096
FBI informants I predicted

447
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,912
Probably

448
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
2 of

449
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,472
Of the top people probably

450
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,520
2 out of 10 at work

451
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,056
And yes it was a lead

452
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,592
Buy to FBI office

453
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:40,896
Court documents

454
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,176
Exactly what I said

455
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,200
Which is because I know

456
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,736
It's not good

457
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,760
Confirm the court document

458
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,648
Adore

459
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,256
Of course they are

460
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:59,328
Put it in court and then everybody knows that means it's true

461
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:02,400
I think that you know we need to see how these things play out more in

462
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,448
Information about specifics

463
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:08,288
Is needed for me to make a stronger

464
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,616
Telling of what happened

465
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,456
Everything I can tell it looks like there were some militia people who are

466
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:19,296
Notoriously not careful informant

467
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,088
Who were infiltrated

468
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,904
Kidnapping

469
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
Northam

470
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,696
In witmer

471
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:27,744
And they got arrested it

472
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,840
And of course is that were the situation your defensive be like they set us up

473
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,888
The only angle you have

474
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,936
Cuz there's like recordings and

475
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:39,520
Open text messages

476
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
I mean it's

477
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,104
Look the FBI has setup

478
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,992
Counterterrorism strategy is fine people who maybe might want to think about doing something and then like

479
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,784
Put him as hard as I can towards

480
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,600
Causing terrorism and then be like

481
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:54,880
Like that's kind of

482
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,672
One thing they do but with

483
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
With these guys

484
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,512
You can just walk up to it you know you

485
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,840
Google 4chan and then you've infiltrated six of these militia

486
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:09,728
I'm not saying that police enforcement don't do that cuz obviously there

487
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,008
Sentence of that

488
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:16,128
It's just as lazy to assume that they always do that Shore as it is

489
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,152
Is to assume they

490
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:22,016
Don't know about the existing

491
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:22,784
Sensitive

492
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,064
Those sorts of

493
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,344
Because

494
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:26,880
Those are outliers

495
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,440
I don't know

496
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:33,024
Again one of the reasons why I feel like we need more information

497
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,792
When is because of the

498
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:38,400
It's fairly unclear but from everything I can

499
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,168
Intel

500
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,192
It's not a bunch

501
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
Besides

502
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,728
Setting up

503
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,496
Ribault

504
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,288
Here's Alex's

505
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,824
Is clip of himself

506
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,104
From the past

507
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,128
Predicting

508
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,528
That this was a setup I told you so

509
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,856
And what other false flags are we going to see

510
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,928
Definitely

511
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,048
What do you do when your house again

512
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,960
Grab the power to kill what other folks with suicides are

513
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,544
Covid patients are well

514
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:25,248
Wait so you're in favor of kidnapping her

515
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:29,088
The kidnappers swag but also she should have been

516
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,904
Somehow he's like yeah it's a f******

517
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,696
False flag I wish it weren't

518
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:38,048
Yeah but also a militia does need to incarcerate

519
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:44,192
What did something I totally would want my people to do but in this circumstance

520
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:48,032
Is a false flag because they did and it didn't work

521
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,664
Sad facts

522
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,688
The feds must be

523
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,224
Cool

524
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,504
Patriot would get busted his

525
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,528
As if they've already kid

526
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:01,856
Was very strange in terms of like

527
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,416
Here's my gotcha

528
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,536
Saying it's definitely probably a false why should I do that

529
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,840
Definitely probably get mad being like

530
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:15,424
Yeah but come on

531
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,192
Hey alright

532
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,472
Anyway I'll expect

533
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:21,312
Present-day here is a battle between good and evil

534
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,336
That's what's important.

535
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,104
Understand

536
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,896
Other good people meet

537
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,176
The people at

538
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,224
Computer shop

539
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,040
It's a war between Good and Evil

540
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,576
Omni-channel

541
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:38,208
Hulu

542
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,304
Only runs for 12 days

543
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:46,144
Last year was very successful it is

544
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,192
Here today

545
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,824
Black Friday in October

546
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,968
Black Friday in October 1st at Christmas in July we got Black Friday

547
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,016
I think he's forgetting the reason for this

548
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,320
I don't think

549
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:08,160
See I understand Christmas in July cuz it's like urx bonds

550
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,464
Convert 8

551
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,536
Christmas image

552
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,584
Black Friday's

553
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,376
The day after Thanksgiving

554
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,216
October's pretty close to Thanksgiving

555
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:21,984
B forever away

556
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,520
It's too close

557
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,592
What are you going to do a Black Friday ad

558
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:31,968
April know you're going to do a Black Friday in November and in October NASCAR

559
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:37,856
It's too much Black Friday and do you know why you can't do Halloween

560
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:41,440
Is the devil

561
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:45,024
We're doing a special bat theme sale. That's a damn

562
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,352
We cannot do all the way in special

563
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,632
They don't sell

564
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:52,704
Locate our supplements

565
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,240
I think they could do

566
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,520
Infowars

567
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,568
Why not do it

568
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,872
Less harmful

569
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,504
I've guaranteed by now someone's drink that iodine

570
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,064
Call Totally 100%

571
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,392
But I have a strong sense

572
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,160
Kind of put

573
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:15,232
Open their mouths when I just go all the way with candy

574
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,768
Disney Clippers

575
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,072
I thought that I found really interesting

576
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,400
I wonder if you hear this

577
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,168
The same way I do

578
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,728
The diversity is strong

579
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,544
There's a unifying

580
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,592
Christianity or unifying Americana

581
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,896
Ethos

582
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,480
But if you don't have a unifying narrative

583
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,272
You will disintegrate

584
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,832
What happened

585
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,648
Evil or bad

586
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,952
I like that you were taking notes

587
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:50,304
And you wrote down the word diversity and then put a lot

588
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:58,752
Has like a write-down diversity that's where he started

589
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,568
Some notes continuing on and then

590
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,128
Vision following words I was just like

591
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,408
Crossout diversity

592
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:08,480
What I hear from a clip like that is

593
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:11,808
Diversity is great as long as there is a robust

594
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,600
Status quo that supports

595
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,648
Am I interesting

596
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,672
Primary

597
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,720
And the only ones that are really important

598
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,768
I can't believe you would call me a white now

599
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,072
Because I do not want it all white

600
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,096
That's crazy

601
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:29,216
Supremacist I want a diverse Nation where I'm On Top running every

602
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,520
What don't you understand

603
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,824
Benedict

604
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
Is

605
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,128
Really interesting

606
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,176
To me because I've heard him too

607
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:38,944
Decry

608
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,712
Diversity

609
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,736
Tons in the past

610
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:44,064
So for him to say like diversity is great as long as

611
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,832
Is people

612
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,112
Are subject to

613
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,648
Americana

614
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:50,208
Or in there it is

615
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,488
Sweet

616
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:55,072
That's strange I mean it's not strange at all but

617
00:29:55,328 --> 00:30:00,192
It is it is weird for somebody to literally say I'm a white supremacist and not under

618
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,728
First and that those are the words

619
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,032
Are you straight

620
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,616
Some calls

621
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,640
He's got an answer

622
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,664
About big Tech

623
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,200
The solution

624
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,504
I think it's very reasonable okay thanks

625
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,528
This caller is

626
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:21,440
Maybe I mean I don't know what else they believe they're calling and Alex's shows they can't be that great great

627
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:25,024
Twitter and Facebook are really bad

628
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,792
Yeah so what

629
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:29,632
Do you need to do so you need to Foster other platforms

630
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:32,192
And try and get people off of those

631
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:36,288
Create Alternatives we could create more of an ecosystem

632
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,312
Online

633
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,616
No time

634
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:45,760
Everybody that's listening right now if he went and do that and it least mirror their profiles

635
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,808
I didn't get all their friends and family

636
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,576
10 people

637
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:55,488
Get trained people get them off of the big Tech platforms

638
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,256
A decade

639
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:01,632
Exactly you have you use the big platform while you still have them

640
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:04,448
To promote all the little platforms and grow those

641
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,080
14 days out there brother

642
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,872
14 days out

643
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,920
Play Dollar Store

644
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,944
People better

645
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,272
We sharing on Twitter on Facebook on all those

646
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,136
Infowar however you can now

647
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,672
Sure

648
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,024
Certo

649
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,328
For now

650
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,864
Absolute

651
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,680
Everyone should go to parlor

652
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,960
Everyone should go to gab

653
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,264
Everyone should go to telegram or Telegraph

654
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,360
There's no time

655
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:47,200
Any productive

656
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,224
What I've been doing is

657
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,856
Is changing URL constantly so I can still be promoted

658
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,416
I spend my resources

659
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:01,280
Bands

660
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,328
Oh sure I'll have the guy from

661
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:06,144
From Gabby come on my show from timer

662
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:09,472
I don't care about it no one there except

663
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,776
Stream

664
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:14,336
Who cares it's not a fertile ground

665
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,128
So weird whenever they kicked all the

666
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,152
Vegas off of

667
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,712
Twitter and they were like not all of them

668
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,760
How dare you how could you do that

669
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:25,088
And then they went to the other place together and they were like oh my God everybody's

670
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,880
Xtreme picatinny rail

671
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:32,256
What a shock this is this bigotry isn't my bigotry you're even more big

672
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:38,656
Alarm for a long time then he probably should have

673
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,472
Contributed to the solution of it as opposed to

674
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:44,288
Desperately trying to still promote his stuff

675
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,080
The platform

676
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,104
That exist

677
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,664
I mean I guess you did try to do that Infowars dating

678
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,432
Insight

679
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,224
There was that

680
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,504
Do that

681
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,528
Affected my job

682
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,064
I think that one had some

683
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,088
Like

684
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,112
General

685
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,136
Design flaw

686
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,928
Yeah I would say like

687
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,232
Before we even get to the website or the

688
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,376
Design design and conception flaws

689
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,960
That's something that should be up on the Whiteboard and then erased

690
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,728
Immediately

691
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,568
So are we

692
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,336
From Canada

693
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,896
Should stop trying to meddle in our election

694
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,368
Yeah with two weeks left

695
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,136
It's too late

696
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,440
Why do Whimsy

697
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,512
White now

698
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,048
Insurrection Act

699
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,352
And

700
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,680
Roundup and prosecute every single one of

701
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,216
Biden Hunter

702
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,752
Hillary

703
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,288
Build and work them

704
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,896
By the way there the authoritarians have tried to have

705
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,456
By the way

706
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,224
Just remember that

707
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,552
Yeah Canada

708
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:03,392
Okay I'm down here's what we'll do yours my here's my

709
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,160
Peace treaty

710
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,720
Alright this is I think how we're going to solve

711
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,768
Right so eat even if Biden does Wendy

712
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,584
People are going to go ape shitt

713
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,376
Problem here's what we'd

714
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,656
Did we have a sit-down to

715
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,936
Between the left and the right

716
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:22,592
Bishop Desmond Tutu and Reconciliation

717
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,872
Nothing alright

718
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,152
We will

719
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,200
Who do we put the clintons in the Bible

720
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,736
Things in the whole lot of them in jail

721
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,016
If they just leave us alone

722
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:36,928
Yeah you with that with that there's some reason to put them in jail their evil borrow a term

723
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:40,000
There was a lot more popular couple years ago I think that would embolden

724
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,072
Probably I don't know

725
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:46,400
What's a good solution

726
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:50,752
We just move on I do I do like the ideas I do like the idea of some sort of

727
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,520
3D

728
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,800
Or something

729
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,080
Or some kind of

730
00:34:55,104 --> 00:35:01,248
It doesn't feel like there's a way forward without like some massive negotiation

731
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,528
Goodbye

732
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,088
Yeah I don't know if that's possible.

733
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:05,856
Something's got to happen

734
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:12,256
You guys will do it

735
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:15,584
Not sure I'm not sure I support this

736
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:16,864
Alex

737
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,472
Easy supporting with this collar saying

738
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,776
Lock up all the political enemies

739
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,080
Canada. Here's how this looks to Alex

740
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,640
In in real-world term

741
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,712
How many times has blackmail Joe Biden movie

742
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,248
Emails proving an egg and

743
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,296
Father Firepower she is not fit

744
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,856
He's the only to be arrested

745
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,768
Anime year we can have another general election

746
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:48,096
Trump's going to lose you can legitimately

747
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,192
Martial law

748
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:56,032
If they can't steal it with an overwhelming fraud

749
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:01,408
Cancel session race war we can't just sit back and let her do this

750
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,456
So

751
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:05,760
Alex

752
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:11,648
Is saying we should destroy the Democratic party lockup all the leadership course

753
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:15,232
I don't get arrested

754
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:22,400
Is Casey HR new Democratic question project is now the Democratic Party

755
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:26,752
Remind me of another type of course we can do it all over again Dan

756
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,056
Way we know it's right this time

757
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:32,384
You do it every year until bricks

758
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:33,920
I tell you what

759
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,456
If you want cost

760
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,992
Is

761
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:43,392
A good way to get it promised some kind of bizarre

762
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:49,024
Is never going to happen happen

763
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,584
An idiot would have actually hold that election

764
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,144
Calista

765
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:59,776
Also how would you create an apparatus

766
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:04,128
Like the Democratic party within a year that could be viable as a national park.

767
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:07,456
Come on this is childish

768
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,016
Yeah but Alex says like

769
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,576
Trump knows he's going to win

770
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,880
You know he's not afraid of Biden

771
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,160
Lock him up

772
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,440
Right

773
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,232
Sounds like something

774
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,512
Dictators do when they are

775
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:22,560
Totally not afraid

776
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,376
The high-level people today

777
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:28,192
Don't want to go on record yet Rodger stones on tomorrow by the way

778
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,776
Rodger doesn't want to attack

779
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,944
The trumps only five points ahead

780
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,504
He was 15 points ahead last time

781
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,880
Only five points ahead

782
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,160
Probably so high

783
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,184
You got to lose

784
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,256
And to all these Republicans are we doing

785
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,792
How does euphorian stop

786
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,584
I'm sorry folks right now

787
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:00,960
Be a fraud in the Tommy's Chinese will rule America with the satanic

788
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,336
Well alright

789
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,360
I mean sounds

790
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,152
Barely resigned to it

791
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,736
It kind of a mini more positive wasn't like

792
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:19,136
And then we have to go kill everybody right or just playing time before the commercial for ramp-up I think I think he did

793
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:24,512
Didn't realize he was going to get that extreme until music started

794
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,520
What a

795
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,288
That's what that

796
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,920
Much like Laurel Uber Cedar Falls

797
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,224
Earlier in the episode we heard Alex

798
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,552
Accidentally read an article is headline about Sweden

799
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,344
Without knowing anything

800
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,136
Think about what was going on and then

801
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,696
He does this again

802
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:56,000
About Brazil

803
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,096
Brazil's

804
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,632
Major state

805
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,472
Bye, this calls for mandatory covid vaccination

806
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,824
I'm a communist state

807
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,872
46 million doses

808
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,176
Chinese reading makes no sense

809
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:20,576
Given that we all know that Alex loves bolsonaro who is the president of Brazil

810
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,112
Countries not run by a communist

811
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,672
How to sing there's a Brazilian steak

812
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,952
It's run by a communist

813
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:32,352
Because he doesn't know the story at all

814
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:36,704
The story is about the governor of South Paulo is Joe Doria

815
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,752
Doria is not a communist

816
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:42,592
Brazilian version of The Apprentice

817
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:45,152
Partially because he's a famous businessman

818
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,456
Land is worth almost 50 million dollars

819
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,088
Alex or one of his employees saw that Doria is a member of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party

820
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,112
And decided

821
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,136
That makes him a communist

822
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,976
In reality that's a fairly Centrist party in Brazil

823
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:05,376
It was actually the main governmental opposition to be more Socialist Workers Party which included figures like Lula and Dylan

824
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:09,472
Imagine Alex spends all of his time reading for a news

825
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:15,872
Just going like why don't you name things the way I name things

826
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:18,176
Australian labor is the

827
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:24,832
Goodguys what are we what are we doing here if all you know is the name then Social Democratic party might make you think the guy

828
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,600
Guys

829
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:32,000
But if you work you'd probably be a member of the Communist Party of Brazil or possibly the Democratic labor party

830
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,280
Workers Party

831
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,048
Secretly

832
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:34,816
Capitalist

833
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:35,584
Call Cheryl

834
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,864
It's an upside-down

835
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:39,936
Little things like this showcase out with his lack of depth

836
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,984
In terms of any kind of reporting

837
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,752
He's doing

838
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,312
You have no idea what the story is about other than that it's

839
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,896
The Ford politician like so go ahead let's play music

840
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:54,016
Also Alex doesn't know this so let's hope he doesn't find out that actually bolsonaro was

841
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:59,904
Is elected president as a member of the social Liberal Party has actually super right

842
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,744
Confuse the poor boy we can get started with that

843
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,144
Do I always find a really interesting when you can almost tell that I was reading a headline is got to be a misper

844
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,984
Play the I like Brazil

845
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,288
The distraught the words dates

846
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,592
I imagine I wonder what would happen

847
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:19,616
If

848
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,664
Somebody just removed bolsonaro

849
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,688
Name from all the

850
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,968
Headlines and just put

851
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,760
Social liberal politician

852
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:26,784
How

853
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:32,160
Different would his coverage just be

854
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:35,744
For sure but do you know what I mean like really all is that all

855
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,560
What takes really would be interesting to see if like

856
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:41,120
No one has ever called him Brazil's Trump

857
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:43,168
Without a care at all

858
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,960
I imagine

859
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,240
Why would he

860
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,288
Unless it was like Brazilian is

861
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,312
Trump

862
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,616
You know we need to do we need to find some like

863
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,407
Really leftist politician

864
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,455
And brand them as like some other country

865
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:59,295
Trump trick out

866
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,855
You know one person who could get it done

867
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,879
Steve

868
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,415
Aerobic

869
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:07,743
Steve pieczenik overthrow of government

870
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,351
Morally every event

871
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,399
It is ever happened in the world

872
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,703
Steve comes in

873
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,751
Do you want to talk about how the Democrats

874
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,543
Their self-destruction where they are

875
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:25,151
For several years now

876
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,199
You can have this

877
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,527
Created

878
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:33,855
What's happening in this new year

879
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:37,183
In an era where we need

880
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,975
Understand

881
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:47,423
3 backpage.com

882
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,703
858

883
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,519
Can have a Nancy Pelosi

884
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:54,079
80 years old

885
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:57,919
Maxine Waters

886
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,223
82 years old

887
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:05,343
What you're seeing here we said

888
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,159
Party

889
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,951
Senile dementia

890
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,743
Eventually

891
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,095
Define

892
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,655
Taken electrical applications are generally

893
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,959
Too old and I think that we could

894
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,239
Stand to

895
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,519
Inject some

896
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:28,127
Younger Representatives

897
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,431
It's fine that conversation is fine

898
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,735
It's not a Democrat problem

899
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:37,343
Yeah it's not a Democrat problem

900
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,159
Also part of a problem

901
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:46,559
74 that's not start talking about

902
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,863
Young man

903
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,143
Also

904
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:54,751
Listing of people's ages and how much money they have when he's like

905
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,287
Trump is old and Rich

906
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:58,079
I have no idea what

907
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,359
He's trying to do

908
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:02,943
That's incredibly all I'm hearing while he's doing that is like in my head and

909
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,479
I'm just going like Trump sold to

910
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,503
Council two

911
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,783
Yeah and he has a lot

912
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,063
He has a lot of money

913
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,367
Or maybe he doesn't have a lot of fun

914
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,415
Maybe you're the one who's

915
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,439
Yeah

916
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,743
Anyway I thought meant to be disoriented

917
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:18,815
21 Rock

918
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,351
That is

919
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,119
Is the constant

920
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,655
Sure

921
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,679
Does not like police

922
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,239
I'm against police state

923
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,055
Crazy p

924
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:34,175
Cause of Civil War cost of session

925
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,711
At a certain point

926
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,807
They're going to do to us

927
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:48,767
You're correct

928
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:54,655
Is really funny about that first of all the Steve's

929
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,447
The second thing is like Alex

930
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:01,055
If you understand his show and you actually know what he's talking about

931
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,359
I can translate that clip to being

932
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,151
I'm against the police state

933
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:08,223
Keith Olbermann said something so we need a police game

934
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,759
I feel very attacked

935
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:13,343
So I would like a police state

936
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,391
Keith Olbermann the YouTube channel

937
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,671
Do you know what we need

938
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:19,999
Ultimate safe space is a police state

939
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:25,119
What is Bill Maher says something

940
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,911
Where does it end

941
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:27,935
It's a slippery slope

942
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:35,103
You don't have a police state then you get older men and then you'd like Walsh it it's all all the real

943
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,199
Bill Barr it might cause

944
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,479
His head will explode

945
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:41,759
Sprinkler head exploding

946
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,063
This is where I got really like

947
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,111
I don't know Steve

948
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:46,879
What are you doing

949
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:50,463
Steve has a plan Visa vie

950
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:52,255
Dealing with

951
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,023
Twitter

952
00:45:54,815 --> 00:46:00,191
Mike Jones because you couldn't never all tweets should be replaced with Milani

953
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:05,567
No come up but this plan is expensive it's silly

954
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,615
Man

955
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,383
I like

956
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:11,199
But there's another reason I'm going to

957
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,735
And the reason because

958
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,063
A song about Jack from Twitter

959
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,855
Since he decided

960
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,135
Personal with

961
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:19,903
Trump

962
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,951
And use Hunter Biden and started to

963
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,327
And that is when now has

964
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:32,703
Isn't it amazing for the past 15 years

965
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,983
You've been considered the

966
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,823
What does that really mean

967
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:38,847
Dorsey

968
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,127
Now remember

969
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:40,895
Renee

970
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,623
You self-righteous

971
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,671
Thinks he's better than

972
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:56,511
He's gay

973
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:57,791
Dadaism

974
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:01,887
The hidden secrecy and nastiness

975
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,167
Seven Dwarfs

976
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,959
Why is it a problem for you

977
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,031
I have

978
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,847
0 comprehension of why he's talk

979
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,383
Walking the way he's talking

980
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:15,199
Yeah personal with Trump

981
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:15,967
What do you do

982
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,783
Wait what

983
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,551
Steve

984
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:22,111
His plan haha deal with big Tech

985
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,903
Twitter

986
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,671
Gay

987
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:25,695
Yep

988
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,231
Yep

989
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,839
What we're going to do

990
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:38,239
Is we're going to put jack in the center Square

991
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:44,639
Idea let's act like a schoolyard children and gay bash somebody I don't know

992
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:49,759
Don't care

993
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,063
You don't need to take

994
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,159
I don't even take out how to record

995
00:47:56,415 --> 00:48:00,255
You shouldn't care either I don't I don't understand I don't understand

996
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,559
So Grinnell is

997
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,095
Because here's what he said

998
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,119
Here's what he say

999
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,167
I don't care if he's gay

1000
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,447
What I don't like

1001
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,727
Is somebody I

1002
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,751
Don't know

1003
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:13,055
Not lying to me about something that is

1004
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,591
It's not my business to know

1005
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:18,175
Well sort of I think also this Harkins

1006
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,199
Back to life

1007
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,479
School

1008
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,015
Communism

1009
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,575
The days when someone

1010
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:27,391
Sexuality could be used to Blackmail them and stuff

1011
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,415
House on American

1012
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:31,487
Yeah yeah I think that's worth

1013
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,255
Steven 7

1014
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,791
Yeah well that's true

1015
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:34,815
He might be too old for

1016
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,607
Remind me to

1017
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,399
Confirm

1018
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,447
I just ordered

1019
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,471
Stand this Lake

1020
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,311
Anyway this is not just

1021
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,591
Something that's

1022
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:50,175
Steve is picking up is a plan that he wants to put into action

1023
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,455
Have you also seems

1024
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,479
A little bit pissed

1025
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,783
About to bad customer service that he got

1026
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:58,879
Do you still use square right which Jack started as well she or anything

1027
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,415
Steve still a little mad about

1028
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,351
No one answer

1029
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:14,239
Using Square guess what happened they said they don't work on Saturdays and Sundays

1030
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,335
You got multibillion-dollar

1031
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,479
Homosexual

1032
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,367
Yeah

1033
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,647
Holyshit

1034
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:36,255
I decided I don't even I don't even know what to say like what I'm listening to the sound like

1035
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,047
Wow

1036
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:41,631
These people's brains working such paillard

1037
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,655
He said that's

1038
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:47,775
Just while he's screaming about like not getting customer service when he used

1039
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:51,103
Square because they took weekends off and then somehow he's going to get

1040
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,151
Get back

1041
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,175
What in

1042
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,223
I don't know

1043
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:58,015
When we overthrew Rome

1044
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:58,783
Brutus

1045
00:49:59,295 --> 00:49:59,807
To take my

1046
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:00,831
Advice

1047
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,367
Said what we should have done is

1048
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,391
Call Julius

1049
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:06,207
A dick but it didn't go that way

1050
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,791
I

1051
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,143
I mean Steve seen better days

1052
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:16,447
Flip like

1053
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:20,543
Sinister plotting this is just being an a******

1054
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:24,383
Dick baby

1055
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:27,711
Look like a old man write a letter

1056
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:33,855
Whether or not Jack is gay is not my business and I don't care whether or not that is

1057
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:34,623
The case what's

1058
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:36,415
Steve is doing is deeply humbled

1059
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:39,231
No incredibly incredibly am deeply homophobic

1060
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:45,375
The caller who called in earlier I had a better plan

1061
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:48,447
Yeah I would argue that as well

1062
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:51,007
Steve also had some plans

1063
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,799
For Trump

1064
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:55,871
We need plastic action now what else would you do

1065
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:01,759
What I would say is I

1066
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,527
Get rid of bar

1067
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:05,599
Country that can't do that

1068
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:14,047
With what he's been doing Sara Lee I would get rid of Gina Gaston

1069
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,887
I would start

1070
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:19,167
Firing people

1071
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,727
Understand

1072
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:31,711
Anybody that's establishment anybody that's globalist

1073
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:35,039
Google I'm in a minute

1074
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,159
You know what this advice translates to this is like

1075
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,439
Hey

1076
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,207
Sacrifice

1077
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:45,023
People

1078
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:49,375
Totally throw people overboard

1079
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:55,775
5

1080
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:03,455
Alex's advices basically like

1081
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:06,015
Throw people off the Lifeboat just f****** thing

1082
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,831
We got two weeks of the election

1083
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,623
Pocket sacrifice whoever you got

1084
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:15,999
Take down the entire history.

1085
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,535
Manicure

1086
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,303
That is

1087
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,071
Tumi

1088
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,631
Any indication of people who doing well

1089
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:25,983
Thrilled about their prospects know he's only ahead by five point

1090
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:28,031
Internal quality

1091
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,823
Iau have

1092
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,359
To be so far gone

1093
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:34,687
So far gone down the rabbit hole with b*******

1094
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,479
To believe that Trump would ever even

1095
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,247
Think of getting

1096
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,295
I mean

1097
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,575
If Trump

1098
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,599
Makes bar

1099
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,623
Feel bad

1100
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,927
Bar has everything

1101
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,975
Like it is ridiculous

1102
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,767
Barb aerones

1103
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,303
Like forever

1104
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:54,655
Seems like based on the I mean I hate to put on my Steve pieczenik

1105
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:58,495
Psychiatry psychology

1106
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:03,359
I would bet on him over Trump

1107
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,127
100

1108
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:08,991
Inserting the Department of Justice in as

1109
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,271
Defendant for Trump

1110
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,039
Libel

1111
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,063
Like

1112
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:16,927
That's the level of barnos everything is involved in covering up ever

1113
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:18,463
Every crime is doing everything

1114
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:21,023
There's no way you f****** your fixer

1115
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,863
One last clip here for

1116
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,887
From Steve's appearance

1117
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,471
Trump is

1118
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:31,519
After Alex's second wedding

1119
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:38,175
Trump called and wanted to talk to Alex's wife about how like a great blessings on your union

1120
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:40,479
Steve says this and I swear it's just like

1121
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:44,319
Sometimes he'll come in and it's like oh it's a racist day

1122
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:47,391
Today is a homophobic

1123
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,415
Hellboy

1124
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:53,279
Good news is that he understood

1125
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,047
Exactly

1126
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,167
Do you like swimming

1127
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:02,239
Text women that spinner

1128
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,519
Unique feature

1129
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,335
Wait what

1130
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,103
What is

1131
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,383
F****** a happening

1132
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:13,247
I don't know David Michelle what are we doing yeah probably

1133
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:17,855
I am a man these people are not

1134
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:21,951
Yeah yeah it was it was a it was a jarring

1135
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,999
Appearance

1136
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,279
Steve Bart

1137
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:27,071
Alright man just

1138
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,095
Just go back

1139
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:31,679
Townie by 10 a.m. and then go to bed at 9

1140
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,239
Fucken leave us alone you old

1141
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,799
So Steve Williams and Alex

1142
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,079
Sackets the rambling

1143
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:39,615
About how he's always right

1144
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:41,919
And Trump is going to win no matter what

1145
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:44,479
My guts never wrong cuz it just sounds

1146
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:46,271
Subconscious

1147
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:47,551
Amish Paradise

1148
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,319
Decision

1149
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:52,415
In a healthy election today

1150
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,463
Trump's going to lose because of massive fraud

1151
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:56,255
He's got to get his points

1152
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,791
Way up above her

1153
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:58,815
Just five.

1154
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,863
10.15

1155
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,399
Her

1156
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:06,239
Do we wish we were running against somebody else whelming

1157
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,263
Slide

1158
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:10,847
They're going to contest it folks or just any way you slice it

1159
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:14,687
This is a foreign outside takeover of the country literally

1160
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:19,039
No matter what Trump's going to win probably going to lose today because

1161
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:19,807
The cheating

1162
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:25,439
And her part is partially I think subconscious Hillary stuff and then I think the other part is

1163
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:28,255
Prior to this has been talking about house

1164
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,791
Kamala Harris is going to be the X

1165
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,119
Just going to be watching his

1166
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:36,959
His stories are whatever

1167
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:39,519
You know what I want I want to continue this

1168
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:45,919
Rain of having no idea who's in charge of anything at any given point in time I would definitely prefer

1169
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,967
Bi handled by some weird

1170
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,247
Vice president

1171
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:51,807
Double team that's going on that sounds great

1172
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:55,135
Call Zach and

1173
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:57,951
The first fellow here accuses Alex

1174
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:58,975
Pics of lying

1175
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:05,119
About the FBI and the deer hunter Biden the Lowry I like it Alex does not take this well

1176
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:07,423
You know you know damn well.

1177
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,703
The FBI has knock

1178
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:13,823
Confirm

1179
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:15,871
He's being arraigned

1180
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,407
Bye

1181
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,479
Reply.

1182
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,295
And his dad

1183
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:26,111
Get up on C-Span

1184
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:30,975
And said that they were investigating us so I went said I won't give you a million bucks by far the prosecutor

1185
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:32,511
Listen to me boy

1186
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:35,583
We're done with you

1187
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,887
You're the bomb

1188
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:41,727
Okay thank you calling here in Gaslight my audience

1189
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,007
You don't do that

1190
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:43,775
You're a joke

1191
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,079
Keep you all

1192
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:51,711
Disappeared

1193
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:55,551
Coward

1194
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:59,903
Is it time I didn't want I didn't want to beat up on you with all my facts

1195
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:06,303
So I don't have time for it honestly I think what happened there if I had to guess what

1196
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,071
Like logic

1197
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,863
Tree that Alex's brain went down

1198
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:09,887
It was

1199
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:10,655
Alright

1200
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:15,007
This guy obviously knows that I'm in polishing the s*** out of the story

1201
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,543
And what the FBI is it

1202
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:17,823
Confirmed and all that

1203
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,103
That is trouble

1204
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:23,711
So what I'm going to do is see if I can get him dancing around this

1205
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:28,319
Clip of Biden prosecutor

1206
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:30,879
Can get him to take the bait on arguing about trash

1207
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:38,559
No I'm not

1208
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:40,607
And that's why I hang out because

1209
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:45,215
If you can't detract somebody over to aside argument

1210
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:46,751
You can't talk to the

1211
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,287
And it's one of the reasons I think

1212
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:51,103
That call is a good example of why it's like

1213
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,407
Almost pointless to try and

1214
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:55,455
Confront Alex about things on his show

1215
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:58,271
I think there's probably some people who could

1216
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,039
Handle

1217
00:57:59,295 --> 00:57:59,807
Like

1218
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,111
Bringing up

1219
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,159
Decent points to him but it won't go in

1220
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:04,927
Anywhere

1221
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:10,559
One thing I think I would like to hear someone ask him or I'd like to ask him myself

1222
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,583
Is

1223
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,375
Alright

1224
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,399
2000

1225
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,167
7

1226
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,447
You're on your show

1227
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:18,751
You're talkin about whatever you're talkin about

1228
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:21,567
Are you lying to the audience about the devil

1229
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:24,895
Being behind all of it or was it that will not behind it then

1230
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:32,831
You know a lot of people like to argue about whether or not the devil

1231
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:39,231
Send those people haven't been to the extra Dimensions that I have dinner so

1232
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,143
So yes I mean technically the devil was

1233
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:51,007
You need to realize it before he died I talked to Charlie Daniels

1234
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:57,407
He was working on another song of follow-up

1235
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,943
Cayman Island vacation

1236
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:01,759
During that period of time when I was on air talk

1237
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:08,159
About the Federal Reserve and all that stuff

1238
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:08,927
She was at the beach

1239
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:13,535
He was enjoying himself

1240
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:14,815
It look good

1241
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:18,655
See I really want to get into a discussion of what hit the devil's specific

1242
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:24,799
Check powers of never go spearfishing with the Devil he's got that that work

1243
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:27,103
Materialize a drink if he still wants it

1244
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,127
Only my ties

1245
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,919
Does he have to order it or

1246
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:34,783
The guy who can only materialize situationally appropriate drinks

1247
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:41,183
Does he have to get the glass from somewhere else and then he can materialize the drink he can only imagine realize drink

1248
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:42,463
Appropriate glasses

1249
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,999
Arizona Beach

1250
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:50,399
Shrek get a mai tai in a flute if he is at a speakeasy he can get an Old Fashioned

1251
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:52,191
Moscow mule

1252
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:57,055
Possible

1253
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:01,919
Is I love this devil

1254
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:07,295
The devil's powers for drinking tea realizations

1255
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,831
That's what I want I want if you

1256
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:11,903
You're going to start telling me the devil is real you better start telling me what the

1257
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:16,767
The limits of his powers hyper-specific

1258
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,303
So bored

1259
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:21,375
Captain America eventually you're like okay you can

1260
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:23,679
Carry the hammer of Thor whatever we at least

1261
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:28,543
All the times when Alex gets a call like this it ends up ruining

1262
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,823
His entire show

1263
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,103
And I was really worried

1264
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,151
Even though we're in the third hour

1265
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:36,479
I was worried that he was going to like completely Fall Apart

1266
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:42,111
I need doesn't man he just goes to another call and everything is fine he's not even thinking about that

1267
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:44,671
I wanted to say my mentor reminds me often

1268
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,975
Never stop an ego on its way to

1269
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:47,999
Destruction

1270
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,279
Doesn't need your help

1271
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,863
American Eagle

1272
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:55,935
Sleeping awake

1273
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:56,959
Ganda

1274
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,983
Is destruct

1275
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,287
Thing is just

1276
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:06,175
Waking up

1277
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:18,207
I guess no comment they are here

1278
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,535
The Bible said this was fake

1279
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:24,863
They have said nothing

1280
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:27,935
Now we have the lawyers email the API admitted they had to laugh

1281
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:32,543
Nothing to say about the last guy I mean

1282
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:35,871
On her ass but

1283
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:41,247
Elegance

1284
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:44,831
Like I was some 72

1285
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:47,391
Girl he picked up at a bus stop

1286
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,671
Yikes

1287
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:50,975
Could abs

1288
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:51,743
Absolutely of Kent

1289
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:54,047
Right I had to get two more calls

1290
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:58,143
Like the old guy

1291
01:01:59,423 --> 01:01:59,935
Yep

1292
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:01,727
Attract

1293
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,519
I swear I did

1294
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:04,287
I do love

1295
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:06,335
Especially when I heard that guy some

1296
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,359
Something very very boring

1297
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,407
And Alex not say anything I was like

1298
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:11,199
In Alex's that guy is in Alex

1299
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,223
Who had right now just going

1300
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:15,807
Boy over and over and over again

1301
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,855
I can't yell at that car

1302
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,135
Boy

1303
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,415
How many yo

1304
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,951
Not about that guy

1305
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:23,487
I'm going to sublimate that

1306
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:24,767
Christian

1307
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:26,559
Who don't support Rothrock

1308
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:30,911
People

1309
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:33,727
People that I believe

1310
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,263
Good intentions

1311
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:36,799
Thinking about you

1312
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:39,359
They don't like Trump

1313
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:43,967
Morally Superior

1314
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:47,807
Through hell and you should vacuum

1315
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,159
BoBoiBoy

1316
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,207
I think that's gross

1317
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:57,023
And bad but also I only really play this

1318
01:02:57,279 --> 01:03:00,095
Because the transitions into a little bit of Bible talk

1319
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:03,167
Which may be a new segment on show

1320
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:07,519
This is a really special edition of knowledge fight Bible talk

1321
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,567
Because Alex gets into

1322
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,335
Tumult estimate

1323
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,359
Business

1324
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:16,223
But he also talks about something that happened in his own life recently that I find

1325
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:18,271
Almost impossible to avoid

1326
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,391
7 years of

1327
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:25,951
Harvesting

1328
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:26,719
Salmon

1329
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,487
Joseph

1330
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:30,047
Prime minister

1331
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:32,607
Big Mac show that information

1332
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:41,311
People

1333
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,103
Atlanta in following years

1334
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:47,455
Dream of the prophet in Egypt

1335
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:51,039
Another seven years of fat the seven years of skinny

1336
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,927
StoryBots

1337
01:03:57,183 --> 01:04:02,815
Talking I was talking to a high-powered Democratic people are

1338
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:09,215
Meeting with the local Democrat Mafia head

1339
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,799
He said Alex what's going on

1340
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:13,567
4000

1341
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,591
Years ago Egypt

1342
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,663
7 Days of

1343
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,199
What

1344
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:24,831
You believe that

1345
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,111
Nope

1346
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,391
Yes

1347
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:35,839
That story that is 100% true that only happened a few days ago

1348
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:40,191
Synchronous within the last month I met with a local

1349
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:42,495
What bullets for Mafia leader

1350
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:43,519
What are you talk

1351
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:49,919
Local Global is Mafia leader who is confused about the simplest dream interpretation anyway

1352
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:51,967
One has ever heard of before

1353
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:58,623
I have I have an interesting theory about what Alex is referring to look at it here in a minute

1354
01:04:58,879 --> 01:04:59,903
Little more about farro

1355
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:03,743
They wouldn't dug up the Sanskrit in the end

1356
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,559
Screw what's in Genesis

1357
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:14,239
The firstborn of the Israelites killed as a way to just call off

1358
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,007
Boy

1359
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,287
I don't want too many boys

1360
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:19,103
Warriors I want women they can control

1361
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:27,551
Leaving aside be historical accuracy questions about biblical events Alex's interpretation of why Pharaoh wanted

1362
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,855
The kill the Israelite boys is not necessarily the

1363
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:30,879
The consensus opinion

1364
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:33,695
Going back to Josephus is commentaries on x

1365
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:40,095
So that's one of the most mainstream understandings of Pharaoh's decree was that his advisers had prophesied that the mail would be the one

1366
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:41,119
Want to save the Jews

1367
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,935
And those the killing of the boys was an attempt to stop this for

1368
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:44,703
From happening

1369
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:49,567
This is mirrored in the story of Jesus's birth when Herod ordered the deaths of all male children

1370
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:50,591
Nikka possibly be

1371
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,639
In the right age range to be the Messiah

1372
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:53,919
From Josephus

1373
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:56,223
One of those secrets

1374
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:59,551
Scribes were very sagacious in foretelling future events

1375
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:00,319
Truly told

1376
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:06,207
That about this time there be a child born to the Israelites who if you were weird would bring the Egyptian

1377
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,511
Dominion low and would raise be Israelites

1378
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:13,119
That he would Excel all men and virtue and obtained a glory that will be remembered through all ages

1379
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:19,775
Which theme was so feared by the king bad according to this man's opinion he commanded that they should cast every male child

1380
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:23,103
Which was born to be Israelites into the river and destroy it

1381
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,639
This was of course

1382
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,175
The backstory of Moses

1383
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:31,807
In the context of Exodus 1 there is a concern about the increase of the Hebrew population

1384
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:34,623
And that they might become enemies of Egypt

1385
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,159
Inside with the enemies of Egypt

1386
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:37,183
If there was a conflict

1387
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:40,255
What's the deal with that within the text

1388
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:42,047
Enslaving them forcing them into hard labor

1389
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:44,351
The killing of the male children

1390
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,655
A slightly disconnect

1391
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:49,471
Thought from old commentaries

1392
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:52,543
A lot of the belief is about the prophesying of the

1393
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,311
Becoming aphmau's

1394
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:58,431
Yeah that's one of the very first versions of the story where it's like

1395
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,735
In terms of time travel profit

1396
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:01,503
Sissy stuff

1397
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,271
Read like

1398
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:05,599
Yeah the prophecy only comes true because you act

1399
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,879
That's the way you would

1400
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:07,903
Normally Act

1401
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,183
If you would heard the

1402
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:12,511
If you didn't want Moses to show up maybe

1403
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,535
Just be nicer dude

1404
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:17,887
It's like my killing everybody you were the one that created the whole problem

1405
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:18,911
The God of Thunder the first

1406
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:25,567
Your dad is outside your nature Sonia prophecy to come true I would save the trip I don't like you calling Moses

1407
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,335
The problem

1408
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:28,895
I think it was a problem maybe for from the

1409
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:31,199
Perspective of pharaoh

1410
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,479
Sparrow

1411
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:39,135
He's just he's just a rabble-rouser he's an instigator you can't have it you just let him go

1412
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:43,999
Historical if I if I had my druthers

1413
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:46,559
And I would have a talk so yeah I think

1414
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:48,095
I think Alex just does

1415
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:49,887
Bible corner

1416
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:53,727
But Alex does get back to talking about the meeting with

1417
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:54,495
Globalist

1418
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,031
Mafia leaders

1419
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:00,127
I think it's just his lawsuit

1420
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,687
And by the way folks and sit there and say

1421
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:09,343
Bible

1422
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,111
Godby

1423
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:10,879
What the devil

1424
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:17,279
I will absolutely

1425
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:19,583
With

1426
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:22,911
Two representatives of the top billionaires

1427
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:24,191
Bienaime repeatedly

1428
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:27,263
I've got meetings with the Enemy going on right now

1429
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:28,543
East Coast

1430
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:33,151
Give up

1431
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:35,199
Embrace Christ they want

1432
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,735
Cuz I rub their father the devil

1433
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:37,759
The synagogue

1434
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:44,159
That all seems like

1435
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:47,231
Satellites are really well I mean sure

1436
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:50,559
When he says that he has ongoing meetings with

1437
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:54,399
Higher-level globalist

1438
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:57,215
You know you know you know you know that Sandy Hook

1439
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:00,031
Trial is going on

1440
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:03,871
What a baby bat

1441
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:07,711
Meeting with the globalist mafia leaders that

1442
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:08,991
Recently was actually his

1443
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:12,063
Custody hearing okay so just Family Court

1444
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,879
Yeah it was the mediator

1445
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:16,927
You they were a high-level democratic

1446
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,207
Mafia.

1447
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,023
So Alex

1448
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:24,351
He just doesn't have time to deal with collars

1449
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:25,631
Who

1450
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:27,167
They all disagree with them

1451
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,191
It's really important

1452
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,727
And stuff too

1453
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:32,799
Really important

1454
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:34,591
Especially

1455
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,871
San Francisco

1456
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:36,895
Saturday

1457
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,271
Free speech well-spoken

1458
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:44,063
Can you cannot be racist

1459
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,159
Merry Chrysler

1460
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,183
Excavating

1461
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,975
I'm not as strong as he is.

1462
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:54,815
Get so mad you not my front teeth. Got your dad

1463
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:55,839
Your dad

1464
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:56,863
Enterprise

1465
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:03,263
So we got a guy who got punched

1466
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:04,799
Who Alex's

1467
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:07,103
Jerk now having on his gas

1468
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,127
I'm going to

1469
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:09,663
Declare that punch was a false flag

1470
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:16,063
Self in order to make the left look bad and that's why you should

1471
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,343
I don't know

1472
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,111
Gravel governor

1473
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:19,647
So anyways

1474
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:24,255
The person who punched him has been arrested and is being charged with a hate crime

1475
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:25,791
I feel like

1476
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,327
Hey

1477
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:28,863
Not great

1478
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:30,143
Not great that two people

1479
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,935
We'll punch each other but when they do

1480
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:34,239
If someone punching somebody and then they get arrested

1481
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,263
I don't really

1482
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,031
Kind of Howard

1483
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:38,079
Care too much probably

1484
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:40,895
Anyway I have one clip of this guy and

1485
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:41,663
It's them

1486
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:44,223
Him and Alex trying to make the argument that Joe Biden

1487
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:44,991
Is racist

1488
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:47,551
You always.

1489
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,831
Free puppy

1490
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:03,423
Wait that I don't think Alex got

1491
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,703
He was just

1492
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:07,519
Oh boy I think there might be some

1493
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:11,103
Facetiousness there might be some joking

1494
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:13,407
It's really hard to tell

1495
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:16,735
If that is something that Alex thinks like actually

1496
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:18,015
Or

1497
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:18,783
I don't know

1498
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:19,807
Anyway who cares

1499
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:20,575
Span I would

1500
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,855
I would really

1501
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:22,623
Personally

1502
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:24,671
You know I don't know

1503
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:28,767
I think it would be very hard

1504
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:30,047
To hear somebody

1505
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,583
Call me well spoken

1506
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,119
And then trying to argue that

1507
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,655
The guy that that guy doesn't like

1508
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:35,423
Mike is the racist

1509
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:37,471
You know I'm saying

1510
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:38,751
But he's a very

1511
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:43,871
Ticular but what did you what did you say you know what you're saying right

1512
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:46,431
The Battle of trying to deal with someone like Alex

1513
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,455
So Alex

1514
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:49,759
Co-ops the 4th hour

1515
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:52,319
Gerald Celente was supposed to host

1516
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:55,135
And Alex just takes over the 4th hour

1517
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:56,415
Preemptive

1518
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:58,719
Talenti knows this happen sometimes

1519
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:01,023
Just too much important stuff going on

1520
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:04,351
Still mad at that guy

1521
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:11,263
The waiting is over now

1522
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:17,151
Now the waiting is over

1523
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:18,431
I know that from

1524
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:22,271
You know like listening to Alex's show constantly people call in and say

1525
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,295
When is the war

1526
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,319
Yeah is it now

1527
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:25,343
Is it time

1528
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,879
Should the weight be over

1529
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:35,839
Let me be clear about that it doesn't seem ambiguous

1530
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:37,119
Cool

1531
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:39,935
The only time I want to hear the wait is over

1532
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:43,263
Is when it's the 69 Boyz album that has wolf wolf

1533
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,311
Hanukkah

1534
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:47,359
Freak you down to the base

1535
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:49,663
The wait is over

1536
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:54,783
Was that one freak was still spelled with a pH of

1537
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:55,551
PH free

1538
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,319
Victim

1539
01:12:56,575 --> 01:13:00,159
You spelled with a Q spelled with a Q back then

1540
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:02,463
It's a

1541
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:06,303
Alex Alex says that he needs to take over the 4th hour because he's at

1542
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:08,351
That's breaking news sure because he needs

1543
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,119
Take phone calls

1544
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:11,679
Are these people who are on hold and he's going to take them

1545
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:15,775
Because that was his excuse to not talk to the little whiny little baby

1546
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:19,103
He doesn't actually do that

1547
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,639
And then

1548
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:23,199
Oh man I haven't taken any calls

1549
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:27,807
You held it all three and next I want I love you

1550
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:29,343
Appreciate you sex

1551
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:33,951
Unplug last hour will be bankrupted we don't

1552
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:36,511
I went to top

1553
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:38,303
Developers who got like seven suppliers

1554
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,095
Best

1555
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:43,167
Multi-vitamin mineral amino acid

1556
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,191
Like the taste great

1557
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:45,983
Chelsea

1558
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:51,103
So he's taking over Gerald Celente his time he is going to go to

1559
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:52,383
She hasn't gone to cause

1560
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:54,687
And now he's taking up time doing a nap

1561
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:57,503
Supercuts better use

1562
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:58,783
Desert inet

1563
01:13:59,039 --> 01:13:59,551
Very busy

1564
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:05,951
He's exhausted

1565
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:06,719
Living

1566
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:11,327
Feeling women

1567
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:15,679
I don't need

1568
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:20,543
What is a baby's got to wear

1569
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:21,823
Face shield mask

1570
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:22,591
Airborne

1571
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:27,967
Let's go back to Luckenbach

1572
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:28,735
Texas

1573
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:35,647
Isaac is still on hold on

1574
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:42,047
The successful

1575
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:56,127
Alex

1576
01:14:56,383 --> 01:15:02,527
Just looking at this song

1577
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:07,647
It was a parody

1578
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:10,975
I don't think work

1579
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:11,743
Packers value should be

1580
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:16,351
But I think you should

1581
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,375
Do your job

1582
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:19,423
I honestly do

1583
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:25,823
I would rather listen to

1584
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:28,895
I mean it's like 50/50 he's going to do this to kill time

1585
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:30,175
50/50 chance

1586
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,455
Just going to do that races

1587
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:33,503
Impression

1588
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,527
As long as he

1589
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:38,879
You know he airs on this side of just killing time doing nothing

1590
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,439
I'm not mad

1591
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:42,207
Not matter

1592
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:48,095
Waylon and Willie and the boys

1593
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:48,863
Listen to a good one

1594
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:49,631
Yeah

1595
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:51,167
Anyways

1596
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:52,959
Alex sadove take the calls

1597
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:53,983
They're not interesting

1598
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:56,287
Zach

1599
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,055
Call

1600
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:58,335
And I was like

1601
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:02,943
You should never take calls from people named Zach cuz it reminds me that you had a fake

1602
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:06,271
Why won't you do that

1603
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:12,671
We haven't spoken to the is this it wasn't does that cuz I was that was what I thought.

1604
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:14,975
It's another Zack it's just a difference

1605
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:15,999
Whatever happened to Zack

1606
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:21,887
Queue for a while. Was a golden kiwi

1607
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:26,239
He was Alex's Cube because he was mad at cute he wanted his own

1608
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:29,311
It's all I've got back Zach spelled with a Q

1609
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,615
Or maybe a carrier

1610
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,407
Yeah

1611
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:36,479
I I kind of like when you finally went to that call

1612
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:37,759
I was like

1613
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:39,295
What if it is

1614
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:43,135
Where you been why have you called me

1615
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,439
Wasn't

1616
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:47,231
Now they say that they blocked

1617
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,511
Probably

1618
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:53,375
Calling from Morocco from down the hall

1619
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:58,495
So Alex has also Patrick Holly in from National file

1620
01:16:59,263 --> 01:16:59,775
Bizarre

1621
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:01,055
I hate this guy

1622
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,847
I honestly I turned off

1623
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:04,639
The show they're still like half an hour left

1624
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:05,919
Patrick amen

1625
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:09,503
I think you'll know why

1626
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,527
I want to hear that

1627
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,319
Well you know what I think

1628
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:18,207
What we're seeing now is Hunter Biden first of all I mean I don't know if the left thought they were just going to Cakewalk to this

1629
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:22,047
Action with the stupid vote-by-mail in the drive-thru Taco Bell voting but

1630
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:25,375
I don't think they counted on the fact that Patrick Highway 26

1631
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,143
16 veteran

1632
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:27,679
Rudy Giuliani

1633
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:34,079
Our super-agent are our James Bond for America Steve Bannon I mean these people are still out here like

1634
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,871
Rodger Stone

1635
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:37,151
We didn't go away

1636
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:43,551
Who are you Dennis Miller are you trying to be in that has the Dennis Miller

1637
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:48,927
There's like an attempt to be funny going on but he also just sounds like a baby

1638
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:51,743
Yeah there's a real baby

1639
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:56,863
I can't I can't stand him and then followed by what it said

1640
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:00,703
Just have like

1641
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:02,239
An outsized intolerance

1642
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:03,519
What's 4

1643
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:05,311
Patrick

1644
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:09,919
But I don't care about anything he says

1645
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,247
I can't imagine a world where and he has

1646
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:15,807
Storyworth

1647
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:16,831
F****** voice

1648
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:17,855
Is

1649
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:19,903
Integrate

1650
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:20,927
Yeah it's great

1651
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:25,791
DeBary grading but I could put up with

1652
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:26,559
He also like

1653
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:32,447
You're clearly trying to be funny in this isn't funny and I resent that

1654
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:34,751
You can't have a grating voice

1655
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:35,775
That is both

1656
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:37,055
Being smug

1657
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:39,871
And unfunny at the same time at me

1658
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:41,663
Without me wanting to throw up

1659
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:48,063
Yeah like that's brutal Patrick holiday 2016 of veteran

1660
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:49,087
I know

1661
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:49,855
I know

1662
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:53,183
That's got to be like an attempted self-effacing humor right

1663
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:59,071
No cuz he has a grading annoying smug voice

1664
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:00,607
It's

1665
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:02,399
Yeah it's interesting but

1666
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,167
In that way that's

1667
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:03,935
Really not in

1668
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:06,495
I just don't like it whenever they act

1669
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:08,031
Smug after like

1670
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:10,079
It is so many times they

1671
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:11,871
Just pratfall and then like

1672
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:13,151
From the

1673
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:16,479
Covered in bulshit that they stepped into

1674
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:18,527
I live on the ground looking up

1675
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:19,807
Hit me with a smug look like

1676
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:22,623
See I beat you like what are you doing

1677
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,647
You fell in s***

1678
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:24,415
He did

1679
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:27,231
Why are you doing the why you making me feel like I'm the

1680
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:30,815
So we going to be able to stand

1681
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:31,839
I don't know man

1682
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:32,863
I just get the sense

1683
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:33,887
That

1684
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:37,215
The run-up to this election isn't as fun for Alex as last time

1685
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:41,823
Play some of the hits with the satanic pedophile laptop

1686
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:42,591
Apps not working

1687
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:44,895
It's just

1688
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,943
Diminishing returns

1689
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:47,967
It's a bummer

1690
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:51,295
Steve wants to gay bash Jack

1691
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:52,319
For no reason

1692
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:54,879
I don't understand what's even going on

1693
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:58,463
I dunno what the kisses so weird because like

1694
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:02,815
When I when we were looking at our last episode 26

1695
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:05,375
I think that I could in 20

1696
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:07,935
Teen look at that episode and be like

1697
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:10,751
I understand everything that's happening

1698
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:11,519
In here

1699
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,799
Larry Nichols

1700
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:15,616
Who is pretending where I have inside information about

1701
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:19,200
I get it

1702
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:20,992
Everything follows rationally

1703
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:22,528
Or at least logically

1704
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,600
What's going on no

1705
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:30,208
I don't understand what the attempt is how they think that this is somehow benefiting

1706
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:31,488
Their side

1707
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:32,512
Like

1708
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:33,536
I don't know I mean

1709
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:38,144
Maybe it's just maybe I'm worn down on satanic panic but it just doesn't seem that at that Pope

1710
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,936
Don't anymore

1711
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:40,704
Buddy's worn-down

1712
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:44,288
I did it it just

1713
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,056
Feels like

1714
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:46,592
This

1715
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:48,384
Isn't going to move the needle

1716
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:49,920
People are tired of this

1717
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:52,224
I think everybody's

1718
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,272
Is in media-wise

1719
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:55,552
People who are covering the election

1720
01:20:55,808 --> 01:21:01,952
And it seems like everybody's in this one spot now where we're really not used to being where it's still there still two weeks to go

1721
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:05,024
And everybody has decided about 2 months

1722
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,048
Yeah

1723
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:08,096
You know so everybody everybody

1724
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:11,168
Trying to still make this like a thing that were Act

1725
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:13,472
Actively engaged where is

1726
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:16,544
My general Vibe of everyone is we're all just like

1727
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,824
I know what I'm going

1728
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,384
To do and now I'm waiting for two weeks

1729
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:21,920
See what all these other

1730
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:25,760
Yeah that is really strange

1731
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:28,320
I was listening to this episode Alex is like it's

1732
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:31,392
Two weeks till the election as like yeah it is

1733
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:32,160
That's weird

1734
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:35,232
Cuz I remember last time it being pretty in

1735
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:36,000
Intense

1736
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:38,560
All the way

1737
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:44,960
And I do still think that this is intense and as much as like the stakes are really high and it's a very important thing and people should have

1738
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:46,240
Sure I don't want to vote

1739
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:48,544
Shame anyone

1740
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,568
Like

1741
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:54,432
You're right I think I think you tapped into the feeling that I have to

1742
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:56,224
I don't know anybody

1743
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:57,760
Cuckoos at all

1744
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:58,528
Unclear

1745
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:01,600
He's waiting for the day we look there's

1746
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:02,880
Going to be no difference

1747
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:05,952
Between voting today and voting in 2 weeks

1748
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,024
And I want I want people to really like

1749
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:11,072
It is that bad

1750
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:12,608
Add it's that bad

1751
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:15,680
That we are now literally at a point now where I have

1752
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,448
To say

1753
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:20,800
If Joe Biden shot somebody in the f****** Street I'd be like

1754
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:21,824
Fine

1755
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:24,640
Will elect him put him into jail

1756
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:26,176
But at least not true

1757
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:27,712
Is that bad

1758
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,736
It really is

1759
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:31,808
Trumps

1760
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:36,672
Trump's words used against an aspiring dictator Georgia

1761
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:40,768
It's brutal I don't understand what could possibly have I mean obvious

1762
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:41,792
If you did shoot some

1763
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:43,328
I didn't f***

1764
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,912
If a demon popped out of a portal and went by

1765
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:47,680
That could be

1766
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:49,984
Redeeming all the way

1767
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:00,992
Provided presumably

1768
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:05,344
I don't like to talk about voting pattern

1769
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,648
The only thing it's going to shake that

1770
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:09,952
Is it the literal devil

1771
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:10,976
It is like

1772
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:12,256
Haha I'm the devil

1773
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,536
What provider

1774
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:17,376
But I got still have a truck I'll probably going to just kill myself

1775
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:25,568
Yeah

1776
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:27,360
I couldn't I couldn't handle

1777
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,176
But that's a happening of my brain

1778
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:36,064
Part of me would be like

1779
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:37,344
Alright well at least this

1780
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,624
Let's the other Shake

1781
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:44,000
Except for a little bit probably end up writing a sequel to the donut or something

1782
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:49,376
I'm confused

1783
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,144
By what

1784
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,168
Alex is doing

1785
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,240
Kinda interested

1786
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,008
And

1787
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:55,776
Checking

1788
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:57,056
The leader

1789
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:59,616
Couple days before the election in twenty

1790
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:00,384
16

1791
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:01,920
I really I wonder

1792
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:07,552
Like Alex presents this image of like I knew the Trump was going to win 100%

1793
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:08,320
Flappable

1794
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:12,160
I think I might go back and try and see the days

1795
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:12,928
Before the

1796
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:14,464
I remember

1797
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:16,000
M-46

1798
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:18,816
Before we started the show I wasn't watching Alex

1799
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:19,584
Constant

1800
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,864
Yeah you know that right

1801
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:24,192
I forgot that we didn't actually do like the lead-up

1802
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:28,288
Right in our first episode

1803
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:32,384
Beginning of right before the inauguration exactly

1804
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,688
Yeah mmm

1805
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:36,480
I was watching Alex a little bit just

1806
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:38,016
Out of morbid curiosity

1807
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:40,320
I meant I was also watching the debates

1808
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:46,208
Ambulation coverage Infowars the show as much

1809
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:47,744
I think that might be interesting

1810
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,072
Think so I might I might check in on that for Monday but

1811
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:53,888
I'm saying that you're cuz I wonder if he's doing the same

1812
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:55,168
Kite like the exact

1813
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:56,704
Kind of same thing

1814
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:58,496
Hello

1815
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:01,056
What do that for anyway I just need something

1816
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:01,824
To make me laugh

1817
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:02,592
Confused about

1818
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:03,360
What the f***

1819
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:04,384
What's going on in this week

1820
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,176
Well I've

1821
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:08,480
I think they're mad and they're lashing out because

1822
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:11,552
By all and every reasonable project

1823
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,088
Trump

1824
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:14,112
Is going to lose

1825
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:16,416
A free and fair election

1826
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:20,768
They're not there's no such thing as a secret reasonable Pole

1827
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:24,352
Exactly

1828
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,656
We do have a website it's not right.
