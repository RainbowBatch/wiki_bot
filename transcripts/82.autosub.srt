1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,776
Where couple dudes exit around

3
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:18,432
Is there a

4
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,992
Q&A session

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,576
A bird

6
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,600
What type of bird would

7
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:27,904
Furtado

8
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:31,488
She's like a bird so lonely fly away I don't

9
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:34,048
Nelly Furtado is a bird she's similar to one

10
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:34,816
Alright

11
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:38,400
Let's try again

12
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:46,336
You would be a burden of a lot about Alex to propaganda

13
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:52,992
And I would be like a rabbit

14
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,552
Jordans

15
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,600
Be going over a thrilling

16
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:01,440
Episode of my investigation into what happened to Alex

17
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:07,840
2015 Donald Trump for president

18
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:16,032
I think it's dumb or are you just are you done

19
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,336
I'm done

20
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,152
No I am I don't think we're done done

21
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,176
Let's say

22
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:27,552
Questions that I started this investigation with are officially a

23
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:31,392
Okay I don't have anymore questions about why Alex Jones

24
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,416
Join team Trump

25
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,208
Yep

26
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,488
Big part of it

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,512
Vladimir Putin

28
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,280
Wow

29
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:43,680
For those of you who've been following along to every at the last 17 install

30
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,984
Thought was going to be maybe two episodes

31
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,264
I thought 5

32
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,360
Where we last left off

33
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,640
In full

34
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,920
Support of Putin

35
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,992
Still not all the way

36
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:57,760
In support of Russia

37
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:04,672
Aleutian in the past

38
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,208
Three or four months

39
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,744
2015

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,304
Saying that he likes what he says but he doesn't trust

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,352
He doesn't think you can trust him because he's

42
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,888
Supported Hillary in the past

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,008
Bob connection

44
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,152
Geraldi's

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432
Alex Jones

46
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,456
Fully supports

47
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:30,272
Vladimir Putin and Russia and all of their action

48
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,040
In the world

49
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,600
Is clearly swayed by Russian propaganda

50
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
Yet

51
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,928
Supported

52
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,768
So also where we last left off

53
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,560
David Knight was hosting for about a week

54
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,840
So really the question

55
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,400
10 is like when does artiste

56
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,680
That is a question

57
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,448
That's pretty much

58
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240
Actually know the answer to that

59
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,800
Okay

60
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,336
It's pretty clear

61
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,384
Moment that happen

62
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,664
All the sudden Alex says

63
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:05,600
Spoiler alert little bit ahead of Russian State meeting

64
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:12,000
My cards too hard

65
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,768
The date

66
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,584
October 27th 2015

67
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,864
To November 9th

68
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,144
2017

69
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,912
L2050

70
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,936
About two years

71
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,032
And it would involve

72
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:31,200
Before we get into our investigation today in earnest

73
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:37,600

Also I need to make this announcement we've been flirting and teasing around the idea of something big coming

89
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,367
Here's what it is

90
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,695
We are now going to be broadcasting live

91
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,767
Every night at 8 p.m. central

92
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,047
Not every night

93
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,095
Monday through Thursday at least

94
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,935
Brett from 8?

95
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,471
Live on the internet

96
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,543
Video audio all of it

97
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,079
You can find our feed

98
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,151
Start TV / knowledge fight

99
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,991
We are going to be going over current-day Alex Jones

100
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,551
Keeping up with what bulshit key spelling

101
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:15,903
Everyday we're going to try and make this this knowledge fight more robust

102
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,207
Take it into the infowar

103
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,231
Arena

104
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:25,887
You're very excited so excited

105
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,167
Very excited

106
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:27,935
It's Freight

107
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:34,335
For years and years I've wanted to do a first of all alive thing I wanted to do a radio show

108
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
Ability

109
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,919
To take calls and stuff like that

110
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,247
Like this possibility that we can

111
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,783
Get it into that

112
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,183
Sort of thing as opposed to us sitting around for 3 hours and then releasing it the next day or at

113
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
Because

114
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,863
With the with the 20s

115
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,887
15 investigation

116
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,239
No fine we released it two days later and

117
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,079
Present-day episode

118
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:11,967
You release it the next time you're like what

119
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:18,367
Exactly like how the New York Times in the washing

120
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
Composer like

121
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,671
Trump is great now

122
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:27,583
Lunatic but he's an independent not

123
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,399
Another one

124
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,959
Compelled to do this now because

125
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,751
Enter really interesting.

126
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,287
That will tap

127
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,823
Alex Jones is

128
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
The Donald Trump

129
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,407
Because of the debt ceiling situation

130
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:45,503
People saying the Trump is he's a true independent he's working with the Democrats

131
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:50,623
Can hate people I hate the Great

132
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,159
But it's

133
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:56,255
The mind-boggling thing is like I kind of get it because

134
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:57,791
Dude

135
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,583
We have a Nazi in the White House

136
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,399
Everyday be like

137
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,423
Guys not

138
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
He's a Nazi

139
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,263
Nothing at are you paying attention

140
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:12,127
So they're just trying to get like a a different narrative

141
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:18,527
It much like we end up being a lot of the time with Alex

142
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,671
Alex's fine today

143
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,839
Is it true independent now he's right right

144
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,631
Working with the Democrats

145
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,167
F*** you watching

146
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,471

Take phone calls

169
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,671
Call Landon said having to come all the way over here

All the way over here from my girlfriend

Get to the investigation that's what people want to hear they want to hear some Alex Jones

172
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,727
Yeah I don't know if they do

173
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,895
Like a review on iTunes

174
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,455
Too much Alex Jones love the guys talk

175
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,991
Hate it with Alex Jones

176
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,551
Why is this Alex Jones Show

177
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,391
We're starting on the 27th

178
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,415
This is coming off

179
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:38,815
A good almost week of David Knight hosting lilacs is on a vacation with people

180
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,887
Navigating it something

181
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,703
But you never says what and it's unimportant

182
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,775
The 27th Alex Jones shows back up

183
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,311
How to get sonair

184
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:55,711
It's one of the least inspired 3 hours of broadcasting I've ever heard in my life

185
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,527
If you look at my notes this episode sucks

186
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
You just as like

187
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,183
I was walking around the mountain

188
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,463
Panda

00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,999
People love me

190
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,631
Just kept coming up to me and Alex

191
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:18,239
I don't appreciate of the common people I

192
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,567
Yeah it's so I don't have any

193
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,335
Parable

194
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,359
An episode

195
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,663
Part of the body of it

196
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,735
Is the interview with the guy who's the vitamin lawyer

197
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
The vitamin

198
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,855
Yes Galaxy supplements illegal

199
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,207
Couch

200
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:43,071
Like illegals TSA

201
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,375
And we move along to the 28th

202
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,399
Which is where we will start

203
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
Earnest

204
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,447
Alex Jones

205
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
DC

206
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
Brigade

207
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:55,359
Really don't like political correctness

208
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,383
Terrible

209
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,687
Starts off the show

210
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:05,087
A list off a number of political correctness grievances that he has I want you to keep track of how many

211
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,719
Free Speech now on the campuses

212
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:21,983
Call people out a bunch of bullets

213
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,543
Bullies

214
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:28,895
Political correctness

215
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,967
It's going.

216
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,015
Does Caitlyn Jenner

217
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,855
You are not

218
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,719
You are not

219
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,791
Mother father yes I am

220
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,703
I don't care

221
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,007
None of those are real

222
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,311
None of those are real thing

223
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,847
When you hear

224
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,127
People on camps

225
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
Campuses are

226
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,967
Eating to see who can destroy more

227
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
Of the language

228
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,295
I remember what I was

229
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,575
College

230
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:17,535
No one was able to use any of verbs

231
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,399
IHOP

232
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,471
Passive voice

233
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,871
Make it a noun god dammit

234
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,431
That's what I did in college

235
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,711
I don't know if I was

236
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,783
But also

237
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,623
Applying all Scrabble

238
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,415
No proper nouns

239
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
Talking about it any given

240
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:54,143
No capitalization

241
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
This is

242
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,447
But I do

243
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:07,455
I see a debate team like a debate competition where you got three people on either side one of them blocks up to a podium

244
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,551
Here's why we shouldn't use the word mother

245
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:13,855
Cuz it's dumb

246
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:17,439
Next

247
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
Mothers are

248
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:27,167
I love those mother and I will raise

249
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:33,567
We shouldn't use the word mom

250
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,127
Mom

251
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,407
Call Mom

252
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,199
Totally fine

253
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,991
So fascinated by his ideas

254
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,807
You telling me dress like Caitlyn Jenner

255
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,575
I'm going to

256
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,975
I don't think he does

257
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:55,839
Yeah I think he's like I can't people are saying that you can't mock trans people

258
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
Thor costume

259
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,655
And either I will

260
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,215
Around Halloween

261
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:07,103
At this point that's why that was

262
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,639
On a real tear

263
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,687
About misunderstanding why

264
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,271
Mc4 minority group costumes are inappropriate

265
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,039
He's like

266
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,319
Taco party

267
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,767
It's bit more wisely.

268
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:32,959
Don't turn a group into a costume

269
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,287
No we're not saying

270
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,943
And also you are criticizing Obamacare

271
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,247
Also known as ever said you can't use a brown

272
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:51,647
The guy in Seattle the terminology brown bag was it

273
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,463
Has a racially-charged history and that's true

274
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:58,559
You can still use Brown Bags if you want

275
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,839
The brown bag

276
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,375
Themselves that are the

277
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,399
Problem no

278
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,423
No you can't

279
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,959
You can't be angry at a bag

280
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,031
No we can't we can't spend this much time on One Clip we got some

281
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:16,223
We're coming to telling me I can't defend myself I will

282
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,527
Let me tell you something

283
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:24,671
I don't know

284
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,743
I'll see you in hell

285
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,423
Alex Jones that has found out that the Southern Poverty Law Center

286
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,471
Has put out a new article

287
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,895
From the

288
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:50,015
Demonizing the conspiracy myths

289
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,439
Imaginary situation

290
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,023
Call Margie

291
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,071
The imaginary

292
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:03,839
Paradise

293
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:13,567
That there is an agenda 21 to restrict resources so the Southern Poverty Law Center put out a long article

294
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,639
Debunking a ton of Alex Jones of narrative

295
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:21,759
Specifically targeted at Alex Jones these are these right-wing

296
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
Curious.

297
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,647
Already

298
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,695
F******

299
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,231
F*** you guys

300
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
Love

301
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
The conservative

302
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,839
The splc because it's always like

303
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:44,543
Support for people and free speech and Alexa

304
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:51,199
Just like the ACLU

305
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,991
Do a lot of good work

306
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,015
They represent a lot of pee

307
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,087
People who

308
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:01,439
It's need to get to Too Much depth

309
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,719
It's not like he's starting

310
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,743
Free People

311
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,279
Pay attention to the narrative

312
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,815
Puts out

313
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,447
He's starting to get a little bit scared of his own position

314
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,199
We could have pointed out

315
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,991
Much closer to real time

316
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
How much

317
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,295
He is just supporting Rush

318
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,599
And I don't think people did a good job of

319
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,159
Expressing that back then

320
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,487
You were telling me this later earlier

321
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,511
Which is like

322
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,303
If it was

323
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,095
Something where

324
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
It was much

325
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
More prevalent

326
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:46,495
On what

327
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,263
Pay attention

328
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,031
But because

329
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:48,799
Kind of Justice

330
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,567
Small part of

331
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,847
Every broadcast

332
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,383

Barbecue does believe

337
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,791
He's influencing Russia

338
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,119
Belief

339
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,191
You know when you're getting trick that's how you rationalize

340
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,215
You're being

341
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,055
Do you think like

342
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:25,151
I won the first round in this guy

343
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,943
And then you turn around and disappear

344
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,711
It's too easy

345
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:32,319
That's that's exactly what's going on I can't wait

346
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,879

Easter videos funny

357
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,871
But the rest of it is not funny at all

358
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,919
It's Alex proving he's kind of a dick

359
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,991
The story he tells might not be

360
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:04,319
Be true also story is true

361
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,599

00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:10,975
Dick needs to mind his own goddamn business here some parents

363
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,047

Such and such

367
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:30,943
Baby just died it was just a year old and

00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,511
I didn't exist

371
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,559
I used to take people's kids

372
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,887
I should take people to other children when they had a sudden infant death

373
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,703
They claimed it was shaking

374
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,079

380
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,031
And all the time I heard about

381
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,591
Yeah

382
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,407
Other

383
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,631
Most autistic

384
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,167
Children

385
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,239
1%

386
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,263
Country

387
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:06,175
And they almost always decline

388
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:10,271
After they don't talk for a few days

389
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:22,560
Lobotomy

390
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:26,144
Feels real good

391
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:36,896
Ready for those preemies 7 months 8 months 6 months they're fine they're breathing they're getting better

392
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:41,248
After their couple days doctor comes

393
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,320
Relations full regimen

394
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,600
7 shots

395
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,416
And the nurses back doctor

396
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,976
Bioethics board

397
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,560
They're going to stop breathing summer going to die the doctor says

398
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,864
You know policy

399
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:03,264
I can't miss shots dumb shut down the spot other still on the respirators

400
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,848
Bottom can't make it because we're at 11 country

401
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,664
Arab country

402
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,784
But he's relish

403
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,880
To a lady whose

404
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,512
I know

405
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,584
Your baby just died but let me tell you

406
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,864
And also

407
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,168
I don't care about your baby

408
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,984
I just want to push my agenda

409
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,384
Useful situation for me to lie to you

410
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,224
Some of these

411
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:48,064
It creates in my head the idea for a cartoon

412
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,880
Where it's just Alex

413
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,416
Buddy at the people's business

414
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,208
You got talk about baby

415
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,816
Call my babies in the hospital

416
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,120
I mean

417
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,680
Something like that

418
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:09,824
Nosy-ass anti-vaxxer cartoon Alex Jones is kind of funny but in the real world it's not

419
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:16,480
I love the idea anytime a baby goes into the hospital he

420
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,248
Thinks it's vaccine

421
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,576
Yeah not like well baby resistance

422
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,112
Babies

423
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,160
Okay if you're looking for

424
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:27,232
Babies were stolen by f******

425
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
Coyotes

426
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,048
But I'm done with

427
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,840
Fish it if you hate

428
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:34,400
Hospitals and medical science

429
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,960
F****** don't go and shut

430
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:41,056
The fuk up a couple of things that we should discuss just in terms of

431
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,592
His bulshit narratives

432
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,944
Attached

433
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,224
Or in any way related

434
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,992
Vaccination

435
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,296
There are a couple studies has been

436
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,576
Thoroughly debunked

437
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,600
Junk science

438
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,880
They didn't follow the science

439
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,440
Inclusions that work there to be

440
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,512
Concluded

441
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,840
Conspiracy theory that the vaccines cause autism is Italy

442
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,400
Nothing they kill your kids

443
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:09,216
Dump will now that's

444
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:10,240
Premature babies

445
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,264
7 shot

446
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:17,920
Another another interesting issue a lot of people believe anti-vaccination things

447
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,944
Because of court case

448
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:19,968
Should have been one

449
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,272
By people whose children have been hurt by the

450
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:26,624
There's a thing called the national vaccine injury compensation

451
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,392
Sensation

452
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,184
There's a vaccine Court

453
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,976
That was specially setup

454
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,024
This court is rigged

455
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,304
In favor of people make

456
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,864
Intentionally so

457
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,888
Because

458
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,168
The government w

459
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,704
To pay people

460
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,240
Not to silence them

461
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,032
But they want to make it easier

462
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,336
Sensation for being hurt

463
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,616
Buy vaccine

464
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,640
Because there is

465
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,200
Negative side effects

466
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,624
Probably this court doesn't necessarily need you to prove scientifically that the vaccine cause

467
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,696
Your baby to be hurt or to die they just

468
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,744
Need to have a preponderance of the evidence

469
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,536
Like it's a civil court

470
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:10,144
And so there have been court cases that have come through the n v i c p

471
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,680
And people have

472
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,520
Science has proven this thing

473
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,288
Winning

474
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,080
Just something that was set up

475
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,384
In order to compensate people for their loss

476
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,920
Without proving science

477
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
Typically anything

478
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:25,248
Now this is something that's super into

479
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,296
Sing to me

480
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,880
Government they set it up specifically that way

481
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,696
Here here

482
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,000
Complained

483
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:39,584
Is that whatever you talk about vaccines and killing babies

484
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,240
Read the insert it says it can cause diabetes or whatever

485
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:52,640
Aspirin bottle

486
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,176
No fault situation

487
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:54,944
For Zach's

488
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:59,296
In terms of like drug companies won't be held responsible

489
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,344
For vaccines Bedford

490
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:07,488
And that's done also intentionally by the government and I'll read this article on science blogs.com

491
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,304
History

492
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:15,168
In the early 1980s in the report publicized by a news report

493
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:18,496
And later a book by Harris Coulter and Barbara Lowe Fisher

494
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:21,056
I called DPT a shot in the dark

495
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:26,176
That the wholesale DPT vaccine was linked

496
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,456
Encephalitis

497
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:33,088
Hop lot of product liability lawsuits was on the verge of bringing the US vaccine program to its me

498
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,392
Later studies exonerated

499
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,464
Especially a large case-control study

500
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,280
But those studies did not come out until the 19th

501
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,328
Even though existing evidence of the

502
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,168
It did not clearly rule one out

503
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,728
As a result vaccine manufacturers heading

504
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,520
Increasingly difficult difficult

505
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,800
Obtaining liability

506
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:56,128
More and more of them stop making Wholesale Depot

507
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:56,896
Vaccine

508
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,712
Congress ultimately was forced to intervene past

509
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,016
The national childhood vaccine injury Act

510
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,296
1980s

511
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,600
Which established the Federal no faults

512
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,136
Compensate victims

513
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:07,904
Of injury

514
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,440
Recalls by mandated vaccine

515
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,720
So

516
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:13,024
There's a situation where people

517
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,304
That's a good thing

518
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,400
4 people could not prove nor disprove a link

519
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,704
Between a vaccine and

520
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,800
F****** weight into

521
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,736
Connection if you destroy company

522
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,552
You destroy the progress of science

523
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,088
The people could end up getting

524
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:41,440
People might have taken down an industry

525
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,976
But they almost

526
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,256
And the government had to

527
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:46,048
Step in to create these courts

528
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:52,448
And to create this no-fault system so intentionally they set it up

529
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,752
So the people who make the vaccine wouldn't

530
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,312
Be punished in the off-chance of these

531
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,336
Hammocks

532
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,640
Yeah that they might not be guilty of

533
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,176
And the government would pay everything

534
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,456
Yeah so it is

535
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,248
Actually a good system

536
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:09,856
It's a very good system but people use things that are found

537
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,928
That are not

538
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,744
Civil cases basically

539
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,024
Treat them as if they are sick

540
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,584
I'd like the one that Coretta Scott King

541
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:29,824
So the other uses there is he says the 80

542
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,896
Plus percent of the autistic people are male

543
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,920
That is

544
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,688
Bananas

545
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:38,272
Well it's accept this is also super interesting if you look into it

546
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,064
The reason that there is

547
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,392
That most autistic people are male

548
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,232
Classify

549
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,256
Boys and girls

550
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,280
There's a two-prong

551
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,072
That's a piece of one of

552
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,888
What issues is in the early days

553
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,912
Autism

554
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,448
Almost

555
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,240
Everybody they studied were do

556
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,544
That's how both

557
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
Pacific studies

558
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,616
But especially in the case of

559
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,408
And one of the reasons for that

560
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,944
Is because the weight male

561
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,248
Autism

562
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,784
Is incredibly obvious

563
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,344
Symptoms are

564
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
More

565
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,416
Clear

566
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,208
There have been

567
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,768
People who

568
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:23,072
One of the leading theories about that

569
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:28,704
Is that women have whether it's sociologically in Grain or

570
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,008
Have a higher ability to mimic

571
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
Social cues

572
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,592
Amer able2know

573
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,640
Instinctively what's appropriate

574
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,920
And not scream out in

575
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,688
It like that

576
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,968
Beyond that

577
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,736
Studies have

578
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,296
Started to be done that are in Decatur

579
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,064
That

580
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,696
Stuff like anorexia nervosa self-harm social anxiety views more feminine

581
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,720
Related

582
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,744
Conditions

583
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,304
Will know I mean all those things

584
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,632
Males can have but there is

585
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,400
Women

586
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:01,728
People are starting to understand and look at it from the perspective of

587
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,496
Those

588
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,776
Is our female autistic

589
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,312
Symptoms right they may not

590
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,080
Habanero

591
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,872
Right

592
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,640
Recalled Naruto

593
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,944
Okay

594
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,712
Okay

595
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,480
Yeah I would

596
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,248
Come in that forever

597
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,016
Well

598
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,064
Beyond that those are some of the reasons Alex's

599
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,600
So

600
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,136
He's full of s*** but also

601
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,160
More importantly

602
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,440
People f******

603
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:25,280
Especially if they're big

604
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,072
Do your f******

605
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,352
Lyft get out of there

606
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:31,168
So just take on

607
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:31,936
Science

608
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:37,568
And he has no understanding of some of the nuances of

609
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,360
But they'll let's get

610
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,384
To him discussing

611
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,152
Houston

612
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,712
In terms of the product

613
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,736
Sal's

614
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,512
What

615
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,304
So that sucks

616
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:08,704
Yep as long as you drink 67 oz of olive oil in lay on your right side for an hour

617
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:15,104
No good

618
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,432
If you are on

619
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,456
Take 46

620
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,576
Talk to your doctor before you get a chance

621
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,696
Green and black stones come out of

622
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:36,608
You don't want to tell them

623
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:39,424
Just put them right on a desk

624
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,448
Can be like

625
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,520
Good

626
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:48,128
So what's going on with Leann

627
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,688
Has been

628
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,456
St.Louis

629
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:54,016
Where there is a fire burning Underground

630
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,296
Near nuclear waste

631
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,832
Or something along those lines

632
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:00,672
Skype going

633
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:03,232
I think I vaguely recall the story

634
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,792
I'm not sure if they're angle on it is a crack

635
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,560
I don't care

636
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:09,120
Because they can never get her Skype connection

637
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:09,888
Together

638
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,472
I will go to Leanne and Medicaid

639
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,288
So the app says over and over again

640
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,616
Like as if

641
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,920
He thinks she's going to die

642
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:25,504
To clear himself over and over again

643
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,416
Every single time he brings it up he points out it wasn't my idea

644
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,208
Cuz he picks just going to go bad

645
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,536
And they can never get around

646
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,584
Of course they have sex

647
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,608
In a bar across

648
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,144
Might as well

649
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,520
We have a visit from

650
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,544
George Noory

651
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,080
Coasttocoastam

652
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,616
Alright As We Know

653
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:54,176
Coasttocoastam

654
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,456
From

655
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,736
I think it's like midnight

656
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,272
3 a.m. or something like that

657
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,344
They talk about aliens

658
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,880
They talk about Ancient Aliens

659
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,184
Love it. You talk about all that

660
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,000
Pyramids hologram probably talk about

661
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,840
Probably talk about

662
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,864
I imagine

663
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:19,520
Middle Eastern Arrow

664
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,920
And the reason he's on

665
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,456
Might surprise you

666
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,736
We have forgot

667
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,760
Morality

668
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:36,416
And what this country was all about that and I think it's just crazy Alex

669
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,488
As a nation inducing

670
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,096
White screen

671
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,120
The

672
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:48,448
Presidential push to try to get me to run for office

673
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:54,848
You are absolutely right

674
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:58,432
But I'm really independent

675
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,200
However

676
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:04,320
If you can run for president of the United States you really have to be a Democrat or

677
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,856
Nando's party

678
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:11,232
Because that's what Carter's the biggest faults

679
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:16,352
There has been a group

680
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:20,448
I did consider that

681
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:24,288
But have to take a leave from Coast-to-Coast and I'm not sure I want to do that

682
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:29,664
I probably could

683
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,272
Call car service.

684
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:43,744
The listeners

685
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,536
The debates not a chance

686
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,376
Coast to Coast

687
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:55,264
A.m.

688
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,592
What's the Nielsen ratings of radio shows Indiana

689
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,408
He is going to easily win

690
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,176
The Democratic

691
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,480
Even though he is

692
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,504
Not a republic

693
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,112
Kenora Democrat libertarian we all know how Democrats

694
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,648
Love libertarian

695
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,976
He's non-partisan

696
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:18,816
Even real

697
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:25,728
Reality is a couple things that he believes it would fly over well with the Democratic Party

698
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,752
Denomination

699
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,800
Bluelivesmatter

700
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,872
Make perfect

701
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:38,272
Everybody loves thrilled with those positions

702
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,832
Yelling all the time about how we

703
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,880
We need fewer vaccinations

704
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:45,440
Unless oversight of police

705
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,208
Guys

706
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,744
I'm going to announce my camp

707
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,792
For president right now in

708
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,816
In 2020

709
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:53,632
My main platform will be bring back polio

710
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,728
Big polio white predicate

711
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,544
Can't pronounce

712
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,568
But

713
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,640
So George Noory

714
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,944
He expands some of his position

715
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,736
One of them

716
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:13,088
Get rid of income taxes just make it available

717
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,624
No fire station

718
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:18,720
If your house burns down you better

719
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:22,560
A tip on hand for the fire department

720
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,352
Remember

721
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:27,424
Damn that there was a time in our history where they're actually

722
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,472
Competing Fire Department

723
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,032
Sabotage each other

724
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,056
Worcester burn down

725
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,080
You had to

726
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:40,480
And if your neighbor bought fire insurance they would protect your neighbor's house from the fire of your

727
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,320
F****** insane competition

728
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,856
Pre-market

729
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:50,720
Prosperity libertarianism as a whole is like

730
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:55,328
The elements of a we've done before elements

731
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:58,144
You're wrong

732
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,168
Prove it

733
00:37:59,424 --> 00:37:59,936
Scientific

734
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,216
Clear mathematically

735
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,496
We can just go back

736
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,288
15 years and he likes me

737
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,312
This is what happened

738
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,336
When the dump

739
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,360
Believe

740
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,384
It's actually practice

741
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,992
We'll figure it out better technology

742
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:17,856
Piece of George noory's campaign is about

743
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,136
Empi defense

744
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,416
Alright okay

745
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:28,352
Inordinate amount of time talking about how vulnerable

746
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,888

774
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,512

794
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,200
And that is

795
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,736
CNBC

00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:58,880
Republican primary debate and if you recall

00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:01,184

807
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,304
Pretty much instantly

808
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,400
This is a Polaroid moment

809
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:46,240
Where you don't have to wait more than just a few seconds

810
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:49,312
After the debate I was sitting there watching it with family

811
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,360
And children

812
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,455
And even let me

813
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,135
My thirteen-year-old son

814
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:09,535
Watching the coverage

815
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:12,351

00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,143

00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,191
Do that

818
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,751
And my children said

819
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:26,175
The reporters

820
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,063
And trying to make

821
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,903
Republican look stupid

822
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,695
But they looked stupid

823
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,487
They didn't show

824
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,791
My thirteen-year-old had to say about it

825
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:45,887
In-depth analysis from a 13 year old

826
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:47,935
Good work

827
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:51,263
So do your multiplication homework

828
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:56,383
I let my seven-year-old daughter watch one of the most homophobic

829
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,663
Racist

830
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:03,551
Things that I could possibly allow her to watch a bunch of

831
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,087
A f******

832
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,391
People more

833
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,927
That's what that debate was

834
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,463
The contest

835
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,255
To see who could destroy more length

836
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:15,327
If you remember this has been on it

837
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,887
Infowars

838
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:21,727
You're way past parents

839
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,007
You're right

840
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,287
Alex has more to say

841
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,479
Into the issues that they communicated

842
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,807
Three-year-old kid thought okay

843
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,111
He wants to critique the media

844
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,135
And how they behave

845
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,463
You can really tell there's something he wants

846
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,231
Disabled

847
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:49,375

Softball questions

849
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:57,055
The Republicans

850
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,335
Control

851
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,127
Was crystal

852
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:00,895
Clear

853
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:05,247
That this was all rigged attempt

854
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,783
To derail

855
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,879
Was a fiasco

856
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,415
It was a disaster

857
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,951
It was a train wreck

858
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:16,511
It was an implosion

859
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,791
For them

860
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:18,815

They are the deceivers

886
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,479
They are the enemy

What you're feeling

898
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:18,879
Alex

You're an idiot

900
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,951
I agree with what you

901
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,791
But what you mean is dumb

902
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:30,143
I don't agree with what you mean but you're literally point is correct

903
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:35,775

Interesting now little parallel there

00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,975
I'm going to skip this

909
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:56,511
I will say

910
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,047
The one thing that

911
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:58,815
He is

912
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,863
We write about

913
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:01,887
Is the

914
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,679
During the campaign

915
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,983
Media

916
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:09,567
Failed us on a level I don't think I've ever seen

917
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,127
Ara

918
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:17,247
All the all the blame we want to put on the

919
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,271
Nazis

920
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,599
The media wanting a story

921
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,903

Campaign wanting that horse race big

923
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,999
Problem and one of the big read

924
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,023
The Trump was elected

925
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,399
Asking Trump question

926
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,935
Like Direct

927
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:38,495
What teams are now if somebody just asked Trump

928
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,287
What something means like

929
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,311
Trump

930
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,359
What is what does DACA

931
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,127

Stop talking about

937
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,975
How he sounded

938
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,767
And started talking about how

939
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:01,535
He knows

940
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,559
F****** nothing

941
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,863

No Quarter

943
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:14,591
Course not just because

944
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,639
Critiques of the media doesn't mean we agree

945
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,967
That

946
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,247

Creon wife

949
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:30,463
It's just Alex saying that he got his dad to retire because of Obamacare and now he works for him

950
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:33,791
That makes sense

951
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:42,751
Contradicts himself within a span of a couple seconds

952
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:43,519
Waterbeds

953
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:47,103

959
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,823
Let's go undercover and expose it

960
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,103
Talking points

961
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,023
Hiring people that love freedom

962
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:39,327
Like I would hate it if he was hiring

963
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,863
People who are

964
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:41,631
F****** faccia

965
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:45,215
Hiring people who add

966
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:45,983
Vacated harsh

967
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:46,751
Against

968
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:47,519
Any kind

969
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,335
Oversight from the government

970
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,127
Terrible terrible

971
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:54,431
Rehired

972
00:49:54,943 --> 00:50:00,575
This investigation is supposed to be about how Alex Jones ended up

973
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,855
In the presidential campaign

974
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:07,231
We need to cover some of the stuff that I don't want to cover about this

975
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:10,815
Cuz these clips I don't like to listen to Ted Cruz talk

976
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,119
Steel yourself

977
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:16,959
Because we're going to have to listen to Ted Cruz talk a little bit in this next clip

978
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,983
Iamzoie

979
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:22,591
Didn't critique it on the other side but it's interesting to hear how Alex treats Ted Cruz

980
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,127
At this point in history

981
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,175
He has a boner

982
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:34,879
Corrupt mainstream media

983
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:35,647
Patron

984
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,839
First one

985
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,399
Supporting Isis

986
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:48,959
Facial sports that's a problem

987
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:58,943
Really has delivered

988
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:08,927
Compromise

989
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:17,119
Washington created

990
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:22,751
American voters

991
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:28,383
Let me say something at the outset the questions that have been asked so far in this debate

992
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:34,783
Illustrate why the American people don't trust the media

993
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:37,087
Kill me

994
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:41,439
Let me see

995
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,743
The question that I was asked

996
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:44,767
I don't want

997
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,815
Answer because I had a big party

998
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:51,935
Forcing a government shutdown really don't want

999
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:52,703
Whataburger

1000
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,983
Things I did was

1001
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,287
Lower the credit rating of the entire

1002
00:51:56,799 --> 00:52:00,895
Black president

1003
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:01,663
Complaining about

1004
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,687
The national debt

1005
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:05,247
I have ensured that it will be higher

1006
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,039
Now

1007
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,575
In fairness

1008
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:11,391
In Ultimate fairness

1009
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:14,975
That question was phrased a little aggressive.

1010
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:18,815
Don't get me wrong question is valid

1011
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:24,959
I'm not I'm not partial here

1012
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:27,519
Are you trying

1013
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:30,591
Well the governor government its function

1014
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:31,615
People like

1015
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,919
You don't want the government to Funk

1016
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,991
Are you an a****** you want to grab

1017
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:41,087
Make the government not work

1018
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:43,647
Does that preclude

1019
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:45,951
And because he can't answer that question

1020
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,999
You have to grandstand at

1021
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:52,351
Flip it on the media

1022
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:57,471
Yeah absolutely and gets a break because everybody at the Republic

1023
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,495
Intubate it's f******

1024
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:06,943
And you look at the questions Donald Trump

1025
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:10,015
Are you

1026
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:16,415
Snow tubing timing

1027
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:23,583
Never seen any pants

1028
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:49,439
Clear

1029
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:56,351
The men and women on this stage.

1030
00:53:56,607 --> 00:54:02,239
Where is Vicksburg

1031
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:08,639
And nobody

1032
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:35,519
What you think

1033
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:53,951
I skipped the breakers so important

1034
00:54:55,743 --> 00:55:00,863
This is how they try to control the narrative that's how people act like babies

1035
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:01,631
If that's how we

1036
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:06,239
Tried to control the narrative

1037
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:08,031
Control the narrative

1038
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,663
But it would still like

1039
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:18,527
Hey there was talking to it

1040
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,295
You're like okay

1041
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:25,695
Because you're a f****** idiot your child

1042
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:30,047
You're going

1043
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:34,655
It's a situation where the question might have been framed for Leo

1044
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:39,007
Did poorly but it gives an opportunity for you to rise above it and defend yourself

1045
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:46,175
Issue that clearly a lot of people think you're a f****** dick about

1046
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:53,087
Even to the end when the time is up he plays victim

1047
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:59,487
They're not going to give it more time

1048
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,047
You don't want to talk about something

1049
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:06,655
Cuz we're all

1050
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:08,959
Super rich

1051
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:10,239
Right where the super rich

1052
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:17,407
Carino's

1053
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:23,551
You guys just want to say insult each other you don't want to ask Gustafson

1054
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,575
Question

1055
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:26,623
Admitted

1056
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:28,415
It was

1057
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,695
I am not going to answer

1058
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:35,583
Ted Cruz

1059
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,679
The nails on a chalkboard

1060
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:43,519
As a human being they're legitimately should not be live audio

1061
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:46,079
I think Cody's debate

1062
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,359
Like it's that's a mess

1063
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:51,967
Cuz you can just Pandora and do it like that

1064
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:52,991
Time if your

1065
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:56,575
Why are you stopping for Applause break

1066
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,623
You're not using your time properly

1067
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:01,695
Because you were screaming

1068
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,487
I was very

1069
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:08,863
In the middle of the cruise is the best on his feet of any statement I've ever seen

1070
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:09,887
God-killer

1071
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,679
Sitter that with it

1072
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:12,447
6 months

1073
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:13,983
He will

1074
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:18,079
Join in on the Ted Cruz's dad killed JFK

1075
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:18,847
Well that's true

1076
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:22,687
Fart

1077
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:24,479
Quickly that's amazing

1078
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,247
Sing to me

1079
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:26,783
That doesn't

1080
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:30,367
Hey when you don't believe in anything

1081
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:34,207
You don't have to worry about whether or not your positions

1082
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:40,607
We got to get through of this debate

1083
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,375
S***

1084
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:46,239
Alex screaming about Melissa harris-perry because

1085
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:49,567
There's a part

1086
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,663
As I recalled the setting was

1087
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:55,199
Confirmation hearings

1088
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,735
Paul Ryan

1089
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,015
Baby speaker

1090
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,807
Alex

1091
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,855
Spinning reel fun yarn about that

1092
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:08,255
Cuz all of us Liberty people

1093
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:12,863
And we're going to get one of our guys in there cuz we have

1094
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:20,031
This doesn't mean that we can put them in but he's on a short leash

1095
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:23,359
You want me to get out of there

1096
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,127
Sick of it

1097
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,919
Pennsbury smart

1098
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:29,503
Very clearly had a million-dollar offer on the table

1099
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:35,903
So this is really takes all day

1100
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,695
People all day

1101
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,975
I could leave

1102
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:41,791
And get millions of dollars

1103
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,583
And no don't care what I'm doing

1104
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,143
Not have to worry about it

1105
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:49,471
Confirmation hearings

1106
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:52,031
Call Ryan

1107
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:52,799
These hard-working

1108
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:55,615
Stop

1109
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,407
To say like

1110
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:00,223
I agree with you and I think Paul Ryan is a good choice

1111
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:04,831
Whatever I think of the word hardworking I want to be careful about language

1112
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:06,367
Because it brings up

1113
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,903
To me an image of

1114
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,695
Slaves in a field

1115
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:12,255
And that is the definition of hard-working for me

1116
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:15,071
What I think she was getting at first of all I don't

1117
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,607
Necessarily agree with how she makes

1118
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:17,631
This points

1119
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:24,031
I think that might be a little bit of a linguistic stretch in terms of bringing unrelated issues in and what have you

1120
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,311
I think the point that she's making his

1121
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:26,847
I hate all of us

1122
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,383
We're not really that hard work

1123
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:31,199
In the grand scheme of things

1124
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:34,271
Clear about what we do

1125
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:37,087
She's going to go to 100%

1126
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,111
But Alex is

1127
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:38,879
Furious

1128
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:41,695
Start ranting here it goes

1129
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,463
A couple minutes

1130
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:44,767
And then weaves into some Ben Carson

1131
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,791
Some stuff in the debate

1132
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,583
And it's really important

1133
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,375
Did we get the entire

1134
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,399
Text leading up to this

1135
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,679
Cuz where it ends

1136
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:53,983
And what's making Alex really mad

1137
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,007
Is fascinating

1138
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,031
I will get to it

1139
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:23,679
You tell me I got to drink

1140
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:42,623
Are you

1141
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:45,439
Break her conditioning

1142
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:47,999
Like Gary Oldman only unprofessional

1143
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,863
God's creation

1144
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:58,239
Are God's real

1145
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:03,103
Nice pivot from God God is God

1146
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,303
Yeah you do have it

1147
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:24,095
Either

1148
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,375
I am a liberal

1149
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:32,799
Miami pro-freedom

1150
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:40,735
You carry nightmare soviet-style brainwashing

1151
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:46,367
You are a mess

1152
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:56,607
I'm not stupid I know full well your clips

1153
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:57,375
I have to say here

1154
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:04,287
People pull off your garbage everybody knows

1155
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:13,247
Informational I will destroy you and your onward I don't need violence

1156
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:18,111
Yeah

1157
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:25,279
Living together

1158
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:29,887
No blacks

1159
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,727
That's what you don't want to

1160
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:38,079
As a social engineer eugenicist

1161
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:46,527
Great moderator questions

1162
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:50,879
JetBlue

1163
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,927
Nutritional supplements

1164
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,719
Relationship

1165
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:18,527
And this is what happened

1166
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:33,375
I think it's a good product

1167
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:04,095
No you are

1168
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:35,583
On purpose

1169
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:42,495
Wow

1170
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:56,319
Yeah he gets off air during the little 72nd commercial break

1171
01:04:57,343 --> 01:05:01,183
I think the reason he's really mad is because

1172
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,463
The context

1173
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:05,279
Being critiqued about isn't nutritional

1174
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:08,351
He knows that that's what he does

1175
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:11,423
And he knows that he's kind of vulnerable

1176
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:15,775
Damn goes out all the other night

1177
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:19,359
Ben Carson was involved with mannatech

1178
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:21,919
For a very long time

1179
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:22,943
A couple of paid speech

1180
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,503
$42,000 for one of the

1181
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:26,527
Just got paid

1182
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:28,831
April

1183
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:33,183
Carson first

1184
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:35,487
But whoever did that

1185
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:38,047
Their website

1186
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:41,119
Article in the Atlantic

1187
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:44,191
Carson first spoke out in favor of man

1188
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:46,239
Over a decade ago when he claimed that the

1189
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,263
Space companies

1190
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:49,823
Michael nutritional supplements which included large

1191
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,871
Tree bark and aloe vera extract

1192
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:53,919
Help him overcome prostate cancer

1193
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:57,759
In what video format attack last year that remains online

1194
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:02,111
Carson discusses his experience with nutritional supplements while seated next to the company's logo

1195
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:03,135
Quote

1196
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:07,743
The wonderful thing about a company like mannatech is that they recognized that when God made us

1197
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:09,535
He gave us the right fuel Carson

1198
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,303
Unexplained

1199
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:13,119
And that's you with the right kind of healthy food

1200
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:17,727
Basically what the company is doing is trying to find a way to restore natural as a medicine

1201
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:20,031
Mechanism for maintaining hell

1202
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:22,335
But don't sound like an unbiased purse

1203
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:23,871
When God made us

1204
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:24,895
He also did

1205
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:26,175
Give us cancer

1206
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,991
Traffic

1207
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,271
Will breakdown

1208
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,367
Yeah

1209
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:39,231
You just take some aloe vera man

1210
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:43,583
How do you get away with lying

1211
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:47,935
Don't matter

1212
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,727
Doing somebody being like

1213
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:50,495
Hey

1214
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:54,079
You clearly didn't say anything if you don't have any involvement with them

1215
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:59,711
Why is your picture on their website

1216
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:05,087
The reason that they don't know why I need to do

1217
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:10,719
Just be super clear about it but the question was doesn't that indicate that judgment on your part

1218
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:18,143
Does pissed off because mannatech

1219
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,935
Is also a direct sales

1220
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:20,959
Operation

1221
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,007
Products

1222
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,031
Sell it to your friend

1223
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:28,895
Is there a multi-level marketing

1224
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:29,663
F****** s***

1225
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:32,479
It's all pyramids

1226
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:35,551
Alex Jones has a pyramid scheme operating out of Infowars

1227
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:36,575
Study run

1228
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:41,439
Mannatech is incredibly similar to the Infowars supplements

1229
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:49,631
People start discussing it and you start looking at this stuff

1230
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:50,655
Realize how much of

1231
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:51,935
The f****** scam it is

1232
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:53,471
It is his house

1233
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:55,263
The cards could unravel very quickly

1234
01:07:57,055 --> 01:08:00,895
Getmadz

1235
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,687
People unjustly

1236
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,711
And

1237
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:06,015
Ura

1238
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:09,087
Why is it that you don't believe

1239
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,903
You're a weirdo

1240
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:14,975
Endocrine

1241
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:18,815
Episode Alex Jones discussion

1242
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:19,583
Cox

1243
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,375
He talks about cuckolding

1244
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,655
And I just

1245
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,935
I love you f****** love

1246
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:24,959
I left

1247
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:26,751
Just goes like that is getting repetitive

1248
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,799
And we got a lot of ground to cover but

1249
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:31,871
If you want to go to listen to that piece of the episode

1250
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:33,919
Not worth it

1251
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:36,735
Get cut marks

1252
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:38,527
Selective discussion of Russia

1253
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:43,135
Terms of the last like

1254
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:45,439
Two weeks or so of Infowars coverage

1255
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:46,975
Don't worry

1256
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,791
It's just a because you wanted to cover the debate

1257
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,071
He's getting back into

1258
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:54,143
There shouldn't be done

1259
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:55,935
Because people don't know how to use them yet

1260
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:59,775
Restricted areas on the rain

1261
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:01,311
Mnml

1262
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:02,847
And everyone else

1263
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:03,615
Ultimate

1264
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:06,687
I get not having a bunch of recruits

1265
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,535
Directions kill people

1266
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:33,823
Russian Blue cat

1267
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,359
About my fighting force

1268
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:38,175
Making sure there are fewer of them

1269
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:42,015
You don't want to go to a boot camp

1270
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,039
Because you might die

1271
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:49,439
Also making sure the one probably psychological

1272
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:53,023
PTSD before the

1273
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:59,423
Actual size of a cook among the people who aren't even in the ship

1274
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:03,263
Word for political correctness

1275
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:05,311
We would still be murdering our own

1276
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:08,895
Military

1277
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:15,295
You can see how great they are filled with people who are

1278
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:19,647
They're happy that they're alive

1279
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:25,791
Interview with his intrepid reporter Wayne Madsen

1280
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:32,191
He's the guy who brought us the hot story about Hillary Clinton's Chef being murdered and having a letter pin to him it said call Lee

1281
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,471
Larry Nichols

1282
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:37,311
Love it

1283
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:42,943
The case of 9/11 in Arizona there is a hanger

1284
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:45,503
There's like an Airfield and

1285
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:47,295
Convinced that this is where they turn

1286
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:49,599
Planes into remote control drone

1287
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:53,183
It is just speculation

1288
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:54,463
And they treated as gospel

1289
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,487
I knew it was

1290
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:57,279
Going to be Arizona to cut stuff

1291
01:10:57,535 --> 01:11:03,423
And a man like two days later on the show they play a report of human Arizona

1292
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,215
And they think it proved anything

1293
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,519
Except that it

1294
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,823
Very easy to get onto this Airfield

1295
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:14,687
They've been here without getting killed

1296
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,223
Freaking fat WeedMaps

1297
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:21,343
Just walking around for the camera isn't really a camera guy with a walking around like

1298
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:28,255
What are you doing

1299
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:31,839
If security is that lacks

1300
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:33,631
Look like

1301
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:35,167
16 years later or whatever

1302
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:40,543
Sanford ownership

1303
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:43,615
Really care

1304
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:45,151
So we now move on

1305
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:46,431
To October 3rd

1306
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:48,223
I believe

1307
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:51,807
It gets really serious

1308
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:54,367
Parking

1309
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:55,647
Super

1310
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:56,415
Steatorrhea

1311
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:57,439
Here we go

1312
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:06,655
Driver and the only thing that's constant

1313
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:12,799
By the late eighties is global warming

1314
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:18,175
In the larger cycle

1315
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:22,015
15 years

1316
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:23,551
First

1317
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:26,111
Increasing temperature slowed

1318
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:31,231
Numbers across the world

1319
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,511
Not true

1320
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:34,303
High temp some record low temp

1321
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:37,887
Always mobile

1322
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:44,799
Climate change

1323
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:52,223
Cuz the climate

1324
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:00,671
Because this is such a big deal

1325
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:08,607
Anthropogenic climate change

1326
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:10,911
Is a geostrategic

1327
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:17,311
Thriving energy sector and every other country

1328
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:21,919
And Putin 100%

1329
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:25,503
It's the mailman

1330
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:28,063
Russia haven't even going along with the fraud

1331
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:31,647
Call boy

1332
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:34,207
Doughboy

1333
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:35,231
Just can't listen to that

1334
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:36,767
Pitstop

1335
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:37,791
Three hurricane

1336
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:39,327
Yeah

1337
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:41,887
And for that you just go a week in the past

1338
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:43,167
Yeah

1339
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,191
F******

1340
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:45,727
Throwing everything

1341
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:46,751
Can you listen to

1342
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:47,519
These people who lived

1343
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:48,287
Tonight at 4

1344
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:49,055
So long and

1345
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:50,847
Look at all the damn

1346
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:55,199
Can you look at the

1347
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,223
They were made like

1348
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:58,783
Smell 10 years ago so pretty much matching up

1349
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:01,087
With what's happening in front of our eyes right now

1350
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:04,159
How did we not know Dan

1351
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:07,743
I don't know

1352
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:12,351
Listen to themselves

1353
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:15,423
And made sure that everybody

1354
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:18,495
And so they could continue murdering everybody

1355
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:20,799
Gluten

1356
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,847
Has a lot of financial interest

1357
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:26,687
Emmanuel

1358
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:28,223
Right it's a weapon

1359
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,599
Energy

1360
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:34,623
F*** you

1361
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:35,647
Russia has

1362
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:37,695
Is it possible for us to collect

1363
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:38,463
AAA Sue

1364
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:45,375
All the people in Houston

1365
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:46,143
Can blink

1366
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:48,191
We can definitely link all of this damage to

1367
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:52,799
One One Sweet Day

1368
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:55,871
And that they knew that this was a result of

1369
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:58,943
So I'm pretty sure that they should be shut down

1370
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,039
This is

1371
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:05,343
In terms of our investigation

1372
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,367
It's more important

1373
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:08,671
Did Alex is being fooled by Putin

1374
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:09,439
Stamps on it

1375
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:11,999
Yeah well I don't think he's

1376
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:13,535
I think so

1377
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:15,839
Aegis dovetails nicely into

1378
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:16,607
The climate change

1379
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:18,143
Denial

1380
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:19,935
Take that

1381
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:21,983
Take the climate-change part of it out of it

1382
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,055
Into thinking Putin is smart

1383
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,079
And a good leader

1384
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:28,383
By Putin take the position

1385
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,407
Agrees with

1386
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:30,943
For the reason

1387
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:34,271
That's a strategic reason to deny climate

1388
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:40,159
If his name

1389
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:42,719
Absolutely has the exact same Financial in

1390
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:47,071
So because he doesn't want to lose these billions

1391
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:49,887
Trillions of dollars that he could be making if

1392
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:51,423
Sanctions were lifted

1393
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:54,751
He's super against climate change

1394
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:58,847
Alex already

1395
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:01,663
He's sucked more into Putin is a genie

1396
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:03,199
He's a great leader

1397
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:08,575
He already was flirting with of Being Fit

1398
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,111
Is now just going

1399
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,391
F****** w****

1400
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:17,535
Wow

1401
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:22,655
Climate change.

1402
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:25,471
Climate change

1403
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:27,519
Is a geostrategic weapon

1404
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:36,735
Washers breaking with the globalist on every front they didn't go along with carbon taxes before and said they weren't sure it was real

1405
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:42,367
Control

1406
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:45,439
World leaders

1407
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:49,279
Bipolar

1408
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,303
Defense

1409
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:58,239
This is cause for celebration

1410
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:00,287
Just wanted another notch

1411
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:02,591
Cuz you know I don't trust him in that

1412
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:13,343
They wanted to get rid of our override they want

1413
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:19,487
Russians

1414
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:29,727
Special Forces

1415
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:37,151
International

1416
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:40,479
One of their main heads

1417
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:44,063
I was told it was the sky

1418
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:47,391
Once they cut to me they started interrogating me

1419
01:17:54,815 --> 01:18:00,959
Who I was who I work for

1420
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:20,415
Listen to the show

1421
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:28,863
When the signal goes out to this

1422
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:37,823
If a weapon system to selectively cut off the energy

1423
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:39,871
Do you understand what just happened

1424
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:43,455
Do you understand what you just admitted on air

1425
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:47,039
Do you realize

1426
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,319
That's

1427
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,599
Bucked up

1428
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:51,135
He's at he just

1429
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:55,743
I was interviewed

1430
01:18:58,303 --> 01:18:59,327
I should not have said that on

1431
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:00,607
You just admitted

1432
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:09,567
You know what happened

1433
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,103
This guy

1434
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:15,967
You know what happened in that interview told him that Putin listens to his show

1435
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:17,247
Images of Genius

1436
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:19,807
That's how they compromised

1437
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:21,343
Through flattery

1438
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:24,415
That's how you make it

1439
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:26,463
Steve pieczenik started on the last episode

1440
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,487
Paranoid

1441
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:28,767
Delusional people

1442
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:33,631
Super easy to manipulate

1443
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:34,911
Russian

1444
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:39,007
And then

1445
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:40,031
Grilled him

1446
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:43,103
That's insane

1447
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:45,407
Bills game over

1448
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:48,223
Route

1449
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:53,599
He is proof that he's the worst

1450
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,279
I should not have said that

1451
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:03,071
I should not have said that

1452
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,727
When I heard that

1453
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:10,751
I was like

1454
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:13,567
I just didn't know what to do

1455
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:14,848
How do you deal with that

1456
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:19,712
How do you deal with a guy who can be outside

1457
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:23,040
You don't tell him

1458
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:26,880
And you deal with like multiple layers of Handler

1459
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:28,928
Steve pieczenik

1460
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:30,976
Is clearly feeding him is Heritage

1461
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:33,280
And then there's probably its third stage

1462
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:35,072
It gets him back to the Kremlin or whatever

1463
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:37,120
You make it so Alex Jones

1464
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:40,448
Think that the people who are feeding and narrative are the ones

1465
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:42,240
It's from Russia

1466
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:48,640
Goody flatters me every time he's on the show

1467
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:50,432
It's f****** nuts

1468
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,968
This is so f****** obvi

1469
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:56,320
And the other thing that's interesting about that is

1470
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,856
Was in on it

1471
01:20:58,368 --> 01:21:03,232
The idea that they set up an interview with Artie and then it's actually spies

1472
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,304
That means

1473
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:12,960
He's way more of a Spade outlet than Alex is willing to admit

1474
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:17,568
So problematic

1475
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:21,152
He's making the subtext text

1476
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:29,088
Even the Russian government

1477
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,816
Are you doing

1478
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:40,352
You don't need an investor

1479
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:43,680
Navigate of journalists when one of the guys is whistleblowing

1480
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:51,104
Proudly revealing that he is now officially an ass out of there

1481
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,128
Well that's

1482
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:53,920
The same thing that he does with his sources

1483
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:06,208
Supplement

1484
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:10,560
Mainan super male Vitality of brain Force

1485
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,584
Heaven is like

1486
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:14,912
But I got Trucking recruiting

1487
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:19,776
Heck is I don't know if he realizes

1488
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:21,056
Of course he does

1489
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:25,152
What he's telling the story I don't think he realizes how f*****-up this story is

1490
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:27,200
I don't think he realizes what he reveal

1491
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,272
It's like

1492
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:31,808
The only reason

1493
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,112
Because that almost certainly is happen

1494
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:37,952
Members of Donald Trump

1495
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,488
Sure

1496
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:40,256
Again

1497
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:42,304
You are supposed to report that to be FBI

1498
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,584
Yeah

1499
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:49,728
Deal with that people were willingly cooperating

1500
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:53,312
Russian Folk

1501
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:56,896
Tricked into a meeting or something like that

1502
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:57,920
Supposed to report

1503
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:04,576
The FBI reported that description that he's gay

1504
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:06,624
100

1505
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,648
Percent should have been like

1506
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:10,208
I don't know what's going on

1507
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:11,488
But I got trick

1508
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,328
And ended up talking to high-level Russian government officials

1509
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:18,656
They were grilling me about whether or not I work for the government

1510
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:20,448
That's like

1511
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:24,032
When he talked about being in a James Bond novel

1512
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:25,056
He's kind of correct

1513
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:26,592
But he's not James Bond

1514
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:29,664
Real f******

1515
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:35,296
Somebody who gets flipped

1516
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,320
Anime

1517
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:39,648
He Slipped by Goldfinger

1518
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:42,208
It's so crazy it's like Homer Simpson

1519
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:45,792
Scorpio I know that we talked about that clip for an hour

1520
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:46,816
But

1521
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:49,120
It's more fun if we just play this next clip cuz

1522
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:49,888
Even worse

1523
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:56,288
Let's continue here now shifting gears

1524
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:57,312
Wish.com

1525
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:59,360
Ultraman

1526
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:07,040
Has come out and said climate change

1527
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:12,672
To kill populations Detroit Nation

1528
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:14,464
Of the inside bubble cartel

1529
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:18,560
Is a

1530
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:21,376
Devastating

1531
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:25,216
Because Russia obviously

1532
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:38,528
And exposing what's going on with

1533
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:42,112
But

1534
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:44,160
So I guess it goes

1535
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:44,928
Putin

1536
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:46,720
Matt drudge office

1537
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:53,120
Oh no

1538
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:54,656
It is very weird

1539
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:58,752
I'm sure Matt Drudge

1540
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:05,152
Drudge's mouth right

1541
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:06,944
Alex Jones

1542
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:07,712
Works

1543
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:11,040
I'm so does Matt drudge probably

1544
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:12,064
Based on

1545
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,624
Every piece of evidence

1546
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,696
And they're clearly at least aligned in some way

1547
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:20,512
Is Alex's externalize

1548
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:22,560
He's externalizing the network

1549
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:25,120
Saying babe

1550
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:31,264
Drudge

1551
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,800
Under your breath

1552
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:34,592
That's supposed to be like

1553
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:37,408
Look at all these people who work for us

1554
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:39,968
Hey dude do you know what I'm starting to realize

1555
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:43,552
The reason that he started to have the same gas

1556
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:45,600
Saint everyday

1557
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:46,880
I think it started in

1558
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,160
Sommore in 26

1559
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:48,928
16 or so

1560
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,976
The reason is because I need to

1561
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:52,512
Keep a better eye on him and no one want

1562
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:53,536
What's the listen to show

1563
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:55,328
I think that's what's going on

1564
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:57,120
Good stuff like this happen

1565
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:58,656
And if this happened a lot

1566
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:00,704
If it breaks like this happen

1567
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:02,496
Did the game would be up

1568
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:05,056
Like people would be able to

1569
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:09,664
Do you listen to work for Russia everyday

1570
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:14,784
Everybody would listen to this podcast the game is up

1571
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,064
Yeah it's John

1572
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:21,696
Just say that can't believe that he would

1573
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:24,256
I was going to do an interview for RT

1574
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:29,376
Lied to me at the behest of the governor

1575
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:32,704
I'll be intelligence Services of Russia

1576
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:34,752
By the intelligence service

1577
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:35,520
Agents

1578
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:36,544
Hoodlum

1579
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:41,152
Insane

1580
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:42,944
Then I'm sure that

1581
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:46,016
Quote unquote interview

1582
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:47,040
Behind Russia

1583
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,320
What's not

1584
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:49,856
Situation where they said

1585
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:52,672
You're so right about everything how are you so right

1586
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:57,024
Yeah but I'm sure they did say things like that

1587
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:58,304
And flattery process

1588
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:01,632
It's f****** absurd they had to

1589
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:03,936
To of been all of them sitting there like

1590
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:04,960
Trying hard not

1591
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:05,728
Not to laugh

1592
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:07,520
We thought this was

1593
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:08,288
Going to be

1594
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,360
Skeptical we thought you were

1595
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:13,408
We thought you would at least be like

1596
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:18,272
Hey Will I like America and it's you guys

1597
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:21,088

1598
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:27,232
Pretty skeptical of all authority

1599
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:30,048
Boy this is easier than we thought

1600
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:33,376
We thought you would we thought you'd be like oh this is it

1601
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:34,400
Christian

1602
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:35,424
And you might even hang out

1603
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:38,240
Obama should have just said Alex Jones was cool

1604
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:43,872
Might have saved America

1605
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:47,456
Hey Alex Jones I love what you're doing

1606
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:50,016
Let me give you some let me give you

1607
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:52,320
Some things that I would also love for you to be doing

1608
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,344
And that would be

1609
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:58,208
This is followed up all this huge like rush it

1610
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:01,280
Is followed up with a long interview with dr. group about liver

1611
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:07,936
This show is so weird

1612
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:17,152
Light trees

1613
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:23,296
Liver stuff that makes green

1614
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:28,928
Greater Blackstone chiropractor who made the formula

1615
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:34,048
Excuse me your liver also do whatever Russian

1616
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:38,400
There's a long interview

1617
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:40,960
Interview with gym bars

1618
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:43,520
Who is an old timing

1619
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:44,800
Conspiracy theorist

1620
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:48,128
He's written a book about we talk about

1621
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:49,664
Sing like a couple episodes back

1622
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:54,016
Studio and

1623
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:57,600
Yeah this

1624
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:59,904
Only people like that Alex

1625
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,184
And some others

1626
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:04,000
Try to bring you the real news

1627
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:08,608
Example of a the whole thing going on in the Ukraine

1628
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:15,520
What people don't really understand that it's over Russia's making a bad move and old cuz we're getting all this anti-russian propaganda

1629
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:17,312
You're back off look at it

1630
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:21,152
Essentially what happened would be like if we fix the i a

1631
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:24,992
I mean the Russian saved take their intelligence service

1632
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:26,272
I'm over here to Texas

1633
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:27,552
And get a bunch of

1634
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:30,624
Texting pulled up about this secede from the Union

1635
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:31,648
And

1636
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:33,184
I think we all know this

1637
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:36,256
But I actually have anyway

1638
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:40,352
And then Texas secede

1639
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:42,912
And then the United States again oh

1640
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:44,960
Say look you can't do that

1641
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:48,032
And they would come and try to stop at

1642
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:50,336
Right grout the same thing over there

1643
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:52,128
Grapefruit we set up this

1644
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:53,152
Separatist

1645
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:53,920
Lumen

1646
01:29:54,432 --> 01:30:00,064
We armed them we egged them on and now in Russia says you've always been a part of Russia you can't do this

1647
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:03,136
Now all of a sudden we're turning them into the aggressor

1648
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:06,720
One of the most convoluted

1649
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,584
Both versions of what's going on in Ukraine I've ever heard

1650
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:14,656
Also let's take this piece out of it

1651
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:16,192
The people who were trying to

1652
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:17,472
In California

1653
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:18,752
We're working with Russia

1654
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:21,312
Oh yeah

1655
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:22,592
Fled to Russia

1656
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:25,920
However you want it the Catholic Alexa

1657
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:27,712
For a group of people

1658
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:33,088
So obsessed with saying that the Civil War was a war of Northern aggression

1659
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:34,880
Him to all of a sudden be like

1660
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:36,672
No visit United States was right

1661
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:41,024
We we we absolutely agree that the Civil War

1662
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:43,072
And we should have been taking over

1663
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:44,352
Just like Russia

1664
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:47,168
That's f****** nuts

1665
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:50,752
Because

1666
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:54,336
Because the area in Ukraine

1667
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:56,896
Part of Russia

1668
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:58,688
No it never was

1669
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:00,736
The Soviet Union

1670
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:02,016
But

1671
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:04,064
That doesn't exist anymore

1672
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:10,720
Very good reason

1673
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:12,000
Created an uprising

1674
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:17,120
And Russia is just trying to get this area not to secede from Russia

1675
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:19,680
It indicates to me

1676
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:23,008
Disrespect of Truth

1677
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,032
And

1678
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:25,824
Unacceptable

1679
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:27,616
To the Ukrainian

1680
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:31,456
Complete acceptance of everything that is in line with Russian narrative

1681
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,784
Converse

1682
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:37,088
Exact episode where Alex is admitting

1683
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:40,672
Contact with Russian Intelligence Officers

1684
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:41,696
That's

1685
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:42,464
F***** up

1686
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:44,768
Videos almost every guest

1687
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:46,560
Ends up having some weird

1688
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:48,096
Connection with Russia

1689
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:50,400
Espouses

1690
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,936
Amazingly pro-russia

1691
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:53,472
The opposition's like Jamar is he

1692
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:57,824
Interesting so I'm starting to think the Jakari Jackson

1693
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,360
Didn't leave because of trump

1694
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:00,640
Tired because

1695
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:02,688
No I'm starting

1696
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:03,968
Maybe he's sent

1697
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,296
How Deeply this was a Russian propaganda Outlet

1698
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:08,320
Thank God out

1699
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,600
I'm thinking maybe that's

1700
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:13,184
I don't think

1701
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,232
If either of my suspicions are true

1702
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,256
I don't think you talk to any

1703
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:18,816
Because

1704
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:26,496
Living might wind up with a note taped to of the

1705
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:30,848
The image of anyone dying with a note

1706
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:35,200
But

1707
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:36,480
Yeah I mean

1708
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:37,504
If if

1709
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:40,320
The suspicions that we're really starting to see our true

1710
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:41,856
I think

1711
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:44,672
That anybody with actual information

1712
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:45,696
They could confirm.

1713
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:48,256
What it might be a risk

1714
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:49,024
To their lives

1715
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:50,048
To come out with it

1716
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:59,008
American soil

1717
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:03,616
Strangely enough

1718
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:07,200
Easy argument

1719
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:09,504
Anti-russian

1720
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:11,296
Which is really high

1721
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:16,416
Is that America does

1722
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:18,720
Sure

1723
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:20,256
And the idea that it's like

1724
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:24,352
We're judging them for overthrow

1725
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:25,888
Because

1726
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:27,424
We've overthrown plenty

1727
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:31,776
The show already

1728
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:36,640
When it's being done to us

1729
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:39,456
The question I'm asking

1730
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:40,480
He is not just that it

1731
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:41,248
It's at

1732
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:43,296
Would our intelligence services

1733
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:44,832
Stupid

1734
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:49,184
Grab some

1735
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,976
Media in Russia

1736
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:55,328
I'd like some anti Alex Jones

1737
01:33:56,608 --> 01:34:00,704
Skyping with the CIA I think that

1738
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,752
The remnant

1739
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:03,776
The KGB

1740
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:17,088
They just didn't have to worry who gives a s*** who cares

1741
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:23,232
And even then

1742
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:24,000
Who cares

1743
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,792
No one no one

1744
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:29,376
No one said anything

1745
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:36,032
I don't have audio this

1746
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:38,336
But I might try and post the video of it

1747
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:39,104
Because

1748
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:44,224
What are the narratives that Alex is pushing on this day is episode

1749
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:45,504
Is here on October 30th

1750
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,272
Is that

1751
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:48,576
The EPA came out with a video

1752
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:51,904
Video

1753
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,696
Can pumpkins be like Smashing Pumpkins

1754
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:56,768
Climate change

1755
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:59,072
Is fueled by

1756
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:00,096
Farms in

1757
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:00,864
The Creator

1758
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:03,680
Pumpkins for a novelty purpose one time a year

1759
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:04,704
It does

1760
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,752
Cause a lot of CO2 emissions

1761
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:10,080
Pumpkin

1762
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:11,872
It's that tire its

1763
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:15,456
It's a government agency trying to be funny in that

1764
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:16,224
Never going to be

1765
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:17,504
But

1766
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:23,904
Making a parody of the parody video

1767
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:24,928
Video with Buckley

1768
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:28,256
We're going around Buckley is like

1769
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:31,072
Is Igor and bring him pumpkins to destroy

1770
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:34,144
Ebony starts rambling about

1771
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,448
I want to kill.

1772
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:39,520
This is bad

1773
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:40,544
Is High School prom

1774
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:41,824
But I did

1775
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:44,640
And he's doing this and millions of people are watching us

1776
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:48,224
Acquit

1777
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:54,624
It's just you got to keep quality

1778
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:55,392
You're good or bad

1779
01:35:57,952 --> 01:35:58,464
Halloween

1780
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:03,584
That's on a Saturday

1781
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:04,608
November 4th

1782
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:08,192
Alex Jones

1783
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:10,752
I will come back on November 2nd

1784
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:15,616
The nurse

1785
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:25,856
Play control by

1786
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:34,816
And so that's why US Special Forces are being put in

1787
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:40,192
Hope that the Russians end up killing some US troops

1788
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:47,104
You deserve to be now attacked and you deserve

1789
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:53,504
Assad forces Russia you better pull out

1790
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:56,576
Hoping the American people get all stirred up and support

1791
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:04,256
So sorry about that there's a little glitch

1792
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,024
Isis

1793
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:10,400
Does Isis support control

1794
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:12,960
So

1795
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:13,728
Roshes Gray

1796
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:17,824
I love what they're doing.

1797
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:21,408
Pushing there

1798
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:23,712
That the globalist are putting our forces

1799
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:24,992
Suzanne hoping the Russia

1800
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:26,272
Kills one of them

1801
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:27,296
In order for us

1802
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:28,576
To attack them

1803
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:29,600
To pay there

1804
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:31,136
Their evil plot is

1805
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:33,952
To destroy the world and Russia specifically

1806
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:35,232
So his are the only country

1807
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:36,000
If it's fighting against

1808
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:40,608
Right which I'm sure the intelligent

1809
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:42,656
The other thing

1810
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:43,680
Or a globe

1811
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:45,728
The other thing that's important

1812
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:49,824
To point out is later he goes so far as to say

1813
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:52,128
That if Russians bomb American

1814
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:53,664
And kill them

1815
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:55,456
He takes

1816
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:56,992
Agency and guilt

1817
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:58,272
Away from Russian

1818
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,320
Import put it on Obama

1819
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:04,160
Cuz you put those forces there in order to bake the Russians into attack

1820
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:06,464
It's f****** convoluted as hell

1821
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:07,488
And it's

1822
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:08,768
Do you not

1823
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:10,560
Supporting America at all

1824
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,120
I'm not for war either

1825
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:14,144
I don't want to ride

1826
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,936
I don't want to risk killing anybody

1827
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:19,264
We have no place in a lot of the conflicts were in

1828
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:23,360
Sometimes you have to stop

1829
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:25,152
Stop atrocities from happening

1830
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:26,688
It's very complicated

1831
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:30,272
But the more you read about foreign policy

1832
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:31,552
The more you're like

1833
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:33,856
Nobody knows what to do

1834
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:35,648
Nobody has any idea what's

1835
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:36,672
Best thing to do

1836
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:38,464
Everybody who thinks they know what the best

1837
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,488
Thing to do is

1838
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:40,256
F*****'-a

1839
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:42,304
Everybody who does something

1840
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:44,352
Things up more

1841
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:46,656
No

1842
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:48,704
What's going on and everybody's

1843
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:54,080
The first president

1844
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:57,664
His foreign policy made as much sense as it could

1845
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,712
Now our foreign policy is

1846
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:00,480
Not exist

1847
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:06,368
When I look at this

1848
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:07,648
Yeah

1849
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:10,464
Go to the next clip

1850
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,768
And it's about immigrants

1851
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:14,304
Cat stuff

1852
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:15,072
I want

1853
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,352
To be clear

1854
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:18,912
Extensive Alex Jones

1855
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:19,936
Repeating

1856
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:21,216
Very clearly Russian

1857
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:24,800
By the way you put up on TV screen

1858
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:27,872
Infowars.com we have the map up on screen there

1859
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:30,176
Infowars.com show

1860
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:34,272
You can see the areas controlled by Islamic State

1861
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:38,112
From the start until now

1862
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:41,184
Budget re-branding a multi to under a new flag

1863
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:42,720
No it's not

1864
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:44,256
It's fighting against

1865
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:50,144
Conduit goes up into the Northside of Iraq

1866
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:53,216
Refugees coming from

1867
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:57,824
Otherworld

1868
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:03,968
Travel up into Syria

1869
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,784
And then travel from there as refugees

1870
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:07,808
Europe

1871
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:12,160
Other refugees are under the age of 30

1872
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:16,512
And get off the trains and form up a military formations

1873
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:18,048
And follow their leaders

1874
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:21,376
30 year old on average Military Officers

1875
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:25,216
Once I get the refugee centers

1876
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:29,824
Disappear by the thousands every day

1877
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:32,128
Into the European culture

1878
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:36,224
Not true not true at all but also hostess I was really messing up the

1879
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,272
Prince between average and median

1880
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:41,600
That's one of the things that he's messing up when it comes to

1881
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:45,184
So if you want to say like the average is 30

1882
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:47,232
That means

1883
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:48,256
The 12

1884
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:49,024
You're old

1885
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:51,072
Counties under 30 you know that right

1886
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:52,096
Your children

1887
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:53,120
Counties under 30

1888
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:53,888
It's strange

1889
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:56,960
From certain death

1890
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:58,240
Yeah but

1891
01:40:58,496 --> 01:41:00,288
The reason why I say that this is Russian propaganda

1892
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:02,848
Because I've been doing a little bit of looking in

1893
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:05,664
To the exact nature of this

1894
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:06,944
Anti-immigrant

1895
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:08,480
Propaganda

1896
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:09,504
What's been going on

1897
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:12,576
Beat what I can

1898
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:15,904
The sources that I've been able to find

1899
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:18,208
Russia is very clearly

1900
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:19,744
Trying to

1901
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:21,024
Make the problem

1902
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:21,792
Of migration

1903
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:22,560
Worse

1904
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:23,840
They're doing this to

1905
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:24,864
Destabilize

1906
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:25,888
And turn people against

1907
01:41:26,144 --> 01:41:26,912
Each other in Europe

1908
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:28,704
In order to make populations

1909
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:29,728
Distrust each other

1910
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:31,520
If sometimes they're they're like

1911
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:34,592
Sometimes our propaganda campaigns are super obvious

1912
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:38,688
Like there was a referendum

1913
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:40,224
How to create a trade deal with Ukraine

1914
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,760
Has Putin obviously wasn't

1915
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:45,344
Isolating Ukraine to make it weaker and more likely to fall into Russia

1916
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,112
Empower

1917
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:47,136
Is article about this

1918
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:49,440
Amsterdam up before the vote

1919
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:50,720
I'm at Dutch officials

1920
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:52,000
Openly afraid of

1921
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:52,768
The far-right media

1922
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:56,608
They didn't want to be denounced or mocked in the tabloids or shouted at by thugs in

1923
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:57,376
In the street

1924
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:58,912
The government's majority is small

1925
01:41:59,168 --> 01:41:59,680
I was told

1926
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:02,752
Sure there is but we don't want to take the risk

1927
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:03,520
The correct

1928
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:08,384
Very clear influence the politicians

1929
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:09,408
No it's happening

1930
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:13,760
Because of the radical people who will

1931
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:15,040
Make their lives

1932
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:16,320
Miserable thank you

1933
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:18,368
That is not so much about the

1934
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:19,648
But that is about

1935
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:21,184
Trying to destabilize

1936
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:22,464
Isolate Ukraine

1937
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:25,024
In terms of the Immigrant

1938
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:26,816
There's an interesting case study

1939
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:28,352
About this girl name

1940
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:30,656
What are you

1941
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:32,960
Cuz I'm going to read from this article

1942
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:34,240
Are in NATO magazine

1943
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:35,776
About

1944
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:36,544
1

1945
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:39,104
Yeah it was one of his first hit

1946
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,128
Which magazine

1947
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:44,224
Beam I don't know is it independently produced

1948
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:45,760
San Francisco weather

1949
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:47,808
Roma

1950
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:49,600
It is in a factory down south

1951
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:52,416
So they are

1952
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,464
This case of Lisa

1953
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:56,768
Is water first

1954
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:59,328
Senses where people can really directly C

1955
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:00,864
Exactly the mechanism

1956
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:02,400
Russia was using

1957
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:04,448
To promote a fake story

1958
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:06,240
Direct

1959
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:07,776
Especially Muslim

1960
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,824
Which is actually kind of bulshit

1961
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:10,592
Because if you look at this

1962
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:11,360
Statistics

1963
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:12,896
Russia's not afraid of Muslim

1964
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:14,176
They don't hate Muslims

1965
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:17,248
Baby and if you look at the entirety of Eurasia

1966
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:20,064
They have the highest percentage population of Muslims

1967
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:21,344
Like in Europe

1968
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,904
The highest is 7.8% I believe in France

1969
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:25,184
Russia has 10%

1970
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:26,464
Population

1971
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:28,768
And we've only got like two

1972
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:32,864
Something like that part about it

1973
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,912
They're not as bigoted as Alex even

1974
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:38,496
They care about making the rest of the world

1975
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:39,776
Of invading horde

1976
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:40,544
They're just

1977
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:41,568
Splitting our own

1978
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:42,336
Concurrent bigotry

1979
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:43,360
That's all you

1980
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:49,760
The case of Lisa dominated the headlines and impacted on German public discourse

1981
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:50,528
For two weeks

1982
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:51,808
In January 20th

1983
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:52,576
16

1984
01:43:52,832 --> 01:43:55,392
The 13-year old Russian German girl

1985
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:56,160
430 hours

1986
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:57,440
Was reported by

1987
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:58,720
First Russian television

1988
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:00,512
I've been raped by migrants

1989
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:01,792
The story

1990
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:03,328
Inbreds

1991
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:05,888
The German police were able to establish that he she had been

1992
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:06,656
With a friends at night

1993
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:09,984
Christ story was

1994
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:12,800
Intensively reported on Russian domestic and foreign media

1995
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:14,592
Diplomatic

1996
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:15,360
Between German

1997
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:16,128
Indian Russia

1998
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:18,944
For the first time

1999
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:21,248
Several of the different Russian Elliman

2000
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,272
The influence

2001
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:24,320
TARDIS

2002
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:25,600
If it's article working

2003
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:27,136
In the coordinated way

2004
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:27,904
So the Bullet

2005
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:32,768
A journalist from the first Russian TV channel picked up the case of the Russian German

2006
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:35,072
My girl

2007
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:38,912
Russian foreign media like RT Sputnik nrt Dutch

2008
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:39,936
Reported on the

2009
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:42,496
Social media as well as right-wing groups

2010
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:44,288
Distributed the information on the internet

2011
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,312
Demonstration

2012
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:49,664
Super organized Facebook involving representatives of the German Russian minority

2013
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:50,944
Goochland rowson

2014
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:52,480
As well as neo-nazis

2015
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:56,832
Russian foreign media in Germany reported

2016
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:58,880
Mainstream media

2017
01:44:59,392 --> 01:44:59,904
Finally

2018
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:05,536
At the top political level Russian foreign minister Sergey lavrov made to public statements about his concern

2019
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:08,096
The inability of the Russian

2020
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:10,144
The German police

2021
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:13,728
To take such cases seriously because of political correctness

2022
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:15,776
Sounds a lot like our

2023
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:16,800
Sounds very soon

2024
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:18,592
As a result of Elisa

2025
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:20,640
And the different Russian activities and

2026
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:21,920
In the context of Ukrainian

2027
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:24,224
We're able to see a shift

2028
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:27,040
In Germany from the dominance of

2029
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:31,648
There must be a translation issue here we're seeing a shift in Germany for the

2030
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:32,928
The economy / politic

2031
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:33,696
Text to dominance

2032
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:34,976
The politics over the account

2033
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:37,536
Russian is becoming Russia

2034
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:38,304
Security risk

2035
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:39,328
The relations

2036
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:41,120
Are increasingly politicized

2037
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:41,888
Securitize

2038
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:43,168
Sakura size

2039
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:46,496
So then there was an interview with a guy Hungarian

2040
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:47,520
Spy names

2041
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:48,544
Ferric cataract

2042
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:50,336
Little gentleman who

2043
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:51,872
Probably

2044
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:54,176
Name

2045
01:45:56,736 --> 01:46:02,880
This is a guy who broke cover to tell the independent about how he closely monitored and observe how Russia attempts

2046
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:03,648
Aggravate

2047
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:04,672
50 migration crisis

2048
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:05,952
Spreading false stories

2049
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:07,488
He was quoted as saying

2050
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,072
When it comes to the events in Cologne or other sexual offense

2051
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:12,864
Meaning of Russian

2052
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:19,008
Are active in emphasizing that the German or Western authorities and the media are attempting to cover-up these crime

2053
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:23,104
They don't exist

2054
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:33,344
I mean they are trying to cover up that it

2055
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:36,160
I want to make sure that you know it

2056
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:42,304
But this is aligned with the narrative the Daleks

2057
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:44,608
Absolutely

2058
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:45,888
D.c. government

2059
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,936
In your upper covering up rape

2060
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:48,704
Statistics

2061
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:49,472
He talks about

2062
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:52,288
Sweden all the time that's another Russian prong attack

2063
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:53,568
Cuz they want to

2064
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:55,360
To destabilize Lapland

2065
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:58,944
To be able to take out to Sweden Norway and

2066
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:04,320
This this idea that these governments are enabled

2067
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:05,600
Care of

2068
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:06,880
Their own people

2069
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:08,928
Is to get people against

2070
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:09,952
Their governments

2071
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:12,768
Create political strife

2072
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:14,560
Political conflict

2073
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:16,608
The committer get a government

2074
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:19,168
Unable to deal with external crises

2075
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:21,216
Or make them ripe for the plucking

2076
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:23,264
You something that Russia

2077
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:24,032
Has been doing

2078
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:25,312
Even Beyond

2079
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:26,848
If you go back further

2080
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:32,736
Even before they were involved in like trying to f*** with our election they were doing this immigrants should wait now run

2081
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:38,112
Here's where it gets interesting

2082
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:41,184
Nigel farage

2083
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:42,720
Has been very guilty

2084
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:44,512
Of perpetuating a lot of

2085
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:46,816
Stories that act up

2086
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:48,096
Should be f******

2087
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:49,632
They are

2088
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:51,168
He's super guilty

2089
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:54,752
A lot of the exact same and upbeat

2090
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:57,568
The rhetoric of

2091
01:47:57,824 --> 01:47:58,592
The Sweden Democrats

2092
01:47:59,104 --> 01:48:00,896
A political parties influence

2093
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:02,432
By Marshall in fear of asylums

2094
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:03,968
And advocating for

2095
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:04,736
Restrict immigration

2096
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:06,272
Critics like the

2097
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:07,296
Sweden Democrats

2098
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:08,576
Suspect that the government is

2099
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:10,112
Colluding with the mainstream media

2100
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:11,136
To hide Amex

2101
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:12,416
Statistics of sapota

2102
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:13,440
Supposed

2103
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:14,720
50 calls

2104
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:18,816
Albo in particular the rape capital of Europe

2105
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:20,608
Now Sweden Democrats

2106
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:23,168
What is a misleading name Ara proto-fascist

2107
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:24,448
Just organization

2108
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:25,472
To say of course they

2109
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:30,080
Australia

2110
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:31,360
The Liberals are actual

2111
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:32,128
Play the worst people

2112
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:36,480
Into this

2113
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:37,760
The reason that rape

2114
01:48:38,016 --> 01:48:41,088
Statistics are kind of high even though actually they've gone down

2115
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:43,136
Crime all across them

2116
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:45,440
What are the reason

2117
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:47,232
If you track it from like

2118
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:48,256
2005

2119
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:51,328
I wanted the reason

2120
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:52,352
Is because

2121
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:53,632
In 2005

2122
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:55,680
Sweden voted to

2123
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:57,728
Expand what they consider

2124
01:48:57,984 --> 01:49:00,800
And so they have a very wide

2125
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:01,568
Of

2126
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:04,384
Inappropriate sexual behaviors that get classified

2127
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:07,200
Yeah so from 2005

2128
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:10,272
The number looks like it's going up

2129
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:11,040
It's just

2130
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:13,856
Consider more things

2131
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:15,136
In that category

2132
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:16,160
Further

2133
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:18,208
They have a very interesting legal

2134
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:21,024
It turns out

2135
01:49:22,048 --> 01:49:23,840
Visit from Swedish store

2136
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:26,656
Bothers at

2137
01:49:26,912 --> 01:49:27,936
That's that's a big problem

2138
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:31,264
Say

2139
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:32,288
If

2140
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:35,104
Like

2141
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:37,920
Example that you

2142
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:40,224
Call the police

2143
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:41,504
And she has a diarrhea

2144
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:44,320
Where she has in her diary

2145
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:45,344
Census of spousal rape

2146
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:46,624
That her husband

2147
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:47,392
Committed against her

2148
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:50,720
The police will consider that 400 Prime

2149
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:53,024
So each incident

2150
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,304
Is considered a crime

2151
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:55,584
Instead of one

2152
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:56,864
Cuz that's what it

2153
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:58,144
But

2154
01:49:58,400 --> 01:49:58,912
If one

2155
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:03,520
Call comes

2156
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:04,800
It makes there's two pissed

2157
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:06,080
6 look incredibly

2158
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:12,224
So whenever there's one victim and a bunch of offenses

2159
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:16,064
One perpetrator and a ton of offenses

2160
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:18,624
Or one perpetrator rsi1 victim

2161
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:19,392
10

2162
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:20,672
Perpetrators

2163
01:50:20,928 --> 01:50:22,720
It can make things look like there is

2164
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:24,000
Is more actual a

2165
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:26,048
Then there actually are

2166
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:26,816
Which I think is

2167
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:27,840
Probably

2168
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:28,608
Yeah I think

2169
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:29,376
Absolutely

2170
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:31,168
I think it's a think it's positive

2171
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:32,704
But it does open its

2172
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:33,472
Self up to being

2173
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:35,008
She was raped

2174
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:35,776
400

2175
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:36,800
Yes

2176
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:38,848
That is

2177
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:41,920
Is that is the point

2178
01:50:42,176 --> 01:50:43,200
That is what should be

2179
01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:44,224
Considered

2180
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:46,528
In jail

2181
01:50:46,784 --> 01:50:47,808
For 400

2182
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:51,904
Because that is how they

2183
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:53,440
Classified things another keeps

2184
01:50:53,696 --> 01:50:56,768
It's really easy for people on the outside

2185
01:50:57,024 --> 01:50:57,792
To make

2186
01:50:58,304 --> 01:50:59,840
Really misleading claims

2187
01:51:00,352 --> 01:51:00,864
About

2188
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:02,400
Then I

2189
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:05,984
So because of the Russia

2190
01:51:07,008 --> 01:51:08,800
You assume they do it the same

2191
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:10,848
And then you are easily manipulated

2192
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:12,640
Russia perpetuates

2193
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:13,408
These narrative

2194
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:14,688
Pins it on

2195
01:51:14,944 --> 01:51:15,456
Immigrants

2196
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:16,480
And these

2197
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:19,040
And people like Nigel farage

2198
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:19,808
And Alex Jones

2199
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:21,600
Pick up on them

2200
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:22,624
Actuate them further

2201
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:24,672
Yeah that is a queer pipeline

2202
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:26,208
What's going on

2203
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:29,792
Quotes

2204
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:31,072
F****** insane

2205
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:35,424
Like all of this just like the the crack epidemic

2206
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:36,448
In the 80s

2207
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:40,032
Sprite and how that was used to demonize black p

2208
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:43,360
Based on an agenda that old f****** white men

2209
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:45,408
Like all of that

2210
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:46,944
Stuff is done

2211
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:48,480
So specifically

2212
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:50,016
And so it and instead

2213
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:51,040
Targeted Manor

2214
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:53,088
People who are dumb enough to believe

2215
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:56,160
F******

2216
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:56,928
Sad

2217
01:51:57,184 --> 01:51:59,232
I'm just really sad that they're still

2218
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:01,792
People who would otherwise think

2219
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:03,584
Normal fine people

2220
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:04,352
And then there's

2221
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:05,632
Manipulate

2222
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:07,168
This dumb s*** Epic

2223
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:07,936
Cam monster

2224
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:09,472
Like all of the

2225
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:11,520
This

2226
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:13,056
A f****** sociopath

2227
01:52:14,592 --> 01:52:16,640
Who knows that everything he says

2228
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:17,664
Is b*******

2229
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:18,688
Is Ally and

2230
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:19,968
Is going to hurt

2231
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:20,992
People that he's telling

2232
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,832
He is an evil human being

2233
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:26,368
The people who buy

2234
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:31,744
Between

2235
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:32,512
The Russian

2236
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:33,536
Russia

2237
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:35,840
Yeah the government

2238
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:38,912
Is evil the people are generally good

2239
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:40,704
Hit the gas

2240
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:50,432
Assad

2241
01:52:56,832 --> 01:53:01,440
Praising praising God

2242
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:09,120
Chemicals

2243
01:53:09,376 --> 01:53:14,240
I'll do whatever you want I'll even the power

2244
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:17,312
Press conference

2245
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:23,968
We all know that

2246
01:53:24,224 --> 01:53:24,992
Lot of dictators

2247
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:26,528
Advocate Power Wheel

2248
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:31,392
Tons wants to retire to England

2249
01:53:31,648 --> 01:53:34,208
Wants to give up all of those billions of dollars

2250
01:53:34,464 --> 01:53:34,976
End.

2251
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:39,584
Total control over his country

2252
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:44,192
For forever

2253
01:53:47,008 --> 01:53:49,056
Just wants to step down a bunch

2254
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:52,128
2 +

2255
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,408
That

2256
01:53:54,432 --> 01:53:55,200
Things were false

2257
01:53:55,712 --> 01:53:56,736
Come from

2258
01:53:58,784 --> 01:54:00,320
This video that Alex is

2259
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:06,464
I couldn't track it down I don't know specifically what he's talking about

2260
01:54:07,232 --> 01:54:08,768
But I'm ninety-nine percent certain

2261
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:09,536
He's taking it out.

2262
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:11,072
I'm guessing it

2263
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:12,096
It's from something else

2264
01:54:12,352 --> 01:54:14,912
Maybe even in a different country now it says no idea

2265
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:17,984
Here's another damning f****** clip

2266
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:27,200
The movie

2267
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:28,992
Climate change is man-made

2268
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:57,664
Running our country

2269
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:59,200
Alex Lovett or leave it

2270
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:03,552
Guess he doesn't have kids

2271
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:06,880
Peyton Dungy five-year-old how to get b******

2272
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:12,000
Cut people taxes

2273
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:15,584
Promoting Christianity

2274
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:23,264
Listening gun laws in Russia

2275
01:55:25,056 --> 01:55:28,640
Weather shows how unbelievably pathetic

2276
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:30,944
How old is Ron Wood

2277
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:32,224
We are

2278
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:35,808
You know who those people are who are saying Putin is Hope and Messi

2279
01:55:36,064 --> 01:55:36,576
Boards are

2280
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:37,600
Bought

2281
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:42,208
Completed regular old folk

2282
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:44,000
Completely falling

2283
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:47,328
For their prompt the other promovare equal

2284
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:50,144
Seeing all these pro-russia

2285
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,168
Sandbox pop-up

2286
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:52,960
Putinism

2287
01:55:53,216 --> 01:55:53,984
This is pathetic

2288
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:56,544
It's not pathetic

2289
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:03,712
That's that's probably going to be the biggest Quest

2290
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:05,760
For Obama

2291
01:56:06,528 --> 01:56:07,040
Presidency

2292
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:07,808
Is legacy

2293
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:09,088
Yeah why did

2294
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,160
I think

2295
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:14,464
I don't know

2296
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:16,256
It's sort of deal with that question we end up in

2297
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:17,792
Wild speculation

2298
01:56:18,048 --> 01:56:19,584
I would guess that

2299
01:56:20,096 --> 01:56:21,376
You don't want to start a war

2300
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:23,424
That might be one piece of it

2301
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:25,472
I think another piece of it might be

2302
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:28,032
Threat

2303
01:56:28,288 --> 01:56:29,824
Like back threat

2304
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:30,848
But have been made

2305
01:56:31,104 --> 01:56:31,616
I don't know

2306
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:37,760
I don't I don't know I don't think we'll know for another good 10 years probably what the reality was why

2307
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:39,808
More wasn't done to

2308
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:40,576
Chicken batter

2309
01:56:40,832 --> 01:56:45,952
Really like to know how it feels

2310
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:48,256
I'm sure not great

2311
01:56:48,512 --> 01:56:51,072
Otherwise

2312
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:56,448
Of course I let him take over like

2313
01:57:00,032 --> 01:57:01,056
Hey

2314
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:02,592
You wanted to become

2315
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:03,360
The caliphate

2316
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:09,504
All right I just wanted to take over the Middle East as they're talking about this they slash up on screen

2317
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:11,296
Shepard Fairey

2318
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:14,880
Picture of Putin as that hope

2319
01:57:15,136 --> 01:57:15,904
Image of Obama

2320
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:17,184
Yeah it's crazy

2321
01:57:21,536 --> 01:57:24,352
Here we go

2322
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:25,120
Maybe

2323
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:31,520
Donald Trump

2324
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:46,880
And Carson is coming out defending Obama's policy

2325
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:51,744
Carson is a super smart guy

2326
01:57:56,352 --> 01:57:58,400
Not as informed

2327
01:57:59,424 --> 01:58:01,728
Orbi

2328
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:06,080
Former Secretary of State Hillary

2329
01:58:06,336 --> 01:58:08,640
Strike again Carson

2330
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:09,920
Along with his

2331
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:12,224
Inoculations BS

2332
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:15,040
Trump is just better

2333
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:22,208
Delivers on what eats like

2334
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:24,256
A better than Hillary

2335
01:58:29,888 --> 01:58:36,032
Directions

2336
01:58:37,312 --> 01:58:38,848
You see there that

2337
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:40,896
Trump is indicating a line

2338
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:42,944
With Putin and this makes Alec

2339
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:44,224
What's warm to

2340
01:58:45,248 --> 01:58:47,808
He is now instead of saying I don't trust him

2341
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:50,112
He's adding on a second layer of

2342
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:52,928
It where before was I'm afraid he's going to double-cross

2343
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:57,280
But he might double-cross them

2344
01:58:58,048 --> 01:58:58,816
Insane

2345
01:58:59,328 --> 01:59:01,120
I don't know how to

2346
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:04,192
Combination of eggs

2347
01:59:04,448 --> 01:59:04,960
Exhaustion

2348
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:06,240
Yeah that I think

2349
01:59:07,776 --> 01:59:08,800
Just about all of us

2350
01:59:09,568 --> 01:59:12,640
At least it's really starting to tear me apart

2351
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:14,688
These people

2352
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:17,248
Always going to

2353
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:18,272
To believe that Trump

2354
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:19,808
Who is the better

2355
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:20,832
That Hillary would

2356
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:22,112
Yeah

2357
01:59:22,624 --> 01:59:23,392
Abject

2358
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:28,000
Arash

2359
01:59:29,792 --> 01:59:32,352
You're just in denial

2360
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:34,912
Some critics of Hillary in our heart

2361
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:35,680
Plenty

2362
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:38,752
Critiques of Hillary position

2363
01:59:39,008 --> 01:59:39,776
It is just

2364
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:40,800
It is beyond

2365
01:59:41,824 --> 01:59:42,592
Just dealing with

2366
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:44,128
People who have to

2367
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:46,176
Spend so much energy

2368
01:59:46,688 --> 01:59:47,456
In denial

2369
01:59:47,712 --> 01:59:50,016
Yeah either that or they just got pregnant

2370
01:59:50,784 --> 01:59:52,064
Like those are the only two ways

2371
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:52,832
To go about it

2372
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:53,600
Soma

2373
01:59:53,856 --> 01:59:55,136
Exhaustion is just like

2374
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:55,904
I get it

2375
01:59:56,672 --> 01:59:57,184
You're dumb

2376
01:59:57,440 --> 02:00:00,768
You have no further you cute more to say

2377
02:00:01,024 --> 02:00:04,096
Because you are now completely and utterly Arash

2378
02:00:04,608 --> 02:00:05,376
I can't

2379
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:07,936
I can't debate with you

2380
02:00:08,192 --> 02:00:08,960
Because there's nothing

2381
02:00:10,752 --> 02:00:13,056
The reality is too overwhelming

2382
02:00:13,312 --> 02:00:14,080
It's just like

2383
02:00:14,336 --> 02:00:15,360
Now there are three

2384
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:16,384
Three hurricane

2385
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:18,688
Hitting our f****** coastline

2386
02:00:19,968 --> 02:00:20,992
People are like

2387
02:00:21,248 --> 02:00:22,272
Let's not talk about climb

2388
02:00:24,064 --> 02:00:24,832
Let's not talk about

2389
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:26,624
We do that all the time

2390
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:28,160
You work so hard

2391
02:00:28,416 --> 02:00:29,696
Don't politicize the issue

2392
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:37,888
No longer a politic situation

2393
02:00:38,144 --> 02:00:38,656
Eating what

2394
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:39,936
You have murdered

2395
02:00:40,448 --> 02:00:40,960
Your children

2396
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:42,752
What you have done

2397
02:00:43,008 --> 02:00:44,800
To everybody who is Ojos

2398
02:00:45,568 --> 02:00:47,104
Like Mike

2399
02:00:47,872 --> 02:00:48,896
Still thinks that

2400
02:00:50,176 --> 02:00:51,712
You know Trump is a great present

2401
02:00:52,224 --> 02:00:54,784
Here's what your ears what you're really in denial

2402
02:00:55,808 --> 02:00:57,344
If you actually stopped

2403
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:58,368
And except

2404
02:00:58,880 --> 02:00:59,392
The fact

2405
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:00,160
That

2406
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:01,696
By your actions

2407
02:01:02,208 --> 02:01:02,976
And by your vote

2408
02:01:03,744 --> 02:01:04,256
You have

2409
02:01:04,512 --> 02:01:05,024
Essentially

2410
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:06,560
Contributed to the deaths

2411
02:01:07,072 --> 02:01:08,096
Of millions of people

2412
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:09,632
Specifically

2413
02:01:10,144 --> 02:01:10,656
Your kids

2414
02:01:10,912 --> 02:01:11,424
Right

2415
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:12,960
If you do that

2416
02:01:14,752 --> 02:01:15,776
Has to be overwhelmed

2417
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:18,336
I probably don't want to do it of course

2418
02:01:18,592 --> 02:01:21,664
It has to all of a sudden like that

2419
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:23,200
Responsibility

2420
02:01:23,456 --> 02:01:24,736
Accepting a personal

2421
02:01:24,992 --> 02:01:25,504
Responsibility

2422
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:30,624
A large-scale

2423
02:01:34,464 --> 02:01:38,816
About the flip side of this for Alex to Now flip on Trump is for him to record

2424
02:01:39,072 --> 02:01:40,096
Acknowledge that he was used

2425
02:01:40,352 --> 02:01:42,144
Would be

2426
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:44,960
Not the same

2427
02:01:45,216 --> 02:01:48,800
Is it soon as he gets off the Trump train he's got to look back on everything to be like

2428
02:01:50,592 --> 02:01:52,128
Was used by Russia

2429
02:01:53,408 --> 02:01:53,920
Any chance

2430
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:59,040
I got to skip a bunch of stuff cuz we are going to sucking

2431
02:01:59,296 --> 02:02:01,600
End up in a 5-hour podcast

2432
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:04,160
Did you call

2433
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:05,952
Deep s*** like that

2434
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:09,792
Russian intelligence

2435
02:02:10,048 --> 02:02:12,096
And then visit episode is going to end

2436
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:14,144
Isaac

2437
02:02:14,656 --> 02:02:15,936
Workout

2438
02:02:16,192 --> 02:02:18,240
But I'm going to skip

2439
02:02:19,008 --> 02:02:20,288
Because they are

2440
02:02:21,056 --> 02:02:23,360
Alex tell the story of his Halloween party

2441
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:28,224
Why would you skip that one cuz they're long

2442
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:33,088
Let's hear about Halloween party

2443
02:02:36,928 --> 02:02:38,208
And I

2444
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:41,536
Two people come up to him baby 3 it's unclear

2445
02:02:41,792 --> 02:02:43,328
Go up to minnich use him as having an option

2446
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:44,864
It's not

2447
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:45,632
True at all

2448
02:02:47,168 --> 02:02:48,448
I kept there's two of them

2449
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:49,984
He tells the story twice

2450
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:51,008
And it's very different

2451
02:02:51,264 --> 02:02:51,776
Eastside

2452
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:58,432
But in the first version he says that some white girl came up and was crying because every costumes

2453
02:02:58,688 --> 02:03:00,992
Could have warned would have been accused of being racist

2454
02:03:01,504 --> 02:03:02,528
That makes sense do not have

2455
02:03:02,784 --> 02:03:08,928
Whose character is mysteriously absent from the second version of the story but it becomes a multiple people

2456
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:10,976
Remember When

2457
02:03:11,232 --> 02:03:11,744
The Disney prince

2458
02:03:12,768 --> 02:03:16,096
And people were like imagination

2459
02:03:16,352 --> 02:03:17,120
The other thing

2460
02:03:19,936 --> 02:03:20,448
We're going to drop

2461
02:03:20,704 --> 02:03:22,496
Is the we find out that Buckley dosa

2462
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:27,872
Which is Buckley's

2463
02:03:28,128 --> 02:03:28,640
Spinning

2464
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:31,968
A little bit

2465
02:03:32,224 --> 02:03:33,248
This clip we can't

2466
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:35,808
The end of the November 2nd episode

2467
02:03:36,064 --> 02:03:36,576
That we're on here

2468
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:38,112
I and

2469
02:03:38,368 --> 02:03:41,440
It's just fun because it's what happens when Alex Jones get spray

2470
02:03:41,696 --> 02:03:45,024
Called

2471
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:46,560
Another story

2472
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:54,752
Calling from communist California here in the first time, I just wanted to say how much I love your product

2473
02:03:55,264 --> 02:03:56,032
Thank you brother

2474
02:03:57,056 --> 02:03:59,616
Aman DNA Forester mail at Aldi

2475
02:03:59,872 --> 02:04:00,640
Oakland

2476
02:04:00,896 --> 02:04:01,920
Survival Shield

2477
02:04:02,176 --> 02:04:04,224
Appropriate filter for over the past year

2478
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:07,296
Thunderstorm

2479
02:04:07,808 --> 02:04:09,600
I've been looking for like a year-and-a-half now

2480
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:11,904
Everything

2481
02:04:12,416 --> 02:04:12,928
Come to fruition

2482
02:04:29,824 --> 02:04:35,968
Do we have a US Navy missile instructor and many other experts confirming that the Earth is flat and Motionless

2483
02:04:40,064 --> 02:04:44,672
That's an ad hominem thing people call in

2484
02:04:49,536 --> 02:04:51,072
Got so I have a couple thoughts about

2485
02:04:51,584 --> 02:04:52,096
Yes

2486
02:04:54,144 --> 02:04:56,192
It's possible that was a prank call

2487
02:04:56,704 --> 02:05:00,288
It's not possible that he's being trained by the institute's or whatever to do this

2488
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:02,080
Or whatever he calls

2489
02:05:03,872 --> 02:05:06,944
But it's possible that was not a prank

2490
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:08,736
That's what I'm saying

2491
02:05:08,992 --> 02:05:14,112
Hayirli possible 100%

2492
02:05:16,672 --> 02:05:17,184
On that voice

2493
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:23,584
No ever told doesn't change wants to talk about the Earth being flat

2494
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:28,448
He loves Alex Alex doesn't water I recognize that there is a big overlay

2495
02:05:28,704 --> 02:05:29,728
Between those communities

2496
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:32,544
The crazy people and people who like him

2497
02:05:33,056 --> 02:05:35,104
There is a massive Venn diagram overlap

2498
02:05:36,896 --> 02:05:38,176
Suggest there is

2499
02:05:38,432 --> 02:05:40,480
Just one Circle

2500
02:05:40,992 --> 02:05:43,296
So we skip the 3rd and the 4th cuz I don't give a s***

2501
02:05:44,576 --> 02:05:46,368
It's on the 3rd

2502
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:48,928
Actually has

2503
02:05:49,696 --> 02:05:51,232
He has an interview with Michael Savage

2504
02:05:52,512 --> 02:05:53,280
It's based on

2505
02:05:53,536 --> 02:05:54,816
Substantial to the matter at hand

2506
02:05:57,888 --> 02:06:00,192
So deep that we're skipping an interview with Savage

2507
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:01,984
On the 4th

2508
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:04,288
James O'Keefe has a new video

2509
02:06:05,312 --> 02:06:11,456
We're not going to play any of it around to a couple colleges

2510
02:06:11,712 --> 02:06:16,576
And tried to get the people who work in the student Help Services

2511
02:06:16,832 --> 02:06:18,880
The offices to shred the Constitution

2512
02:06:20,416 --> 02:06:21,440
Because

2513
02:06:21,696 --> 02:06:22,464
Why are these

2514
02:06:22,976 --> 02:06:27,072
So if you actually watch the videos

2515
02:06:27,328 --> 02:06:28,352
But at the same time

2516
02:06:28,608 --> 02:06:30,400
Did this girl goes in and she's like

2517
02:06:30,912 --> 02:06:31,680
I found

2518
02:06:31,936 --> 02:06:34,752
Because the tution that someone handed to me to be triggering

2519
02:06:35,264 --> 02:06:37,056
And you see the people's faces like

2520
02:06:40,128 --> 02:06:41,152
Can I

2521
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:43,968
How can I be catering to this person

2522
02:06:44,224 --> 02:06:47,296
But at the same time not be crazy I want to pick some up

2523
02:06:47,552 --> 02:06:48,320
Because that's who I am

2524
02:06:49,856 --> 02:06:50,624
Yes I am

2525
02:06:51,136 --> 02:06:51,904
I can't just

2526
02:06:52,928 --> 02:06:54,976
Even even though I would be

2527
02:06:55,488 --> 02:06:56,256
I would at least

2528
02:06:56,768 --> 02:06:57,280
Talking to

2529
02:06:57,536 --> 02:06:58,048
If I said

2530
02:06:58,560 --> 02:06:59,072
F*** off

2531
02:06:59,328 --> 02:07:02,656
The shredding of the Constitution is always

2532
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:04,192
The Girl Who is the

2533
02:07:04,448 --> 02:07:05,472
Mark or is the plan

2534
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:08,800
I guess

2535
02:07:09,568 --> 02:07:10,336
I don't prove any

2536
02:07:10,592 --> 02:07:13,920
University

2537
02:07:14,432 --> 02:07:15,200
It's not

2538
02:07:15,456 --> 02:07:16,736
The Constitution

2539
02:07:16,992 --> 02:07:18,016
Coffee

2540
02:07:19,808 --> 02:07:24,160
I get the idea of life

2541
02:07:24,416 --> 02:07:24,928
Who cares

2542
02:07:25,184 --> 02:07:25,696
It's not important

2543
02:07:26,208 --> 02:07:29,536
The other thing that Alex goes off on on this episode that I thought was

2544
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:33,888
Ended her a candle with the Cubs

2545
02:07:34,912 --> 02:07:37,216
Housekeeping Kendall

2546
02:07:37,472 --> 02:07:41,312
He goes on a long rant about how men are the

2547
02:07:41,568 --> 02:07:43,104
Defense mechanism for women

2548
02:07:43,616 --> 02:07:47,200
And the womb women's bodies create man in order to

2549
02:07:47,712 --> 02:07:48,480
Protecting of them

2550
02:07:48,992 --> 02:07:50,272
It's very weird

2551
02:07:58,976 --> 02:08:00,256
Truly insane

2552
02:08:00,512 --> 02:08:01,024
Yeah

2553
02:08:02,304 --> 02:08:04,608
No because it's the sexism of

2554
02:08:04,864 --> 02:08:05,376
Force

2555
02:08:05,632 --> 02:08:06,912
Chivalry in some ways

2556
02:08:07,168 --> 02:08:08,960
Because it's like this idea that

2557
02:08:09,728 --> 02:08:10,752
Implied

2558
02:08:11,008 --> 02:08:13,568
He saying is that women who hate

2559
02:08:13,824 --> 02:08:14,848
Rejecting their help

2560
02:08:15,616 --> 02:08:16,128
Buc-ee's

2561
02:08:16,384 --> 02:08:17,408
These bull Dyke

2562
02:08:17,664 --> 02:08:18,432
And what have you

2563
02:08:18,688 --> 02:08:21,504
They are they are rejecting the natural way

2564
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:22,272
That is

2565
02:08:22,528 --> 02:08:23,040
Man

2566
02:08:23,296 --> 02:08:25,344
On a biological level are just

2567
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:26,368
Created in order to

2568
02:08:26,624 --> 02:08:27,136
To protect women

2569
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:29,440
That is basically

2570
02:08:29,952 --> 02:08:30,720
Then why are they so

2571
02:08:31,744 --> 02:08:33,024
I don't know

2572
02:08:34,304 --> 02:08:34,816
The violence to

2573
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:37,888
It's it's interesting that you know

2574
02:08:38,144 --> 02:08:38,656
If we were made

2575
02:08:38,912 --> 02:08:39,424
To protect with

2576
02:08:41,728 --> 02:08:42,240
Right

2577
02:08:42,496 --> 02:08:43,776
His system

2578
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:48,896
Abuse and murder

2579
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:53,504
I think it's one of those peyote moments for him cuz he's just getting out there

2580
02:08:54,784 --> 02:08:58,112
Then he has another interview with the guy about China using a

2581
02:08:58,368 --> 02:08:59,136
It's one child policy

2582
02:09:01,184 --> 02:09:02,208
Interesting on one level

2583
02:09:02,464 --> 02:09:05,280
And then it turns into a whole thing about relative

2584
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:08,864
A Birthright

2585
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:09,888
People are reproducing

2586
02:09:12,192 --> 02:09:15,008
Throughout that I skipped

2587
02:09:15,264 --> 02:09:16,288
It's really not worth it

2588
02:09:16,544 --> 02:09:18,336
Get onto the fifth

2589
02:09:18,848 --> 02:09:19,872
And

2590
02:09:20,128 --> 02:09:21,152
Alex spent the first

2591
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:27,296
. of the show talking about how Robert Rodriguez Tarantino suck

2592
02:09:27,552 --> 02:09:28,064
Cuz I don't like him

2593
02:09:28,576 --> 02:09:29,856
Another globalist

2594
02:09:30,112 --> 02:09:30,624
I guess

2595
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:32,672
Then he has an interview with Ron Paul

2596
02:09:33,184 --> 02:09:33,696
And

2597
02:09:33,952 --> 02:09:35,232
I feel like quitting

2598
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:40,096
Still be like

2599
02:09:40,352 --> 02:09:40,864
Look

2600
02:09:41,632 --> 02:09:42,144
Pulp Fiction

2601
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:43,168
Actually

2602
02:09:53,152 --> 02:09:56,480
Easy sake

2603
02:10:00,832 --> 02:10:01,344
Ends up being sad

2604
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:07,488
What do you make a

2605
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:13,376
Treasonous conspiracy

2606
02:10:14,912 --> 02:10:16,192
More more

2607
02:10:21,312 --> 02:10:23,616
That's really scary when the

2608
02:10:23,872 --> 02:10:26,176
Sounds more Americana the America

2609
02:10:26,688 --> 02:10:29,248
That is a little bit scary

2610
02:10:29,504 --> 02:10:30,016
I bet

2611
02:10:30,528 --> 02:10:31,808
I bet it is

2612
02:10:32,576 --> 02:10:34,624
Americana

2613
02:10:35,136 --> 02:10:37,440
That's out

2614
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:39,744
I love you remember

2615
02:10:41,792 --> 02:10:43,328
Make America Russia

2616
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:49,984
Ridiculous Ron Paul isn't like hey f*** off

2617
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:58,944
Tells you everyday

2618
02:10:59,456 --> 02:11:04,832
You can have mainstream media is lying to you but Russia

2619
02:11:05,088 --> 02:11:08,160
Is mainstream media

2620
02:11:08,416 --> 02:11:09,184
Already

2621
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:10,464
Agrees with a dump

2622
02:11:10,976 --> 02:11:11,744
You believe

2623
02:11:13,536 --> 02:11:17,376
Opposing hungry hungry hungry leader as

2624
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:20,192
Closely aligned

2625
02:11:25,056 --> 02:11:26,592
Sessions with

2626
02:11:26,848 --> 02:11:27,872
Right

2627
02:11:28,384 --> 02:11:30,432
So at the end of episode Alex

2628
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:35,296
I don't know maybe he wanted to leave early or something we just replace the entire Matt drudge interview

2629
02:11:35,808 --> 02:11:38,624
Weak ask what happened. I don't know why you

2630
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:40,672
Hard-on for me

2631
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:44,768
Also kind of lame

2632
02:11:45,024 --> 02:11:46,816
He has a long interview with Peter Schiff

2633
02:11:47,072 --> 02:11:49,120
Where they talk about his dad dying in prison

2634
02:11:49,632 --> 02:11:51,680
Rest in peace

2635
02:11:51,936 --> 02:11:55,008
I'm sorry you're not political prisoner

2636
02:11:55,264 --> 02:11:56,288
Andy what he was

2637
02:11:57,824 --> 02:11:59,360
He also alcohol suspended

2638
02:11:59,872 --> 02:12:02,944
A lot of time talking about how David Cross

2639
02:12:05,504 --> 02:12:06,528
I don't know

2640
02:12:06,784 --> 02:12:09,088
Haha

2641
02:12:09,344 --> 02:12:11,648
But did he also did altitude

2642
02:12:12,672 --> 02:12:13,696
Mr. show was great

2643
02:12:15,744 --> 02:12:17,536
I think it's actually all about Run Ronnie run

2644
02:12:19,072 --> 02:12:20,352
I think that's what he's mad about

2645
02:12:20,608 --> 02:12:21,120
Look

2646
02:12:21,632 --> 02:12:25,216
I just had high hopes for it and it didn't turn out to be as good as I thought I was going to be

2647
02:12:27,008 --> 02:12:28,032
Do great

2648
02:12:29,312 --> 02:12:33,920
Ben Carson is done

2649
02:12:34,176 --> 02:12:37,760
A lot of Ben Carson's officially done

2650
02:12:38,016 --> 02:12:40,576
Episode

2651
02:12:40,832 --> 02:12:42,112
Scholarship at West Point

2652
02:12:42,368 --> 02:12:43,904
He's done

2653
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:47,232
Alex's precluded him from being a possible candidate

2654
02:12:47,488 --> 02:12:49,024
Which really just leave

2655
02:12:49,536 --> 02:12:50,304
He was like okay

2656
02:12:51,072 --> 02:12:52,352
We can't let Ben Carson

2657
02:12:52,608 --> 02:12:53,120
Can be president

2658
02:12:53,376 --> 02:12:54,912
Let's make sure he's

2659
02:12:55,424 --> 02:12:56,448
Secretary of Housing

2660
02:13:01,568 --> 02:13:07,456
People dropped out chronology at this point I think only like Rick Perry and Lindsey Graham

2661
02:13:07,712 --> 02:13:08,224
I dropped out

2662
02:13:08,736 --> 02:13:13,600
Like everyone is still in the mix or everybody

2663
02:13:13,856 --> 02:13:15,648
Yeah and no one like you

2664
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:16,672
No one is even

2665
02:13:16,928 --> 02:13:17,440
Close to truck

2666
02:13:17,696 --> 02:13:18,208
At this point

2667
02:13:21,536 --> 02:13:22,304
Trump or Carson

2668
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:24,096
Even though he loves Rand Paul

2669
02:13:24,352 --> 02:13:25,888
And wishes Rand Paul was out there

2670
02:13:26,144 --> 02:13:27,936
Yeah but Ted Cruz is not like even

2671
02:13:28,448 --> 02:13:30,496
Super in the running

2672
02:13:30,752 --> 02:13:31,520
Cruises

2673
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:36,128
You can support

2674
02:13:36,384 --> 02:13:38,688
Ted Cruz all you want but you look at Amir like this is fine meme

2675
02:13:39,712 --> 02:13:43,808
Really implicitly memes

2676
02:13:44,064 --> 02:13:47,392
Trump is really the only game in town

2677
02:13:47,648 --> 02:13:48,416
Because Rand is no

2678
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:49,952
Never there

2679
02:13:50,208 --> 02:13:54,048
No

2680
02:13:54,304 --> 02:13:55,328
Creative dr. pepper

2681
02:13:58,144 --> 02:13:58,656
But

2682
02:13:58,912 --> 02:13:59,424
I believe it

2683
02:13:59,680 --> 02:14:03,520
The only clip I have from this episode

2684
02:14:05,312 --> 02:14:11,200
Yeah the only clip that I took from this episode is Alex accidentally reviewing sort of his workflow

2685
02:14:11,456 --> 02:14:14,016
Go against whatever the new world war agenda is

2686
02:14:16,576 --> 02:14:19,904
Just as a default

2687
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:20,672
So

2688
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:23,488
If you aren't understand what you just

2689
02:14:23,744 --> 02:14:27,328
Instantly goes against whatever this imaginary

2690
02:14:27,584 --> 02:14:30,144
Star for later rationalize

2691
02:14:30,656 --> 02:14:32,704
Yep that's right. That's how we create this position

2692
02:14:36,288 --> 02:14:38,848
Feeling and then say or do anything to just

2693
02:14:39,104 --> 02:14:39,616
Testify that feel

2694
02:14:39,872 --> 02:14:41,152
That is not at all

2695
02:14:42,176 --> 02:14:43,712
Insane

2696
02:14:43,968 --> 02:14:46,528
So that is on the 6th

2697
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:48,576
And then we go

2698
02:14:48,832 --> 02:14:49,344
Is

2699
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:50,112
Saturday

2700
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:52,416
And we show back up on November 8th

2701
02:14:52,928 --> 02:14:53,440

2702
02:14:53,952 --> 02:14:56,000
It's time for a launch of a new soft narrative

2703
02:14:56,512 --> 02:14:58,048

Perfect Storm

2708
02:15:10,848 --> 02:15:14,944
Economically

2709
02:15:16,224 --> 02:15:17,760
Astrophysics

2710
02:15:18,528 --> 02:15:20,064
Israeli legendary

2711
02:15:21,344 --> 02:15:23,648

And selectively

2723
02:16:25,344 --> 02:16:26,880
Which is exactly what planet

2724
02:16:28,672 --> 02:16:31,488
Eliza go inside those came out again last week and started

2725
02:16:31,744 --> 02:16:36,096
He said he didn't buy it completely years ago

2726
02:16:47,872 --> 02:16:49,152
This is about the Paris climate

2727
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:52,480
That's the

2728
02:16:59,648 --> 02:17:01,184
Would you predict it

2729
02:17:01,696 --> 02:17:04,512
Would you would you

2730
02:17:04,768 --> 02:17:07,072
You know how when you get really angry

2731
02:17:15,008 --> 02:17:16,032
F****** do this s***

2732
02:17:16,288 --> 02:17:18,080
That's crazy

2733
02:17:18,336 --> 02:17:19,616
We're all dying

2734
02:17:20,384 --> 02:17:22,432
World

2735
02:17:22,688 --> 02:17:23,200
Yep

2736
02:17:24,224 --> 02:17:24,736
So

2737
02:17:26,272 --> 02:17:27,808
Paris climate talks

2738
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:30,368
Alex

2739
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:31,904
I think books don't even

2740
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:34,976
Big still don't care

2741
02:17:35,232 --> 02:17:39,584
For the destruction that they caused

2742
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:42,144
And they're going to do everything possible to ensure

2743
02:17:43,424 --> 02:17:44,960
I don't understand

2744
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:52,384
Impossible unless you're a psychopathic serial killer if you been lied to and you believe

2745
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:58,784
The creation of world government

2746
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:00,832
Studies that have been done by Lorde

2747
02:18:03,904 --> 02:18:04,416
F******

2748
02:18:04,672 --> 02:18:08,000
I can't deal with this s*** you are murdering us I'm not

2749
02:18:12,352 --> 02:18:15,168
Jordan Jordan

2750
02:18:15,424 --> 02:18:19,264
I've always

2751
02:18:21,312 --> 02:18:24,128
Snow on Wednesday

2752
02:18:24,384 --> 02:18:30,528
Humans need to go

2753
02:18:30,784 --> 02:18:32,576
Because in his next clip

2754
02:18:32,832 --> 02:18:33,600
You start

2755
02:18:33,856 --> 02:18:35,648
By talking about globalist

2756
02:18:35,904 --> 02:18:37,184
Plops and what-have-you

2757
02:18:38,464 --> 02:18:40,768
It turns into a weird aggressive like

2758
02:18:41,792 --> 02:18:42,560
I know

2759
02:18:42,816 --> 02:18:43,328
Hugo Boss

2760
02:18:44,096 --> 02:18:47,936
Cogitate sort of man going crazy

2761
02:18:49,984 --> 02:18:51,008
How you doing

2762
02:18:51,264 --> 02:18:55,616
I know the globalists are listen I really could use a golf

2763
02:18:55,872 --> 02:18:56,384
Weekend

2764
02:18:56,640 --> 02:18:57,152
Anyways

2765
02:18:57,408 --> 02:18:58,176
Ice

2766
02:18:58,432 --> 02:19:03,040
I think he thinks that everyone who's not an info Warrior isn't about globalist

2767
02:19:03,552 --> 02:19:05,344
I think that's what he thinks literalism

2768
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:09,952
It's f***** up not let humans develop naturally

2769
02:19:13,792 --> 02:19:15,840
From the ivy

2770
02:19:16,096 --> 02:19:18,400
Okay I know what you're going to say before you thinking

2771
02:19:19,168 --> 02:19:21,472
All this crap

2772
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:28,384
On the head

2773
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:31,200
Grunau

2774
02:19:31,456 --> 02:19:33,504
Getting patted on the head and thinking you're part of

2775
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:39,904
The crude refers to the group

2776
02:19:40,928 --> 02:19:41,696
A couple times

2777
02:19:41,952 --> 02:19:42,976
Yeah

2778
02:19:43,232 --> 02:19:45,792
Because I

2779
02:19:46,304 --> 02:19:47,584
Makeup

2780
02:19:48,096 --> 02:19:49,120
Supplies

2781
02:19:49,376 --> 02:19:52,448
We are the group

2782
02:19:52,704 --> 02:19:57,056
No did because I've listened to so much of the show I know exactly what he's talking about

2783
02:19:57,568 --> 02:19:58,336
Which is the group that Rodger

2784
02:19:58,592 --> 02:19:59,872
Stone Steve pieczenik

2785
02:20:00,384 --> 02:20:02,688
So when you talked about

2786
02:20:02,944 --> 02:20:03,456
Leave

2787
02:20:03,712 --> 02:20:04,224
If you have that you went

2788
02:20:04,480 --> 02:20:06,784
Does a meeting people passage on the head

2789
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:08,576
Made you take that you're part of the group

2790
02:20:08,832 --> 02:20:10,112
Exactly what his life is

2791
02:20:11,904 --> 02:20:12,672
Flattered by Russian

2792
02:20:12,928 --> 02:20:13,440
Intelligent

2793
02:20:13,696 --> 02:20:14,208
And now

2794
02:20:14,464 --> 02:20:15,488
He's been brought in

2795
02:20:15,744 --> 02:20:17,024
By Steve pieczenik

2796
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:19,328
Into this organization that is trying to

2797
02:20:19,584 --> 02:20:20,352
Promote Donald Trump

2798
02:20:20,608 --> 02:20:22,144
As president for the interest

2799
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:23,424
Over foreign country

2800
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:26,496
And they made him feel like he's a part of it

2801
02:20:26,752 --> 02:20:30,848
This is all just

2802
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:32,384
They made him feel like

2803
02:20:32,640 --> 02:20:33,152
They were party

2804
02:20:33,408 --> 02:20:35,968
His group

2805
02:20:38,016 --> 02:20:41,856
It's a prank call

2806
02:20:42,112 --> 02:20:46,976
Maybe prank call this is

2807
02:20:47,232 --> 02:20:48,256
Legally speaking Alex

2808
02:20:48,512 --> 02:20:49,024
Trying to

2809
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:50,304
To deal with what's happening

2810
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:53,376
To him by saying it's what his enemies are going

2811
02:20:53,632 --> 02:20:55,936
Enemies are people who

2812
02:20:56,448 --> 02:20:56,960
The show

2813
02:20:57,216 --> 02:20:58,240
That are on board

2814
02:20:58,496 --> 02:20:59,520
I guess

2815
02:21:04,128 --> 02:21:06,688
The establishment

2816
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:12,320
You think you're going to pray on your fellow humans and Ascend to the next level

2817
02:21:12,832 --> 02:21:14,368
101

2818
02:21:14,624 --> 02:21:15,648
Are they still living

2819
02:21:16,416 --> 02:21:16,928
SA

2820
02:21:17,952 --> 02:21:22,560
Absolutely

2821
02:21:24,096 --> 02:21:25,376
Who's this

2822
02:21:36,128 --> 02:21:38,688
Cuz you're not even Spirits your little greedy bastards

2823
02:21:39,456 --> 02:21:45,600
Wash yourselves already

2824
02:21:46,112 --> 02:21:47,648
If you were alive you know

2825
02:21:51,232 --> 02:21:54,560
Machine to augment your help you or help you survive

2826
02:21:54,816 --> 02:22:00,192
A machine that makes your godson machine that takes over your Freewill I machine

2827
02:22:00,448 --> 02:22:00,960
Yeah you should take

2828
02:22:01,216 --> 02:22:02,496
Take a pill for that

2829
02:22:11,968 --> 02:22:14,272
And you want to believe it's artificial intelligence

2830
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:20,160
All the answers were laying in front of you

2831
02:22:20,672 --> 02:22:21,184
What is he

2832
02:22:21,696 --> 02:22:22,464
I'm not sure

2833
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:24,768
He's on a weird Tire on this episode

2834
02:22:26,560 --> 02:22:28,096
This show is a whole lot of nothing

2835
02:22:28,864 --> 02:22:32,960
20 minutes talking about how he's always been about Benghazi

2836
02:22:33,216 --> 02:22:33,984
Play some clips

2837
02:22:34,240 --> 02:22:35,264
From Benghazi pass

2838
02:22:37,824 --> 02:22:38,848
Marine Le Pen

2839
02:22:39,872 --> 02:22:41,664
Complains about bathroom

2840
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:43,456
Espouses a belief

2841
02:22:43,968 --> 02:22:48,320
That if you are actually the victim of terrorism you never talk about it

2842
02:22:48,576 --> 02:22:50,368
Cuz you don't want to encourage terrorism

2843
02:22:50,624 --> 02:22:52,928
By proxy

2844
02:22:53,184 --> 02:22:55,232
Someone claimed terrorism it's been a false flag

2845
02:22:56,768 --> 02:23:00,608
He also admits that is Sunday show is the only one

2846
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:03,936
That is not actively co-produced by gcn

2847
02:23:04,192 --> 02:23:05,728
Cuz I use a different phone line

2848
02:23:05,984 --> 02:23:06,496
He said

2849
02:23:06,752 --> 02:23:09,568
That Sunday is the only show that we entirely produce ourselves

2850
02:23:09,824 --> 02:23:10,592
That means

2851
02:23:10,848 --> 02:23:12,640
He either goes through gcn

2852
02:23:13,664 --> 02:23:14,432
Outside funding

2853
02:23:15,456 --> 02:23:16,480
He probably should

2854
02:23:18,016 --> 02:23:23,648
Involved

2855
02:23:24,160 --> 02:23:25,696
Some sort of outside

2856
02:23:27,488 --> 02:23:28,000
He's Dutch

2857
02:23:29,024 --> 02:23:29,536
Revealing

2858
02:23:31,584 --> 02:23:32,096
A guy who'd

2859
02:23:32,352 --> 02:23:33,120
Define himself

2860
02:23:34,144 --> 02:23:35,424
By what

2861
02:23:36,192 --> 02:23:37,728
And how much

2862
02:23:37,984 --> 02:23:39,008
He has no end

2863
02:23:39,264 --> 02:23:40,032
Internal identity

2864
02:23:40,544 --> 02:23:41,568
It's purely

2865
02:23:42,080 --> 02:23:42,848
I am against

2866
02:23:43,872 --> 02:23:44,640
And that's who I am

2867
02:23:44,896 --> 02:23:46,432
Person who is

2868
02:23:46,944 --> 02:23:47,456
I'm again

2869
02:23:47,712 --> 02:23:49,504
All of these all of the

2870
02:23:51,552 --> 02:23:52,320
Like I don't

2871
02:23:53,344 --> 02:23:54,624
I don't entirely

2872
02:23:54,880 --> 02:23:55,392
Stand those p

2873
02:23:55,648 --> 02:23:56,672
People that's a type of Google

2874
02:23:57,696 --> 02:23:59,232
The people who Define themselves

2875
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:03,072
That's such a weird thing to me

2876
02:24:03,328 --> 02:24:04,352
Is that you don't have any

2877
02:24:04,864 --> 02:24:05,376
Eternal

2878
02:24:07,168 --> 02:24:07,936
Like you don't have it

2879
02:24:08,448 --> 02:24:09,728
Idea of who you are

2880
02:24:10,240 --> 02:24:10,752
If it works

2881
02:24:11,008 --> 02:24:11,520
For the

2882
02:24:12,032 --> 02:24:13,056
These imaginary p

2883
02:24:13,568 --> 02:24:14,336
Who is

2884
02:24:15,104 --> 02:24:16,640
Do you like do you like

2885
02:24:16,896 --> 02:24:17,664
A good scotch

2886
02:24:18,944 --> 02:24:19,456
Do you like

2887
02:24:19,968 --> 02:24:20,480
Beef

2888
02:24:23,552 --> 02:24:29,440
What does he even like that stuff or is it like somebody told him that smelly somebody was like

2889
02:24:29,952 --> 02:24:30,976
Is bad

2890
02:24:34,304 --> 02:24:37,120
Or he's like I met a vegan one time and they were like you should meet people

2891
02:24:39,424 --> 02:24:44,288
I love it

2892
02:24:44,544 --> 02:24:45,312
Baby butthead

2893
02:24:46,336 --> 02:24:47,616
This this next trip

2894
02:24:47,872 --> 02:24:48,896
Is also super revealing

2895
02:24:49,408 --> 02:24:52,992
And it might actually be a piece of his intrinsic personality

2896
02:24:54,272 --> 02:24:55,040
Incredibly f*****-up

2897
02:25:06,560 --> 02:25:07,840
I want more

2898
02:25:08,608 --> 02:25:13,984
I realize it's an awful lot about the taxes

2899
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:30,112
I don't get off on it

2900
02:25:30,624 --> 02:25:32,416
Serious it is

2901
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:41,120
That's just what it comes down to look up some phone calls here he gets off on people attack

2902
02:25:41,632 --> 02:25:42,144
It makes

2903
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:47,520
Inflammatory

2904
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:53,152
I don't know who should be saying these things on air

2905
02:25:53,408 --> 02:25:54,688
To see a therapist

2906
02:25:55,968 --> 02:25:56,480
Two man

2907
02:26:00,320 --> 02:26:00,832
I mean

2908
02:26:01,344 --> 02:26:02,112
Finished

2909
02:26:02,368 --> 02:26:02,880
That is

2910
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:09,024
You're just a f******

2911
02:26:09,536 --> 02:26:12,608
Yes

2912
02:26:12,864 --> 02:26:14,144
I'm screaming about

2913
02:26:14,400 --> 02:26:15,424
Situation

2914
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:20,288
Where some students were offended by people wearing a racist Halloween costumes

2915
02:26:22,592 --> 02:26:26,944
Had a confrontation with the head of student affairs I believe

2916
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:31,040
I am he was explaining that it is free speech for them to be able to

2917
02:26:34,112 --> 02:26:37,952
What the f*** you're supposed to create a safe environment for us we're being

2918
02:26:38,208 --> 02:26:40,256
Racially victimized by people

2919
02:26:41,536 --> 02:26:42,304
It is a debate

2920
02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:45,120
You know I don't think either side is wrong

2921
02:26:45,376 --> 02:26:45,888
Because

2922
02:26:46,144 --> 02:26:48,192
Isaac that you should be able to wear

2923
02:26:49,472 --> 02:26:50,240
But there should be

2924
02:26:50,752 --> 02:26:53,056
The real consequences for it

2925
02:26:53,568 --> 02:26:54,848
So it is free speech

2926
02:26:55,104 --> 02:26:57,408
To say and do horrible things

2927
02:26:57,920 --> 02:27:00,480
It's also the most reasonable response

2928
02:27:00,736 --> 02:27:01,248
Tubi

2929
02:27:01,504 --> 02:27:02,272
Very mad about it

2930
02:27:02,528 --> 02:27:05,088
So the government should not arrest

2931
02:27:08,160 --> 02:27:09,440
There's that and deprived

2932
02:27:09,696 --> 02:27:14,560
Institutions such as a College address

2933
02:27:14,816 --> 02:27:17,376
It's not punishing you for your free speech

2934
02:27:17,632 --> 02:27:19,936
You're creating an environment.

2935
02:27:20,192 --> 02:27:21,472
It's not conducive to learning

2936
02:27:21,728 --> 02:27:23,008
Alarm

2937
02:27:23,264 --> 02:27:25,824
Victimized

2938
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:26,592
Somebody brings in

2939
02:27:27,872 --> 02:27:29,152
That is not

2940
02:27:29,408 --> 02:27:30,176
Not a safe environment

2941
02:27:34,016 --> 02:27:34,784
And then

2942
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:35,552
F******

2943
02:27:35,808 --> 02:27:39,904
So Jordan be ready for November 9th

2944
02:27:40,416 --> 02:27:40,928
No

2945
02:27:45,536 --> 02:27:46,048
My friend

2946
02:27:47,072 --> 02:27:47,584
The beginning of the end

2947
02:27:48,096 --> 02:27:51,168
Obviously

2948
02:27:51,424 --> 02:27:53,984
Around the world

2949
02:27:54,496 --> 02:27:57,824
Dining us to jail

2950
02:27:58,336 --> 02:28:00,896
Phyllis Schlafly of founder of Google form

2951
02:28:01,408 --> 02:28:06,016
Breakdown

2952
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:10,624
Book

2953
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:12,160
For the fact

2954
02:28:12,416 --> 02:28:14,464
Clinton's of had a war on women

2955
02:28:18,560 --> 02:28:23,168
Show that is coming up Rodger Stone has arrived

2956
02:28:23,936 --> 02:28:24,704
Disappearance

2957
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:27,008
This is when he shows up

2958
02:28:28,288 --> 02:28:29,312
Rodger Stone

2959
02:28:29,568 --> 02:28:32,896
Yep

2960
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:43,136
I don't know which I don't know which order would be a good question

2961
02:28:43,392 --> 02:28:45,696
The thing that is interesting to me is that

2962
02:28:46,208 --> 02:28:46,720
Alex

2963
02:28:46,976 --> 02:28:48,256
Seems to be unwilling

2964
02:28:49,024 --> 02:28:50,048
Or unaware

2965
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:51,584
Of the fact

2966
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:52,608
Or unwilling

2967
02:28:52,864 --> 02:28:53,632
To tell the fact

2968
02:28:54,144 --> 02:28:55,936
Is that Rodger Stone Works on Trump

2969
02:28:56,960 --> 02:28:59,264
In his interview Oregon's introduction

2970
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:04,896
He only says

2971
02:29:05,152 --> 02:29:09,248
That's not great alternative historian

2972
02:29:13,344 --> 02:29:13,856
For him it's just

2973
02:29:17,184 --> 02:29:17,952
He's a dirty trick

2974
02:29:18,208 --> 02:29:21,024
Even brings up how Rodger Stone was behind

2975
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:22,304
A lot of those fake

2976
02:29:22,560 --> 02:29:23,584
Conservatives that showed up to

2977
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:24,608
The shutdown the recount

2978
02:29:24,864 --> 02:29:26,400
Florida in the 2000 election

2979
02:29:26,912 --> 02:29:30,752
Like he talks about how he got these fake people to show up

2980
02:29:31,008 --> 02:29:35,360
Alex

2981
02:29:35,616 --> 02:29:36,640
He hates George W bush

2982
02:29:37,152 --> 02:29:41,248
But he just doesn't talk like that

2983
02:29:42,016 --> 02:29:45,344
He doesn't actually get into the fact that Rodger stone is

2984
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:46,880
Deeply involved with Trump

2985
02:29:47,136 --> 02:29:47,648
Until then

2986
02:29:47,904 --> 02:29:48,928
The middle of their interview

2987
02:29:50,976 --> 02:29:52,256
But first

2988
02:29:52,512 --> 02:29:53,280
Teasing motherfuker

2989
02:29:53,536 --> 02:29:55,328
Alex Jones to tell you a story about the gym

2990
02:29:56,096 --> 02:30:02,240
Welcome

2991
02:30:02,496 --> 02:30:04,544
Morning I was shot in the local gym

2992
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:08,384
And I killed an 18 month old baby are there

2993
02:30:10,688 --> 02:30:12,736
Is this

2994
02:30:13,504 --> 02:30:16,832
I don't really care I just ignore that

2995
02:30:18,112 --> 02:30:18,624
I get off on it

2996
02:30:22,208 --> 02:30:23,488
On some cable machines

2997
02:30:32,192 --> 02:30:35,776
Amazon The Machine

2998
02:30:36,032 --> 02:30:37,568
I guess you can use that but

2999
02:30:42,688 --> 02:30:45,248
Which is not normal

3000
02:30:45,504 --> 02:30:46,272
Of course here

3001
02:30:46,784 --> 02:30:48,320
Not sure actually I'm done with it

3002
02:30:52,672 --> 02:30:57,024
Alex Jones

3003
02:30:57,792 --> 02:31:00,864
He was staring at me

3004
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:07,776
Can I said

3005
02:31:08,032 --> 02:31:08,800
You know who's

3006
02:31:10,592 --> 02:31:14,432
Causing problems in this country it's the new left there nothing was

3007
02:31:14,688 --> 02:31:16,224
I said you're not

3008
02:31:27,488 --> 02:31:30,816
Movie where

3009
02:31:32,608 --> 02:31:34,400
I didn't actually say that to him I was thinking that

3010
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:37,728
Myself

3011
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:39,008
Knox

3012
02:31:40,032 --> 02:31:41,312
And just walk away

3013
02:31:41,824 --> 02:31:43,104
Because you're not going to help

3014
02:31:43,616 --> 02:31:44,640
People like that

3015
02:31:44,896 --> 02:31:47,968
You legitimately most cases

3016
02:31:48,224 --> 02:31:50,784
There was a look of concern on your face

3017
02:31:53,856 --> 02:31:54,368
You

3018
02:31:54,880 --> 02:31:56,672
If we had a psychiatrist

3019
02:31:56,928 --> 02:32:03,072
Sitting right next to us they be like medvetz paranoid delusions of grandeur

3020
02:32:03,328 --> 02:32:05,888
7

3021
02:32:06,144 --> 02:32:11,264
Recognized

3022
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:13,824
Set timer

3023
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:18,688
How many people do you think are those

3024
02:32:22,784 --> 02:32:25,600
I question whether he was actually ever

3025
02:32:25,856 --> 02:32:27,392
Quite frankly

3026
02:32:27,648 --> 02:32:29,696
It could just be laying around in bed like

3027
02:32:32,256 --> 02:32:36,352
I'd be like you're not a liberal, liver

3028
02:32:36,608 --> 02:32:38,656
All of this could be some sort of weird

3029
02:32:38,912 --> 02:32:40,704
Jacob's Ladder fantasy

3030
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:42,752
Fix it without really dying

3031
02:32:43,264 --> 02:32:45,312
I mean just just the line of like

3032
02:32:46,336 --> 02:32:48,640
And then they walked away and said

3033
02:32:49,152 --> 02:32:50,432
Oh Alex Jones you the right way

3034
02:32:50,688 --> 02:32:51,456
Peanut and you're like

3035
02:32:51,968 --> 02:32:52,480
They didn't

3036
02:32:52,992 --> 02:32:53,760
No of course

3037
02:32:54,016 --> 02:32:54,784
We weren't there

3038
02:32:55,552 --> 02:32:57,344
I can guarantee you they didn't

3039
02:33:01,952 --> 02:33:02,720
They just were like

3040
02:33:02,976 --> 02:33:05,024
I saw you just got on that machine

3041
02:33:05,280 --> 02:33:11,424
We do a regular routine here we're going to use it as a personal trainer she clearly works

3042
02:33:11,936 --> 02:33:17,824
It's not bad Attica to be like oh you know we're going to need that machine

3043
02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:20,640
I know that from the time I spent at a gym

3044
02:33:20,896 --> 02:33:23,712
There aren't they can daddy the polite interaction

3045
02:33:24,224 --> 02:33:30,368
About him being like a you can have it now if we don't need it now

3046
02:33:30,880 --> 02:33:31,648
He's a lunatic

3047
02:33:35,488 --> 02:33:37,792
Like it's easy to say he's crazy but

3048
02:33:38,048 --> 02:33:39,328
Gets really crazy

3049
02:33:39,584 --> 02:33:42,656
He's like mentally ill on a literal level

3050
02:33:42,912 --> 02:33:43,680
This man

3051
02:33:43,936 --> 02:33:45,216
Needs a psychiatrist

3052
02:33:45,728 --> 02:33:47,520
He's high-functioning enough

3053
02:33:48,032 --> 02:33:50,336
Live his life and what have you

3054
02:33:50,592 --> 02:33:52,640
But he is

3055
02:33:52,896 --> 02:33:55,200
Enough to sell weirdo pills and stuff like that

3056
02:33:56,480 --> 02:33:57,760
He is cripplingly insane

3057
02:33:58,016 --> 02:33:58,528
Oh absolutely

3058
02:33:58,784 --> 02:34:03,648
He is both of those things simultaneously and that's why I always get kind of bothered when I see

3059
02:34:03,904 --> 02:34:05,952
The videos that like I love Sam Cedar

3060
02:34:06,208 --> 02:34:08,768
I think imma Jordan majority report is awesome

3061
02:34:09,024 --> 02:34:11,328
But a lot of the time when they cover Alex Jones

3062
02:34:11,584 --> 02:34:13,120
They deal with it like a is he

3063
02:34:13,376 --> 02:34:15,168
Crazy or is he manipulative

3064
02:34:15,424 --> 02:34:17,472
As if they're mutually exclusive

3065
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:26,944
Crazy evil Spectrum

3066
02:34:35,648 --> 02:34:36,672
Pies you can make it

3067
02:34:36,928 --> 02:34:39,232
So I'ma

3068
02:34:39,488 --> 02:34:40,512
It's another version of the Halloween

3069
02:34:40,768 --> 02:34:41,536
Story that didn't happen

3070
02:34:42,048 --> 02:34:45,888
But you can guess what story the kind of delusional bulshit that sin is all the way story

3071
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:47,424
Crazy I'm started

3072
02:34:47,680 --> 02:34:49,728
Weather Buckley is even a DJ

3073
02:34:51,008 --> 02:34:57,152
Starting to question whether or not Buckley's even real I know he's real cuz I've seen him in some videos

3074
02:34:57,408 --> 02:34:59,200
I could be redacted

3075
02:34:59,456 --> 02:34:59,968
Stone prank

3076
02:35:00,224 --> 02:35:00,736
There it is

3077
02:35:00,992 --> 02:35:03,040
So now we can register

3078
02:35:03,296 --> 02:35:04,320
Play no longer game

3079
02:35:04,576 --> 02:35:05,088
I wanted

3080
02:35:05,344 --> 02:35:10,720
Mostly focus on Rodger Stone because it's looking for forever

3081
02:35:10,976 --> 02:35:15,072
But it turns out we do need a little bit of Phyllis Schlafly

3082
02:35:16,352 --> 02:35:19,424
They have about four minutes of the interview where they're flirting

3083
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:20,192
About how much

3084
02:35:20,448 --> 02:35:20,960
She love gun

3085
02:35:21,472 --> 02:35:22,240
It is weird

3086
02:35:24,032 --> 02:35:24,544
Never

3087
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:25,312
Ever

3088
02:35:26,592 --> 02:35:27,104
Words

3089
02:35:27,616 --> 02:35:28,896
Ever

3090
02:35:29,152 --> 02:35:29,664
Never been

3091
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:32,736
More desert until the end of this next clip

3092
02:35:32,992 --> 02:35:35,040
And then people will understand why

3093
02:35:35,552 --> 02:35:39,136
But if you take them how to read they'll be able to read some of the great books

3094
02:35:39,392 --> 02:35:41,184
Little ripped in the English language

3095
02:35:41,696 --> 02:35:42,464
The talks about

3096
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:44,768
The principle of limited government

3097
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:46,048
Fandango

3098
02:35:46,304 --> 02:35:49,376
Why freedom is important than important to work for

3099
02:35:55,264 --> 02:35:57,056
MiFi

3100
02:35:57,312 --> 02:35:59,872
It's a good example to the Grassroots

3101
02:36:00,128 --> 02:36:01,664
Fish you can win

3102
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:03,456
Against overwhelming odds

3103
02:36:04,224 --> 02:36:07,296
I do know I have a DVD called doing the impossible

3104
02:36:07,552 --> 02:36:10,112
And which I show all the odds that were down

3105
02:36:10,368 --> 02:36:13,440
When I started the fight against the Equal Rights Amendment

3106
02:36:13,696 --> 02:36:14,976
Everybody was again

3107
02:36:15,232 --> 02:36:16,256
Against

3108
02:36:16,512 --> 02:36:18,304
The president's the congressman

3109
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:19,328
The prayer

3110
02:36:20,096 --> 02:36:24,448
Everybody you can think of everybody who is important the organization

3111
02:36:28,032 --> 02:36:30,080
People haven't got any fighting

3112
02:36:30,336 --> 02:36:31,104
Boy

3113
02:36:31,360 --> 02:36:33,664
Yeah what it would do you want to play a game

3114
02:36:34,688 --> 02:36:35,200
Schlafly

3115
02:36:38,784 --> 02:36:40,064
Equal Rights Act

3116
02:36:40,320 --> 02:36:40,832
F******

3117
02:36:41,344 --> 02:36:42,624
Batwoman

3118
02:36:42,880 --> 02:36:45,440
Has done so much damage she is eight

3119
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:49,536
Literal monster like it's one of those things where

3120
02:36:49,792 --> 02:36:50,304
We can

3121
02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:51,328
Prosecute

3122
02:36:51,840 --> 02:36:53,632
Murderers on a small scale

3123
02:36:53,888 --> 02:36:56,192
But somebody who has killed as many people as Phyllis Schlafly

3124
02:36:56,960 --> 02:36:59,008
Is Untouchable apparently

3125
02:37:00,288 --> 02:37:01,568
She is a true murderer

3126
02:37:03,616 --> 02:37:04,384
That woman

3127
02:37:04,640 --> 02:37:05,920
Has led to the death

3128
02:37:06,176 --> 02:37:07,200
So many women

3129
02:37:07,712 --> 02:37:12,832
Through distrust of distrust of influence

3130
02:37:13,088 --> 02:37:13,856
Across the

3131
02:37:14,112 --> 02:37:15,648
You f****** conservative lunatic

3132
02:37:15,904 --> 02:37:16,416
Spectrum

3133
02:37:16,928 --> 02:37:18,208
They picked her up

3134
02:37:18,464 --> 02:37:19,744
And promoted her

3135
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:21,024
Laura Lee

3136
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:22,304
To influence women

3137
02:37:22,816 --> 02:37:25,632
Was Barry Goldwater probably

3138
02:37:25,888 --> 02:37:31,008
F****** evil she is a murderer and there's no other way to describe it

3139
02:37:31,520 --> 02:37:32,288
That is what she is

3140
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:33,312
And I f******

3141
02:37:33,824 --> 02:37:34,336
She's a mess

3142
02:37:35,872 --> 02:37:37,920
I can't stand that she is allowed to walk free

3143
02:37:38,432 --> 02:37:39,456
I think she's dead

3144
02:37:40,736 --> 02:37:41,504
Natsu

3145
02:37:44,320 --> 02:37:47,904
The reason I wanted to play that clip just to give everyone a little flavor

3146
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:49,184
Of hay

3147
02:37:49,440 --> 02:37:52,768
So weird that everyone was against me when I was against the Equal Rights

3148
02:37:55,328 --> 02:37:57,120
Call rights

3149
02:37:57,376 --> 02:37:57,888
Quotes

3150
02:37:58,400 --> 02:37:58,912
Phyllis Schlafly

3151
02:37:59,168 --> 02:38:04,032
Because

3152
02:38:04,544 --> 02:38:06,080
It's like it's like a shity

3153
02:38:06,336 --> 02:38:07,104
Comics like

3154
02:38:07,872 --> 02:38:10,688
Oh man I wish I could just stay home all day

3155
02:38:11,712 --> 02:38:15,040
Find

3156
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:17,856
F****** tear you not recognizing

3157
02:38:18,112 --> 02:38:19,648
The forced part of it

3158
02:38:19,904 --> 02:38:21,184
That was really the problem

3159
02:38:21,440 --> 02:38:23,232
That's Equal Rights Act worksheet

3160
02:38:23,488 --> 02:38:26,816
But the reason I needed to keep her interview in is this

3161
02:38:29,120 --> 02:38:31,936
2016 what's your view on

3162
02:38:33,728 --> 02:38:35,264
Well I'm kind of hoping

3163
02:38:35,776 --> 02:38:37,568
If there wasn't one guy

3164
02:38:37,824 --> 02:38:39,872
Who could really make a change of Donald Trump

3165
02:38:41,920 --> 02:38:44,480
He wants to make our country great

3166
02:38:44,992 --> 02:38:48,576
A lot of these other people have no interest in making our country great

3167
02:38:49,088 --> 02:38:52,672
And I think he really genuinely does want to make our country great again

3168
02:38:53,952 --> 02:38:56,512
I think he's got a vision like Ronald Reagan

3169
02:38:57,280 --> 02:38:59,328
And I wish you well

3170
02:39:00,608 --> 02:39:03,424
I hope he's another Ronald Reagan but I tell you

3171
02:39:04,704 --> 02:39:05,728
Adopt perfect

3172
02:39:06,240 --> 02:39:07,520
Even you are not perfect

3173
02:39:09,312 --> 02:39:10,848
But anyway

3174
02:39:14,176 --> 02:39:16,224
Anyway he's got stuff

3175
02:39:16,480 --> 02:39:18,528
Yeah it alright

3176
02:39:18,784 --> 02:39:20,576
So are we see their Alex

3177
02:39:20,832 --> 02:39:23,392
Refers to Phyllis Schlafly is a living legend

3178
02:39:23,648 --> 02:39:29,792
He talks about how much she is an influential piece of his conservatism he loves Goldwater

3179
02:39:30,048 --> 02:39:31,584
As well

3180
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:32,352
When

3181
02:39:32,608 --> 02:39:33,632
When she comes back

3182
02:39:33,888 --> 02:39:37,216
And says that she's for Trump that is not a small thing

3183
02:39:39,008 --> 02:39:39,520
Game time

3184
02:39:39,776 --> 02:39:40,544
She gives him

3185
02:39:40,800 --> 02:39:41,568
His deflection

3186
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:42,592
He's not perfect

3187
02:39:43,360 --> 02:39:44,128
Bonita resigning

3188
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:47,456
Something he will use for the neck

3189
02:39:47,712 --> 02:39:48,480
His wife

3190
02:39:49,248 --> 02:39:52,064
So at this point I was Jones opens up the phone line

3191
02:39:52,320 --> 02:39:56,416
He wants to have people call in who have been victims of PC culture on campus

3192
02:39:58,208 --> 02:39:58,720
And it goes on

3193
02:39:58,976 --> 02:40:04,608
Even if you disagree with me if you want

3194
02:40:04,864 --> 02:40:05,632
Awesome

3195
02:40:05,888 --> 02:40:09,728
He goes on to also talk about how when Starbucks had their like let's talk

3196
02:40:09,984 --> 02:40:10,496
On the cops

3197
02:40:11,776 --> 02:40:16,640
Operational trouble man this country was so much better off we were getting along before Obama came in like

3198
02:40:16,896 --> 02:40:17,408
Call boy

3199
02:40:17,664 --> 02:40:18,432
Yeah boy

3200
02:40:18,944 --> 02:40:19,968
Great that's not

3201
02:40:20,736 --> 02:40:22,016
Cripplingly racist as is

3202
02:40:23,296 --> 02:40:24,064
So much and

3203
02:40:24,320 --> 02:40:26,880
Still doing it now that idea of like

3204
02:40:27,136 --> 02:40:28,160
He wants to make our

3205
02:40:28,928 --> 02:40:29,696
Against

3206
02:40:29,952 --> 02:40:30,976
I do that

3207
02:40:31,488 --> 02:40:32,512
Any meaning

3208
02:40:32,768 --> 02:40:35,328
They don't talk about how they don't talk about what

3209
02:40:35,584 --> 02:40:37,376
They don't talk about anything other than

3210
02:40:37,632 --> 02:40:39,168
I get the general

3211
02:40:39,424 --> 02:40:39,936
Feeling

3212
02:40:40,192 --> 02:40:41,728
Betty wants to make America great

3213
02:40:43,008 --> 02:40:43,520
Dutch

3214
02:40:43,776 --> 02:40:46,592
Perfect way to deny that you're a giant

3215
02:40:48,128 --> 02:40:48,640
It's such a

3216
02:40:48,896 --> 02:40:49,664
Perfect wave

3217
02:40:49,920 --> 02:40:51,200
To deny that you wanted

3218
02:40:51,456 --> 02:40:52,224
Kill poor people

3219
02:40:52,736 --> 02:40:57,600
It's just such a perfect way to Encompass all of this right-wing b*******

3220
02:40:57,856 --> 02:40:59,648
Only thing it'll like

3221
02:40:59,904 --> 02:41:00,672
I feel like he wants

3222
02:41:00,928 --> 02:41:01,440
How to make American

3223
02:41:05,024 --> 02:41:06,304
There's no meaning

3224
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:13,728
For as much as Alex complains about George Orwell

3225
02:41:13,984 --> 02:41:14,496
Peace out

3226
02:41:14,752 --> 02:41:16,032
Do you think you'd be able to be like

3227
02:41:17,056 --> 02:41:18,592
Might be some sort of a cc

3228
02:41:19,104 --> 02:41:21,152
Yeah buddy.

3229
02:41:23,456 --> 02:41:24,224
The time is come

3230
02:41:24,992 --> 02:41:28,576
18 episodes of Investigation have been leading us to this point

3231
02:41:28,832 --> 02:41:30,368
Rodger Stone makes his appearance

3232
02:41:30,624 --> 02:41:31,904
On the Alex Jones Show

3233
02:41:32,416 --> 02:41:34,464
And now we will find out if my prediction

3234
02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:35,232
What's correct

3235
02:41:36,512 --> 02:41:37,536
Start supporting Trump

3236
02:41:37,792 --> 02:41:40,864
As soon as Rodger Stone shows up

3237
02:41:41,120 --> 02:41:41,632
Prediction was

3238
02:41:43,424 --> 02:41:45,728
Before they get into any trouble matters

3239
02:41:45,984 --> 02:41:47,008
They want to s*** on Hillary

3240
02:41:47,776 --> 02:41:51,360
Gaston has a book about Hillary having a war on

3241
02:41:51,616 --> 02:41:53,152
Yep

3242
02:41:53,920 --> 02:41:54,944
Ostensibly the reason

3243
02:42:01,088 --> 02:42:01,600
These nuts

3244
02:42:01,856 --> 02:42:03,904
This is what movie

3245
02:42:05,440 --> 02:42:06,720
Very short-tempered

3246
02:42:17,728 --> 02:42:18,752
And choose carpet

3247
02:42:21,312 --> 02:42:25,152
That's pretty amazing

3248
02:42:27,200 --> 02:42:29,504
Are you saying that we shouldn't have somebody who has a

3249
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:31,296
The foul-mouthed short temper and his

3250
02:42:31,552 --> 02:42:32,064
Exceptional

3251
02:42:32,320 --> 02:42:33,600
Greedy in the White House

3252
02:42:34,112 --> 02:42:34,624
Are you saying that

3253
02:42:35,136 --> 02:42:37,696
A Bad series of quality to have in a f******

3254
02:42:37,952 --> 02:42:40,768
What are you saying that that's not what we

3255
02:42:41,024 --> 02:42:45,120
Understand is that this is Rodger Stone hot dog

3256
02:42:45,632 --> 02:42:46,656
This is them showing off

3257
02:42:46,912 --> 02:42:48,192
Yeah he's showing off that he can

3258
02:42:48,448 --> 02:42:49,984
Just f****** say whatever a goddamn

3259
02:42:50,240 --> 02:42:53,312
It shows how stupid and gullible Alex

3260
02:42:53,568 --> 02:42:54,080
Yeah

3261
02:42:56,384 --> 02:42:56,896
Carpet

3262
02:42:57,152 --> 02:42:58,176
That's amazing

3263
02:43:03,808 --> 02:43:04,320
What is 30

3264
02:43:05,344 --> 02:43:10,464
What is that

3265
02:43:11,488 --> 02:43:12,000
So

3266
02:43:12,768 --> 02:43:13,280
These nuts

3267
02:43:13,536 --> 02:43:14,048
Clips

3268
02:43:14,560 --> 02:43:16,608
Are essentially Rodger Stone

3269
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:19,424
Haven't watched

3270
02:43:19,680 --> 02:43:21,984
Knowing what Alex Jones is rebuttal

3271
02:43:22,240 --> 02:43:22,752
The Trump bar

3272
02:43:23,264 --> 02:43:25,056
And knocking them down one by one

3273
02:43:25,824 --> 02:43:27,104
So the first one

3274
02:43:27,360 --> 02:43:28,896
The Dow Jones

3275
02:43:29,152 --> 02:43:29,664
2 is

3276
02:43:29,920 --> 02:43:30,432
Mob connect

3277
02:43:32,480 --> 02:43:32,992
Flip flops

3278
02:43:33,504 --> 02:43:35,040
What the biggest one is

3279
02:43:35,296 --> 02:43:36,064
Can we trust

3280
02:43:36,320 --> 02:43:37,344
Is he for real

3281
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:39,392
Or is this some sort of a joke

3282
02:43:40,160 --> 02:43:41,184
Here's the answer to that one

3283
02:43:41,952 --> 02:43:45,536
Rodger Stone

3284
02:43:47,328 --> 02:43:51,680
He was the chairman of Donald Trump's exploratory campaign

3285
02:44:03,968 --> 02:44:10,112
There's no question I don't agree with Trump on everything

3286
02:44:11,904 --> 02:44:12,928
Ticket by Trump

3287
02:44:13,184 --> 02:44:14,208
Can't bully Trump

3288
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:21,888
Definition of lobbyists he doesn't understand special interest

3289
02:44:22,144 --> 02:44:24,192
Baby's first present we've had to really work

3290
02:44:24,448 --> 02:44:26,240
For the American people

3291
02:44:31,104 --> 02:44:35,968
Corrupt

3292
02:44:57,216 --> 02:45:03,360
Sleep

3293
02:45:07,712 --> 02:45:11,552
And where he was really born into the political mainstream

3294
02:45:11,808 --> 02:45:17,952
That's why he's ahead of the polls to go

3295
02:45:21,792 --> 02:45:25,120
So I'm going to load of bulshit but

3296
02:45:25,632 --> 02:45:26,912
You see that the thing

3297
02:45:27,168 --> 02:45:29,216
EZ's deflecting Alex Jones

3298
02:45:29,472 --> 02:45:33,824
Concerns about whether he's for real or not and then adding on Dino's Alex

3299
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:36,128
Super into racism 9/11

3300
02:45:38,688 --> 02:45:41,248
All those things

3301
02:45:41,504 --> 02:45:42,784
He's so much more than

3302
02:45:43,808 --> 02:45:45,344
So now we get to the Mob question

3303
02:45:46,112 --> 02:45:49,696
Okay cuz Alex really put together a birder's bro thing

3304
02:45:49,952 --> 02:45:50,464
Things that I would hate

3305
02:45:50,976 --> 02:45:52,768
I feel like

3306
02:45:53,024 --> 02:45:54,560
Curated this episode just to like

3307
02:45:55,328 --> 02:45:56,864
Can I destroy Jordans

3308
02:45:57,376 --> 02:46:01,728
Very angry

3309
02:46:01,984 --> 02:46:03,264
You stole from him

3310
02:46:03,519 --> 02:46:05,055
And leave him a

3311
02:46:05,311 --> 02:46:05,823
Bitter husk

3312
02:46:06,079 --> 02:46:07,871
Total perspective

3313
02:46:08,127 --> 02:46:08,639
Vortex

3314
02:46:08,895 --> 02:46:09,407
From Douglas Adams

3315
02:46:09,919 --> 02:46:14,527
See you you're looking at this wrong and I'll explain it a little bit later but we get to the mom question

3316
02:46:15,039 --> 02:46:18,623
Close friend

3317
02:46:25,535 --> 02:46:27,583
New Jersey casino control license

3318
02:46:28,095 --> 02:46:29,631
And hold one for 13 years

3319
02:46:30,143 --> 02:46:33,983
If you're in bed with the mob it's just not possible they have the most stringent laws

3320
02:46:34,239 --> 02:46:38,847
They put a proctoscope right up your derriere and they look at every financial transaction

3321
02:46:39,103 --> 02:46:40,895
In your entire life.

3322
02:46:41,151 --> 02:46:44,735
It's clean and they got nothing on him that's amazing

3323
02:46:47,039 --> 02:46:50,623
Opposite of what is true we can't be mobbed up cuz he works in casino

3324
02:46:54,975 --> 02:46:55,743
Staggering

3325
02:46:56,255 --> 02:46:58,047
What

3326
02:46:58,303 --> 02:46:59,839
You can't hold a license for 30

3327
02:47:00,095 --> 02:47:00,607
Seniors

3328
02:47:00,863 --> 02:47:02,399
Unless you're Bob's

3329
02:47:02,655 --> 02:47:07,263
Alex pies at Hook Line & Sinker

3330
02:47:07,775 --> 02:47:12,127
To the point where later in the interview Alex brings up the Bob stuff

3331
02:47:12,383 --> 02:47:13,919
As if he never believed

3332
02:47:14,431 --> 02:47:15,199
No fuc

3333
02:47:15,455 --> 02:47:20,319
People believe in the Bob

3334
02:47:20,831 --> 02:47:24,671
Indeed quail in the course of the interview you see Alex Jones

3335
02:47:24,927 --> 02:47:25,951
Denying things

3336
02:47:26,207 --> 02:47:27,231
Penske said in the past

3337
02:47:30,815 --> 02:47:32,351
Sup

3338
02:47:32,607 --> 02:47:34,399
Rodger Stone

3339
02:47:34,655 --> 02:47:35,167
Demonstrative

3340
02:47:44,895 --> 02:47:45,407
Sure

3341
02:47:45,919 --> 02:47:46,943
Alex Jones

3342
02:47:47,711 --> 02:47:50,783
Is the only one who can save America

3343
02:47:51,039 --> 02:47:51,551
Sure

3344
02:47:52,575 --> 02:47:53,087
Signed off on it

3345
02:47:53,343 --> 02:47:54,111
Sure sure

3346
02:47:54,879 --> 02:47:55,647
Sure

3347
02:47:55,903 --> 02:47:57,183
Here's where the interview gets

3348
02:47:58,719 --> 02:47:59,231
And they don't talk

3349
02:48:02,815 --> 02:48:03,327
Obviously

3350
02:48:06,399 --> 02:48:08,191
The globalist and all of their

3351
02:48:08,447 --> 02:48:09,727
Armies of

3352
02:48:10,239 --> 02:48:10,751
Snapchat like that

3353
02:48:11,007 --> 02:48:13,311
Sarah

3354
02:48:13,567 --> 02:48:14,079
The next clip

3355
02:48:14,335 --> 02:48:14,847
Realwear

3356
02:48:15,359 --> 02:48:16,383
This indicates

3357
02:48:16,639 --> 02:48:18,431
Rodger Stone 104

3358
02:48:18,687 --> 02:48:19,199
That wasn't salad

3359
02:48:19,967 --> 02:48:20,991
There is no doubt that

3360
02:48:21,247 --> 02:48:23,807
Keenly aware of where a lot of his

3361
02:48:24,575 --> 02:48:28,671
We're a lot of his interests lie and maybe the parent companies

3362
02:48:28,927 --> 02:48:30,207
Monetary interest fly

3363
02:48:30,975 --> 02:48:31,487
This is interesting

3364
02:48:34,815 --> 02:48:37,119
Cuz I know his views on monetary reform

3365
02:48:43,775 --> 02:48:47,871
I can tell you that right now.

3366
02:48:50,943 --> 02:48:56,831
Provided for in our government

3367
02:49:03,231 --> 02:49:05,279
This is wild

3368
02:49:05,535 --> 02:49:10,143
You're seeing Alex gets flipped real time it is it is amazing

3369
02:49:10,399 --> 02:49:10,911
8/8

3370
02:49:11,167 --> 02:49:11,679
It's

3371
02:49:12,447 --> 02:49:15,263
It's hard not to like look at Stone do this and be like

3372
02:49:16,287 --> 02:49:22,431
12 player game recognize game

3373
02:49:23,967 --> 02:49:29,343
Radar currently be like hey if I just lied Alex

3374
02:49:29,599 --> 02:49:30,367
You've gotta believe

3375
02:49:31,391 --> 02:49:31,903
As long as

3376
02:49:32,159 --> 02:49:37,535
Because what the f****** Federal Reserve does

3377
02:49:37,791 --> 02:49:38,559
She might

3378
02:49:39,583 --> 02:49:40,351
Okay you're right

3379
02:49:42,143 --> 02:49:45,471
Definitely doesn't know that you want to shut it down

3380
02:49:46,495 --> 02:49:50,591
Certainly not going to go back to the gold standard

3381
02:49:50,847 --> 02:49:51,871
You know who

3382
02:49:53,407 --> 02:49:54,175
Of course

3383
02:49:54,431 --> 02:50:00,575
So what what Rodger stone is basically doing a lot of levels you taking

3384
02:50:01,087 --> 02:50:07,231
Taking the things that Alex loves about Rand Paul and applying them to Trump

3385
02:50:14,143 --> 02:50:20,031
Absolute about 9/11

3386
02:50:20,287 --> 02:50:21,055
It's all just

3387
02:50:21,311 --> 02:50:23,103
Political it's all just grandstanding

3388
02:50:23,359 --> 02:50:24,127
Of a guy who's

3389
02:50:24,383 --> 02:50:26,175
Staying whatever it is he feels like

3390
02:50:26,431 --> 02:50:31,551
I've been repeating back what people tell him they like when you have no ethics

3391
02:50:31,807 --> 02:50:34,111
And your skull

3392
02:50:34,367 --> 02:50:35,391
That's what you do

3393
02:50:38,719 --> 02:50:40,511
So now now

3394
02:50:41,279 --> 02:50:42,047
The other thing

3395
02:50:42,559 --> 02:50:43,839
That Alex is always had

3396
02:50:44,095 --> 02:50:45,375
The bee in his bonnet

3397
02:50:45,887 --> 02:50:47,167
Is that

3398
02:50:47,423 --> 02:50:48,191
Trump has connect

3399
02:50:48,447 --> 02:50:49,215
Hillary Clinton

3400
02:50:49,727 --> 02:50:51,775
Amy said positive things about Hillary Clinton

3401
02:50:52,799 --> 02:50:54,591
So this comes up next

3402
02:50:55,359 --> 02:50:56,639
But it's in the context

3403
02:50:56,895 --> 02:50:57,407
Glenn Beck

3404
02:50:58,175 --> 02:50:58,687
Because Alex

3405
02:50:58,943 --> 02:51:00,479
Is starting to agree with Rodger

3406
02:51:00,735 --> 02:51:03,295
Stone it doesn't want to admit that he is

3407
02:51:03,551 --> 02:51:04,319
Concerns about that

3408
02:51:04,575 --> 02:51:05,087
Teresa's

3409
02:51:05,343 --> 02:51:06,879
Glenn Beck his head concerns

3410
02:51:07,135 --> 02:51:10,719
About Donald Trump's connection

3411
02:51:13,279 --> 02:51:19,167
He loves a man of his position he has to pimp out Glenn back in order to even

3412
02:51:19,423 --> 02:51:21,215
Raise the question that he wants to talk

3413
02:51:38,367 --> 02:51:43,231
Yeah but I like Glenn a time before Dad can we know what is beef is with Donald Trump

3414
02:51:49,631 --> 02:51:54,495
His business he is right

3415
02:51:54,751 --> 02:51:55,519
If you don't

3416
02:51:55,775 --> 02:52:01,663
Campaign contributions into the pockets of the politicians they don't even listen to

3417
02:52:04,991 --> 02:52:09,087
Used to people working for you to get your point of view in front of government

3418
02:52:09,599 --> 02:52:14,975
Relationship

3419
02:52:30,335 --> 02:52:33,919
Boat from the dock

3420
02:52:36,735 --> 02:52:39,807
They're fighting to keep us

3421
02:52:42,623 --> 02:52:48,767
Rodger Stone more things to tell him Trump is going to do

3422
02:52:51,071 --> 02:52:51,583
Yeah

3423
02:52:51,839 --> 02:52:52,351
F******

3424
02:52:53,631 --> 02:52:54,399
This is Dad

3425
02:53:01,311 --> 02:53:03,103
What is my name

3426
02:53:04,127 --> 02:53:04,639
Who's making me

3427
02:53:04,895 --> 02:53:05,919
Feel bad for Allie

3428
02:53:06,687 --> 02:53:07,711
It's just watching it

3429
02:53:07,967 --> 02:53:10,015
It's like

3430
02:53:10,271 --> 02:53:11,551
Santa Clause 2

3431
02:53:11,807 --> 02:53:13,343
Tile

3432
02:53:13,855 --> 02:53:18,463
Just it's just all imaginary nonsense

3433
02:53:18,719 --> 02:53:21,023
Meeting was

3434
02:53:21,279 --> 02:53:22,303
O'Hara dating Alex

3435
02:53:24,351 --> 02:53:24,863
Wow

3436
02:53:26,143 --> 02:53:27,679
I heard that

3437
02:53:29,727 --> 02:53:35,871
No Putin fighting the global is he's offended Christian

3438
02:53:36,383 --> 02:53:38,687
Very frequently said I have from

3439
02:53:38,943 --> 02:53:39,967
Secret sources

3440
02:53:40,223 --> 02:53:43,807
The secret Leah Christian secretly defending christened

3441
02:53:44,063 --> 02:53:45,855
How much do you think come from

3442
02:53:46,111 --> 02:53:50,975
Spies accidentally talked to in fake interviews with Artie

3443
02:53:52,255 --> 02:53:52,767
Crazy

3444
02:53:53,535 --> 02:53:55,071
Crazy

3445
02:53:55,327 --> 02:54:01,471
And this is where I think Rodger Stone pulled out the death blow the whole political correct again.

3446
02:54:01,727 --> 02:54:04,287
He understands that freedom is on the ropes

3447
02:54:18,623 --> 02:54:22,463
Weird

3448
02:54:22,719 --> 02:54:27,327
How many death threats do you think

3449
02:54:31,935 --> 02:54:37,311
Sure because he's speaking out on a lot of controversial subjects o

3450
02:54:37,567 --> 02:54:42,431
Is AAA security he himself carries both his sons

3451
02:54:42,687 --> 02:54:46,271
Very active Hunters

3452
02:54:53,439 --> 02:54:57,279
Reagan Carey Reagan had a holster you know on his

3453
02:54:57,791 --> 02:54:59,583
He was carrying about 80% of the time

3454
02:55:06,239 --> 02:55:12,383
Yeah I'm sure he wishes he was carried when Hinckley tried to take him out or Hinckley and others try to take you out

3455
02:55:12,639 --> 02:55:15,967
Run has been carrying

3456
02:55:16,223 --> 02:55:22,111
If only RFK Sirhan Sirhan

3457
02:55:23,647 --> 02:55:24,927
Also Reagan husband

3458
02:55:25,695 --> 02:55:29,279
According to that guy whose name I can't remember

3459
02:55:30,559 --> 02:55:32,607
Like I you see it you see it there

3460
02:55:32,863 --> 02:55:33,375
Like that

3461
02:55:33,631 --> 02:55:36,191
The transformative moment I believe the moment

3462
02:55:36,447 --> 02:55:37,983
Rodger stone is saying

3463
02:55:39,519 --> 02:55:40,543
Carrying all the time

3464
02:55:40,799 --> 02:55:42,079
His sons are big gun

3465
02:55:45,407 --> 02:55:46,431
Amanda

3466
02:55:46,943 --> 02:55:47,967
Do we have a president

3467
02:55:48,223 --> 02:55:48,991
Who carry yep

3468
02:55:49,247 --> 02:55:50,015
And then he'd that's it

3469
02:55:50,527 --> 02:55:51,295
Giant boner right

3470
02:55:55,391 --> 02:55:55,903
Come back to guns

3471
02:55:56,671 --> 02:55:57,183
Like that

3472
02:55:57,439 --> 02:56:01,791
That's where we we kind of started with that couple of ideas of

3473
02:56:02,047 --> 02:56:03,071
Is it racism

3474
02:56:03,327 --> 02:56:03,839
Is it.

3475
02:56:05,375 --> 02:56:06,655
Absolutely but

3476
02:56:06,911 --> 02:56:07,679
The death blows

3477
02:56:08,703 --> 02:56:09,983
Why did Gatsby

3478
02:56:10,239 --> 02:56:11,263
Court trumpism

3479
02:56:12,287 --> 02:56:13,311
Are you f******

3480
02:56:14,079 --> 02:56:14,591
Sane

3481
02:56:14,847 --> 02:56:15,871
How could you possibly

3482
02:56:16,127 --> 02:56:16,639
We Believe

3483
02:56:16,895 --> 02:56:22,015
Manual dexterity

3484
02:56:22,527 --> 02:56:24,319
I am at the end of November 9th

3485
02:56:24,831 --> 02:56:25,855
Alex does not

3486
02:56:26,111 --> 02:56:26,879
End up saying

3487
02:56:27,135 --> 02:56:27,903
I support

3488
02:56:28,415 --> 02:56:29,439
Or anything like that

3489
02:56:29,951 --> 02:56:33,791
But you can't believe everything that Rogers Donuts

3490
02:56:34,047 --> 02:56:36,351
And this is going to get integrated into his world

3491
02:56:36,863 --> 02:56:38,143
I predict Within

3492
02:56:38,655 --> 02:56:39,167
2 days

3493
02:56:39,679 --> 02:56:41,471
He's going to come out and say that he supports

3494
02:56:42,495 --> 02:56:44,287
I'm guessing it will be that quick

3495
02:56:44,543 --> 02:56:45,311
I don't know yet

3496
02:56:45,823 --> 02:56:46,335
But

3497
02:56:46,847 --> 02:56:47,359
Tumi

3498
02:56:47,615 --> 02:56:48,639
Abyss episode

3499
02:56:48,895 --> 02:56:50,943
Is the end of me being curious

3500
02:56:51,199 --> 02:56:52,479
Yeah Rodger Stone did it

3501
02:56:52,735 --> 02:56:53,503
Well it's

3502
02:56:53,759 --> 02:56:57,343
That's right Russia setup

3503
02:56:57,599 --> 02:57:00,159
11 Rodger Stone was the point man who knocked it over

3504
02:57:06,815 --> 02:57:08,351
No just the one

3505
02:57:09,375 --> 02:57:10,655
But I mean I take it

3506
02:57:12,703 --> 02:57:14,495
So transparent it's just like

3507
02:57:16,287 --> 02:57:18,591
Yeah I know it like rogered

3508
02:57:18,847 --> 02:57:19,871
That could have done

3509
02:57:21,407 --> 02:57:22,687
20 minutes of research

3510
02:57:22,943 --> 02:57:23,967
Listening to a couple of clips

3511
02:57:24,223 --> 02:57:24,991
In bitlife

3512
02:57:25,247 --> 02:57:26,015
Like this this this

3513
02:57:26,271 --> 02:57:27,551
Send this a lot so I'm just

3514
02:57:27,807 --> 02:57:28,319
Going to say Trump.

3515
02:57:29,599 --> 02:57:31,135
Alex is going to believe

3516
02:57:31,391 --> 02:57:35,999
Because of the groundwork that's been laid by Alex's pro-russia position

3517
02:57:36,511 --> 02:57:37,535
Because of

3518
02:57:38,047 --> 02:57:40,351
Fellow member of the 45 groups

3519
02:57:40,607 --> 02:57:41,631
Pieczenik coming in

3520
02:57:41,887 --> 02:57:42,655
I'm speeding Alex

3521
02:57:42,911 --> 02:57:44,959
The Narrative that Trump

3522
02:57:45,215 --> 02:57:47,519
Knows everything he's on the right side of

3523
02:57:48,799 --> 02:57:51,615
Alex was Prime from a week ago when piszczek was on

3524
02:57:51,871 --> 02:57:56,479
You remember that Steve was asking to come on

3525
02:57:58,015 --> 02:57:59,295
To come on as a setup

3526
02:57:59,551 --> 02:58:00,575
For this press

3527
02:58:00,831 --> 02:58:03,391
Like a week and a half later when Rodger Stone shows up

3528
02:58:03,903 --> 02:58:05,951
Mysteriously on his book tour

3529
02:58:06,207 --> 02:58:10,047
Book much they just talk about how great Trump is

3530
02:58:11,071 --> 02:58:13,119
It's my investigation

3531
02:58:13,631 --> 02:58:14,143
It is over

3532
02:58:14,655 --> 02:58:15,679
But I'm going to keep going

3533
02:58:16,191 --> 02:58:16,959
Until

3534
02:58:18,239 --> 02:58:20,543
Yeah it's okay

3535
02:58:22,079 --> 02:58:24,127
We at we know we know what happened

3536
02:58:24,383 --> 02:58:24,895
Now

3537
02:58:25,407 --> 02:58:26,431
I think you and I

3538
02:58:26,687 --> 02:58:28,223
And our policy walks out there

3539
02:58:28,479 --> 02:58:28,991
No

3540
02:58:29,503 --> 02:58:30,271
Astoria vets

3541
02:58:30,527 --> 02:58:31,039
No one else

3542
02:58:32,063 --> 02:58:33,343
There is a

3543
02:58:33,599 --> 02:58:34,367
Massive

3544
02:58:35,391 --> 02:58:37,951
I don't know what the exact connection

3545
02:58:38,207 --> 02:58:39,743
With Trump and Russia is

3546
02:58:39,999 --> 02:58:40,767
I don't know

3547
02:58:41,023 --> 02:58:42,559
But we know damn well

3548
02:58:42,815 --> 02:58:44,351
But Alex has been compromised

3549
02:58:44,607 --> 02:58:46,399
Alex has an asset for Russia

3550
02:58:46,655 --> 02:58:47,167
And

3551
02:58:47,679 --> 02:58:48,959
He's a gullible f***

3552
02:58:49,215 --> 02:58:50,751
Being used by the members of the

3553
02:58:51,007 --> 02:58:52,031
The 45 group

3554
02:58:52,287 --> 02:58:53,567
Steve pieczenik

3555
02:58:54,079 --> 02:58:57,407
The I don't know the rest of the people who were in a Rodger stone for sure

3556
02:58:57,663 --> 02:58:59,455
He's being used as a puppet

3557
02:58:59,711 --> 02:59:02,527
Football on their part in order to get elected

3558
02:59:02,783 --> 02:59:03,807
Probably

3559
02:59:04,063 --> 02:59:04,575
Serving Russia

3560
02:59:06,111 --> 02:59:07,903
It's very very very clear

3561
02:59:08,927 --> 02:59:09,439
Yeah

3562
02:59:10,463 --> 02:59:11,487
Game over

3563
02:59:12,255 --> 02:59:15,327
Congratulations everybody

3564
02:59:16,351 --> 02:59:22,239
We made it to the end we figured out the knowledge that we needed and

3565
02:59:22,495 --> 02:59:23,519
To being impotent

3566
02:59:25,311 --> 02:59:26,335
It is kind of

3567
02:59:26,591 --> 02:59:27,359
It is kind of funny

3568
02:59:27,871 --> 02:59:28,895
That I

3569
02:59:30,175 --> 02:59:32,479
Like there's a certain amount of

3570
02:59:33,759 --> 02:59:34,271
Silliness

3571
02:59:34,527 --> 02:59:36,831
To the idea that all of these powerful

3572
02:59:38,111 --> 02:59:39,391
Secretive brilliant man

3573
02:59:41,183 --> 02:59:42,463
I have to go to

3574
02:59:42,719 --> 02:59:43,231
A dumb

3575
02:59:43,999 --> 02:59:45,791
Paranoid delusional schizophrenia

3576
02:59:46,303 --> 02:59:47,327
And doodle

3577
02:59:47,583 --> 02:59:48,863
Minimal amount of

3578
02:59:49,119 --> 02:59:49,631
Convincing

3579
02:59:49,887 --> 02:59:51,167
For then

3580
02:59:52,703 --> 02:59:53,215
Millions of

3581
02:59:53,471 --> 02:59:55,263
People

3582
02:59:55,519 --> 02:59:59,615
They could do it themselves

3583
02:59:59,871 --> 03:00:02,431
Years and years of radicalizing

3584
03:00:03,967 --> 03:00:05,503
Fringe of firing his audience

3585
03:00:06,015 --> 03:00:09,087
To the point where there are millions of people who are up for grabs

3586
03:00:09,599 --> 03:00:10,623
Do the brilliance

3587
03:00:10,879 --> 03:00:11,903
Strategic move

3588
03:00:12,159 --> 03:00:13,183
To tap into that

3589
03:00:13,439 --> 03:00:13,951
Because

3590
03:00:14,207 --> 03:00:15,743
They're not going to leave you

3591
03:00:16,255 --> 03:00:17,023
They're brainwash

3592
03:00:18,303 --> 03:00:21,375
Like every want to listen to Infowars

3593
03:00:21,631 --> 03:00:22,911
People

3594
03:00:23,167 --> 03:00:24,959
You can see it in the trans

3595
03:00:25,983 --> 03:00:29,567
You conceived it back when Alex was saying the Trump was mobbed up

3596
03:00:29,823 --> 03:00:30,847
The callers were saying

3597
03:00:31,359 --> 03:00:34,175
Started to say I like what you saying but I don't trust him

3598
03:00:34,431 --> 03:00:35,967
Every single caller mirror.

3599
03:00:36,479 --> 03:00:37,759
I guarantee within a week

3600
03:00:38,015 --> 03:00:40,319
Everyone's going to say Zhang

3601
03:00:40,575 --> 03:00:41,343
Trump is awesome

3602
03:00:41,599 --> 03:00:43,903
He's our only hope he's already had colors

3603
03:00:45,951 --> 03:00:50,559
A couple and then you also have callers that I haven't even like I haven't kept it everything just cuz

3604
03:00:50,815 --> 03:00:52,863
Then we don't make us a Five Hour podcast

3605
03:00:55,423 --> 03:00:57,215
Call in and say

3606
03:00:57,471 --> 03:01:01,055
The Dare that it's just

3607
03:01:01,567 --> 03:01:05,151
You know they talk about Rush Limbaugh fans being dittoheads

3608
03:01:05,407 --> 03:01:08,735
Yeah I had to signing off on everything Rush Limbaugh believes that's nothing

3609
03:01:08,991 --> 03:01:10,271
Compared to Alex Jones

3610
03:01:10,527 --> 03:01:12,063
And the reason he's dangerous

3611
03:01:12,319 --> 03:01:13,343
Is it smaller but more fervor

3612
03:01:14,111 --> 03:01:17,439
I don't know definitely smaller but varfer but yeah you're right but

3613
03:01:17,695 --> 03:01:18,975
The reason it's dangerous

3614
03:01:19,231 --> 03:01:19,999
Impark

3615
03:01:20,255 --> 03:01:20,767
Parcel

3616
03:01:21,791 --> 03:01:23,583
His indoctrination of his audience

3617
03:01:24,095 --> 03:01:25,887
Is convincing them that their free thing

3618
03:01:26,655 --> 03:01:27,167
Part of it is

3619
03:01:27,423 --> 03:01:27,935
Convincing them

3620
03:01:28,191 --> 03:01:29,983
That what makes you info Warriors

3621
03:01:30,239 --> 03:01:31,007
Is it you resist

3622
03:01:31,263 --> 03:01:32,799
The brainwashing of the globalist

3623
03:01:33,311 --> 03:01:34,335
You think for yourself

3624
03:01:34,591 --> 03:01:40,735
Wow at the same time falling in line with literally every married if I'm pushing that happens too large

3625
03:01:40,991 --> 03:01:41,503
Russian propaganda

3626
03:01:42,527 --> 03:01:43,039
F****** insane

3627
03:01:44,063 --> 03:01:44,831
F****** insane

3628
03:01:47,903 --> 03:01:50,975
Old episode of ours

3629
03:01:51,231 --> 03:01:56,607
Episode where I was making the argument that Alex

3630
03:01:56,863 --> 03:01:58,655
Is not someone who's involved

3631
03:01:58,911 --> 03:02:00,191
With Russia he's just an idiot

3632
03:02:01,983 --> 03:02:02,495
Full

3633
03:02:02,751 --> 03:02:06,335
Full circle and all it takes is listening to his goddamn show

3634
03:02:08,895 --> 03:02:13,759
Specific

3635
03:02:14,015 --> 03:02:15,807
Convincing myself at least

3636
03:02:16,063 --> 03:02:17,343
That like oh he's not

3637
03:02:17,599 --> 03:02:18,623
Sing a true thing

3638
03:02:18,879 --> 03:02:22,207
It's not real

3639
03:02:22,463 --> 03:02:22,975
In

3640
03:02:24,255 --> 03:02:24,767
Whether it's

3641
03:02:25,023 --> 03:02:26,047
Destabilizing countries

3642
03:02:26,303 --> 03:02:28,607
Or a demon

3643
03:02:29,119 --> 03:02:35,007
So I mean it's very clear Alex Smith

3644
03:02:35,263 --> 03:02:37,567
But he got drilled by f****** Russian intelligence

3645
03:02:37,823 --> 03:02:38,847
Didn't do anything about it

3646
03:02:39,103 --> 03:02:40,383
I mean that's all you need to know

3647
03:02:41,919 --> 03:02:42,943
Could be our investigation

3648
03:02:43,711 --> 03:02:46,271
Rodger Stone interview are all you need

3649
03:02:46,783 --> 03:02:48,575
All the rest of it is just

3650
03:02:48,831 --> 03:02:49,343
Proof

3651
03:02:49,599 --> 03:02:51,903
More proof

3652
03:02:52,415 --> 03:02:55,999
Like number of

3653
03:02:56,255 --> 03:02:58,047
Twisted I know we're not done

3654
03:02:58,303 --> 03:03:00,095
I mean with with our investigation

3655
03:03:00,607 --> 03:03:01,887
Curiosity

3656
03:03:04,191 --> 03:03:04,703
Twisted Tea

3657
03:03:04,959 --> 03:03:07,007
Turns all along the way

3658
03:03:07,263 --> 03:03:08,031
Enforced on what it is

3659
03:03:08,287 --> 03:03:09,311
He's doing yeah

3660
03:03:09,823 --> 03:03:10,335
And then

3661
03:03:10,591 --> 03:03:11,359
The fact that it just

3662
03:03:12,127 --> 03:03:12,639
F******

3663
03:03:13,407 --> 03:03:15,967
Funnel Vision

3664
03:03:17,247 --> 03:03:17,759
Compromised

3665
03:03:18,015 --> 03:03:18,783
Rodger Stone

3666
03:03:19,807 --> 03:03:20,575
Made him part of

3667
03:03:21,087 --> 03:03:23,135
Rodger stone that was my first prediction

3668
03:03:24,927 --> 03:03:25,951
Surrounding it I could never

3669
03:03:27,231 --> 03:03:27,743
This is not

3670
03:03:29,791 --> 03:03:30,303
So what is it

3671
03:03:30,815 --> 03:03:32,351
So now that we know

3672
03:03:32,607 --> 03:03:33,119
He's

3673
03:03:33,631 --> 03:03:34,143
Pizza Ranch

3674
03:03:34,399 --> 03:03:34,911
Propaganda

3675
03:03:36,447 --> 03:03:37,471
Is there anything

3676
03:03:37,983 --> 03:03:38,495
Do

3677
03:03:38,751 --> 03:03:39,775
No

3678
03:03:41,567 --> 03:03:43,359
I don't know.

3679
03:03:43,615 --> 03:03:44,383
Yeah I guess

3680
03:03:44,639 --> 03:03:46,687
India wants

3681
03:03:46,943 --> 03:03:47,455
The cover this

3682
03:03:48,223 --> 03:03:48,991

03:03:49,247 --> 03:03:51,295
80 hours approved to go through

3684
03:03:51,807 --> 03:03:52,575
But

3685
03:03:53,599 --> 03:03:55,391
I don't know I don't know what we can do

3686
03:03:55,647 --> 03:04:01,791
It's terrible to imagine they would do their job

3687
03:04:02,047 --> 03:04:03,839
For free tell your friend

3688
03:04:04,095 --> 03:04:10,239
Everybody you can let him know

3689
03:04:10,495 --> 03:04:12,031
Post about this on

03:04:12,543 --> 03:04:16,895
I'm not involved in any of that red world so if you are please

3691
03:04:17,151 --> 03:04:18,943

I hope you'll get killed everybody

3699
03:04:39,935 --> 03:04:46,079
Not everybody gets killed because they discovered Russian propaganda

3700
03:04:48,127 --> 03:04:51,967
I work plenty of ways to go that was not too bad ironically he's a cutout

3701
03:04:52,735 --> 03:04:53,759
The things you chooses

3702
03:04:56,319 --> 03:04:57,343

Purely Outlets

3706

To get the volume

3707
03:05:10,655 --> 03:05:11,167
It's it's

3708
03:05:12,447 --> 03:05:12,959
The

3709
03:05:13,215 --> 03:05:13,727
Entire

3710
03:05:13,983 --> 03:05:14,751
Republican strategy

3711
03:05:16,287 --> 03:05:16,799
Doing something

3712
03:05:17,823 --> 03:05:18,335
Obvious

3713
03:05:19,103 --> 03:05:20,383
And then just saying that

3714
03:05:20,639 --> 03:05:21,407
No we're not doing

3715
03:05:21,663 --> 03:05:23,455
They are

3716
03:05:23,711 --> 03:05:25,247
The psychological Serta blooper

3717
03:05:28,575 --> 03:05:30,367
We were looking at it

3718
03:05:30,623 --> 03:05:33,439
With that Knowledge from the beginning

3719
03:05:34,719 --> 03:05:36,511
Sort of Revelation

3720
03:05:36,767 --> 03:05:39,071
Franklin

3721
03:05:39,327 --> 03:05:41,631
People accuse me of being Russian is like

3722
03:05:41,887 --> 03:05:44,959
Oh you're arrested

3725
03:05:54,431 --> 03:05:55,711
Standing up to

03:05:55,967 --> 03:05:58,015
People it really brings into Focus

3727
03:05:58,271 --> 03:06:00,063
Very harrowing picture

3728
03:06:00,319 --> 03:06:02,623
Easily compromised man

3729
03:06:02,879 --> 03:06:03,903
Who's suffering

3730
03:06:04,159 --> 03:06:04,671
So much

3731
03:06:05,183 --> 03:06:06,975

03:06:11,583 --> 03:06:12,095
But

3736
03:06:12,863 --> 03:06:14,911
Because the way he expresses his pain hurt

3737
03:06:15,167 --> 03:06:16,447
Millions of people

03:06:16,703 --> 03:06:22,847
