25
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:34,464
Fair enough. He's alright

26
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,256
He seems more interesting

27
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,048
I meant Danny with a dragon

28
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,840

86
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,263
I think it's pretty easy

87
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:03,359
Get the image in your head you know you hear six names listed off

88
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,663
You could easily get the idea that were like

89
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:12,063

00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,879

96
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,623
Right

97
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,743
Hiring keep me from doing what I assumed that was the case

98
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,535
If you're going to be going off on

Well I need to know what Alex was

111
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,263
People are clamoring for our insight

112
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,287
It isn't

113
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:42,431
It is

114
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,455
It feels like

115
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
The president is

116
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,015
Is trying to get a house representative

117
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,807
You have put that.

118
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,951
The president is officially

119
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,767
That doesn't really come up although Alex

00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,839
Dumb s*** about to Omar I'm not I didn't

121

To the actual news.

123
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,751
The day

124
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,543

Move on but there's other stuff you know like a songs

126
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,127
The rest

127
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,175
No those

128
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,199

00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:33,375
Interesting taken will get to it down the road

134
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,423
It's a this is a pretty boring

135
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,727
For the most part

136
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:39,775
But

137
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,823
That doesn't mean that this next

138
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
Didn't

139
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,383
Almost entirely ruined

140
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,479
Here's where we start at the episode

141
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,807
And I will explain on the other end of this clip

142
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,111
A metal

143
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,183

151
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,367
They tried to please

152

And the Jolly Green

153
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,231
But I'm rushing back to the information

154
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,023
But here's the thing

155
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,631
For a moment cuz I want to discuss that quote

156
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,191
Correctly

157
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:46,079
He seems to be getting better or least this is a better version of

158
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,383
Unfortunately he's completely

159
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:55,551
He says that the author of the quote is unknown and it's about written on a cell wall during the Revolutionary War

160
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,599
That isn't true that doesn't sound

161
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,415
At all established

162
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,207
It was from a March 28th

163
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,767
47 letter to the editor of the Wall Street

164
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,631

166
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,727

167
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,263
Support

168
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,799
One place that differs

169
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,823
And it's attribution

170
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,847
Book

171
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,383
It's called The Impossible Dream

172
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,663
A self-published

173
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,455
Communist track

174
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,247
Published in 1990

175
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
Dan Rather

176
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:32,159
I was hoping to track down a copy of this to read over

177
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,695
This is one of the only places that I

178
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,719
I can find where this quote is

179
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,487
Is attributed to

180
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,767
Author unknown

181
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,839
But unfortunately on Amazon

182
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,863
Cost $400

183
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:45,215
I wasn't willing to pay that $400 to get a copy of this book so I decided to

184
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,287
To see what I could learn about the author of 1 km

185
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,847
Initials km

186
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
It turns out that this is

187
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,663
Is K Maureen

188
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,199
And the more I looked into her

189
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,479
And I was

190
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,247
This book

191
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,015
Is where Alex

192
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
The quote from

193
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,855
The first thing that led me to suspect

194
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,951
Is it he has listed as a member on the website of the foundation of

The first modern

200
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,959
Specifically setup to promote libertarian ideas

201
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
That's what I thought

202
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,543
That seems like

203
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
And furthering that's

204
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,871

209
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:41,023
Call traffic but I've been waiting weeks

210
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,863
To bring it up but unfortunately

211
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
We've often meant

212
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,191
Is stupid books The Naked communist

213
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,471

215
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,031
Discover he's written a ton of books

216
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,591
A lot of them are weird fundamentalist Mormon

217
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,175
He published a book called

218
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,223
Do you want to raise a boy

219
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,415
?

220
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:13,279
It's not really there's no emphasis given to any of the words but there's a lot of different ways

221
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,047
Could be

222
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
You want to raise a boy

223
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
You walked

224
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:22,751
Do you want to raise a boy

225
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,639
The book includes

226
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:34,783
Sometimes boys get into bed sex habits during the early team

227
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,623

Wait for it

231
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,471
It starts out with masturbation

232
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,007
Then the individual

233
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,287
The partner for Mutual sex

234
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:01,919
Play these practices are destructive to the personality

235
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:06,527
To the point where he becomes involved in various types of sex crimes

236
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:12,927
Speculative

237
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,487

I guess I'm just made that way

244
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:34,431
His family are really cool

245
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,271
Is that the reason that he has a

246
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,343

247
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:45,439

00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
Kason build

Purporting to be evidence

Outside meddling in local politics

273

275
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
Concerns to the

276

According to her

283
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:03,775
I've been receiving the output from California Council on intergovernmental relations

284
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,079
When I went before governors

285
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,127
Local government reform

286
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
Testimony

Meddling in local governmental affairs

289
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,295
After my appearance there

290
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,575
Ccir reports

291
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,111
Coming to my mailbox

292
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
Friesen see what happened

293
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,183
They took her off of

294
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,999

Fugees

297
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,655
Like what is as far as a larger

298
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,935
Place inside of

299
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
The government

300
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
Body of

301
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,055
The council governmental relations

302
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:44,223
Play just like a little like the cat and the County government and Diet Coke

303
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
City government

304
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
It's just like a

305
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,831
Let's or coordinator

306
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,903
That I get

307
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
Buried

308
00:14:54,719 --> 00:15:00,095
California it would probably be tough for me to say

309
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,399
Has to do with coordination

310
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,679
Government

311
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,495
The cheese lady who goes

312
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
Some earrings

313
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,311
Agitator

314
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:14,175
I don't even know she goes to the meetings necessarily but gets the documents

315
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,199
That's intense

316
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
Conspiracy that

317
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:18,783
She stopped getting these

318
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
Report

319
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,207
So according to heat

320
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:30,047
She shows up at the ccir office and picks up the reports she was missing

321
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,327
Quote

322
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,399
There was one box near her death.

323
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,471
Studiously avoided

324
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:41,823
Well she was gone I picked up one of the documents from the box she had not looked into

325
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
It was titled

326
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
The politics of

327
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,151
Change local government

328
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
Reform

329
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,455
If you're keeping

330
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,735
Score

331
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,015
Essential element needed

332
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,295
To create a nefarious

333
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,879
And attempt to keep it away from someone

334
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,927
Whether or not that story isn't anyway

335
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:05,119
Story are not accurate if I'm

336
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,911
From these sorts of weird eyes

337
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,191
Government sources

338
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,775
Documents

339
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Book on

340
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,591
Control techniques

341
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,639
Okay sorry sorry apology

342
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,175
Spell appalling negation of

343
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,711
The principle of self-government

344
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,991
Publix

345
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
News politics

346
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,575
Shooting programs

347
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,951
The report itself is a 220 page analysis

348
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,999
Pictures of local government

349
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,791
It is not a mic

350
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,583
In any sense of the word

351
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,631
The preface specifically state

352
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,935
It's quote finally a report

353
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,215
Tries to be objective

354
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,263
Put another way we do not want us

355
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,031
Any state

356
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:47,103
We do not Advocate change restructuring of any kind

357
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,639
What community does

358
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,199
You should remain up to the jurisdiction

359
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,991
Leadership

360
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,295
We do feel however that

361
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
It's time

362
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,415
Perform the ways in which change occurs when

363
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,975
So what's the change

364
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,743
They're talking about

365
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
Obviously

366
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,303
Thanks

367
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,095
By the federal government

368
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,119
Take over the local

369
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,703
In reality when you read the report it's super Broad

370
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,751
It encompasses pretty much

371
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,543
Kind of altering of local

372
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
Call policy

373
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
But one thing it's

374
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,615
Particularly

375
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,407
Is how to deal with

376
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,175
Growth

377
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
Princeton

378
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,759
How did the local government

379
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,319
Windy City

380
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,087
Absorbed

381
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,367
Leon incorporate

382
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,903
Rated areas on there

383
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,927
We're going to get into

384
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,951
FEMA camps in Murder

385
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
Not really

386
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,743
The report

387
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,767
Describes

388
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,303
The problem

389
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,839
Problems common to cities

390
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,607
Neighboring

391
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,935
With some unincorporated urban areas

392
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,471
Here I haven't developed

393
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
Haven

394
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,031
Wichita

395
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
Cancel route

396
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,847
So because they are part of

397
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,407
The city they are unincorporated

398
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,711
Their places

399
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,527
Impacto Versailles

400
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,343
They don't pay back

401
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,879
The city the service

402
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,927
Afforded

403
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,951
Rug the connection

404
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,999
Right right

405
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
But it's alright for

406
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,095
The city to go to war with

407
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,631
Annexed territories

408
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,167
Israel

409
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,263
Another question I ask is like generally speaking

410
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,335
And so what happens when

411
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
Negroes

412
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,175
Beyond the confines of the county

413
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,199
How does that

414
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,247
National structure of

415
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,039
Cooperation

416
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,855
It's important to note that this report

417
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,623
Did not advocate

418
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,927
Keep Change Change

419
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,231
Even a actual

420
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
Is happy

421
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,095
Stick to the idea that change

422
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
Is even happening

423
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,703
Tactic of

424
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
Scholarly

425
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,543
They started by sending a quest

426
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,567
American local government

427
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
Beneficial

428
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,359
Had this to say about

429
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,687
Significant

430
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,223
Which responded

431
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
The questionnaire

432
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,015
8%

433
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,831
Restructured reorganized or modernize their manager

434
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,367
Instructors in Submariner in the

435
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,695
The motivating factor most frequently mentioned by in

436
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,719
Instigators of change

437
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,511
Level with cost of

438
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,303
And I believe that a better man

439
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,607
Would save money and deliver better quality

440
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,727
They are already changing

441
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,519
There's a lot of things that already happened

442
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,543
Without any

443
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
Intervention

444
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:29,663
The federal government or even the state government

445
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,223
Cause and effect

446
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
Right

447
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
Reacts to

448
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,319
Ultimately the report

449
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,623
What happened except outside

450
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,647
Climate for

451
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,439
Which could include

452
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,463
The collapse of government

453
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
Pacific Pride

454
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,279
Catastrophe

455
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,303
Natural disaster

456
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,607
Corruption in local leaders

457
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,167
Or financial troubles that are overburdening

458
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,215
The count

459
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
To your whatever

460
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,287
Probably called every one of those

461
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,967
F****** called that doesn't cause drain

462
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,247
This is

463
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,039
Uses of misinformation

464
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
Conclusion

465
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
What you does

466
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,159
Actually

467
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,439
Similar to what Alex

468
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,743
She claims that the report is

469
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,511
Is advocating

470
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
Creating

471
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,559
Climate of

472
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,839
In order to push

473
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,607
Evil Legend

474
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:23,167
Gestation but that's just her paranoid reading

475
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,007
Case study

476
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,103
Positive

477
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,919
Probably could have been helpful that didn't work out

478
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,711
Workout

479
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,503
I've been similarly there's like 12

480
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,575
End up

481
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,671
At this one felt threatened

482
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,439
Found

483
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,463
There are circumstances

484
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,999
They described

485
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,535
A climate for change

486
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,071
They're usually require

487
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,007
They're saying

488
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,031
Baywatch

489
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,247
Trying to push

490
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
Through this

491
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
Unwanted

492
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,319
Because there's

493
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,855
Need a climate of change

494
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:18,208
To do it obviously they will precipitate

495
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:18,976
The collapse of

496
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,512
The government

497
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,560
Catastrophes like a natural disaster

498
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,584
Civic crisis

499
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,656
False flag shooter or financial troubles overburden

500
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
System

501
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,960
All of these things

502
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,752
Paranoid world

503
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,032
Supplies

504
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,824
To all of the primary sources

505
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,408
Very similar mental processes

506
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,944
Is going on

507
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
Cindy

508
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,808
Far and wide but it only got a little bit of traction

509
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,344
The paranoid right-wing world

510
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,392
And caught the attention of a local politician

511
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,720
Globalist

512
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,280
Mostly because anyone who were read the reports

513
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,072
She was citing his evidence

514
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:56,864
Was full of s***

515
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,168
But this is what makes

516
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,448
Indeed

517
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,472
Right-wing world

518
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,240
Of course

519
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:09,408
So then in 1990 she wrote The Impossible Dream

520
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,944
And I was able to find a PD

521
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,504
So I could pay $400

522
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:18,368
I had the same situation I was really interested in this book on

523
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,672
In New York

524
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:24,000
And it turns out there's only one book that's ever been written

525
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:24,768
About them

526
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,304
And in order to get a copy

527
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,584
200

528
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,352
$50

529
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,120
I couldn't find

530
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,472
I'm so interested in so fascinated by it I will never be

531
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,848
So

532
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,408
This book is just a

533
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,200
Pirate like a rambling pile of

534
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,552
Litter robot

535
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,576
The theory of evolution

536
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,368
Do animals ever lived

537
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:54,464
Has made an impact on History Warehouse Cuban have

538
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,024
Are

539
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:03,680
Did she drop a microphone whatever she wrote that has an artistic flourish it's literally a narc

540
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,216
Give me the cheese making against evolution

541
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,496
That's not good

542
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,056
Uncertain

543
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,664
Mirrored in the pages

544
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,200
From the book's introduction

545
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:15,968
Quotes

546
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,016
Here's a bit split over patriotic resist

547
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
Socialism

548
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:23,136
Communism Paragould this worldwide Revolution

549
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:31,072
More real that apparent is the true goal evidence in every react revolutionary movement

550
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,096
Promoted

551
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,144
Actualizing every conquered land

552
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,192
It explicitly stated in early.

553
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,008
Feudalism

554
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,568
With the revolutionaries and Total Control

555
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:44,896
Of all the resources of the world including what

556
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,480
Alex talks about the globalist

557
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,504
Being office human

558
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,320
That is something

559
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:56,672
Pretty Jermaine to his worldview that I'm not actually totally honest I've heard people

560
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
Talk about Nick

561
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
Victoria way

562
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,512
Many other place yet

563
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,280
That's weird

564
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,072
There's just so much of Alex

565
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,912
Like ideas at the forces of taken over

566
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,728
The schools in the media these nefarious forces

567
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,520
Arguments that

568
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,848
The globalist forces employed the hegelian dialectic

569
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,384
No problem reaction

570
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,152
Fallujah

571
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,944
The stock market crash of 19

572
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,480
Plan to bring

573
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,272
Governmental control

574
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,296
That's in there

575
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:26,624
Define liberalism

576
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,160
And conservative

577
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:31,488
Who's actively resisting the revolution

578
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:38,656
Fingers at the Bilderberg Society

579
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,424
Federal Reserve

580
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,960
Give it to me I would have been gone

581
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:47,616
She claims that a minority of Congress voted to establish the Federal Reserve she doesn't say Surya

582
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,920
But it's

583
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:56,832
And she also says that the Federal Reserve is evil plant

584
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,392
McCarthy frames immigration ism

585
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,672
To take over the country

586
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,464
Destroyer

587
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,768
Decries globalist meddling

588
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,560
The quote Internal Affairs of roti

589
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,864
South Africa

590
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,656
Jubilee

591
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,424
She believes

592
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,984
The plan to take over the government

593
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,336
Your standard newworldorder paranoia

594
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,176
Is cribbing from the

595
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,992
Explains a lot of it

596
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,808
However

597
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,344
Anyone other than Alex

598
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,368
We argue

599
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,440
For instance you keep saying there's a war on for the

600
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,256
Of men which kind of generic

601
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,024
As well do

602
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,048
The inscription on

603
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:41,632
The Infowars family crap

604
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,680
She also uses

605
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:45,728
Particular phrasing that I often hear Alex

606
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,776
But I never really here anywhere else like

607
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,568
The term end

608
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
Maine

609
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:55,200
In the analysis

610
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,480
In the main

611
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,808
That's very specific phrasing

612
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,136
Another thing is that she discusses the oil crisis

613
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,440
Piece of evidence that it was

614
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,464
Planned conspiracy

615
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,488
Is

616
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
Wendy Williams

617
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,792
The supposed chaplain

618
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,216
I've never heard

619
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,240
Anyone except

620
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,288
And Alex take that guy serious

621
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,336
Really even most Patron

622
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,104
Conspiracy

623
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,664
Message boards I've read call him a scammer and a charlatan

624
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,944
That's a weird

625
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,712
Similarity

626
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,992
Also

627
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:31,040
Keaton argues that the rise in suicide rates

628
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,064
Among youth in the 90s

629
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,904
Is attributable to what she calls in schools

630
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:39,232
The Peace of Alex's ton of time

631
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,280
But I've never really know where he's getting it from

632
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,840
But it's literally spelled out in this weird self

633
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:44,864
Facebook

634
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,936
I'm not saying this early that he got it from there could be from another source

635
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,984
But it's something that I don't really hear

636
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,264
From other place

637
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,288
The idea that

638
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,312
Teaching kids

639
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,104
About the dangers of

640
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,872
Suicidal

641
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,640
Suicidal thinking

642
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,432
Causes them to commit suicide

643
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
That's

644
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:01,760
And even though it's an impossible book to find

645
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,528
Essentially

646
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,088
Alex's

647
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,392
Cleon skousen

648
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,696
Marvel Universe

649
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:12,768
That does seem like he would have a access to a copy of that

650
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,096
He has Reddit

651
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,192
Because there before that

652
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,984
Times of the internet

653
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,032

655
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,664
Today and

656
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,712
The the means by which a lot of

657
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,504
Patriot militia

658
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,064
Communicated their word like

659
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,600
People would order books

660
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,624
From

661
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,488

Eikenberry

663
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,536
This book being

664
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,304
Part of the

665
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,840
Assertive literature

666
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,472
System that Alex had access to this for Alex's

667
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
15

668
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:03,200
Bercerai

669
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,504
I doubt that

670
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,272
Couldn't

671
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:10,112
Removed from getting a copy

672
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,160
There's a possibility that it's

673
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:12,928
Impossible

674
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:15,232
Yes but it's not definite

675
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,536
Really freaky

676
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,328
Like a blizzard

677
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,352
Legitimately

678
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,144
Was on page 50

679
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,936
Where's the picture of

680
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,824
Every year since 19

681
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,872
57 around the Ides of March

682
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,896
The curtain goes up

683
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,200
Around around of weird Royal

684
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,760
You Americans recognize significance in the

685
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,040
The sequence of events

686
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,344
Justly realize our relationship end

687
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,464
Subliminal in nature

688
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,232
Gippy American

689
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,000
People alert

690
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,536
What happens to those

691
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,352
Like Joe McCarthy refused to compromise with

692
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,472
The rights begin with a saturation reporting by the media of a rash

693
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,776
Stream District Court terrorist activity

694
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,336
Americans recognize this

695
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,616
This campaign for what it is

696
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,384
A classic

697
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,688
Example of brainwashing

698
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,504
Holy s***. A month ago

699
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,784
After Christchurch

700
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,064
The shooting in New Zealand

701
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,624
After that Alex

702
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:21,024
About how the Ides of March the globalist plan all sorts of things

703
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,560
Eversource

704
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,376
Which

705
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,936
You're a goddamn which did you miss

706
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,800
So I think it would be a huge

707
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,592
Cute stretched

708
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,872
Took a toll

709
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:36,640
Inspiration from the

710
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,992
Local California politics

711
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,320
Document

712
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,600
Quote unquote

713
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,368
In the 70s

714
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,904
The entire global

715
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,208
Honestly book

716
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,488
Pretty boring and

717
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,328
Iris

718
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,120
Used to believe that Alex has never read it

719
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,400
And here's the thing

720
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,936
I've never heard him reference

721
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,496
Ever heard him say the name km

722
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,032
And yet here she is

723
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,056
Writing a book

724
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,360
It expresses a ton of things he would go on to preach

725
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,384
A good five years

726
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,920
Before he ever got on the air

727
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,480
I don't know what this means I don't know what to make of

728
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,624
Places that I can find the quote

729
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,696
Is referred to as being attributed to

730
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,976
To author unknown

731
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,096
And for the part about it being scrawled on a revolutionary war cell wall I think I was

732
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:35,008
Imagination

733
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:40,384
Alright

734
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,200
I think that's what it's called

735
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,344
Is Alex

736
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,904
Weirdly misattributed a quote

737
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,464
At least I had the suspicion he miss attributed a quote

738
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,024
And then I read 500 pages of nonsense

739
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,096
Book

740
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,376
We clearly have some

741
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,400
Like that

742
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,984
Ides of March part is really really really f***** up

743
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:14,176
That's almost like a fingerprint comparison

744
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,200
Forensic literature

745
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:15,968
Analysis

746
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:19,040
But it looks weird

747
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:22,112
It looks like Alex probably at this book

748
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,160
Is there a picture of her

749
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,952
Cuz it was self-published

750
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,024
Do we know we do know they don't exist

751
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,096
Cuz she was part of the actually don't know that

752
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:37,472
Could be a pseudonym I've not seen a picture of her and it's very difficult

753
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,800
Specific about her other than

754
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,360
She's left a footprint with the FBI

755
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,896
MC self-published

756
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,920
Facebook

757
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:47,968
Exist

758
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,296
Someone who is a quote-unquote watchdog

759
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,320
In the seventies

760
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,856
California politics

761
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,160
Yeah I also found a site for

762
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,952
Show called

763
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,720
Sweet Liberty

764
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,256
That promoted

765
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,816
Her book and her.

766
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:03,840
The politics

767
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:08,448
Unfortunately they also sell a bunch of books

768
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,472
Zion are real

769
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,264
So they're Pez dispensers

770
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,568
Sara Lee

771
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,616
Even though there is a lot of that in

772
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,456
It's at least a JC

773
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,296
I like learning

774
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,832
And so I don't know about

775
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,880
Or anything like that but it was like

776
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,928
I was reading a book

777
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:34,048
Never talks about like this

778
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:38,656
Picadillo

779
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,680
Points of interest

780
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,216
California

781
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,752
And stuff like that

782
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,824
Expressing through that like

783
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,616
Climate of change in the

784
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,896
The politics of change

785
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,176
Right.

786
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,736
Is definitely what Alex thinks the globalist

787
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,552
Pneumatic acid

788
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,344
Effects of it are very similar

789
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,880
With the like

790
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:05,280
There's a Polish there's a there's a new polish I would assume

791
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:09,376
Sorry about that.

792
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,912
But now let's get it

793
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:19,872
Rambles but nothing for a while and then guess what

794
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,640
Confirm

795
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,408
Terrible

796
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,200
You read a 500-page book

797
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,224
Instead of

798
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,248
Really

799
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:31,392
If the episode I don't have time

800
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,160
S500

801
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,440
But let me be clear

802
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,720
The book is only three

803
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,376
How do I

804
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:44,192
Alex

805
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,264
He has another one of his lawyers

806
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:53,664
Civil rights lawyer first

807
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:00,064
Country with some of the top people out there

808
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:06,464
Very honored to have Norm status in studio what is he also is representing me in

809
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,488
Connecticut

810
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,072
Anti-free speech

811
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,888
Sean fair today

812
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,656
That is why

813
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:19,008
The entire time

814
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,800
Why

815
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,568
Also

816
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,848
Restarting

817
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,128
The elements of my prediction

818
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:27,712
True like I suggested a while back

819
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:28,736
You might see Alex's

820
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,528
In the present day is

821
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,320
Bruce

822
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:37,184
Where he just like makes his whole show about his own legal trouble

823
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,952
She bad like

824
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,488
Let's train of nurses

825
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:40,768
Become

826
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:44,096
Multiple episodes where his lawyers just come in

827
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:44,864
I've got

828
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,656
Super weird

829
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:50,752
This nor Pettis character is a real douche

830
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,360
You got in a little bit of hot water

831
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,688
From the Connecticut Post

832
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,456
Quote

833
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:03,296
Local attorney North Patterson posted Monday photos

834
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,832
Three white hooded beer can

835
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:08,672
Around refrigerator

836
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,952
To his Facebook page

837
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,744
The caption read

838
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,280
Clock stores

839
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,352
How to explain this b******* by

840
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,424
For the sake of provocation

841
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,216
I like to drop a bomb and then watch it

842
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:21,984
Explode

843
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,752
In the comments

844
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,872
It's more it's more than Bloodsport

845
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,408
Alex is goddamn

846
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:30,944
Troll

847
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,064
You know what you know what's worse

848
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,904
I would have given that a solid

849
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,928
Plus

850
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,720
If he didn't have the brown bottle hat

851
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,816
Like if you just have the cord

852
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,656
Right

853
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:55,776
Effort to make sure that

854
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,800
You weren't in favor of

855
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,408
If you somehow make the me but negative

856
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,688
Then maybe

857
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:10,368
Brown bottle hanging is that the one that's

858
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,392
Beyonce

859
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,184
Into you should be arrested

860
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:20,096
People started

861
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:26,496
Let's face it if you're white you can't be right Alex's goddamn attorney of the white

862
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,776
Control

863
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,384
Why didn't you just say

864
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,176
Guys I'm representing

865
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,200
You know

866
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,480
Stop it

867
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:40,064
Maps

868
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:43,392
Who's known as madame

869
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,536
Alex's good buddy Charlie Sheen

870
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,824
Picture of the Gateway pundit

871
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,360
We got to see where his bread

872
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:07,712
You know that that's I think he's figured out a way to latch on

873
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,992
The right-wing grifters

874
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:12,320
And make money off them

875
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:16,160
Yeah it's like a it's like the lawyer for Elise like the lawyer The Wire

876
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,768
Avon Barksdale

877
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,304
Everybody knows what he's doing

878
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,728
He also represented the New Haven occupying camp

879
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,264
2012

880
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,312
What's a counterexample

881
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,616
To these examples

882
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,384
He's doing now

883
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,920
As much as it is

884
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:38,688
Distance of the weird

885
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,992
Trajectories a lot of people took after Aki

886
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,528
For example

887
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,296
Kessler

888
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,320
The guy who organized

889
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,344
The United right rally

890
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,880
Charlottesville

891
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,648
Occupy before

892
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,952
It wasn't broad appeal

893
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,744
That's what I'm saying

894
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,792
Motives

895
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:59,936
Got involved well I mean it is the 99% versus the 1%

896
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:02,240
Yeah there's there's no

897
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,288
Just because this is always

898
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,312
So f******

899
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,616
Fun

900
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:10,688
12

901
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,296
Quote cigarettes don't kill people

902
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,064
People do

903
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,672
We recognize the claim at once

904
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,952
The transparent nonsense

905
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,256
So we text a backhoe using the proceeds

906
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,304
Healthcare

907
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,328
For those destroying the

908
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,424
Why not use the same public policy

909
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,472
Gun violence

910
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,520
I can see the hidden agenda

911
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:38,848
Power I'd repeal the 2nd Amendment

912
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,128
It's an anachronism

913
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,200
Alex's lawyer is a goddamn gun-grabber

914
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,272
Jesus

915
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,808
In a response to

916
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,904
Clearly like I would repeal the 2nd Amendment

917
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,608
Norcos

918
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,656
Suggest a mechanism you'd like to put into play

919
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:06,240
Inherently dangerous product is placed

920
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,264
Stream of Commerce

921
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,568
All those who introduced the product can be forced to

922
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,592
Share the liability

923
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,872
For the Honda product causes

924
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,920
Why not treat guns in this manner

925
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,992
Suppose a firearm is used in a murder

926
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,344
Asasi 250000

927
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,904
A $10,000 fine

928
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,208
The cellar

929
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,744
Each registered owner

930
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:28,768
These

931
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,792
Catch the attention of

932
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:32,096
Trucking in bartering and firearms

933
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:35,168
It might also inspire a sense of Greater accountability

934
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:35,936
Responsibility

935
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,984
He concludes by saying quote

936
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,800
You'll have to pry my gun from my cold dead fingers

937
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,592
A friend of mine said not too long ago

938
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,616
Fine

939
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,896
Nice a game on

940
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,688
It's time to get serious about done

941
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:49,248
Control gun violence is a matter of life and death

942
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,296
Don't expect me to fight fair against

943
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,576
Beer

944
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,624
Against the fear your gun will kill me

945
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:04,608
We're listening to old 2012 2013 episodes in our Sandy Hook

946
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,376
Investigation

947
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:07,680
1 things that we found that Alex's

948
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,960
Completely obsessed

949
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,240
With the impending gun

950
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,800
To the point where he's on the border of incitement

951
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,640
I take it there's a Civil War coming

952
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,224
For taking gun

953
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,528
I find it completely hilarious

954
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,808
That is new lawyer in

955
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:27,904
Sandy Hook defamation trial is literally one of the people he was saying was

956
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,928
To destroy the country

957
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,720
A pic office oval

958
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:33,024
Alex doesn't say anything

959
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,560
Billable hours

960
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:39,680
You tell you my personal beliefs at all

961
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,824
So long as you hit me monthly man I'll say whatever you want me to say

962
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,360
I mean

963
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,504
I just don't understand how you can end up with someone as your lawyer

964
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,552
Is someone who advocates

965
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,856
For something that you are publicly saying

966
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,160
Going to overthrow the country

967
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,184
The freedoms

968
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:07,840
I would get rid of the Second Amendment

969
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,376
Seems to be the only thing

970
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,680
He actually cares about

971
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,056
Interesting question

972
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:17,824
As far as

973
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,128
ACLU is

974
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,176
Absolute

975
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,200
Other races

976
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,672
Good lawyer

977
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:37,280
You know Alex is going to let him take his

978
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:41,888
Cuz he can't be that good of a lawyer that there's not someone else who's as good

979
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,448
Alex

980
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,568
Consider that a variable everyone is clamoring to work

981
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:53,407
The issue is if this guy is someone who advocates

982
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,687
To the repeal of the second

983
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,479
Alex doesn't want him

984
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,759
To be associated with his big

985
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:01,343
First Amendment

986
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:06,207
To get rid of the Second Amendment

987
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,303
Henrico Court

988
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,327
Liquor store

989
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:19,775
Little boy has First Amendment precedent-setting case but he's involved

990
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:23,359
You don't want this guy wants to get rid of the Second Amendment

991
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:25,151
I get a win in the Supreme Court

992
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:29,247
That only makes us much closer

993
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,783
Hookah

994
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:33,087
Alex is stupid

995
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,111
The lawyer if

996
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:34,879
Is taking

997
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,903
The case on let-go

998
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,671
Free speech apps

999
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,767
Whatever

1000
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,399
Or whatever

1001
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:49,471
Impatient

1002
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:55,359
Although stop with the racist

1003
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:58,943
I'm actually going to move that back

1004
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:05,087
250000 dollar $10,000 $5,000 that's like the flat tax

1005
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,111
That's a terrible

1006
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,927
I think it was just sort of a broad idea

1007
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:13,023
I'm just come back when you get a second

1008
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,559
Soffit Fascia

1009
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:17,887
Norm pattis

1010
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,447
Is also a lawyer who represented

1011
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,471
Candace Owen

1012
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,519
But not when she was Candace Owens

1013
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,567
When she was Owen

1014
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:27,359
No

1015
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,639
When she was

1016
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,919
High School

1017
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,967
And she was the victim of

1018
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:32,991
Some racist

1019
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:33,759
Harassment

1020
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,039
Sexual harass

1021
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:39,135
And so she

1022
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,927
She said the people who were

1023
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,951
In her butt

1024
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:42,975
She reported this

1025
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,791
School

1026
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:46,559
Take care of it

1027
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:50,143
Her parents sued the school district

1028
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,215
Take care of it and respond appropriately

1029
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,495
Ended up winning

1030
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,799
$37,000 in a settlement

1031
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,103
Was her lawyer

1032
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,127
I don't want it

1033
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,455
Because I don't know all the

1034
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,223
Details of his

1035
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,503
I did find

1036
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,039
An article about it so I can

1037
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,831
Save it it's a real thing

1038
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:09,855
It certainly

1039
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,647
And I believe her I believe Candice

1040
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:16,511
That stuff doesn't mean that I don't believe

1041
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,279
A the chi

1042
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,303
As a youth

1043
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,583
Was the victim of

1044
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,351
This sort of

1045
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,399
Horrible harassment and abuse

1046
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,679
Yeah I believe that

1047
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:27,519
Even though she is presenting ideas right now.

1048
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:32,383
Perpetuate that very same horrible abuse that does not mean that she does not deserve to be protect

1049
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,991
Does

1050
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,527
Say things like

1051
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,575
Real hate crimes don't exist

1052
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:46,975
Yeah or hate crimes are all hoaxes and that's okay

1053
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:50,559
And so with the know this about her before

1054
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:54,399
History

1055
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,959
Oh yeah sort of ideas out

1056
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:00,287
People

1057
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,335
Put those ideas

1058
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,895
Used to come on Infowars

1059
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,943
Regularly

1060
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,575
You know

1061
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,343
That this

1062
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,111
Stop happens

1063
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:16,927
You know you were

1064
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:20,767
You know that other people also are and they aren't making it up

1065
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:23,071
Yet you are helping a system

1066
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:25,887
Established

1067
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,679
And normalize

1068
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:31,263
Get up

1069
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,799
People to hear your story

1070
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,335
They would say you were mine

1071
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,639
And that sucks

1072
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:40,735
I'm not entirely sure I don't want to litigate any of it it's not important other than to say

1073
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,527
Fit learning that she has

1074
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,295
History makes

1075
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,319
Her look worse

1076
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,695
I believe her and I

1077
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,975
High schooler having to deal with

1078
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:55,583
I also my heart goes out to her after hearing Alex talked about her

1079
00:45:56,863 --> 00:46:00,703
Rabbit ears Westchester Harbour I got busy we never got it done

1080
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:03,263

Super sexy super smart

1082
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:07,871
That's right integrity

1083
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,199
What's number one on the house

1084
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:11,967
Weird

1085
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,247
It's always the first

1086
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,527
Comes up whenever he's talking

1087
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,063
These women that like

1088
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,599
Like her are part of his side

1089
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,623
Is always

1090
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,391
The first thing

1091
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:28,095
Every reason every anchors

1092
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:28,863
Is blonded

1093
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:37,055
Long time

1094
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,335
Those comments at you

1095
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:45,503
Hitler just wanted to make Germany great wonderful National aspirations

1096
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,575
I don't give a f*** about saying that

1097
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,623
Rationalizing

1098
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,647
Hitler I just picked

1099
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:56,511
I just sense of nationalism and

1100
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,095
I still think it's just

1101
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,631
Stupid

1102
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,399
So take

1103
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,703
Evil out of it and it's

1104
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:05,727
Conspiracy

1105
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,007
Alright

1106
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,359
What's going on

1107
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,383
MCs

1108
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:14,175
Grifting the very people

1109
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,223
Who hurt her as

1110
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,551
Easiest to grow

1111
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:24,159
She's a black woman know that

1112
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:30,559
Omarosa is gone

1113
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:36,959
Reveal in 2 years when she's the president that you was f****** with the white nationalist

1114
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:40,287
The most Progressive president

1115
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,103
I get done with all that

1116
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,895
Alex is talking to his lawyer

1117
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,175
Some more of this patent

1118
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
Paris

1119
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:51,551
And out they start talking about the Eisenhower's farewell.

1120
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:54,879
Might be

1121
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,415
Some

1122
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,951
Revisionist history

1123
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:04,607
Recall Eisenhower's famous famous warning about the military everybody quotes

1124
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:12,031
Everybody always see only person controlling

1125
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:19,455
The military-industrial complex

1126
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:29,695
No point Eisenhower's final speech

1127
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,231
Does he mention a breakaway Society

1128
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,119
Does use the words a quote scientific

1129
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,143
Technological

1130
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,703
Using it is very

1131
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,263
I've never discussing the balance

1132
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,311
3 main

1133
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,079
To be involved

1134
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,127
Technology

1135
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,687
Trolls it

1136
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,991
If the government is not involved at all it runs

1137
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,271
The risk of becoming

1138
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,039
Captive

1139
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:55,807
To the scientific

1140
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:58,367
Who would have full control over

1141
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,647
Early modern

1142
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,415
Which government

1143
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,183
Was dependent

1144
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,231
Similarly the government

1145
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:06,559
Involved because

1146
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,327
Intellectual

1147
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,607
Curiosity with

1148
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,375
Money

1149
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:12,447
Which would lead to a likely dead

1150
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,471
Innovation

1151
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,239
Contact

1152
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,007
Is very clear

1153
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,055
There's not a problem with Alex

1154
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,687
Eisenhower's literally advocating

1155
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,711
Speech for the things

1156
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,479
Alex

1157
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,759
The globalist

1158
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,807
For instance he talks about how the world is

1159
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,087
Smaller

1160
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,879
To become a confederation

1161
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,415
Mutual trust and respect

1162
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,951
Global government

1163
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:36,255
Pretty much where the countries of the world RC

1164
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,279
Seen as equal

1165
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,839
Eisenhower literally also says quote

1166
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,143
Disarmament with a mutual honorary comp

1167
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:43,935
Did you bring imperative

1168
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:46,239
He was trying to disarm the world

1169
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:49,823
Do something that Alex is worried that the UN is trying to do

1170
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,615
Through their non-binding

1171
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:53,919
Rewriting

1172
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,223
So much

1173
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,503
Defense

1174
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:03,135
You know likes industrial complex

1175
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,671
That's great

1176
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,719
Running it

1177
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:11,327
Yeah we were running it we would run its own well not even

1178
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,679
Stupid Alex Azar

1179
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,447
Because he always does

1180
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:22,079
It's the same behavior that

1181
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,639
He's assuming so much of what

1182
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:26,943
Of Eisenhower

1183
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:30,015
And then citing it as gospel and that's inappropriate

1184
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,575
It is always fascinating to go back

1185
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,367
Look at

1186
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:37,439
Things that presidents have said that they

1187
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,743
What you know we weren't able to

1188
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:40,767
During the

1189
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,375
And the way that Facebook

1190
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,655
Open Google and all that stuff

1191
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:47,679
Run ever

1192
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:52,543
Is there also

1193
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,591
Stifling innovation

1194
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:55,359
Themselves

1195
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,687
No he didn't really do

1196
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:00,991
Much

1197
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:01,759
About

1198
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,527
Any of that

1199
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:06,623
If you know Carter's

1200
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:11,487
Carteret

1201
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,767
In terms of what should have happened

1202
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,351
The government

1203
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,399
They were able to actually accomplished

1204
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:19,679
Because of all the info

1205
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,239
Like the

1206
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,007
Industrial

1207
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:23,775
Sure

1208
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,711
Hispanic

1209
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,991
New radio host

1210
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,527
In House shows

1211
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:35,295
It's going to be launching

1212
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,927
Real there's no chance

1213
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:44,255
I mean baby

1214
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,279
Harrison Smith

1215
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,071
House show

1216
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:47,839
Whatever

1217
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,375
That's going to be

1218
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:52,703
Bonanza

1219
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,519
Be f****** Rappaport

1220
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:56,543
You know like

1221
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,311
That be fun

1222
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:01,151
Larry Hagman

1223
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:04,479
Right

1224
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,527
Bland

1225
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:12,671
People who are doing the fourth hour are now going to do a show

1226
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:15,743
Both Stone and corsi's salaries off-the-books

1227
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,047
He can hire some Flo Rida

1228
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,351
You know that

1229
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:26,751
For quite a while after he got let go

1230
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,615
Contractor whatever

1231
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,639
I believe that is

1232
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:44,927
He's not working here anymore and now I'm free

1233
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,863
I didn't know that Buckley doesn't work there anymore I don't know

1234
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,911
I just know that he's not there anymore

1235
00:52:55,423 --> 00:53:01,567
It does explain a lot cuz I was wondering why

1236
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,359
Inspirational videos

1237
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:07,455
About how you like whatever you put your mind to

1238
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:10,527
Yeah might be posting these videos and I like

1239
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:11,551
I don't know

1240
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:17,951
Water Tower in Chicago

1241
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,911
I'm not sure of cases but

1242
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,519
Next clip where Alex

1243
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,823
It's a little bit about that

1244
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,383
Paul Joseph Watson

1245
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:37,663
Mother talking

1246
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,735
I don't think this is very interesting

1247
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,015
Quite frankly

1248
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:45,343
How much more of a

1249
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,391
From Alex

1250
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,671
In terms of Assange

1251
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:51,999
Because it seems like something he cares a lot about released

1252
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,791
It's just kind of like listen to this

1253
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:54,815
This is very underwhelming

1254
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:00,447
I don't know who's got it with you likes the Russians relation

1255
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:09,407
The corruption

1256
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:14,527
Order the song to do it at signs get it

1257
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:17,599
Mush

1258
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:20,415
False

1259
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:24,255
If he doesn't let us get out of prison

1260
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,303
Sao Paulo

1261
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:29,887
Not all that important

1262
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:35,775
Because it is essentially like

1263
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:36,799
Trump

1264
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,335
His administration

1265
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:40,127
Is looking to extradite

1266
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:41,919
The United States

1267
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,967
Means that there wasn't any coordination

1268
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:48,575
Between

1269
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,879
Emily quilt maybe it's a nonsense

1270
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:53,951
The truth

1271
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:57,023
These situations really is

1272
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,559
Is Trump is a narcissistic

1273
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:05,215
Aspiring Authority

1274
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:11,615
Metal history

1275
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:17,503
Right so

1276
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:22,111
What's going on

1277
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,927
Alex Azar

1278
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,207
Just pathetic

1279
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:28,255
Because

1280
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:30,559
Trump told him to release those things

1281
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,887
Now he's being persecuted

1282
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:38,751
I'll still like Trump but I'll do it with a little bit of Shame if he doesn't let it go

1283
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:43,103
Where is the line man the line

1284
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:43,871
There is a

1285
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:47,199
Alex

1286
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:49,247
To get to Paul Joseph Watson pumped up

1287
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:51,551
Fitworks

1288
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:54,111
What would you quantify this cuz

1289
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:57,183
Lamborghini

1290
00:55:57,439 --> 00:56:02,559
True train we have the info

1291
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,647
You feel like watching

1292
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,719
Yeah we won some battles and

1293
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:36,351
But we basically won the argument that's the time that we're driving

1294
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,375
That's not why

1295
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:41,983
Like his response was almost like

1296
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,775
Yeah goes alright a scarf

1297
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:47,359
You're angry

1298
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,551
I think it's the azzam

1299
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:56,831
Trying to get this

1300
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:58,879
Other person to recognize and

1301
00:56:59,391 --> 00:56:59,903
Fetal

1302
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:03,999
You feel about what you've done

1303
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:07,583
Like it's two people at the end of a run

1304
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:15,007
We went through a lot out there did we left it all on the field

1305
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,287
Him like

1306
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,103
Having done that tour podcast

1307
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,639
Ambien like

1308
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:24,479
I got my message that I could possibly

1309
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:28,319
It's usually about

1310
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,343
Is

1311
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:34,207
Look at how great I am but even when you say I want to salute you

1312
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,743
To feel the way that Alex is a

1313
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,535
Express

1314
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:38,303

You're listening to The Alex Jones Show

Hope he doesn't come in and we just listen to this song.

1323
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:25,151
I only kept that in I don't give a f*** about what Nick begich has to say

1324
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:30,015
That's very weird

1325
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:34,367
Infowars

1326
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,951

00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:52,287
I just stood up I was so excited

1331
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,823
Within a couple days

1332
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,615
He was on both projects

1333
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,151
Hosting the fourth hour of Alex

1334
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,431

00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,455
Introduce this

1336
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:01,759
Exhibit

1337
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:04,831
In terms of these worlds are not different

1338
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,135

00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:17,631
I do want to send you on your vacation in style

1343
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,167

1344

Oreo

1345
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:39,647
I went back to the well

1346
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:46,047
You're going away for awhile it's only right you know you go out on a real high note

00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:01,407
YouTube channel

1350
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:06,527
Green Pastures

1351
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:07,295
Just because

1352
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:10,111
Entire episode

1353
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:11,391
There isn't still

1354
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:14,719
Amazing

1355
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,815
From Lionel

1356
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:23,423
Some of this

1357
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:29,823
Please remember that Lionel is now a qanon promoter

1358
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:30,591
Invited to

1359
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:33,407
Goddamn White House

1360
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:36,479
Goddamn

1361
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:39,551
So I think we should have

1362
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:40,575
Automated

1363
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:42,623
Take you like a website

1364
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:43,391
Degenerates

1365
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,439
Madlib

1366
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:47,487
For Lionel it it would be the exact same thing

1367
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:53,631
Actual ones are weirder

1368
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,655
I think

1369
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:55,935
Be blown away

1370
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:11,551
Looking for an honest man

1371
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:14,367
I'm looking for someone who actually like mine

1372
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:29,215
Desecrating Old Glory is begging for money

1373
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:35,871
So real quick he has a picture up of like someone who's panhandling but it's like doing them

1374
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:42,271
Doing mine is stuff with her with a hat outfit

1375
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,551
Feel about living statues

1376
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:55,327
Similar vein I can't stand mascot uniform suit

1377
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:58,911
Navigate to Pennock

1378
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:04,287
Don't waste my time showing me the apps that I know you practice and I know you'll do

1379
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:07,359
Tell me ahead of time how you're going to find the card or whatever

1380
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:10,431
Mystikal

1381
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,199
Stop Magic

1382
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:15,295
And a real magic

1383
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:21,695
I feel so similar about

1384
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:28,095
Watching some videos of my life Magic

1385
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:28,863
Real

1386
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:32,447
I think he is very infuriated

1387
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:36,031
We're working very hard on their craft as opposed to

1388
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:41,151
Making a deal with some sort of deity you to gain power

1389
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,943
You are entertaining

1390
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:47,295
Great Is Awesome

1391
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:50,623
Every time someone has to be on the street

1392
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:56,255
It brightens

1393
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:57,535
It's the best

1394
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:03,167
Can I have a dollar

1395
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:07,263
There's a video of the guy who won the world close-up Magic

1396
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,311
Championship switch

1397
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,847
Great to know that that exist

1398
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:14,943
What was

1399
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,735
Incredible

1400
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,783
I don't need magic to be real

1401
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,551
To know that

1402
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:20,831
What that guy did

1403
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:21,599
Is Magic

1404
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:25,439
You know what I'm saying practice and dedication you have to put in

1405
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:30,047
I mean whatever amount of time Lionel this b*******

1406
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,327
Isabella toriel

1407
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:35,935
What is nothing compared to what you have to do to be able to make a card disappear

1408
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:41,823
Who have a craft

1409
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:49,503
I hate mine

1410
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:54,879
I think I think a reason the Trump invited

1411
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:58,719
PIX11 which is

1412
01:03:58,975 --> 01:03:59,487
Is it New York

1413
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:07,423
Like watch like before

1414
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,191
Qanon

1415
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:11,519
I'm not entirely sure but yeah

1416
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:13,567
How dare you be mad

1417
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:16,639
H-E-B least everyone's problems

1418
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:26,623
Moscow what happened

1419
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,439
Minol

1420
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:31,231
Time like Vaudeville

1421
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:33,023
Harrah entertainment

1422
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:33,791
You got a lot of

1423
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:38,655
And then in the Next Generation after that

1424
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:41,215
Do you like there was a lot of jokes

1425
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:41,983
It's about mine

1426
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:44,543
World world

1427
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,079
Sure I made this was probably

1428
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:48,895
89 years ago

1429
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:53,503
It still was irrelevant

1430
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,551
Making fun of my

1431
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:57,343
Do you like

1432
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,159
Brick

1433
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:22,687
Will Ferrell

1434
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:23,711
Great

1435
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:26,527
Ron Burgundy

1436
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:28,063
What is playing

1437
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:32,415
The significance of a Ted Baxter character cannot be overstated

1438
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:37,791
1970s

1439
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:40,607
Partly that of Television Broadcast News

1440
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:43,935
Cronkite sign off until March 6th

1441
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:47,519
1981 11 years later

1442
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,663
Charles Collingwood

1443
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,431
Robert

1927 Yankees

1447
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:05,439
These guys were venerable and venerated wise

1448
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,207
Distinguished

1449
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,487
Respect

1450
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,767
Brighton

1451
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:12,351
Myself

1452
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,119
Exploded

1453
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:16,959
No these

1454
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,495
Custom print

1455
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:21,823
Out of the blood and fog of war and no no comparison today

1456
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:23,871
Andrew Ted Baxter

1457
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:28,223
At the height of our love and respect affair with these broadcast dude

1458
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:31,807
The news anchor.

1459
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:36,159
News version of the potemkin village and its idiot

1460
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,439
Like

1461
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:38,463
I mean

1462
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:41,279
There was a great character

1463
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:43,071
In the Mary Tyler Moore Show

1464
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:45,631
Parody

1465
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,167
So is

1466
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:50,239
Why are you mad

1467
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:58,175
I guess I'll be making fun of mimes

1468
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:02,783
Hearkening to like this new version of news parody and is good as my

1469
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,575
Virginity

1470
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:07,391
I wish things were the 70s again

1471
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:10,463
Why aren't all of his broadcast just

1472
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,399
Lovecraft

1473
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,423
Story

1474
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:24,543
Character Randolph Carter

1475
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:25,823

EDreams

1477
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:28,639
City of the Gods

1478
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:29,919
But it's forbidden

1479
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:30,943
Humans to go to

1480
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,271
So he tries

1481
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:35,295
Adventures

1482
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,087
Do cats fight

1483
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:41,695
The city of Cudahy

1484
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,839
It's really hard at building a city

1485
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:49,119
And they didn't want people in

1486
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:51,423
There was a city of the Gods

1487
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:53,471
Right now

1488
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:56,543
So much better than

1489
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:59,103
Of the Gods

1490
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,895
Adapt and went to his City

1491
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,039
It was Providence

1492
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,599
His memories of

1493
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:11,135
You're so beautiful

1494
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,975
To this dream

1495
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:19,583
Exactly

1496

Mega Lottery

1497
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,287
Complaints he has our base

1498
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:29,567
Because of

1499
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:30,335
Him

1500
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:31,615
Idealizing

1501
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:32,383
His child

1502
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:33,919
Wyandotte

1503
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,783
I will see you then

1504
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:41,087
You might as well just not far off

1505
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:42,367
But he also Tristan

1506
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:43,135
Some other interest

1507
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:44,671
Areas

1508
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:50,815
Mimes and magicians and mascots

1509
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:55,423
Butterflies

1510
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,727
The three arms of evil out

1511
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,031
Gone

And the granddaddy of conversate

1517
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,223
This guy

1518
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:41,247
Manolo Blahnik

1519
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:44,575
No monster Jimmy Choo

1520
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:50,975
Man was made famous for miserable self-indulgent narcissist

1521
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:57,375
Ford Angel constantly complaining griping Crainer Cosmos

1522
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:59,679
About why no one gets it

1523
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:03,263
No one loves

1524
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:15,039
Dubai these torture devices

1525
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:22,463
Confusing challenge

1526
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:29,631
Disfigured and gnarled claws

1527
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:31,935
So now you showing pictures of like mangle

1528
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:36,031
The screen Wichita

Hammer told faith that can double for a hoof

1530
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:47,807
Cracked

1531
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:49,343
I'm sure Lionel here

1532
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:51,391
Just come on over.

1533
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,167
The world

1534
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,447
In some cases

1535
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:07,263
Clydesdale quality Toby offenders

1536
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:09,567

1537

Varnish

1538
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:15,711

01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:54,751
Fire

1610
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:56,543
Another joke

1611
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:03,199
And the dead daisies

1612
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:05,503

I love that one

1619
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:31,871
Must be a local New York commercial and I guess that as a joke is just sort of

1620
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:35,711
Like it's based on recognition

1621
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:38,015
So I mean I guess that misses the mark for us in

1622
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:43,391
Chicago local work

1623
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,671
Also I didn't even

1624
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:46,207
Composite cuz I didn't realize that

1625
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,303
That's unreal

1626
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:53,119
Where is the joke

1627
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,167
I'm confused

1628
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,447
What is what is

1629
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,215
Trying to

1630
01:16:57,471 --> 01:17:03,615
That was still a continuation of the

01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:04,895
The bedbugs bit

1632
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:05,919
But yes

1633
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:11,551

1634
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:12,319
Elvis

1635
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:16,927
Whatever happened to all of these horrible things

1636
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:23,327
We all know about them now so they don't I guess maybe they got sensationalized a little

1637
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,095
Who killed Opie

1638
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:25,375

Jersey

1644
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:53,791
I said Manning on the back

1645
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,071
Are you

1646
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:57,375
Are you Eli Manning

1647
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:01,983
Who are you wearing a jersey that says you are

1648
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:04,799
Yeah that's your fault

1649
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:14,015
I've heard variations of that it opened

1650
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:16,319

1651
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:22,463

01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:23,231
Well

1653
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:27,071
I would I know why you're doing it but I would

1654
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:29,119
I would caution you to resist the urge

1655
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,911
To boo him

1656
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:35,263
Cuz we might miss some of this

1657
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:41,663
Securing the Crickets in the route you know I don't

1658
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:43,711
I think they were like

1659
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:46,783
How big is the second clip with something he said there was

1660
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:51,647
I meant move. That was my favorite thing that's ever happened

1661
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:52,415
Get to this isn't

1662
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:53,183
Eclipse or anything

1663
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:57,791
Analyze

1664
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:01,119
Still waiting for someone to be charged with a crime

1665
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:04,447
I don't want nobody to speak Spanish

1666
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:06,751
I thought you when you have a translation underneath

1667
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:08,031
In Spanish

1668
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:11,615
Did you know that Kenny G and mr. G were related

1669
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:14,943
I don't know who Mr Gs is a local New York celebrity

1670
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:22,623
Those jokes crime one is like

1671
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:24,671
Alright I guess

1672
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:26,975
For something like if you're you know you just need to

1673
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:32,095
The pad.

1674
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:34,655
Throwing that in somewhere as like a

1675
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:39,519
I need to I need to Pivot or whatever to come from

1676
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,287
Because he also has a

1677
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:45,919
Retarded videos that he's put out these Channel

1678
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:52,319
Or hate crime is like a distinction that doesn't deserve to be involved

1679
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:58,719
I don't want to say that he ignores the idea that people of

1680
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:01,535
Target

1681
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:04,351
Proper position of like I am a lawyer

1682
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:09,983
Videos

1683
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,775
You shouldn't be charging

1684
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:13,824
Charging them

1685
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:14,848
With a crime

1686
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:16,640
And then him

1687
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:17,664
Open Mic settings

1688
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,432
He's doing real

1689
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:25,856
Absolutely

1690
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,648
That's f***** up

1691
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:32,512
Many of these sound like premise that friend of the show Mike Wiley would throw away

1692
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:34,560
I would even

1693
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:37,120
Put it on one of those notecards nursefinder

1694
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:40,448
Beautiful

1695
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:49,664
Did Carly ever find out who was so vain

1696
01:20:58,112 --> 01:21:01,952
Bruce Springsteen ever find out who was Dancing in the Dark

1697
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:05,792
Did

1698
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:09,120
The Clapton ever figure out who shot this year

1699
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:11,168
Whose tears worth it

1700
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:16,032
No they weren't

1701
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:18,080
Okay

1702
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:32,160
Do you need a page-one rewrite up app

1703
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:35,232
Uncle Joey

1704
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,048
An interesting

1705
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,608
April, could pull off.

1706
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:42,400
Like you would have to be someone who's like

1707
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,424
Deeply absurd

1708
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,960
Ridiculously deadpan

1709
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:47,264
Yes

1710
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,056
But I could work

1711
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,080
In a certain

1712
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:51,872
Because

1713
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:54,688
Your character would almost have to also be like

1714
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:56,224
Kind of stupid

1715
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:09,280
The joke is about you it's not about what

1716
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:10,304
Is f****** stupid

1717
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:17,216
But even I'd like that still put that one in the middle

1718
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:32,064
Tell me exactly what I'm supposed to do to keep a video diary

1719
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:34,880
Whatever I'm supposed to do when I use Activia

1720
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:37,952
That's all I'm going to say

1721
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:43,072
Whatever happened to Esteban

1722
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:46,144
That was

1723
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,704
Blockbuster

1724
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:55,104
I think he's referring to bowel movement

1725
01:22:55,360 --> 01:23:01,504
Was Jamie Lee Curtis doing the whole you'll s*** right

1726
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:13,280
But not because

1727
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:17,376
I think it's funny but just because like I had Dyke

1728
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:18,656
I heated

1729
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:19,424
You're broken.

1730
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:25,824
Little funny

1731
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:30,688
Just like I can't fight it anymore

1732
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:35,296
You know like if you had an open mic.

1733
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:40,416
2:00

1734
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:45,792
It also cuz you flashes on screen two pics arrested like he did look silly

1735
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:48,096
I used to run an open mic

1736
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:51,424
And my favorite comedian

1737
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:53,728
Never got a laugh from the crowd

1738
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,008
I could not

1739
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:59,104
Stop live

1740
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,896
Terrible terrible jokes

1741
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:04,992
And the crowd would do nothing and then turn and look back at me laughing like

1742
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,016
Who the f*** are you

1743
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:07,040
What are you doing

1744
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:10,368
Like that's a hundred percent difference

1745
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:15,488
I actually enjoy it on that same level right now where is Esteban.

1746
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:18,048
Alone

1747
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:20,352
Kind of

1748
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:24,192
Kind of funny as an observation

1749
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,216
I'm not

1750
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:30,592
You're talking about someone who's very good but isn't

1751
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:32,384
Connecting with an audio

1752
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,152
Complete up

1753
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:34,688
Nevermind

1754
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:39,552
If it wasn't lying

1755
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,856
Now let's get back

1756
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:45,696
How do they show traffic report on TV

1757
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:48,512
By the time you get home and it's all change

1758
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,560
Is it drive you crazy

1759
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:52,608
911 call

1760
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:56,192
Are the person calling a screaming frantic at the cops hair

1761
01:24:56,448 --> 01:25:01,824
Esoteric

1762
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:05,664
Sword

1763
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:07,456
Are you wearing shoes

1764
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:12,320
I think if you had a better performance

1765
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:18,720
Could work

1766
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:23,584
Comic

1767
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,680
Workout 1000 tops

1768
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:31,264
I think that 911 calls

1769
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:32,800
Myconnect

1770
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:37,152
It sounds familiar

1771
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:43,552
The kernel of what you can work with you need a better act out you need a better question than are you wearing

1772
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:44,320
Specifically

1773
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:47,136
Be better

1774
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,440
Something there

1775
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:55,840
Words start with that one

1776
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:58,400
Work with that one

1777
01:25:58,656 --> 01:26:01,216
I'll give him I'll give you to pull that off

1778
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:04,544
Now that's true

1779
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:06,592
Open mic

1780
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:10,432
Woodbine

1781
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,736
When did you last eat

1782
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:24,000
I need the I need to go back cuz when did you last eat was still a continuation of the 911 show that was a joke

1783
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:30,400
Because if that was just a complete non-sequitur is still just a part of the 9/11

1784
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:32,960
Done that joke

1785
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:34,240
Snarled

1786
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:37,568
Couldn't

1787
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:39,360
2

1788
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,664
I mean it has to work off this

1789
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:46,272
And then you ask

1790
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:47,552
Well

1791
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:48,320
Is he wearing a

1792
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:50,368
Kimono or something something along those

1793
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:56,000
The more I think about it the more I actually don't take it

1794
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:56,768
Can work

1795
01:26:57,024 --> 01:27:00,608
Because if you do that like what are you doing

1796
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:01,632
The swordplay

1797
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:03,680
Wordplay

1798
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,960
Is he wearing a cleansing mask

1799
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:09,056
There's no punch there around

1800
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:10,336
Like what's your sign

1801
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:15,968
Hitting on you

1802
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:16,736
Express temp service

1803
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:17,760
Concern I guess I'm

1804
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:19,040
911 operator

1805
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,320
But like

1806
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:22,880

1807
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:29,536

Yes that does that

1809
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:35,936
The number of other directions.

1810
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:41,312
Weird joke.

1811
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:43,616
Cashews

1812
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:46,176
When did you last eat

1813
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:53,344
Was Marie Langston really the unknown comic

1814
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:02,048
I didn't realize I thought it was another

1815
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,376
Yeah but I guess I would say that

1816
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:08,704
Atomic or whatever

1817
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:15,104
You keep that is the third one

1818
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:20,224
The first two are bad

1819
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:28,160
You keep the unknown, cuz the third one making a normal make it a normal

1820
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:35,328
Really specific

1821
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:40,448
Is no good the first question

1822
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:44,288
Close to it a 911

1823
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:45,568
Are your windows

1824
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:50,432
Or something like that

1825
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:51,712
Sure

1826
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:53,504
Something like that

1827
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,296
We spent way too much time on this year

1828
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:57,856
100 *

1829
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:00,672
This is horrible

1830
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:05,280
One day

1831
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:08,608
I want to see a computer screen that looks like the ones they always showing the movie

1832
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:09,632

01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:21,408
What is a change of perception

1836
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:23,968
57

1837
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:35,232
I just left because I'm tired of deconstructing taking his jokes

1838
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:36,768
Across-the-board

1839
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:44,704

Be the funniest guy in the world

1852
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:21,568
It's possible

1853
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:24,128
So it's ironic

1854
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,152

01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:26,688

01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:20,064
Boring

1923
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:26,464
Categorically not boring

1924
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:31,584
A criminal profiler

1925
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:33,120
Alan Greenspan

1926
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:34,656

That is not boring

1930
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:43,360
Fascinating

1931
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:48,480
Irrelevant characters

1932
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:50,528

01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:00,000
Man

1937
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:02,560
It's just to have a conversation with you

1938
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:04,864
Yourself

1939
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,192
Not boring

1940
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:11,008

Like someone like

I'm not being entertaining to you is not his job

1948
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:29,440
The Kardashians whether you want to call them and all that stuff

1949
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:30,976
There's might be some coded

1950
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:34,816
Possibly

1951
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:36,352

I don't know I don't

1954
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:42,240
Probably

1955
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:46,848
Don't like I said I think we circled

1956
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:49,920
Live mostly

1957
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:52,480
Super into that

1958
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:59,136
But I don't know the parody of Carrot Top more than I actually know Carrot Tops cereal

I don't know how I feel about it

1966
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:30,880
Generous synonym

1967
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:32,672
And in front of the actual crowd

1968
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,232
Whatever you want

1969
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:37,280
Take that away from him

1970
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:38,048
He's boring

1971
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:39,584
I might be bored

1972
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,632
Performances

1973
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:50,592
Miss attributing a quote making me read hundreds of pages of a book

1974
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:56,992
I'm not a good barometer I wouldn't get on PIX11 yell at people for being bored

1975
01:37:57,248 --> 01:38:00,832
I know that my radar is off it's yours Idol

So is yours everybody's hero and they're on

1977

Lukewarm

1981
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:21,312
So far

1982
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:35,136
Turn this off right now

1983
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:35,904
Go to another

1984
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,464
How to talk about something

1985
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:40,512
The Unofficial

1986
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:50,752
Is their belief system in this might be motivated

1987
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:57,152
The organization Consortium

1988
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:05,088
Global politics

1989
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:09,952
Changed

1990
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:12,768
Just a green

1991
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:19,936
What day was it here

1992
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:21,984

01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:28,128
What is it

1995
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:30,688
Google

1996
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:32,224
They just heard anyone

1997
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:39,648
Shibboleth like a war on terror

1998
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:44,768
Provides a background where you can superimpose why then

1999
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:45,536
Distortions on

2000
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:48,864
A seemingly innocuous veneer of legitimacy people

2001
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:57,056
But if you're interested

2002
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:03,968
It's a U1 non-binding plan that's been around

2003
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:11,136
The report entitled the first Global Revolution published in 1991 listen to this picture

2004
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:12,672
Don't tell your friend

2005
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:16,512
Is searching for a new enemy to United

2006
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:18,560
We came up with the idea that pollution

2007
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:20,352
Global warming water shortage

2008
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:22,400
Would fit

2009
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:24,960
Here's my big toe

2010
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:29,056
Dear someone bringing up of that first of all

2011
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:30,592
21

2012
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:34,432
It's like 350 pages I bet you haven't

2013
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:35,200
That's my first

2014
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:38,016
Is when you bring up

2015
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:40,064
The club of Rome

2016
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:45,440
Because if they say yes

2017
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:49,536
Then I know that they're an intentional liar

2018
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:50,816
The context of that quote

2019
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:56,704
If you use that quote as to say that these people made up the idea of climate change

2020
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:01,056
Then you don't hear you're either intentionally

2021
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:03,360
Or you don't know what you're

2022
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:08,480
We talked about this a bunch of times

2023
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:11,296
Absolutely like a mark

2024
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:12,064
Propaganda

2025
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,392
Just to demonstrate that he has a lot of

2026
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:16,160
Of the similar

2027
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:22,560
Like even though we at we laugh a lot and yeah still laughable

2028
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,888
Even back in this PIX11

2029
01:41:26,144 --> 01:41:26,656
Yeah

2030
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:28,192

Winsted cause my soul to Chase

2041
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:02,496

Consummate double negative that is known by all except the grammatically

2046
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:17,600
Next time you hear irregardless

The past tense of sting which

Is vinaigrette

2062
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:52,416
Vinaigrette

2063
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:54,720
Denoting the diminutive form of vinegar

2064
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:56,512
Then there's

2065
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:57,792
Supposably

2066
01:42:58,304 --> 01:43:00,352
Which is able to be supposed

2067

YouTube archives

2087

Most of the mispronunciation

2088
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:06,912
Irregardless

2089
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:07,680
You bet

2090
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:09,728
So you noticed that around

2091
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:10,752

You stopped appearing in a

Basically

2146
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:37,696
Perhaps because of my

And management

2182
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:20,352
The idea that there was a program director who was telling him

You think your genital accoutrement make you a man or woman

It's your internal gender identity your head your brain the little voice that gives you

01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:36,768
It's it's weird

2294
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:38,304
It's really weird

2295
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:42,400
Who you just assumed

2296
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:45,472
Did leave these things but he does

2297
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:47,008
Because it's like

2298
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:49,056
You do get

2299
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:52,384
Should have to

2300
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,920
Realize how interconnect

2301
01:53:55,712 --> 01:53:58,528
With so many of the things that you believe in the wrong

2302
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:00,320
Ynobe

2303
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:01,600
You can't

2304
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:02,880
Cognitive dissonance

2305
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:08,256
Maybe maybe

2306
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:10,304
Like there's a lot of things that I see

2307
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:11,584
Steve

2308
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:18,496
Like he has a lot of videos about like talking about how you

2309
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:20,800
Punish people for bullying

2310
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:24,384
That's a horrible bully

2311
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:25,664
Bright like the idea

2312
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:26,432
You shouldn't

2313
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:34,624
Illegal to insult somebody videos

2314
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:38,208
Consistency

2315
01:54:38,464 --> 01:54:39,744
That with his ideas about free

2316
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:45,120
Tubi

2317
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:47,168
Chipotle

2318
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:51,008
He's coming from now

2319
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:53,568
It's weird weird cat

2320
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:54,592
And I think

2321
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:56,896
When you add the

2322
01:54:57,152 --> 01:54:57,664
Uncle of like his

2323
01:54:58,176 --> 01:54:59,712
Later career Intuit

2324
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:00,992
But he's weird enough

2325
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:03,296
Just look at PIX11

2326
01:55:03,808 --> 01:55:04,320
Yeah that's

2327
01:55:07,392 --> 01:55:07,904
You can

2328
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:09,952
Have both trender right

2329
01:55:11,744 --> 01:55:12,512
And cute

2330
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:17,376
I think that you could probably make a you could probably find a way to make

2331
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:19,168
Make it work just because cuso4

2332
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:22,752
The culture of it

2333
01:55:23,008 --> 01:55:23,776
Is very

2334
01:55:24,544 --> 01:55:25,056
On the right

2335
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:26,848
Conservative

2336
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:27,616
It's very

2337
01:55:28,896 --> 01:55:30,944
You know like if it's the sort of thing

2338
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:32,224
Except like Trump

2339
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:34,784
People being in the military

2340
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:40,672
But I don't know how you square that I can't imagine but I don't know I don't know enough to say

2348
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:10,368
Peace out

2349
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:15,744
You have to bring this to the end

2350
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:21,632
Food stamps

2351
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:22,656

Even the devil wouldn't do

2360
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:54,144
When you let it all go

2361
01:56:59,776 --> 01:57:04,128

01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:45,856
Really should have done something

Yeah I really I mean I guess it's probably or

2383
01:58:24,768 --> 01:58:28,096
How it bothers me

2384
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:30,656

Describe to the whole thing

2394
01:59:22,368 --> 01:59:25,184
I mean like

2395
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:30,304
Progressive

2396
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,072
Stuff like

2397
01:59:31,584 --> 01:59:33,376
It really does feel like this is leading

2398
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:34,912
To death

2399
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:36,448
The net is a Megan

2400
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:39,008
I don't know

2401
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:41,056
I feel like it's a dangerous

2402
01:59:41,568 --> 01:59:42,336
Trend

2403
01:59:43,616 --> 01:59:45,408
And Lionel is a part of perpetuating

2404
01:59:47,968 --> 01:59:49,248
Sole ownership

2405
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:50,272
Any deaths

2406
01:59:50,528 --> 01:59:51,552
It might come out a few or not

2407
01:59:51,808 --> 01:59:54,112
