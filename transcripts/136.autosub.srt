I had a lot of those meetings in my life dear Lord

16
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,176
Before we get to it I would like

17
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:28,320

00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,440
Wilford Brimley

28
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:10,048
Okay what's going on

29
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,376
I'm a policy wonk

30
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,704
Thank you so much for

31
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:23,104
Spider iTunes is real glitchy

32
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:34,112
And that it will be a done deal you'll be about to walk

33
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,184
It sounds too good to be true

34
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,024
Have you ever tried to donate to a podcast

35
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,376
I don't know what's going on we'll try the clicklist

36
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,424
That's the best way

37
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,728
I've teased vest

38
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,032
And today we are beginning

39
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,056
The next invest

40
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:53,824
Navigation

41
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,848
Into Alex

42
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,152
Famously

43
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,456
Over the course of most of last year

44
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,736
We dug deep

45
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,784
Into what happened to get Alex Jones

46
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,552
To join up with

47
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,576
Team Trump

48
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:10,208
Came away with a pretty solid consensus that it was artificial inflation of his traffic

49
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,000
Vorw sandbox

50
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:16,864
Because he admitted on-air that his traffic and tripled and his sales were flat

51
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,680
Mysteriously no one buying anything

52
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:22,240
But times traffic

53
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,544
Very sufficient also the

54
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,080
Influences of Rodger Stone in

55
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,360
Text Sharon.

56
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,920
I was there 45

57
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,456
Right around the same time

58
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:36,832
Right so we've got a pretty good handle on that there's go back and listen

59
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,136
Hundreds of hours for today

60
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,696
Perhaps

61
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,280
Laborious Lee covered

62
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,584
Exhaustive coverage of the

63
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,864
Oh yeah you knew

64
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,888
Yeah

65
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:55,776
HD it's one of the most in-depth and long investigations with no one asked

66
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,848
And it turns out and doing another

67
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:03,200
I am interested to figure out

68
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:03,968
Himself as

69
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,528
Is the person who is most responsible for the tea

70
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,064
Tea party he believes

71
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,344
Some stuff to be a leader of

72
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,880
The party from the jump

73
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,928
And I wanted

74
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:16,256
Explorer the realities or lies

75
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,536
Lovett Varian

76
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:24,191
Also along the way because of the timeline will be covering Barack Obama's first election will be covering the

77
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,263
Primary where Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton we're going

78
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,799
The Democratic nomination

79
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,079
We'll see

80
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,943
There's going to be a lot of interesting

81
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,735
Stuff cuz it's a party in earnest

82
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,295
Came to the Forefront of the

83
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,831
Conscious

84
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,111
In the beginning of 2000

85
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,719
Yeah immediately after a black man was elected seriously clue

86
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,255
Yeah after that however

87
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,327
However if you actually look into

88
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,631
The history of it it'd been something would have been

89
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,423
So the roiling under the surface

90
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,775
To the Koch brothers

91
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:06,431
For a while before that to a lot of that and try and figure out what is what exactly along the way

92
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:10,271
And in doing so I hope we'll be able to learn more about Alex Jones

93
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
RECenter

94
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,343
Like exactly what is

95
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
Bulshit

96
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:14,879
What is

97
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,975
Actually important that likely no guns or super important

98
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,815
Absurd and we know that chimeras are strangely

99
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,887
But beyond that there's so much of these trappings

100
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
Citrusy

101
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,471
In this day today especially currently

102
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,287
Sincere just seems like he is

103
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,311
Trump

104
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,383
Right

105
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,407
Two 2008 just

106
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
Because

107
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,247
He is still relatively under the radar

108
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,575
It's true

109
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,599
Showing up

110
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,623
In all kind

111
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,159
The places that he wished

112
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
Is like

113
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,703
Discovering you wasn't getting sued by everybody

114
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,287
People he could just fly under and everyone to be like who

115
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:09,151
You would happily married to his first wife

116
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:15,551
There is also a another episode

117
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,367
2008 previously seemed much happier

118
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:24,255
Just singing The Highwayman for half an episode

119
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:28,863
Never woke up in the morning

120
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
Crazy

121
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,823
He just had Ron Paul that he's hitched his wagon

122
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,383
To be consistent through all the cancer

123
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,199
But Google

124
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,247
Do all of the

125
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,599
Nonsense along the way

126
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,159
I started this investigation too early

127
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:59,327
I didn't know

128
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,191
The primary season started in earnest

129
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,751
It's what I started on March 30th

130
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,871
So today recovering March 30th and 31st 2018

131
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,455
Nothing primary

132
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,111
Nevermind spoiler for another episode

133
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:28,767
He's not at all episode

134
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:33,119
And he said stuff like Obama is going to get killed

135
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
Cuz he's an outside

136
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,799
But still no like talk about the primaries no real talk about

137
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,383
The election at all because

138
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,943
Who is like this election

139
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,759
Twisted my mind

140
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:56,159
Chicken Mart

141
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
To take 3 years

142
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
But what was

143
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,839
Let's start on March 30th

144
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,887
See what Alex is obsessed about

145
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,911
Spoiler alert

146
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,471
He freaked out about CERN

147
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,543
Different job

148
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,591
Different particles

149
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
Aladdin

150
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,151
Uranium

151
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,431
Meconium in gold

152
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
Other

153
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,039
Heavy elements

154
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,575
At the speed of light

155
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,599
Into other Ella

156
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,623
Or the accelerator

157
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
Porgy

158
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,255
European Union. The biggest one

159
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,559
They've got a whole bunch of them here in the US

160
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,399
And I'm going to go back to top sinus infection

161
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,423
Every time I'm in

162
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
Email Music Manager

163
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,383
That all I know is

164
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,919
British

165
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,967
Royal Society must procedures

166
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
Vision World

167
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,759
There's a physicist

168
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,063
Wrote a book 20 years ago saying was good

169
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,623
Or the solar system

170
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,439
I was a bunch of physicists that are now suing

171
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
2 block

172
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,743
Others new Collider

173
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:08,095
Deftun equation show

174
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
Explosion

175
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,703
Is the simplest way to

176
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:19,871
Maybe even

177
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
Tomorrow

178
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,455
Attack Trey my producers in there yesterday

179
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,247
I dug up

180
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Physicist

181
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,575
Ceiling fan

182
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,647

183
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,951

188
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,471
And listen

189
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,751
You can trust these guys

190
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,799
They're not quack why did you say that

191
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,591
Alex

192
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:56,991
Because I'm used to not being on shows he must have had General stubblebine on recently and it runs I called out

193
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,015
I don't know about this

194
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:02,879
You kind of think

195
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,671
Well if they're on CNN

196
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,951
They're not a quack

197
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,583
Assuming that they're not quite

198
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,167
Looking at it

199
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,191
People have on

200
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,495
Are the New Yorker or the New York Times

201
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,263
Through their hiring

202
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,335
Oh s*** maybe all of these people are quack

203
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:26,943
There's a matter of good Alex doesn't do and we're starting to realize that

204
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:33,343
Other places do we have made a lot of assumptions and turns out some of these people

205
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,207
I'm so excited trouble

206
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,231
It's trouble

207
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,791
Pretty obsessed about this and he says that he's going

208
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,607
To get these physicists

209
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:49,983
Write a little bit later

210
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,287
Not today will be dealing with it on the next

211
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,335
Episode

212
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,943
I have some knowledge of the next couple episodes

213
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:05,343
This is a difficult place for me to be graduated from

214
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,647
University or what kind of

215
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,439
What kind of physicists are we getting

216
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:13,279
Guys actually pretty legit in terms of his credentials

217
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:17,375
But at the same time he's a guy in 1999

218
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
Colliding

219
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,751
Top articles against each other

220
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,287
Destroy the universe and then

221
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
It didn't

222
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,359
I'm in here in 2018

223
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,407
Basotho stops earn for being

224
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,943
Open

225
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,967
I don't work out

226
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:32,991
Judge says

227
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,551
But he's failed to prove it anyway that there is

228
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,343
I dunno

229
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,671
Potential Threat that would Merit it also

230
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:47,071
Us courts don't have jurisdiction over European scientific experiment

231
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:57,055
He's like well it's better than other cases I've taken recently

232
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:01,151
Yeah I don't know I don't know exactly the process wherein you decide what

233
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
Gets on the docket what does it

234
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,015
Because you

235
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,807
You don't have to

236
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:12,159
I mean unless you really believe it course you do

237
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:18,815
The entire world is going to be turned into a black hole

238
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,351
Terms of jurisdiction

239
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:25,727
The sheriff is the highest law

240
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,567
Speaking to someone whose name sounds like a terrorist

241
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,615
Alright that was a perfect

242
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,759
Early on Alex Jones

243
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,295
Has a visit from

244
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,575
Jim Marrs

245
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,135
Do you know who Jim bars is

246
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,207
No he's a gentleman who is notoriously

247
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,631
Like he's a big guy in

248
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:01,823
Conspiracy theory conspiracy

249
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
The Forefront of

250
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
The JFK

251
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,735
Conspiracy that mean he also taught like

252
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,759
Accredited college

253
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,295
Class on conspiracy

254
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,111
And I think that elevates him out of the muck

255
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,927
Okay alright

256
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,231
So he's a professor of the

257
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,767
Conspiracy theories that he makes

258
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,583
Yeah

259
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,887
It's important

260
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,167
To know that he also wrote

261
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:27,935
2buckz about 8

262
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,263
I don't like

263
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,615
The more we learn about Ancient Aliens and the more they are still from

264
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,383
They're at

265
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,151
Not

266
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:42,527
You want to have about JFK I'm all yours

267
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,575
You know like I'm I'm open

268
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
During arguments

269
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,159
About the anti-castro Cubans

270
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
CIA

271
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,767
I'm open to hearing any of these

272
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:59,167
Because that is a thing that happened and I'm willing to believe that there was some sort of

273
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,007
Conspiracy involved more fun world

274
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:15,807
Testicle world movie like world

275
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,903
Might not agree with you

276
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:26,303
Actually Sirhan Sirhan who did it I don't know if it's

277
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:30,143
Fine but I don't think you're crazy

278
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,935
If you believe in JFK can

279
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,239
I think we could have a cup

280
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
Jam cake

281
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:39,871
Listen to all of them there is a line

282
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,663
I do

283
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,479
I do think you're crazy

284
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:50,879
If you believe in Ancient Aliens and I want to make us on both sides

285
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:56,767
So I consider him to be someone who has ACT

286
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,071
But also researches

287
00:14:59,327 --> 00:14:59,839
If you stay

288
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:00,863
One of the

289
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,399
Foremost

290
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,679
Conspiracy theorist

291
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,215
Isn't that the end of credibility

292
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:05,983
Subway

293
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,543
Aref

294
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,847
Vrsk

295
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,431
Well

296
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,991
Is actually nothing new

297
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,575
And many other people almost sense

298
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,599
Time of the robber

299
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,671
Loudly

300
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,231
Tried to shout out that he was

301
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,511
Not killed by

302
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
Sirhan Sirhan

303
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,071
Who cannot remember any

304
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,095
Anything that happens

305
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,239
Likely story

306
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,007
Significance

307
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:42,079
Is that after all these years and after all the

308
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,871
Further Evidence

309
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,663
Including scientific evidence

310
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
Comes out

311
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,479
More and more people are waking

312
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
Up and

313
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,527
Beginning to realize that

314
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,879
We're actually right all alone

315
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
The conspiracy theorist

316
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,183
The right all along

317
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:02,047
People are realizing conspiracy

318
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,327
It is sort of like

319
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,423
Conspiracy theorists tell you they're right

320
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,703
And that you need to wake up

321
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:14,079
Sirhan Sirhan and assassination of RFK

322
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,151
There are some interesting elements of it that I think you're not being

323
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,711
In terms of

324
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,039
Compelling circumstantial evidence

325
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,831
That there were other people involved

326
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:29,183
Looks like there was at least one woman who was involved

327
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,487
And they may or may not have been

328
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:34,559
Stalking RFK previous assassination

329
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:39,679
Is the one thing that I

330
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:44,031
Like this is the one thing where I do not need any evidence

331
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,311
I am just going to

332
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,615
You come out and say that I swear to God

333
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,895
I think the XVI killed

334
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,967
Really really do

335
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,247
I really do

336
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,063
Mainly because RFK

337
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,343
Perhaps

338
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,135
Becoming the most

339
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,671
Compassionate and

340
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,487
Progressive candidate in the history of the United

341
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:10,399
David by the way

342
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,239
Martin Luther King jr.

343
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,287
He came out and gave an awful

344
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,335
Look up speech that was one of the more

345
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
I mean

346
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,687
Credited with the fact that

347
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,711
The city he was in

348
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
Didn't try

349
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,039
Because they heard that

350
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:32,671
Right right that's how I'm going overseas and

351
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,463
Seeing all of this starvation

352
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,511
First

353
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,535
Made this change

354
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,559
And he was

355
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,095
Going to win

356
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:40,863
Like he was

357
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,631
Rushing

358
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,167
The other candidates

Primary

363
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,359
Exactly

364
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,943
Yeah it look

365
00:17:55,199 --> 00:18:00,063
This is a conversation that I'm fine having I don't think you're crazy

366
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,087
If you believe this

367
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,367
But also

368
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,439
GID

369
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:11,327

Quote

373
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,007
Quote

374
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,823
He's asked so that there was a time the love

375
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,639
Turn to hate

376
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,943
Because he had previously to this said that he like

377
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,551
What time when Senator Kennedy was a candidate for the

378
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:37,695
Just answer yes it was during the time he was but not exactly specifically

379
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,975
What it turned into hate

380
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,047
Not only that hate really because I still loved

381
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,631
But when he came out with his support for the state of Israel

382
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,959
Israel

383
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:49,983
And then

384
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,263
Questioning resume

385
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,567
At that time he was a candidate for president

386
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
United States

387
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,127
Question

388
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,687
You say it wasn't until all of that that

389
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
But you hate him

390
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,503
Hate van Avenue cutoff

391
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:08,159
No but it was enough for me sir that anything that has to do with Israel or the support of Israel that is enough

392
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,463
Question

393
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,999
But not all of that

394
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,815
Answer well enough to have an impression only

395
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,583
Question

396
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,607
Enough to kill him

397
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,655
Answer I don't know about that sir

398
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,679
Question

399
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
Well did you

400
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:26,079
Didn't you just tell us here a few days ago that if you had him right there you would have

401
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:26,847
Blasted him

402
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,663
The answer

403
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:34,783
Bombers I would have done that

404
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,575
Question you would have done

405
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
Answer

406
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,415
Yes I'm a very impulsive person

407
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:48,351
Whatever my objective would be be it's just

408
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,631
Good for that time only

409
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,959
That's like

410
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,775
That's like an interrogation in the drunk tank

411
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,079
Yeah I mean I

412
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:58,847
Mitre

413
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,383
Could

414
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:04,991
I certainly would have at that point

415
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,807
Maybe I would have I don't I don't know if I did

416
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:11,903
I don't remember but I was there and I was shooting

417
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,463
I don't know all the stuff about

418
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,743
All the stuff

419
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,303
Control and stuff like that is also

420
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,583
Murky because

421
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,655
Who wrote diary

422
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:29,055
Yeah I know it was an entry that said to eliminate RFK becoming more and more of an unshakable

423
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,127
RFK Must Die RFK must be killed

424
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,175
Robert F Kennedy must be assassinated

425
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,455
So

426
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
Because always

427
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:48,767
Twice

428
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,535
You're going to kill me

429
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,559
Most likely

430
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,119
Psychiatrist

431
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,399
Psychologist

432
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,191
Gone on record and say that

433
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,751
Manipulative

434
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,335
Person and also of dual natures and fairly skits

435
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:07,711
The phrenic probably want to tell you that I don't remember

436
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,503
Right

437
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,599
If you believe a murderer who said I don't remember that murder

438
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,391
That's on you

439
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,024
Because I thought we went over on that Project Camelot episode about Mark Richards he says he was off

440
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:27,424
Planet during the murder he was involved with his word I don't know

441
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,216
I'm going to look at

442
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,496
Endurance of the evidence

443
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,776
And I'm going to say

444
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,568
The FBI did

445
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:38,176
Fine you can have that you can have that I'm not as convinced

446
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:38,944
That

447
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
And

448
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,552
Jamar's I have more credibility if you had written two books that answer anyways

449
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:49,184
Talking about Americans who supported

450
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,304
The names of prominent American Tusa

451
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,584
Supported Hitler is

452
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,888
Pretty amazing

453
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,704
You've got the Watson of IBM you got Henry

454
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,240
Ford and Ford Motor Company

455
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,288
You've got Chase Bank in John Jay

456
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,848
Chase Bank

457
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,688
Put conspicuous in their absence

458
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,992
Fred Koch

459
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,296
Never heard of

460
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,088
The Koch brothers father

461
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:21,696
Fedco Kinross

462
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,232
Sympathizer named William Rhodes

463
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:26,048
The Davis to help build the third largest oil refinery in the

464
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:26,816
The Third Reich

465
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,632
He also made a ton of money selling cracking stills

466
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,752
The Communists and

467
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,032
Somatic John Birch

468
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,800
Society

469
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,848
Mysterious in his

470
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,384
Absence

471
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,432
There's always a lot of people that they list

472
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,784
Fred Koch is a big one among those names

473
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,808
I mean

474
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,856
But I'm sure

475
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,416
He may have had an outsize impact

476
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,000
He may be proud

477
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,792
Personally responsible for at least

478
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:01,120
40% of a lot of be war crimes

479
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,752
He doesn't remember it

480
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,568
He said that he didn't know what was going on he was like

481
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,128
He felt like he might have done it

482
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,688
The time but he wasn't sure

483
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:19,808
Favorite

484
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:25,184
What's the history of Fred cope2 is that

485
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,952
Crystalline

486
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,232
He came back

487
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,840
He was really anti what he saw over there

488
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,376
Write this was not the case

489
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,144
What's fascism

490
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:37,728
Did not become like an anti-fascist dude

491
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,776
I'm still him and his son

492
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,056
If traffic with

493
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,688
For a large part of their careers

494
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:50,528
I live so that's interesting to me I don't know I don't know if it's like

495
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,320
National leaving them off the list

496
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:56,416
Cuz you do it those people we talked about Watson he definitely had some

497
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,440
Inclination

498
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,976
Towards

499
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:05,376
Absolutely he also was responsible for disseminating Protocols of the Elders of Zion

500
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,912
There is a lot of

501
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,472
The troubling history of US business interest

502
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,240
And

503
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,808
Morality code and you have to do all of this

504
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:27,648
And there was a whole like lifestyle that you had to live by

505
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,440
Just to work for him

506
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,256
Like he controlled every aspect of your life

507
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,048
Is going to be like

508
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,120
Yeah

509
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,728
I get the mentality that you're described

510
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:45,056
But I'm just talking about like why isn't this on the list

511
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,592
Why aren't you

512
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,920
This isn't the strongest

513
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,712
Sentiment that I have

514
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,992
Buddy

515
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:56,064
Curious cuz Alex does talk about these Americans

516
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,624
Token Network

517
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,392
Comes up

518
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,208
That I'm so that might be a little reason to be suspicious

519
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:05,280
Also turns out I don't think Hitler was that bad

520
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,072
Hitler

521
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,864
Empower and then set him up

522
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:18,848
Mainstream history mystery

523
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,128
Can't we just have

524
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:20,896
Can we just have

525
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:22,944
Nicer be nice

526
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,968
Cuz histories

527
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,016
You think it's predicated on facts

528
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,064
Not know

529
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,136
It'll change

530
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:31,904
Whenever the FBI

531
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,672
Murder.

532
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,952
Play that right now

533
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,000
We have

534
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,048
You know a very weird

535
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,096
Hitler was set up

536
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,632
Declaration

537
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,704
How do you setup

538
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,776
For all of

539
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,896
The doodoo is trying to have a

540
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:59,296
Like he was just a situation where he threw out the Holocaust

541
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:02,112
Newspaper like yeah

542
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,696
Is he mr. Magoo

543
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,512
Everyone thought it was Eva Braun now

544
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:13,632
Blonde wig on a coat rack

545
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,680
It's as good a time as any to go to

546
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:18,496
22 very weird commercials

547
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,520
Did Alex

548
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,288
Plays

549
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,312
On this episode

550
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
Is that

551
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,384
I don't know what to make of

552
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,176
And

553
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:33,856
What about Israel if you could only visit

554
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:40,256
One country One Nation on the face of this Earth since Judaism

555
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:46,656
Because then you'll never be the same

556
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,920
That's weird

557
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:00,224
Weird

558
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:13,536
Drillers could change the way you will ever approach the Bible

559
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:19,936
Deeper and richer way because you have been where it happened you'll never be the same when you visit Israel

560
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,760
That's crazy place to commercials about going to Israel

561
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:38,112
I can tell you what

562
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,928
I can tell you that busy

563
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:51,424
And I looked at their website israel.com

564
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,216
Can you scroll down

565
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:00,128
If you scroll down all the way

566
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:03,968
That the history of

567
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,528
Tourism of the Israeli government

568
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:10,368
Right

569
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,976
No this is from the Israeli government's tourism board

570
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,768
Ahead of the Foursquare

571
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,048
I don't care

572
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:21,120
Exactly what kind of force

573
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:26,496
Foursquare

574
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:30,592
You're glossing over something that I find ink

575
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,128
Ratably weird

576
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,456
Because I want to make it totally clear off the top I don't know

577
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,992
Anyway

578
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:41,344
Alex Jones Israel like so many of his critics claim

579
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,136
But it is

580
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,672
Proof

581
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,488
Indisputable proof

582
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,864
The Genesis Communications network was making a revenue off the Israeli government

583
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:53,888
In 2000

584
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,680
And that's why

585
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,984
Cuz I don't hear any other commercials for

586
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,520
Guatemala

587
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,056
Will soda other countries

588
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,408
The Israeli government was like info

589
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,688
Is where we're going

590
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,456
Great

591
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,224
Right

592
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,040
There's that

593
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,088
I like they must have just been

594
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:19,488
Turn on everything and not really paying attention to what they're doing

595
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,024
Patience

596
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,304
I think it's a network

597
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,656
This is before Alex had his own 20

598
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:31,776
Volume boosters the commercials that play R4

599
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:32,800
The documentary

600
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:35,360
Most of it is in house

601
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,384
Commercials for his

602
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,152
Documentaries

603
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:38,944
And then

604
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,504
Every now and again something like this

605
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:45,344
I got to be honest it's through me for a crazy loop

606
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,392
Yeah I don't know what to make of it

607
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,792
Going to go to israel.com you were never this

608
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,864
But I

609
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,776
It's almost as good as Diamond gusset

610
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,592
But it's crazy man it is a nut

611
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,128
I don't like

612
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,944
Again I don't

613
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,760
Because

614
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,040
Look I don't

615
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:18,624
Agree with their conclusion but one of the pieces of argument

616
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,392
That

617
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:25,280
His aunt Alex's anti-semitic critics make against him is absolutely true Genesis Communications

618
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:31,424
Was making money directly from the government of Israel

619
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:36,544
Right like the tourism government

620
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,360
For like

621
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,920
Go to Mexico

622
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,736
Caribbean cruise

623
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,760
Go to Wyoming

624
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,296
VTA buses

625
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:50,880
Wyoming

626
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,928
What happened

627
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,976
Different

628
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,472
If lcta bus drivers

629
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,520
Work anti Wyoming

630
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:13,408
Worldview was based on lies about Wyoming

631
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:21,088
And everyone everybody who criticized the Ventra said that they

632
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,624
Secretly worked for while

633
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,184
That's what would make it make

634
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,536
Difficult for me lick if I were Alex Jones and I were Ted Anderson

635
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:35,936
I would say thank you tourism Board of Israel we appreciate the offer but we don't want to accept this because we

636
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,728
We are afraid it would give the appearance

637
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,264
The thing

638
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,104
That we are in accurately criticized about all the time

639
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,640
It seems like bad Optics

640
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,200
It's for us thank you very much but we have to pass

641
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,480
That's what I

642
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:53,600
But again this goes back to my argument about his anti-semitic critics

643
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,136
In that they give him

644
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,160
Cover

645
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,208
So he can be as anti-Semitic

646
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:58,976
Does he want

647
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:05,376
And they are like you're not an anti-semite so he knows commercial to bait them exactly

648
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:11,264
If you call him

649
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,080
These guys are anti-Semitic

650
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,616
Miso I clearly am not

651
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,944
It's possible that it's probably like

652
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,760
If you want to meet

653
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,552
Debbie was doing it on purpose

654
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,576
What you probably was

655
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,904
There's so many layers of intention there it's

656
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,440
It's very confusing

657
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,000
I don't know I don't know what it means

658
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,024
I have

659
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,304
Zero idea

660
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:39,168
I don't think that adversity works for Israel anything like that I'm not changing my position on that

661
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,240
I think your position is the most sensible

662
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,568
Because I did least accounts for the psychology of the individual

663
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,592
But I don't

664
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,688
Well and then there's the other psychology which is

665
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:58,880
Whatever they were offering to give it to him at the time to show called

666
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:05,280
What really happened with Israel.

667
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:08,096
Michael Rivero at the time

668
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,400
Music

669
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,192
Aggressively

670
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,800
It's very confusing

671
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,848
I don't know the ins and outs

672
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:25,504
Anyway and his next clip conclusion that

673
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,272
Weird

674
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,624
List of people who I've spoken out

675
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,648
About 9/11

676
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,720
And then comes in with little bit of

677
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:39,328
But now we have just everybody all these visits

678
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,912
Italian president

679
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,704
CIA section chief

680
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,520
Willie Nelson

681
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:53,408
Top actors Best Actress this year

682
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:59,552
Bruce Willis I no longer being a neocon saying they killed Kennedy in the same group that did that basically did 9/11

683
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:02,112
What are they going to do

684
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:09,536
Well unfortunately they'll probably go to the tactic of desperation whisper to launch Another War artists

685
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,304
Set office

686
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:14,144

You take morphine very simile

688
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,568
Admitted

689
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:26,944
Superconducting super collider and other similar facilities are doing things our own equation say

690
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,504
Good chance of blowing the entire planet

691
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,040
Good chances strong

692
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,624
Is straw good

693
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:39,488
35%

694
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:43,328
Neither much lower

695
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:47,680
Willie Nelson is on par with scientist

696
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:56,896
Multiple gas cuz this is Silvio Berlusconi

00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,920
Inside Job

698
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,456
Probably

699
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:01,248
Drunk he was crazy

700
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:07,136
9/11 Inside Job

Transition between Italian president

702
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,632
But then also just to illustrate

703
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,912
10 years ago Alex

704
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,680
It was still doing the

705
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,960
Exactly I'm scared

706
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:29,408
Let's get that around the election to like this last year to make before new

707
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:34,272
It seems like you got it

708
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:38,112
Do this we do this like nuker's at the bottom

709
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,136
Daddy just wants to

710
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:40,928
Chicken nugget

711
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,512
Crazy

712
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,328
This is probably my own Prejudice but

713
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:50,144
Anytime I hear somebody who is supposed to be in

714
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,960
Expert with a Southern accent I'm always going to be like

715
00:35:54,752 --> 00:36:00,128
You need to get over

716
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,176
Really kind of invalidate a lot for

717
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:05,248
There's a lot of dumb people speak like that

718
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,576
Logically it doesn't track

719
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:14,976
RightNow Media perception

720
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,256
Two people with Southern

721
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:21,376
Playing

722
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,680
I've represented

723
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:26,240
Who sings there's a good chance

724
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,544
That also other people

725
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,592
Deb never graduate

726
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,640
I don't know what I don't know what the

727
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:37,504
I don't know where I was going with that famously smart people who speak with a Southern accent

728
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,296
How's it going

729
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:48,256
I know that's possible

730
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,888
It's not good that the only person I could come up with is Jim Ross

731
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:57,472
WWE announcer Jim Ross

732
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:05,152
So this is a Sunday affair

733
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:05,920
Interview

734
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,480
On the show and it is an interview with

735
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,136
Japanese politician

736
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,184
By the name of fruit

737
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,720
And

738
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:24,608
Threw it out with the bathwater cuz it's nonsense

739
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,888
But if you look into it

740
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,704
This guy the Japanese guy

741
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,008
Only isn't 2911 truth cuz he watched

742
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,032
Loose change

743
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,824
Which was produced by Alex Jones

744
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:40,224
So Alex Jones's film gave this guy questions about 9/11 and then they made

745
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:46,624
Now he's a guest on Alex Jones

746
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,184
It's an elevation

747
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,488
Cuz now you have a 4in politician

748
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,792
Who's your narratives backs

749
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:58,400
Do you which elevates them from your standard Rebel

750
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,448
A Japanese translated version

751
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,800
It probably be riveting

752
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:09,408
Be so good never Jimmy James's book was translated into

753
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,968
The Japanese Superdry

754
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,504
Kill kill

755
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:14,784
War

756
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,088
Or so

757
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,696
But the show there's a couple

758
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:25,024

12:30

768
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:02,400

Let it ride around my house

774
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,976

775

Okay

782
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,552
You need to be traction Friday

No toll roads

788
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,560
Road

789
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,096
Centra isn't Spanish

790
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864

Please learn

795
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,592
Metronome

796
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:21,504
So ideally known to say there is

797
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,040
At the end

798
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,904
It's bad I don't think that's sarcasm I think he's phoning it in but I

799
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:31,232
It's irresponsible if someone calls you and is like

800
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:37,632
There is a helicopter following me because I write a chemtrail blogs

801
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,192
I'm at Target

802
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:43,008
Surveillance moment I started

803
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,032
Chemtrails

804
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:50,432
Now helicopters are coming over my house without their lights on exactly 121 I think is someone calls you

805
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:53,248
Dewan says that it's your responsibility as an adult

806
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,528
To say

807
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,576
This is paranoia

808
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,368
You bleed to look into

809
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:05,536
Living with your brother not scream at them drink fluoride submit to this

810
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,304
Paranoia

811
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,376
But paranoia so he's

812
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,912
Conflicting these poor people

813
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,448
Indulging

814
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,984
Bizarre paranoid

815
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:19,360
Just look the other day there was a f****** the helicopter flying over my house for like

816
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,896
Almost the entire day

817
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,760
Freddy year-and-a-half after

818
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,600
F****** time and you know why I'm not

819
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,160
Too far from the Lake Lakeshore Drive

820
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,464
There's traffic helicopters

821
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,744
Over it

822
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,280
There's crime

823
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,584
Around and sometimes there are helicopters

824
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,608
That are

825
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,632
Looking for crime

826
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,656
Exactly

827
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,984
And so it's easy to interpret those things

828
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:50,336
Police helicopter

829
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,360
Pilots just being like

830
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,831
Helicopter closely over your house

831
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:01,855
For example

832
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,647
It's easy to think

833
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,183
Oh this is suspicious

834
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,487
Because you don't have all the information

835
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,023
In the same way

836
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,303
I get a lot of

837
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,583
Calls

838
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,375
When I answer them no one's there

839
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:17,471
And I if I wanted to I could play the game of

840
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,751
People are

841
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,799
Stalking me over the phone

842
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:24,639
And if I were to express those things to you you would very likely say

843
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:31,039
That is an unhealthy way to look at it

844
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:37,439
Maybe being a bad friend yes, maybe it would be better for the show.

845
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:41,535
It's the same level of paranoia or the same style of paranoia which is

846
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,583
Taking an innocuous thing

847
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,631
It has an explanation

848
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,167
Giving it the exclamation

849
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:50,495
Do you want to have my phone number

850
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:55,103
Looking for you

851
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,383
Valve

852
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,407
It's it's

853
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,967
Definitely the explanation that is

854
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,015
I have to deal with

855
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:03,807
It's a bummer

856
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,903
You know what it turns out we found 100 you can't get on the Do Not Call list

857
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,183
Like telemarketers

858
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,511
Just keep calling you can request

859
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,559
Take me off your list they don't respect that

860
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:23,007
Take me off your bounty hunting list please also

861
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:23,775
Their job though

862
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,823
Sonoran for me

863
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,615
Alex

864
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:32,991
Get another color and this one I think is actually this one illustrates Alex Jones his lack of

865
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:33,759
Meant to the cause

866
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:37,855
Let's go ahead now and take another call

867
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,927
Colorado you're on the air

868
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:46,303
Hey Alex get you again today I was going to suggest what if we had something like a Woodstock 911

869
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:49,119
Big Contour we had one day where we had all these

870
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,399
Musicians in all these acts

871
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,167
Famous people

872
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:51,935
We'll come together and we

873
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,983
We just spent one day

874
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,847
Did he just say Woodstock 9/11 concert Logan 911 Woodstock

875
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,407
Woodstock all about 9/11

876
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,199
What do you what do you what's your problem

877
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:05,247
I heard that

878
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:11,903
Like that was very strange for me I let the

879
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:15,231
Clip keep going and then in my head all the sudden I was like wait

880
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:21,887
Woodstock 9/11 concert

881
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,679
Should we have a 9/11 in

882
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,959
Party no

883
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,567
Like a pool party

884
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:33,407
As I read all jumping we would have

885
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:35,455
You know how you have powers

886
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,223
We would have

887
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:40,319
Weird have two people standing on top of each other

888
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,855
And then we throw you at the

889
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:45,439
When I was in college and then the third plan would actually hit

890
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:48,511
The house when I was in college and I had much

891
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,815
Worst taste

892
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,095
Let's say and I had left

893
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,655
Decorum

894
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:57,983
I had an idea for a 911 party where I had twin bong

895
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,567
G.i. lighters would be dressed up at planes

896
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:03,103
I thought I would make a

897
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:04,639
Layer dip

898
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,663
Two different dips

899
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,247
There was something

900
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:15,647
Great party ideas

901
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,463
No

902
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:22,815
Which was a drink a 40 minutes and 11 seconds

903
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,351
Or else the terrorist away

904
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:28,191
That was a part of my 911 party idea that we actually

905
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,215
We did a couple times

906
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,239
Mayonnaise

907
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:33,055
Really hard do not recommend anyone do it

908
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,127
Usually win

909
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,967
Answer your question no metaphor

910
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,247
Really

911
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:43,295
Let the great metaphor for Impala

912
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,087
Sure Harris usually win

913
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,391
Usually because you can't drink

914
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,159
40 fasting

915
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:48,927
Yeah

916
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:49,951
Yeah you end up throwing up

917
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,279
Too much liquid to drink

918
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:57,887
11 Woodstock

919
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,167
Try helping the

920
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,703
People with art architecture

921
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,543
Media

922
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,103
That one major big event

923
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,663
If we could videotape sell and try to show everybody how many

924
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:14,527
People there are from the sure here's the problem you know that

925
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,367
It would take a lot of groups getting involved in the groups would never agree

926
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:21,439
And also no one group I'm probably only person

927
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,719
Actually pull it off

928
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:24,255
Could go out and get the celebrities

929
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:27,071
Celebrities don't know or don't trust

930
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:30,143
Because I don't know these other groups they have been around as long as

931
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,447
Yellow celebrity just call me up

932
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,727
The phone rings and they're on

933
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:36,799
I am at because they have been around long time

934
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,847
Aware of what I've been doing a long time

935
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,639
You built up a lot

936
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:43,455
People but I haven't really actually going out and pushed it

937
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,783
Because I couldn't imagine the headache of it all

938
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:47,807
Shirts

939
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:52,415
911 Woodstock

940
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,207
Infrastructure

941
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:57,279
First one

942
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:01,631
I agree I agree with his premise that no one would agree on

943
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:04,191
I definitely agree with that.

944
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,287
The only person who could pull it off as me

945
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,847
And I don't need that aggravation

946
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,175
You're not really contesting the

947
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:17,503
Claims that that would be huge for 9/11 truth movement

948
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:22,623
What you're saying I wouldn't want to put that kind of work into

949
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,415
Tacitly saying would be effective

950
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:28,767
Well yeah it would be huge for the 9/11 truther movement

951
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:31,583
If there was a real legitimate 911 Woodstock

952
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,631
I would I would watch

953
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:38,495
Well you would have

954
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:41,823
Absolutely going to happen

955
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,199
Covergroup of the Four Tenors

956
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:54,367
Italian president off the top of my head

957
00:47:55,135 --> 00:48:00,255
Holograms music for Selene

958
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,095
Kid Rock

959
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:07,423
Kid Rock would play as one of the Four Tenors nude

960
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,703
The nuge wood death

961
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:10,495
The new just

962
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:13,055
Sarah Palin will probably show up

963
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,591
Danzig Mike show up

964
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:19,455
He would just throw his own probably as we

965
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:26,879
Cornwood play metal guy

966
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:28,927
Tuesday Woodstock

967
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:31,231
This brings us to the end

968
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,767
March 30th

969
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,047
2000

970
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,655
Sunday March 31st

971
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,471
And Alex has a hole

972
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,775
He is no longer obsessed with CERN

973
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,567
Although that will come back up

974
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,847
Bendy very near future

975
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,127
Today

976
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,407
He's pissed off

977
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,455
Because the media is reporting

978
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:55,039
That there are white people who might be an Al-Qaeda

979
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,391
He is

980
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,951
He's taking he's taking that news.

981
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,231
Looks like

982
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:08,351
Because he feels a little bit of personal responsibility for the white race

983
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,655
You know what you're not far off

984
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:13,983
Let's play Let's play a couple clips

985
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:17,311
I will get into his feelings are that are very

986
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,359
There is no Alki

987
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,431
And so

988
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,807
And by the way here it isn't Associated Press

989
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:33,951
OKC attorney general terrorist behind copyright violations copyright violation

990
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:34,975
Terrorism

991
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:39,583
White Collar civil stop

992
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,007
If I were to

993
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,055
If I were to

994
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:53,407
Perfect case of Alex Jones

995
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,431
Twisting a narrative

996
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,967
He has a story

997
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:58,015
About attorney general Michael mukasey

998
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,551
Who is saying things

999
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:01,599
Things about

1000
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,623
A river

1001
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:03,647
Alex

1002
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,439
Change the story

1003
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,207
McKay's

1004
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:09,279
He saying the copyright violations are terrorism

1005
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,327
Which is absolutely not the

1006
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:14,911
If you read the story what do you think

1007
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,703
Is that

1008
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:19,007
The continuing worldwide escalation

1009
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,543
Counterfeiting and piracy poses

1010
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:22,591
Threat to Public Safety

1011
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,127
He said that the mission of the

1012
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:24,895
Department of Justice

1013
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:27,967
This is clear whether it's a complex International narcotics

1014
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,271
A corrupt public officials abusing his office or

1015
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,295
Some scam artists

1016
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,319
Counterfeit software

1017
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:34,111
Our job is to enforce the law

1018
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,391
And bring to Justice those who prove

1019
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,159
Perpetrate these crime

1020
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,695
He said quote

1021
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,767
The counterfeiting of products like Pharmaceuticals and medical devices

1022
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:43,839
Does Auto and airplane parts or electronics that go into our nation

1023
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,119
Critical infrastructure

1024
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:47,679
Can present a real and direct danger to the pub

1025
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,471
This isn't

1026
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,751
A speech that he gave

1027
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:52,799
Add appointment

1028
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:54,591
That he was trying to drive at

1029
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,383
Is a

1030
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,687
That

1031
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,455
Was that

1032
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,223
Stuffed

1033
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:00,991
Inventions

1034
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,527
Points of poses

1035
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:03,551
Threat to the nation

1036
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:04,575
Health and safety

1037
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:05,855
Can Foster

1038
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:07,647
And

1039
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:10,975
That a lot of intellectual property theft is being done by

1040
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,255
Criminal Networks

1041
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,047
And the money that is made off of

1042
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,071
Them

1043
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,887
Which doesn't mean

1044
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,959
Fitting or copyright infringe

1045
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:21,983
Is Terrorism

1046
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:25,055
Just that this is a source of something

1047
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:28,639
Yeah I would say that's a little bit scared

1048
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:31,455
There is

1049
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:39,903
Conflate them far too much but he is also being a little bit irresponsible with the way that he

1050
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:41,695
Combining

1051
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,463
The two

1052
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:45,279
I don't particularly enjoy that

1053
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,047
It's kind of like

1054
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,679
If you're going to bring in terrorism it better be terrorism

1055
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:52,959
And not

1056
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:53,727
Sure

1057
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:54,751
Copyright

1058
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,287
It would be nice

1059
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,847
If we lived in that world

1060
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,407
Unfortunately we're looking at

1061
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,783
Just for a second

1062
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:12,159
That is one of the problems with with this show in 2008

1063
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:14,463
Is that whatever that guy was like

1064
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:17,279
Call latara

1065
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,559
Is it to take more power

1066
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:21,375
God dammit you are correct about that

1067
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,911
You're just f****** Raw

1068
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:23,935
Yeah

1069
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:25,983
You doing this on the right

1070
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,519
Like that's what

1071
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,103
Not doing it that way and you

1072
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,383
You're not helping

1073
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:34,687
Fight what they're doing because you're like

1074
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:38,527
Well the problem isn't what they're doing the problem is

1075
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:42,111
Magical thinking over here

1076
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:46,207
Jordan Belfort

1077
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:51,071
Also the end result of all this stuff is just rationalizing

1078
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,143
Yeah

1079
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:56,959
It doesn't charm me

1080
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:00,031
You know like in terms of

1081
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,567
What mukasey was doing

1082
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:03,103
Edward Bush was up to

1083
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:08,479
I agree spiritually with like being against it but it don't help

1084
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,623
Talk to get back

1085
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,391
Into the idea

1086
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,183
People are joining

1087
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,975
And this is based

1088
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:20,767
On a report that came out

1089
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:22,815
Al-Qaeda was trying

1090
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,095
White people

1091
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,375
And

1092
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,655
That's a reasonable thing

1093
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:27,935
Because

1094
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:30,751
I mean most famously we had John Walker lindh

1095
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,519
Right back

1096
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,543
In the early 2000

1097
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,079
Who was a white guy who

1098
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,871
It signed up with the Taliban

1099
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,199
Garden

1100
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,479
You have

1101
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:44,319
You haven't number of people over the years who have been White

1102
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:46,879
Westerners who have joined Al-Qaeda

1103
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:49,439
And in a clip that we're going to

1104
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,719
Just a minute

1105
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,023
We will get

1106
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,583
The obvious rationalization

1107
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,351
For this

1108
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,143
Go get Alex

1109
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,983
Take your kind of personal

1110
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,591
Get their building this

1111
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,127
Giant mechanism

1112
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:10,943
To track everything you do Trace everything you do

1113
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:14,271
Micromanager Turner national ID card off

1114
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:19,391
Your pharmacist your doctor your lawyer School teachers

1115
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,487
Neighbor

1116
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:27,583
Tattletale Squad

1117
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:35,775
Try to train the feds how to do this

1118
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:38,079
Pause. Just for a second

1119
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:41,151
Alex

1120
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,943
Is being involved in tea

1121
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:43,967
Teaching people how to do this

1122
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:45,759
Write a couple years later

1123
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:48,575
He would make the exact same Claim about social

1124
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:51,135
There's the head of the Stasi

1125
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,415
Is involved in face

1126
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,463
Consult

1127
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:59,327
In the same way that a lot of irons in the fire that isn't just going to focus on one

1128
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:05,727
In the same way that a couple Clips back we heard him to Z like the globalist

1129
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:06,751
Flag

1130
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:10,079
That he does all the f****** time it turns out another one that is done

1131
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:14,943
At least 10 years now has been saved the head of the Stasi is involved in some

1132
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:15,711
He'll getting

1133
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:17,759
On specifically enough

1134
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:20,319
Almost impossible to research

1135
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,343
Personally involved

1136
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,623
Delegates response

1137
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,415
Possibility but he's the one who comes up with

1138
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,183
Project

1139
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:31,839
The former head of the KGB I mean they're really doing

1140
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,143
Going for broke

1141
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,471
And always

1142
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,287
Afghanistan rate Foley

1143
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:48,479
Middle easterners

1144
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:51,295
No I don't think

1145
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:06,911
You know what they're going to do

1146
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,847
You're trying to make up something now

1147
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,175
We're just going to come

1148
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,199
Improv

1149
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:22,527
Right in there and burn your house down burn your farm down

1150
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,111
And they're going to announce on the news

1151
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,159
But they were fighting outside

1152
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,999
Try to call about

1153
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:34,303
URL

1154
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,607
You are the chair

1155
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,679
Take away from

1156
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:40,959
Good idea

1157
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:44,031
That

1158
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,055
Recruit westerners

1159
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,335
Particularly white people

1160
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:48,639
Is that it's actually the globalist

1161
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:51,967
How to make it so everybody suspect everybody

1162
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:52,735
Else

1163
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,015
We are all

1164
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,039
Right

1165
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:58,623
And specifically so they can get the Patriots

1166
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:01,183
And one day Waco them

1167
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:03,231
We want to use that as a verb

1168
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:06,303
Exactly that making just say

1169
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,583
They were Al-Qaeda

1170
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:13,471
We already established it with a new story about how a kite is trying to recruit exactly

1171
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,847
Business

1172
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:25,247
You just made it up on the spot

1173
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:30,367
What do people burn down

1174
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:33,439
That's all I got

1175
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,255
He's trying to speak to a specific community

1176
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,535
Cuz he says you're home

1177
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:39,327
Exactly

1178
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:44,959
A little bit from Fox

1179
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,495
News about

1180
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:47,519
Story

1181
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:48,799
Alex

1182
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,335
Again

1183
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,127
He thinks they're talking about

1184
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,175
And that's very weird

1185
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:55,711
Because when

1186
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:01,855
Most agency officers

1187
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:14,399
Obviously

1188
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:21,055
That's the Holy Grail

1189
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:32,319
Forever

1190
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:36,159
Ben garbage the whole time

1191
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:40,511
We need to listen

1192
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:41,535
But Fox

1193
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,815
Has been

1194
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:43,839
Pile of s***

1195
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:46,655
Consistently

1196
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:47,679
Cuz you need to contact

1197
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:50,495
See what Alex is freaking out about wreck

1198
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,263
Report

1199
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:52,543
But

1200
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:57,151
This is just trying to extend the fear

1201
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,943
They're trying to make the fear bigger

1202
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:02,271
In general

1203
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,295
Completely different

1204
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:11,743
To go into a prison and try to recruit individuals

1205
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:18,911
And then it goes on and on

1206
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:21,215
Just like the FBI training manual say

1207
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,751
White male

1208
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:24,287
Boxes desk

1209
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:26,079
Lot of times it says

1210
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:28,639
Working management

1211
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,431
It's weird

1212
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:32,735
Keep to ourselves ourselves

1213
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:36,319
Evil white males and their Al-Qaeda there every

1214
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,855
We're ladies and gentlemen

1215
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,903
The guy pumping your gas outside

1216
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,207
That schoolteacher Alki

1217
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:47,583
In fact the FBI manual says that preached Al-Qaeda

1218
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:50,655
It's just a Caucasian woman pushing the baby carrier

1219
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:51,423
Al-Qaeda

1220
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:52,703
That's a quote

1221
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:57,311
Everywhere there just

1222
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:12,159
I'm guessing what he's talking about his FBI manuals they talk about

1223
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:12,927
The ascendancy

1224
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:15,743
Terrorism

1225
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,791
So was that white

1226
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:21,887
People do rats are

1227
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:22,911
Yeah

1228
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:24,959
Tamia

1229
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:25,983
I think what he's

1230
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:27,775
Trying to do there

1231
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,311
Invalidate

1232
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:31,871
Any possibility of you calling

1233
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,919
White male domestic terrorism

1234
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:38,527
Preemptively excuse

1235
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:41,599
So whatever your Timothy McVeigh.

1236
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:43,135
He's going to

1237
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:45,951
Conflate the idea of them being terrorists

1238
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:48,255
With the government calling them outside

1239
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:53,887
So it's like these guys are there mentally ill

1240
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,423
Because

1241
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:57,983
If they were terrorists they would have joined Al-Qaeda

1242
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:00,287
Globalist

1243
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,055
Preparing

1244
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:07,455
The ground for you to have your farm burned down and then they say that it was that they were fighting okay. And Isaac

1245
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:12,831
So someone like Timothy McVeigh could blow up the Murrah building

1246
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:14,623
Mexican say

1247
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:17,183
They just get it.

1248
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:23,839
What we're finding

1249
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:24,607
I believe

1250
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,375
Is

1251
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,911
Free decent evidence

1252
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:27,935
That the

1253
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,703
Using

1254
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:30,495
Of white terrorism

1255
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:32,031
And things

1256
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,055
Encroach upon

1257
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,591
Alex's white identity

1258
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:39,455
This is 10 years ago

1259
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:42,783
Very essential piece of his world philosophy

1260
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:47,647
There may be nothing more guns might even be secondary

1261
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,671
White maleness

1262
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:49,951
Yeah absolutely

1263
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:50,719
Very weird

1264
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:52,255
It's not that weird

1265
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:53,535
McDonald's app

1266
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:57,119
Eliza Schuyler

1267
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:05,055
I mean I would say probably is a terrorist Force white people are historically

1268
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:08,127
The there the FrontRunner I would say competent

1269
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:14,527
I would say I was doing some terrorism for a long time

1270
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:19,135
I'd like a report that says that Al-Qaeda is looking for people who can blame

1271
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:21,951
I hear that and I don't take it personally I think

1272
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:24,255
That makes sense

1273
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:27,583
Tyrell Davis

1274
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:32,447
Looking like

1275
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:38,847
If you're a cartoon of a terrorist you're not going

1276
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:44,991
Of course you would look

1277
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:48,319
Alex Garza it takes a very personally as a

1278
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,111
Memes

1279
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:53,695
He is somebody who has said

1280
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,231
In private

1281
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:59,583
Because I don't know if you said it on the show but he said race-traitor

1282
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:02,399
I would imagine I would imagine

1283
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:07,263
If not literally yeah that idea in not so many words

1284
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:12,383
I don't know if he's taking it personally so much as

1285
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:15,199
More on the lines of

1286
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:18,527
I'd like to me what I can hear there is him being like

1287
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:22,623
They're saying that all white people aren't on the same side

1288
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:25,695
His mine

1289
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,999
There's some of that

1290
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,279
Together for some of that

1291
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,815
What do you call the wife

1292
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:35,935
We get to

1293
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:36,703
To deal with

1294
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:37,727
The fact

1295
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:41,311
That's recently when is episode aired

1296
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,335
George

1297
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,103
W bush

1298
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,639
Threw out the first pitch

1299
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,687
At the christening

1300
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:48,735
Are the Washington Nationals

1301
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:49,759
Stadium

1302
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:50,527
Yeah

1303
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:52,575
Apparently

1304
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:54,623
That are playing the brave

1305
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:57,439
And the Braves tried to get him to wear a Braves Jersey

1306
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,975
He said he didn't want to be booed

1307
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:04,095
His contention is that he was mercilessly booed anyway

1308
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:07,935
Replace the audio later it's a mix

1309
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:11,263
Pizza

1310
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:14,335
He plays the audio of it now explains that he's getting like

1311
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,615
Boudin

1312
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:17,151
Piped-in some flaws

1313
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,991
You can tell that it's just a mixed react

1314
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:24,575
Mitch Hedberg

1315
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:27,391
The sound right there's a lot there are Boos for

1316
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:31,487
For sure but they're also people were clearly

1317
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:36,095
Which is what you'd expected apartment baseball stadium

1318
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:38,911
So that's a difference

1319
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:40,959
Is him

1320
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:48,895
Collapse

1321
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:49,919
The 2008

1322
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:54,783
So people weren't even really on on the boo the f*** out of

1323
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:55,551
Gwi

1324
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,319
Not quite yet

1325
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,391
You talked a little bit about that

1326
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:01,439
Let's really ironic

1327
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:03,231
In hindsight considering

1328
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:04,767
What he says about how

1329
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:09,375
Trump is going to save America Trump is basically America's last

1330
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:12,447
Globalist

1331
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,215
What have you

1332
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:15,519
This is very ironic

1333
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:16,543
Years later

1334
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:20,895
I was reading the AP headline here and it says that the Washington Brave tried to get him

1335
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:21,919
From where

1336
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:25,503
Hey Brave Jack and he said oh no they watching me

1337
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:28,831
That's wearing a Nationals

1338
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:32,927
They bowing hilarious if you are an excellent

1339
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:37,279
Announcer just kisses up and just says I like the best he's gone

1340
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:45,215
Got to dig up that Fox News

1341
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:49,567
It's like a martial law have that clip from his second inauguration

1342
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,615
Weather for him

1343
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:55,967
I know that you love

1344
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:59,551
Musica propaganda

1345
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:01,343
You love America don't you

1346
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:09,023
International news

1347
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:11,327
Martial law

1348
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,959
Science fiction movie

1349
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:20,031
For the emperor's driving Turner 12 blue any minute

1350
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:23,615
Vegas going

1351
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:27,199
Now they made a lot of those in 2000

1352
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:30,271
Well everytime from the 1950s

1353
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,551
Now consider

1354
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,319
Yes

1355
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:34,879
Inauguration parade

1356
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:41,791
The cavalcade going down the road

1357
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,095
And Alex Jones screaming

1358
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,375
The people love him

1359
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,935
You get out complete mirror

1360
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:48,959
Consider

1361
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:52,031
The upcoming military parade

1362
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:55,359
Of course

1363
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:56,127
Look

1364
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:57,663
Look at how everybody loves

1365
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:58,431
Who's the president

1366
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:02,271
America our glorious

1367
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:07,135
It's fascinating

1368
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:07,903
The past

1369
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:12,511
Alex about the future

1370
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:15,327
What's going to happen is because

1371
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,375
We keep having these things happen where

1372
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:19,167
Trump says he's a globalist

1373
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,703
And Alex

1374
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:25,311
Trump says I like taking the guns first and then due process later

1375
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:28,127
Alex is like

1376
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:30,943
Whatever any keeps saying like all turn on him

1377
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:33,759
I'll turn on him harder than anybody all this stuff

1378
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:36,063
I think eventually it's going to

1379
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:40,159
Become clear that everyone but Alex has been right the whole time

1380
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:43,999
Eventually Alex will catch up and something will happen that will be too much for her

1381
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:44,767
A handle

1382
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:45,791
And you'll be like

1383
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:49,887
And it'll be like the child

1384
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:52,703
Who thinks that they know what to do and they make a huge mess

1385
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:55,007
70 adults have to be like don't help

1386
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,799
Don't help you're making it worse

1387
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,079
Are the kids trying to

1388
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,871
The cleanup and making more of a mess

1389
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:03,455
Alex Jones is the embodiment of that child who made the mess

1390
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:05,247
Thinks they can help clean up but

1391
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:06,527
We just have to be like

1392
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:07,807
Shut the fuk up

1393
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:08,831
Stay on your

1394
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,111
State go over there

1395
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:11,647
You're in time-out

1396
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:12,927
Centigrade analysis

1397
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:16,767
And he won't listen

1398
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:18,815
Yeah but it only hope

1399
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,607
I don't know

1400
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:21,375
So confused

1401
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:22,655
I don't know how that

1402
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:29,311
I mean prison or the destitute getting sued out of a

1403
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:30,079
To be fun Alex

1404
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:32,383
Yeah

1405
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:33,663
Who starts up a podcast

1406
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:40,831
At Living evidence but it doesn't cost much

1407
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:44,415
I'll be great to get some studio equipment

1408
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:49,279
Speaker

1409
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:59,263
Hyundai move time bedwetting right now I love you

1410
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:01,823
Just just just red diaper Doper baby

1411
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:08,991
Is specifically a Michael Savage catchphrase

1412
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:15,647
Michael Savage leftist a red diaper Doper baby

1413
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,927
I don't like that

1414
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,719
I don't think that makes sense

1415
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:24,607
Has to smoke a lot of weed

1416
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,143
Red diaper Doper baby

1417
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:31,775
Anyway it was a very much

1418
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:34,079
Is it that the term may exist

1419
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,359
Previous to him but

1420
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:37,663
In terms of like radio personalities

1421
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,711
Media Folk

1422
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,503
Images that that's f****** Savage

1423
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:46,623
Rat-a-tat caller called in and asked about Michael Savage and Alex is very wishy-washy on whether he's

1424
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:48,415
Support them at this point

1425
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,183
You clearly listen

1426
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:50,975
He's ripping off his phrases

1427
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:52,767
The show called red diaper

1428
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,559
For babies that was

1429
01:09:56,095 --> 01:10:00,447
Vegenation

1430
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:04,799
Yeah

1431
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:11,455
I would watch it I would

1432
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:16,575
A Rugrats was actually communist propaganda

1433
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:18,623
The twolegs are you always

1434
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:19,391
Stalin

1435
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:23,231
He's actually very short

1436
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:23,999
Yeah

1437
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:26,815
You would be most of his mustache

1438
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:27,583
Depraved

1439
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:28,351
Compared to the Muppet

1440
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:32,191
How do you know are babies

1441
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:41,919
Alex wants to talk all about how the government stealing your blood

1442
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:43,455
Brace

1443
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,223
Where do they

1444
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:47,295
I will tell you exactly where she comes from in a minute

1445
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:51,903
Alex their interview is all about how government stealing your blood

1446
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:53,439
This is something we covered on

1447
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,463
Show in

1448
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:58,047
Passed so I don't want to belabor it too much

1449
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:00,863
But the reason is that there are

1450
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,399
Diseases that need to

1451
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:03,679
Bored

1452
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:05,471
And also

1453
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,823
You know it comes down to

1454
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:14,431
Another one of these like you're not that crazy kind of arguments

1455
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,455
About privacy

1456
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:20,063
But in almost every state they take any identifiers off

1457
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:26,463
Blood not like their coding all of your genomes and everything to create a

1458
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,999
Database

1459
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:30,559
Not a

1460
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:34,655
Personal

1461
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:36,703
Database of DNA in the

1462
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,495
You can find friends

1463
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:39,775
Correlations

1464
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:41,567
Between genetic markers

1465
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,591
4 things

1466
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:45,151
Do you have the more Act

1467
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:48,479
You're able to save people from

1468
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,295
Generally speaking

1469
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:52,319
There are

1470
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,111
Success stories from

1471
01:11:56,671 --> 01:12:01,023
Anyway I find interesting about it is that the interview

1472
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:03,839
To say the name of the organization the Twila brace works

1473
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:07,935
Miss brace why don't you and the nutshell

1474
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:10,239
Tell us about yourself and your credentials

1475
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:13,823
How you got into this and what your organization does little get into the blood

1476
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:15,871
Sure thanks so much

1477
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:20,479
Our organization has been around for about 12 years

1478
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:21,247
And

1479
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:24,831
Beaufort

1480
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,367
Newborn

1481
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:28,927
Are they at that privacy really allows you to give

1482
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:31,999
So anyway she's just hasn't boring shitt

1483
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,815
Like I said we've gone over this

1484
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:35,839
Entire narrative

1485
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:37,375
Nothing that she says

1486
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:41,215
When I was like maybe like all that's a new it's all the same

1487
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:42,751
This is actually almost

1488
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:44,287
Undoubtedly

1489
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,055
This narrative

1490
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:45,823
Interview

1491
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:46,591
What organism

1492
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:48,383
Well I don't know

1493
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:52,479
Men overall organizational lot of privacy issues but give us

1494
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:57,343
The skinny on what they're doing

1495
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,623
To talk about the blood

1496
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:01,439
Don't say the name of the organization

1497
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:05,023
When it's time to like

1498
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:05,791
Plugs

1499
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:06,559
What happened

1500
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:09,631
Because everybody knows who she is

1501
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:11,167
Who she works or no

1502
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,447
I don't know

1503
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:13,983
You think I don't know why

1504
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:16,543
Purposeful that they're avoiding the

1505
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:19,359
I don't necessarily think that that would be paranoid of me to pick

1506
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:25,503
I think Alex or something like that or something like that

1507
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:29,087
Occam's razor tells me it's bad broadcasting

1508
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:31,903
Play up front

1509
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,951
Until much later in the interview

1510
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:37,535
Organization that she works for is called the

1511
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:38,559
Council for health care

1512
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:42,399
Okay good cuz if it was the n-double-acp I would have been on

1513
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,167
No

1514
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:44,703
Is that what you work for

1515
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:48,031
Is a tea partier from Minnesota

1516
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:52,383
Interesting already

1517
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:58,015
Minnesota goes by the name of Ted

1518
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:58,783

Communications net worth

1520
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:02,367
Probably probably coincidence I have nothing

1521
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,135
The two of them

1522
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:03,903
Together but

1523
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:04,927
It's interesting

1524
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:10,303
For healthcare should tell you was a member of the state policy Network

1525
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:11,583
Remember Oregon

Which is received significant money from the Koch brothers

1529
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,727
As well as from the

The Claudette are lamp

1531
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:23,615
What about Coke Family Foundation

1532
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,407
They're so

1533
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,175
Evil in there

1534
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,199
Everywhere

1535
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:28,479
Hold on

1536
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:31,295
Everyone is more to the story

1537
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,575
The donations

1538
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:35,135

1558
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,975
Extrapolating the specific amount

1559
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:13,791
Yeah I don't know what I don't know how to explain that

1560
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:15,327
Extrapolate

1561
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:16,351
Mark of the beast

1562
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:20,191
Probably it's pretty safe to assume that they funneled a ton more money

1563
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:22,239
See an outlet store

1564
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:23,775
Benfica

1565
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,055

From organization called

1570
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:33,247
There's two organizations

1571
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,271
The donors Trust

1572
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,295
Any donors capital

1573
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:37,343
These are water called

1574
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:38,367
Donor-advised

1575
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:42,719
Spawns which means that's fun create separate accounts for individual donors

1576
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:45,791
And the daughters then recommend disbursements from the account

1577
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:47,071
The different non-profit

1578
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:49,887
It cloaks the identity of the original mystery donors

1579
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:51,935
The funds have been distributed in the name

1580
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:54,751
All donors trust or donors Capital fund

1581
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:57,823
A Coke Family Foundation called knowledge and progress

2007-2010

1584
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,735
But because of the setup attempt

1585
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:06,271
Possible to know where those buns

1586
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:10,367
Cloak money from these two funds were funneled to at least 51s

1587

The Heartland Institute is basically an organization that's just there to Stowe.

1600
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:39,551
Heartland also has received significant donations from the coke

1601
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:41,087
And their foundations

1602
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:45,695
For instance the donors trust donors Capital fund

1603
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:47,231
Heartland between 2000

Why the braces writer for cnsnews

Mostly writing anti-obamacare article

1613
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:11,295
This is a conservative news Research Center

1614
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:14,111
One of the media research Center's main f****** is

1615
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:14,879
ExxonMobil

1616
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:18,207
Also the Richard and tell him DeVos Foundation

1617
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:24,607
The parents of Betsy DeVos and Erik Prince Blackwater

1618
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:25,631
Terry Bradley found a

1619
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:26,655
Another major

1620
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:27,423
Conservative

1621
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:30,495
Sound

1622
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:34,591
Like these weird out at dark money thing

1623
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:36,127
Also

1624
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:39,967
Twilight

1625
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:43,807
People real early party activist

1626
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:48,927
I campaigned aggressively against Obamacare

1627
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:54,047
And if you don't roll them you'll never happen we can all fight this by just not doing it

1628
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:56,095
Koch brothers Americans

1629
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:58,911
For Prosperity spent millions of dollars fighting Obamacare

1630
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:00,191
The tea party was almost a

1631
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:01,727
Entirely bankrolled by the coax

1632
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:02,495
Through the American

1633
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:04,031
Prosperity

1634
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:04,799
Foundation

1635
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:06,079
What used to be the same organ

1636
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:08,639
Relation that was called the citizens for a sound economy

1637
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:10,431
Started by the Koch brothers in

1638
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:11,455
84

1639
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:12,479
So

1640
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:16,063
All roads lead back to the coke

1641
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:17,343
Monsters

1642
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:23,743
This is something that we're going to experience very frequently with Alex Jones as guest back in 2008

1643
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:24,511
Yeah

1644
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:25,791
I don't know what like

1645
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:28,351
I want to meet these guys

1646
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:31,167
And I want to just find out what it is they ask

1647
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:33,215
Cuz

1648
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:37,311
I don't know if they believe they're just like

1649
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:41,407
Sociopathic monsters that they're like

1650
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:43,199
Any amount of money

1651
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:47,039
To completely dismantle anything that isn't

1652
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:49,855
What seems like a deregulation

1653
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:54,719
Super heavily because their main business

1654
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,511
As they were coming

1655
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:57,279
Two prominent

1656
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:58,047
Royal

1657
01:18:59,071 --> 01:18:59,839
It seems like

1658
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:01,375
Wilton wings

1659
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:04,191
Involves government deregulation

1660
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:07,007
What I see from all of their stuff though

1661
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:07,775
Is

1662
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:08,799
Like

1663
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,591
Secondarily

1664
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:11,615
I think it's business

1665
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:13,407
You know they just want

1666
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:17,759
Any possibility of a regulator

1667
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:24,159
Just sowing chaos I think it's much more Insidious than that in that

1668
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:25,439
They are

1669
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:29,791
Less interested in the business and more interested in just like this

1670
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:32,095
Vague concept of impunity

1671
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:35,167
Like I want to be able to do

1672
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:36,191
Control

1673
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:37,727
Whatever

1674
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:38,751
I want

1675
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:40,799
Whenever

1676
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:41,823
Sleet

1677
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:44,895
Desire for autonomy in all things

1678
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:45,919
Noah

1679
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:47,455
Can say I

1680
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:50,783
Is there only ideology

1681
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:57,183
Interesting thought and I think as we go along we'll learn more and as we go along.

1682
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:00,767
More opportunities for us to get into

1683
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:03,583
What what indications

1684
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:08,191
But at this point we can say it's suspicious

1685
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:12,799
When listing Americans who are deeply involved with a Nazi somehow Fred Coke

1686
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:14,592
Is not involved in that list

1687
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:17,408
And habitually isn't for Alex Jones

1688
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:19,968
It's interesting that Alex Jones

1689
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:23,552
And this isn't the only example

1690
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:25,088
Multiple multiple times

1691
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:28,416
Yeah Alex Jones has a guest on who's essentially just

1692
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:30,976
Works for Coke front group

1693
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:31,744
I think

1694
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:37,632
So I think we're going to see a ton of that I think we're going to see a lot of these people that are

1695
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:38,656
Rrr

1696
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,704
People who are on Alex's show

1697
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:42,240
Donald Trump

1698
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:46,848
So that's exciting

1699
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:51,968
We're never going to ever going to win

1700
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:53,504
Evil this point

1701
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,808
I don't think that there is

1702
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:56,832
Strong

1703
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,368
Parallel

1704
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:01,440
Or anything like that

1705
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:05,280
There's a lot of Coke

1706
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,048
Connections

1707
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:06,816
A lot of

1708
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:12,960
So

1709
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:14,496
The the

1710
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:18,080
The most common idea behind

1711
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:19,360
Is this like Darkman

1712
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:22,432
They know that they're doing something

1713
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:23,712
Evil

1714
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:26,016
And they are hiding it because

1715
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:28,320
That's how you get away with doing evil

1716
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:29,344
Bulshit

1717
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:32,672
This idea of like

1718
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,208
Because I'm anonymous

1719
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,232
I can do whatever I

1720
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:40,864
Because I will hide behind different organizations

1721
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:45,472
Doing whatever the f*** it is I want these people are

1722
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:47,264
Are carrying it out for me

1723
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:52,128
I agree with

1724
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:55,200
I agree with you the bed does

1725
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:56,736
To be the modus operandi

1726
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:59,296
But I want to be cleared

1727
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:00,320
Because we're going to

1728
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:03,136
Pretty speculative

1729
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:06,464
I don't in the same way that I don't think of that

1730
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:07,232
Commercial

1731
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:12,864
About Israeli tourism proves The Alex Jones works for Israel

1732
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,168
Right

1733
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:16,960
The fact that Alex

1734
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:19,520
You know on

1735
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:21,056
On some coke tip

1736
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:23,872
I don't think that mr. Lee means

1737
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:24,896
He works for them

1738
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:26,688
Wright's just weird

1739
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,248
Again that's not even

1740
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:31,296
Comparison between

1741
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:32,320
I'm just saying this.

1742
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,088
Improve anything

1743
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,112
It's just

1744
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:37,696
It got my ears up

1745
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:41,536
Anyway it was nice quote we learn that Twilight

1746
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:42,816
Probably belongs

1747
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,864
Hope program

1748
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,632
Not just

1749
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:49,216
Parents

1750
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:50,496
It's about cost

1751
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,032
Prevention

1752
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:54,080
And I think

1753
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,360
You know it's good for your lips

1754
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:56,896
To let that roll around

1755
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:57,664
Their brain

1756
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,432
A little bit

1757
01:22:58,688 --> 01:22:59,456
Because

1758
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:00,736
And prevent

1759
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:02,272
Likely

1760
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:03,040
Queen means

1761
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:04,320
That we don't want

1762
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:06,624
Perfect

1763
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:07,904
And we worry about the

1764
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:08,928
Today where is it

1765
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:10,464
Child

1766
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,768
Fist into Define

1767
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:13,536
Imperfection

1768
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:15,072
And it will be

1769
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:16,352
Part of whether or not you

1770
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:17,376
Married

1771
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:18,400
Whether or not you should have

1772
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,168
Children

1773
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,192
So Gattaca

1774
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:21,984
Well I better just described

1775
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:29,920
Absurdity of that play

1776
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:34,016
Look at it another way

1777
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:34,784
Is

1778
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:35,808
They cost

1779
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:37,088
Prevention

1780
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,904
Is indicative of

1781
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,208
Freebirth

1782
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,744
Or very early

1783
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,280
We're able to treat it

1784
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:47,840
There are serapis that we can use

1785
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:49,376
But if we don't

1786
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:51,168
You will have a handicapped person

1787
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:53,728
For the rest of their life will require

1788
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:55,264
Expensive medical bills

1789
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,288
Or like with

1790
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:57,824
50 homeless population

1791
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:58,592
And if they have

1792
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:00,384
Homes they're far more likely to

1793
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,152
To wind up

1794
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:02,432
Banner Hospital

1795
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,200
0

1796
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:04,736
Bringing up

1797
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:07,808
S*** tons of bills that you eventually wind up how

1798
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:13,952
There are ways to measures are more effective

1799
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:15,232
Always

1800
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:18,560
Costco

1801
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:19,840
Action or something like that

1802
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:21,120
In a really

1803
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:25,216
And there's a way to look at it

1804
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:26,496
In the ways that people mean

1805
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:28,800
Brett and they're not the same

1806
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:31,104
So anyway it just seems to me like

1807
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:31,872
Cheese

1808
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:32,896
She perfect

1809
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:33,664
Just good fit

1810
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:34,432
The show

1811
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:35,456
But also

1812
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:36,224
Boring

1813
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:39,040
Alex Jones in 2008

1814
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:39,808
Pretty boring

1815
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:48,512
I'm not enjoying wasn't she doesn't scream that much

1816
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:51,072
Nonchalantly

1817
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:52,096
Taking most of the calls

1818
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:56,192
Yeah so far

1819
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:58,752
Alex Jones

1820
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,032
A subsection

1821
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,312
Compressor

1822
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:06,944
1528

1823
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:07,968
Paragraph babe

1824
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,016
Yes

1825
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:13,344
I can tell that I have missed something and all my research

1826
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:14,368
Sure have

1827
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:18,976
Paragraphs

1828
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:21,536
Again

1829
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:24,096
We discuss this over and over again

1830
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:30,240
That's the subsection that he uses to justify his belief in chemtrails

1831
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:33,056
Paragraphs

1832
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:35,616
Which is right after paragraph be that he cites

1833
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:37,920
I said that informed consent

1834
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:39,968
Is required for all of those

1835
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:41,760
And

1836
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,088
Blood stopped

1837
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:46,624
Location for

1838
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:47,648
Chemtrails

1839
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:48,672
Nothing

1840
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:51,488
Is just talkingshit because he memorized something that he can

1841
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:53,792
I'm confused people

1842
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,072
It's very much

1843
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:55,840
The

1844
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:00,448
Between the two leg like

1845
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:03,264
I see you big things

1846
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,032
Two buckets

1847
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:06,336
Of how much water you're putting into each

1848
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:08,896
Each one is how much more important

1849
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:09,664
You think one is the

1850
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:14,784
The paragraph bead has all of the water in it

1851
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:18,368
Requires informed

1852
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:19,136
Consent

1853
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:19,904
To him

1854
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,184
That's just like

1855
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,464
Do they have to

1856
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,232
To put that in

1857
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:25,792
And then they'll manufacture your inform

1858
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:27,072
Consent later on

1859
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:30,656
Like that's always his idea is

1860
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:34,752
So if you have any kind of if you have any kind of thing

1861
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:37,312
And then you have a regulation on it

1862
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:39,616
The regulation is a lie

1863
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:46,016
Even if it's like just as regulations

1864
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:47,296
Don oil company

1865
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,064
Climate

1866
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:48,832
Changing all that

1867
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:50,112
Are manufactured

1868
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:51,392
To destroy

1869
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:53,440
The very thing that they're supposed to

1870
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:57,280
So is the regulation on V evil ship

1871
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:58,560
That they say

1872
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:02,656
Really something that there for them to destroy whatever it is

1873
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:09,824
Any qualifying Clause is too complicated for a

1874
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:10,848
Ignore it

1875
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:11,872
It's probably there

1876
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:13,664
Exactly

1877
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:17,504
Earlier we heard that I was Jose advertising for tourism to Israel

1878
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:19,552
What else is the advertiser

1879
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:22,112

1932
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:12,096
So I was like there's no f****** way we can do this episode and I can allow that teaser Togo's on

Yes is that Alex is at in the fourth hour

1938
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:34,880

Throwing that in

1957
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:31,616
Old old stereotype of country boy

1958
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:33,152

1975
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,336
Play music

1976
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:37,920
Music here play some jams

1977
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:39,200
I would

1978
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:45,856
I think the world would be better if you would have just gotten on a different format creation

1979
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:50,464
Unlike the old country hits

1980
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:53,792
And on the side

1981
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:58,144
45 minutes of non-stop hits

1982
01:33:58,656 --> 01:34:03,776
With some stuffing and then his in his is like intercutting just like

1983
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:07,360
From Waylon Jennings

1984
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:08,896
The government did 9/11

1985
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:11,712

1986
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:15,552
I think eyes are going to love this

1987
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:17,856
Government

1988
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:21,952
You're not going to get 45 minutes

1989
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:23,744
A great

1990
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,352
Radio format would be him listening to music and screaming over it

1991
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:34,752
Getting real Intuit

1992
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:37,312
And I would really enjoy that I maybe I

1993
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:39,616
Throwed

1994
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:41,920
Revolutionize DJ

1995
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:45,760
Quite frankly like a time when you needed

1996
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:50,624
Coming to Providence

1997
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:55,232
He's right when Clear Channel was taking over all these like to install a dating

1998
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:56,768
You're saying is that Alex Jones

1999
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:00,096
Could have been the next

2000
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:01,888
Kool herc

2001
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:04,704
He's never going to play Urban Music

2002
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:11,104
He could have been a weakened Revolution idj like he could have done

2003
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:11,872
Whitby

2004
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:13,408
Like obviously

2005
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:16,480
We can't take away from him his creativity

2006
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:18,272
The b******* that he spends

2007
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,624
If you could direct that creativity towards

2008
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,672
A more benign format

2009
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:25,696
You could get

2010
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:29,792
Fascinator

2011
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:31,328
Anti-semite

He doesn't really have a rematch of course we have no idea

2014
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:44,128
All the game show host

01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:07,936
Richard Oliver

2020
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:12,544
He wasn't ever in the center Square on the match game now

2021
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:17,152
God dammit I sure wasn't Charles Nelson Reilly know it wasn't

2022
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:17,920
Charles Nelson

2023
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:21,504
It's going to kill me

2024
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:24,832
I'm going to look it up how to better life

2025
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:27,648

Possibility

2029
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:33,536
On this episode

2030
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:36,608
But this next clip is really interesting considering that Alex

2031
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:38,912
In present-day has said that he had sex with

2032
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:43,776
200 women by the time he was sixteen or so

2033
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:46,080
Hear this clip in context

2034
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:46,848
With that

2035
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:49,920
Women in lasting a

2036
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:50,688
A diamond like a

2037
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:53,760
Unhappily wishing I could have them all

2038
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:56,832
You know that feeling that

2039
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:57,856
Anxiousness

2040
01:36:58,880 --> 01:36:59,648
Comanches Gorge

01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:00,672

Now

2045
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:10,400
I've developed to the point where I don't even

2046
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:14,752
Women I mean I do but but

2047
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:16,800
A smaller part of my psyche

2048
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:18,848
I just admire their beef

2049
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:24,736
By sharing it

2050
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:31,136
And it's not even sexually not explain its LOL

2051
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:35,232

01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:38,816

2054
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:49,312
Things on planet but I didn't get into this news first here

2055
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:51,872
What the f***

2056
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:58,016
I appreciate women on a different level than any of you can ever understand

2057
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:05,184
Of course

2058
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:07,232
Women's Beauty

2059
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:08,000

2060
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:12,352
Experience at

2061
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:14,400
I think what he's trying to say is I have

2062
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:16,448
Nobody's trying to say

2063
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:17,216
I think

2064
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:20,032
That was him putting up the bat signal for someone to

2065
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:22,336
To create superbells Italian

2066
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:28,992
I mean I think I think

2067
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:35,136
It's just not as interested maybe there's not enough variety

2068
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:36,672
Difficult

2069
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:39,232
Now we could be cool

2070
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:42,304
I think that there is a I think there's a way that a smart person

2071
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:48,448
Could express similar things to what he say

2072
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:51,264
All-encompassing lost

2073
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,824
For women in Israel

2074
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:56,384
Set alarm to an understanding of people's Humanity

2075
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:59,968
A little bit more than you had when puberty was going on alright

2076
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:00,992
I think there's

2077
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:02,016
Possibly

2078
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:03,040
Something in there

2079
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:03,808
This is

2080
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:06,880
Completely contradictory to his story of

2081
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:07,648
Having sex

2082
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:09,696
251

2083
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:13,024
I mean that was before he could share in their Butte

2084
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:14,304
Ofl

2085
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:16,608
No just tell him to work

2086
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:20,704
If that wasn't what he saying worth

2087
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:23,520
No

2088
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:24,288
Siri

2089
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:27,616
Keller writes in their diary

2090
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:30,688
Before they strangle and rape women

2091
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:34,272
He's a f****** that's an insane person

2092
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:39,136
I don't I don't think it's as crazy

2093
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:42,208
Not like the actual content of it

2094
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:45,792
Think is that crazy able to appreciate women

2095
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:47,328
Beauty in a non lost

2096
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:48,096
Away

2097
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:49,888
Is I think what he's trying to

2098
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:50,656
Express

2099
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:53,984
Again I'm gay

2100
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:56,032
I'm reading contacts

2101
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:58,848
Blues and I think that's what he's trying to say

2102
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,128
Look look

2103
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:00,896
Nobody

2104
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:03,712
Nobody on this planet right now I feel

2105
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:07,296
Is more in tune with the way Alex's brain works

2106
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:09,600
Probably so I'm going to lean on you for the

2107
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:13,440
Alex Alex

2108
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:19,584
Still getting accustomed to it right still have to get my sea legs as it were about this crazy thing.

2109
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:22,912
Cuz what I hear is there somebody

2110
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:24,448
No no

2111
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:32,896
By the way this is a great and save the person I was thinking of was Paul Lynde

2112
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:35,968
Call Linda

2113
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:37,504
Shadoe Stevens

2114
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:41,344
Matter

2115
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,880
I posted

2116
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:43,904
Interested in the fact

2117
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:45,184
Exactly

2118
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:45,952
Is funny

2119
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:47,488
In conflict

2120
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:48,512
With Alex

2121
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:50,048
His claims of

2122
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:54,656
First of all right having sex

2123
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:56,960
250 women Battlefield

2124
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:57,984
Because

2125
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:01,312
Because he wouldn't Express things that way if it was also like

2126
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:02,592
You be like

2127
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:04,896
When I was 18 I felt this

2128
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:05,664
This

2129
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:07,968
This unrequited lust

2130
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:09,760
Towards women

2131
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:11,296
Could be with them but I could

2132
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:14,368
Well that's good

2133
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,648
Had already been

2134
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:16,416
No

2135
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:17,952
It's not fair

2136
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,768
Is this f****** make sense

2137
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:21,792
I'm confused

2138
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:23,840
I don't know what he's trying to

2139
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:26,400
That is though

2140
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:29,216
But like behavior in that

2141
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:30,496
Insofar as

2142
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:33,824
It is always a manipulation of his past

2143
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:36,128
Is to support his present narrative

2144
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:37,408
Right so

2145
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:38,688
Whenever he wants

2146
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:39,456
To be like

2147
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:42,272
I'm the manly man you can respect me cuz I

2148
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:48,672
Then he's like I already had sex with everybody everybody that you've ever wanted to have sex with

2149
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:50,976
Don't bother I got it

2150
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:51,744
Already

2151
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:55,328
But when the narrative is

2152
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,608
You know I am

2153
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:58,400
I actually don't even know why he's

2154
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:00,448
You saying that

2155
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:04,032
There's no reason for that right there's no prior context but psycho

2156
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:13,504
Was f****** going on the intro to that what came right before it was his talking

2157
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,552
He was talking about like

2158
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:17,344
Having money isn't bad

2159
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,136
But having money be all you

2160
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:20,160
You care about

2161
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:21,184
Is bad

2162
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:24,256
Towards the Lost

2163
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:25,024
For women

2164
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:26,304
Right but it's

2165
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:27,072
Still doesn't

2166
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:28,352
It doesn't like

2167
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:29,632
Me telling you that

2168
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:31,680
Doesn't give this property

2169
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:36,544
Recently

2170
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:41,152
It's between that talking about money and him getting into the

2171
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:43,456
Long pause where he's clearly

2172
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:46,528
But yes I don't know man again

2173
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:50,112
Feel of like

2174
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:51,392
All the sudden

2175
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:53,184
All of his previous

2176
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:54,976
Lies and

2177
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:56,512
And bulshit just like

2178
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:59,840
Catch up to him for a moment and he's just this Berry

2179
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:01,376
Open an honest person

2180
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:02,144
Telling

2181
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:04,704
Way more than he wants you

2182
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:09,312
Interesting people in the world to talk to

2183
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:10,592
Because I think he has a

2184
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:11,872
Perspective that no one can

2185
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:12,896
Can possibly imagine

2186
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:15,712
Write like the idea of lying for 20 years

2187
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:18,784
But even if he actually believes that the global is

2188
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:19,808
Exist

2189
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:21,856
He has to know that he's lying about a lot of

2190
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:22,880
Of other stuff

2191
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:26,464
In order to reinforce that narrative

2192
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:27,232
Himself

2193
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:28,768
And has the cognitive dissonance

2194
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:29,792
What's involved to be like

2195
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:34,144
Well I'm lying about this tiny detail but it's only because it reinforces the

2196
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:37,728
The bigger thing that I believe is true

2197
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:40,032
Anything in service to the larger

2198
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:45,408
To solve the larger problem

2199
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:48,736
Isaac wants it all collapse

2200
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:50,272
Pinky probably live

2201
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:51,296
Incredibly it

2202
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:52,064
In perspective

2203
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,600
That I will go to

2204
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:54,368
Prison

2205
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:55,392
And interview him

2206
01:43:55,648 --> 01:44:01,280
For my forthcoming novel

2207
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:06,400
Try try and make

2208
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:07,936
Peace with my

2209
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:09,472
Evil twin

2210
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:11,264
In this next

2211
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:13,056
Clip

2212
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:14,080
Clip

2213
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:14,848
What's Jones

2214
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:17,920
But you said earlier this is before

2215
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:21,504
Entirely collapse

2216
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:23,552
Like full-on financial crisis

2217
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:25,856
They come to the end of 2008

2218
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:29,952
You thought

2219
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:32,256
You are excited for Avengers 3

2220
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:36,096
The sequel to the 2008 financial crash

2221
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:37,888
Is going to be

2222
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:42,752
Huge hearing Alex made over a billion dollars

2223
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:44,544
We're going to lose over 2 trillion

2224
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:49,408
Incredible Alex is rhetoric as that

2225
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:56,064
Because it's going to coincide with the rise of a child's face

2226
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:57,856
Obama's fault he's running for

2227
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:01,952
Here in this last clip

2228
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:02,720
Talking

2229
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:04,512
Sing about

2230
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:07,840
And they're getting

2231
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:11,168
Total nazi-like power over all the other banking

2232
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:11,936
And lending

2233
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:13,728
And brother chocolate Usha

2234
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:18,592
Weatherall

2235
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:23,968
And then I'll offer the next solution as

2236
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:26,528
Kind of like one of those traps

2237
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:28,320
The more you struggle the tire gets

2238
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:29,856
And they're just always there

2239
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:33,696
When I'm your friend never mind my hands around your neck there you go

2240
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:34,720
There you go

2241
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:40,096
I love you so much

2242
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:40,864
Ma

2243
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:44,448
Just helping your net just wiped

2244
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:45,472
Bring some standoff

2245
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:49,312
Don't you mind that

2246
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:54,944
Yes

2247
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:57,504
So that

2248
01:45:58,528 --> 01:45:59,040
Not

2249
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:04,160
Like this Alex I feel like I could go out and have a conversation with

2250
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:09,280
Yep because that like with the cobra

2251
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:11,328
They have the center for Freedom progress

2252
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:12,608
Witches Library

2253
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:17,472
Games for progress

2254
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:20,800
We're helping you

2255
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:24,896
There's a there's a point there that

2256
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:28,224
If I could just like twists

2257
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:31,808
Globalist

2258
01:46:32,064 --> 01:46:34,112
They are General you're right

2259
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:35,392
What

2260
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:40,768
You're just wrong about how and who and why they're entrenched

2261
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:41,536
To listen to you

2262
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:47,936
Because no no no

2263
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:52,032
Is an example of the Broken Clock being right twice a day

2264
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:56,640
We know because of history that the financial crash

2265
01:46:56,896 --> 01:46:57,408
Is coming

2266
01:46:57,664 --> 01:46:58,688
Right now it's

2267
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:01,760
Doing what he does all the time because he works

2268
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:02,784
Oregairu

2269
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:03,808
Who sells gold

2270
01:47:04,064 --> 01:47:07,904
Which is warning people and saying everything is going to f****** collapse

2271
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:13,792
It's not like this is the only time he said it and he's f****** right that this is what's coming

2272
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,328
Just 88

2273
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:16,864
Just what he does all day

2274
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:18,656
Time it just so happens

2275
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:20,960
Bit after this

2276
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:21,728
It did happen

2277
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:26,336
And if you're playing me like everything is going to crash eventually

2278
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:31,200
You just say it over and over and over again it's coming

2279
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:34,016
That's what's so weird about now

2280
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:38,112
Are you saying that everything is going to turn around and

2281
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:38,880
And a crash

2282
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:46,816
He's saying it's going to crash but it's going to because of the globalist

2283
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:54,752
It is not because

2284
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:57,312
About the bank

2285
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:58,592
Ready

2286
01:47:58,848 --> 01:47:59,360
But because it

2287
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:00,384
It's a good demonstration

2288
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:01,920
Even ten years ago Alex

2289
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:02,944
Still really

2290
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:06,528
He's still really gross

2291
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:08,064
He is

2292
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:10,624
Deep into those weird fantasies where he's

2293
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,392
Playing it out

2294
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:13,184
You

2295
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:16,512
I bet you can even know this

2296
01:48:18,048 --> 01:48:21,376
But even back in about

2297
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:23,936
Like its current version of it is

2298
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:27,776
More animated and exterior this is just sort of like

2299
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:30,080
He's not even committing

2300
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:33,408
Like

2301
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:36,224
Details of how they're taking you through the back

2302
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:45,184
They have a gurney down there they got your why wouldn't they have

2303
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,744
Keep Gurney's in their basements

2304
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,864
Gurnee they're going to have your kid blood

2305
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:59,264
Cuz they're going to make it

2306
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:02,336
Get high on your children's blood

2307
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:07,456
You have even more adrenochrome

2308
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:12,320
So I mean look we've come to the end of the first episode of the 2008 investigation

2309
01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:13,600
And we've learned a lot

2310
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:20,000
I'll be perfectly honest with you like I have mentioned this along the way a little

2311
01:49:20,256 --> 01:49:21,792
I think it Bears repeating

2312
01:49:22,048 --> 01:49:24,096
2000's more boring

2313
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:25,376
Then current day

2314
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:27,168
Mostly because he wasn't

2315
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:28,192
Icons

2316
01:49:28,448 --> 01:49:29,472
Italy in a state of being press

2317
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:34,336
Against the wall and a caged animal

2318
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:35,872
Like it has the back to the wall

2319
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:37,920
He is f******

2320
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:40,224
Screaming about anything and everything

2321
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:44,320
Easier Road a hoe

2322
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:50,208
He has theirs got money coming in from the Israeli tourists important

2323
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:56,608
People are donating cuz of his dumb documentaries that we had early to punch me out and he has a comfortable

2324
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:58,912
Existence like I said he's still married to

2325
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:00,192
The Kelly at this point

2326
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:04,544
Infowars is a small operation with only a few employees

2327
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:07,104
Have a ton of overhead but it's an independent

2328
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:12,480
He doesn't have to worry about about

2329
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:15,040
There's that there's so much going on about his life

2330
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:18,112
Listen to Country Boy

2331
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:23,488
And have a great time with it and then get into whatever he wants

2332
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:25,792
Whatever narratives he wants to spend

2333
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:27,072
And he's he's

2334
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:27,840
He's living it

2335
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:32,192
You know you do hear some of that like

2336
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:33,472
I'm sure he

2337
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:34,752
He feels like he's getting

2338
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:36,288
Complacent he's not

2339
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:38,592
Fulfilling his ambition

2340
01:50:38,848 --> 01:50:39,616
In the same way

2341
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:46,784
He feels the way that he takes those calls are just like

2342
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:51,648
Yeah sure there's a f****** helicopter are you

2343
01:50:54,208 --> 01:51:00,352
He's dismissive his f****** colors all the time

2344
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:03,168
But

2345
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:06,496
The only thing that's important about that talking caller is not his

2346
01:51:08,544 --> 01:51:09,056
Naive

2347
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:10,592
Dismissal

2348
01:51:10,848 --> 01:51:12,640
That he is irresponsible invite

2349
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:13,920
Not helping them

2350
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:17,504
Bedford

2351
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:19,040
What's going on with that

2352
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:20,576
Friends

2353
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:21,856
So I think

2354
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:28,000
In time the singles group

2355
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:29,536
Right you need to meet up

2356
01:51:35,168 --> 01:51:36,448
OkCupid

2357
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:41,312
Harmony was around

2358
01:51:41,824 --> 01:51:44,384
Kim Trail blogger wouldn't you bring up the subsection with him

2359
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:45,408
That's good question

2360
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:50,272
I know I think I think in time we're going to discover things that are

2361
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:51,296
Much more

2362
01:51:51,552 --> 01:51:53,856
Concrete at this point we have

2363
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:54,880
The beginning

2364
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:55,904
Indication

2365
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:00,512
I don't know why

2366
01:52:01,024 --> 01:52:03,328
I don't know what

2367
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:04,608
Here's the here's the thing

2368
01:52:05,376 --> 01:52:07,168
Whitney 2015 invest

2369
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:09,472
Navigation we had a concrete thing in my

2370
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:10,752
And that was

2371
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:13,312
What about

2372
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:15,360
Trump

2373
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:16,384
Announces Canada

2374
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:18,944
Install what happens from there

2375
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:21,504
Here this is so much more open-ended

2376
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:22,528
Because

2377
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:25,600
The Tea Party doesn't quite exist yet

2378
01:52:25,856 --> 01:52:27,648
The primaries aren't hot yet

2379
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:29,184
We're laying a lot of con

2380
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:34,560
We're getting indication

2381
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:36,608
The case I think

2382
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:37,632
This invest

2383
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:39,168
Applications going to be

2384
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:42,496
We don't I don't know what we're going to find

2385
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:47,872
I don't know where we're going to enjoy it a lot of people who might not be the target

2386
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:50,176
Play quick with Alex

2387
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:56,576
Back in this time what I'm hearing is working to get all of these kind of different Waypoint starting

2388
01:52:56,832 --> 01:52:57,344
To generate

2389
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,136
Yeah and

2390
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:05,280
And so what we're going to find what we've already

2391
01:53:05,536 --> 01:53:07,840
Clearly comes from Twila brace who works

2392
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:09,376
For a Coke funded

2393
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:10,400
Put that's what I'm saying

2394
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:14,496
That's what we're going to find here is all of these

2395
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:16,544
Sources

2396
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:19,872
And how it is that they are affecting

2397
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:20,896
His worldview now

2398
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:25,504
Yeah that's what I'm interested in this investigation is like

2399
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:28,064
How is it that this guy who is

2400
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:29,344
Hey

2401
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:30,112
Just

2402
01:53:30,368 --> 01:53:30,880
Like

2403
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:31,904
Again

2404
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:33,952
Right in the wrong way

2405
01:53:35,488 --> 01:53:38,560
Sprite how did this guy turn into the weird

2406
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:39,584
Monster

2407
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:40,608
That

2408
01:53:40,864 --> 01:53:42,656
Is just an unhinged

2409
01:53:43,424 --> 01:53:45,216
Azure as you said rabid Wolverine

2410
01:53:45,472 --> 01:53:49,056
Where did this come from from

2411
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:51,872
Stinking f****** The Highwaymen

2412
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:54,176
And the country boy exactly

2413
01:53:54,432 --> 01:53:57,504
Radio

2414
01:53:59,296 --> 01:54:03,904
It's weird I think I think those are the two things that we're going to find my intention starting list

2415
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:05,184
Is figuring out stuff about the

2416
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:05,952
Tea Party

2417
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:12,096
I am the rise of the Tea Party through the lines of Alex and I think ultimately

2418
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:13,120
Probably

2419
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:17,216
The Accidental thing that we're going to find is the beginnings of all of

2420
01:54:18,496 --> 01:54:20,544
That's probably much more value

2421
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:26,944
So this is probably the worst time of my life

2422
01:54:30,016 --> 01:54:35,136
But everybody else is going to have a good time trying to make the best out of it and make a show out of it yet. Thank you all so much for
