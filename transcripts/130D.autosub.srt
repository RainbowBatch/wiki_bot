1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:04,352
Everybody welcome back to knowledge

2
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:10,496
Four of our

3
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,544
Five-part coverage of Alec

4
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,128
To call it a documentary

5
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:16,896
We'll go ahead

6
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,664
What does the name

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,944
Convention he came up with

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,504
Film

9
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,296
Slick

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,648
Drew blank there for a second

11
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,928
Nothing

12
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,720
But researching

13
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:34,304
Recording and editing about this documentary for the last 3 weeks

14
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,912
Anyway guys where we last

15
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:43,520
On episode 23 we were in the middle of

16
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:47,360
And as promised at the end of

17
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,128
Continues

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,688
At the beginning of this episode but

19
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,992
There's not too much left of it look forward to us

20
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,832
To get into some other b******* Alex's lying about

21
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,880
Couple of quotes that he's faking

22
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,928
Couple more quotes

23
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,488
I'll be honest

24
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:09,376
This is where I think I got a little bit mad in the middle

25
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:13,216
Self decently but set

26
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,520
Be some cracks starting to show here in

27
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,544
What would be

28
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,152
H 7 of me and Jordan sitting around and recording

29
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,176
This

30
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:22,944
Nonsense

31
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,224
Anyway

32
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,016
Enjoy

33
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,600
Just enjoy

34
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:38,048
Alex

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,632
There's there's an argument to be made that what they were doing was actually

36
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,400
Rotting

37
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:47,776
These foundations they probably didn't mean to but

38
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,336
Alien producteurs that's what they did

39
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,128
I didn't start off as a scam

40
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:57,504
With the strong support of the US and England

41
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,808
Germany

42
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,256
The end of the war

43
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,536
The Allies protected

44
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,560
Prosecution

45
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,864
Nazi scientist

46
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:19,264
The tortured thousands of people to death I wonder why I have to assume

47
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,568
Yeah that's not true they didn't

48
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,592
Yusuke

49
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,664
Mengele escape to South America

50
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,200
No that's not

51
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,248
It's untrue protector

52
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,040
There were many scientists

53
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:40,000
At a high-level who and who put a lot of a lot of them we're not involved

54
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:44,608
Crimes against humanity

55
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
That would be nice

56
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,752
Will do you know any other name

57
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,336
Yeah David's parking

58
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,640
Citation needed

59
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
Citations needed

00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688

61
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,712
That was his brother

62
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,016
Okay what has me making fun of

63
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:02,784
The German language

64
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,136
Is possibly true but you're not proving it

65
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:07,904
Because you don't have any

66
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,720
Okay fine

67
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:16,096
I know about like naive to think that the American government did not protect

68
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:16,864
Genocide

69
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,936
Jenna ciders

70
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:23,008
As well as our desire for knowledge and the

71
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,544
It meant meet at the time

72
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,848
To defeat the Russians in developing whatever

73
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,920
Of course they projected there's a there's a bunch of

74
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,760
Bottles that I would have to that a number of them involved

75
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,064
The idea that a lot of people who had access to Teresa

76
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,344
Being done

77
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,904
And the results of it we're not involved

78
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
With

79
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
The crimes against

80
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,768
And so a lot of people

81
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,560
From prosecution

82
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
Commit War crime

83
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,144
The United States could have swallowed them up

84
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,960
Most of the people who were involved in Project Paperclip

85
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:59,360
Lot of the Nazi scientist who came over like 1 or van Braun unrelated areas involved

86
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,384
Relations and crack

87
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,480
Nuremberg trials were specifically set up in such a way

88
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,504
2 only

89
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,552
Prosecute for a couple different

90
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,344
That were within the

91
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:13,696
Spectrum of the Court view of the Court jurisdiction

92
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
And

93
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,512
I don't

94
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,815
100% accuracy but

95
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,095
I don't think

96
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,679
Did someone like Mengele would have escaped prosecution

97
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,215
Alex

98
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
Alex Jones said

99
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,519
Specifically

100
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
Singular

101
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,567
Scientist

102
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
Not playing

103
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:36,223
Yes he's talking about Mengele

104
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,623
It was history's f****** amazing though like realistically to be a Nazi is this evil

105
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:48,255
Margaret Sanger situation were like no no but I'm Amazed

106
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,535
Like V the fact

107
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,327
He had the foresight to know like

108
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,607
It's going down

109
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,631
Escaped

110
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
10 days

111
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:58,239
Before the camps were liberated

112
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,079
Did get captured

113
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,359
And they used his name

114
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,151
But because of

115
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,455
Some sort of stuck up with record-keeping

116
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:13,343
They're like oh you're not one of the people we are looking for a out released and ended up escaping to South America

117
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,135
Lakeville lucky that he had

118
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,415
In terms of that it's just

119
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,487
It's unbelievable

120
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,071
Maybe it's mind control

121
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,143
So he did Escape sup American-owned really protect

122
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
Alex Jones

123
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,983
Making that claim

124
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,519
Requires far more

125
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
Citation

126
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,759
The Nazi brand

127
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,231
The Allies literally fought each other over who would get top-notch

128
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,303
Wow

129
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:56,863
They were free

130
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,447
The angel of death Josef Mengele

131
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,007
Is Bosch otmar Von vershire

132
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,567
We're not prosecute

133
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,871
Even continued his work in Germany

134
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,895
After the war

135
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,687
Ne8 brain

136
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,247
Mangala did not Escape prosecution

137
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,295
At the Nuremberg Trial because he is

138
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,831
Escaped to South America

139
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:22,719
Escaping

140
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,487
To be metaphorical

141
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,303
Most people weren't tried In Absentia

142
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:31,423
They're only a couple people who are gone

143
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,447
Something like that

144
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,495
But here's the thing

145
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,567
The Nuremberg trials were incredibly

146
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:46,271
The first thing to keep in mind when you talk about the Nuremberg trials is there's a jurisdictional issue that it was only limited to work

147
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,599
Crimes against humanity waging Wars of aggression

148
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,903
A crime of that

149
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,671
Variety

150
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,719
Considered under those guidelines

151
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:59,327
There's no reason to think that otmar Von verschuer would have been found guilty

152
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,375
Was even deserving of the Courts at 10

153
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,911
What he did

154
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,983
We rightly can look back on his grotesque

155
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,263
An awful now

156
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,311
But it didn't rank with the Nuremberg trials

157
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,359
At the time there was the appearance

158
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,687
That he was just a scientist who benefited from receiving

159
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,479
Some samples from Angela in Austin

160
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,039
But not anyways and active

161
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
Participant

162
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,623
History calls that into question a little

163
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,183
So here's the thing Von verschuer was

164
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
Mangalore

165
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:33,119
Doctoral advisor whatever coming up

166
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,167
Completely separate

167
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:35,935
Research in

168
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,751
Institute nemeia received some samples from Angela

169
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:42,591
He was not involved in the camps and anyway

170
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:47,455
Well there's plausible deniability in terms of like that if there's no way you're going

171
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,479
To prove that he

172
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,783
Committed crimes against humanity war crimes

173
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,599
Crimes of aggression

174
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,135
Things are not going to prove that

175
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:01,535
If you could do that would make a great if you bring them up on trials in the

176
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,815
Those crimes

177
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:08,447
No so there's no reason why he ever would have been brought up now

178
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
In hindsight we can look back

179
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,287
Probably probably not

180
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,591
He's probably way more guilty than we know

181
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,383
It's kind of like

182
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
So

183
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,943
I look at it

184
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,223
Kind of like the way people look

185
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
Catania Harding

186
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:24,319
Look at the time for a while people saw her is just

187
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,647
The victim then she had no involvement with the Gallipoli

188
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,719
And his actions but she was involved

189
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,023
There's no doubt she was involved

190
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,863
So there's something like that it's too-little-too-late can't do anything about it

191
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
Pennywise

192
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
Wait which

193
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,935
I didn't see the movie

194
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:45,567
Jeff gillooly was her husband who hit Nancy

195
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,359
Nancy was the one who was he

196
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,991
The Nuremberg trials there were the doctor trials in 1946 to 90

197
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
B-47

198
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,807
Which would not

199
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
We've been locked up in

200
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,367
Nazis for a while now

201
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,439
Not as long as the road as far as

202
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,975
As far as

203
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
Tonya Harding

204
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
And Aunt

205
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,375
That was on TV right like I don't remember

206
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:13,215
No not the nothing

207
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,263
Like on TV

208
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
On the day

209
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,823
People were like

210
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:25,503
This Olympic athlete had her husband beat the s*** out of her competitor

211
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:31,135
Sounds about right

212
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:37,279
That was like 10 when I know I was remember that and I remember like

213
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,839
Steven the videos in my head of that

214
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,375
Crying like

215
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,495
It's amazing to live through though

216
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:50,079
That is a real thing that happened to

217
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,383
No big deal I was a guy

218
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:58,783
And if I refuse

219
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,135
Tonya Harding is a monster but abuse

220
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,439
I feel sorry for her but also

221
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:13,631
She's really good one of the only people to hit a triple axel

222
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,423
Competition but it wasn't

223
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:21,823
Nancy Kerrigan was also really good Tonya Harding was really good she was running

224
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
The triple axel

225
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:27,199
Rarity

226
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,015
Nancy Kerrigan was probably going to make the Olympic team

227
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,295
There's only

228
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,087
So much room on that team

229
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,767
Dude he has beat mob ties

230
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,095
Really

231
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:49,471
Lead pipe problem

232
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,055
I don't see how you have a friend

233
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,663
Good

234
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:03,039
Situation

235
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,135
46 + 47

236
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,927
Yeah up Nazi sign

237
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:15,839
This would also not guilty of any of the charges that were in the

238
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
Jurisdiction of that Court

239
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,447
Charges they were able to make war crimes against humanity

240
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,007
Performing medical experience

241
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,311
Experiments without the subject's consent

242
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,127
All prisoners of war and civilians of occupied countries

243
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,455
In the course of which the experiments of the defendants committed murders

244
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,015
Brutalities cruelties tortures atrocities

245
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
Nicki Minaj

246
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,599
Also planning performing to mass murder prisoners

247
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,903
Warren civilians of occupied countries

248
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,927
Mattias does

249
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,767
Buy gas refill injection

250
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,375
And diverse other means and nursing homes hospitals and asylums during the euthanasia program

251
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,191
Are participating in the mass murder of concentration camp in

252
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,727
And

253
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:57,055
The other crime they could have charged them with with membership in the SS

254
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,871
None of these would have applied Devon vergere

255
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,943
It would have been applied to mangala but you had already escaped stuff and

256
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,015
Known as protecting anybody it was just a waste

257
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:06,783
Waste of time

258
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,087
Prosecutor

259
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,391
He was clean

260
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,415
Got to wait cleaning

261
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,207
All of his Witnesses though it been

262
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
Hitman

263
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,255
In the leg with a lead pipe

264
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:24,959
You just got the samples from Angela I think

265
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,519
Hanging out with Mussolini

266
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,871
Angry exposed

267
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,943

Eugenics quarterly

Social biology

270
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,087
The American birth control

271
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,623
Became Planned Parenthood

272
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,463
New terms like transhumanism

273
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,255
Population control

Racial hygiene

278
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,935
And social Darwinism

279
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:03,359
What's going on here at all previous.

280
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,943
Crypto eugenics

281
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
Purposely

282
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,527
Taking their Eugenics beliefs Underground

283
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,647
They became highly respected anthropologist

284
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,183
The postwar world

285
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,975
All of those things are eugenics

286
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,511
I don't think that's what that

287
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,535
Thing is.

288
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
Let that drawing

289
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,727
Project Paperclip

290
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,591
Military-industrial

291
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,687
The founder of

292
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,479
Roosevelt

293
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,783
That is a little icky

294
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,807
Perhaps

295
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,623
Thomas Watson was given a medal by Hitler

296
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,927
You also returned it later

297
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,231
I don't know if we can find evidence

298
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,279
But he was a dedicated follower of him

299
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
He was

300
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,351
A boy that's a problem

301
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
Yeah

302
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,751
Thomas J Watson and Supply his punch card computers

303
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,055

304
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,479
IDM human identification number

305
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,063
This is

306
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:19,903
This is true but I don't know if

307
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,255
Launch Car Technology work.

308
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:30,399
Computer

309
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,983
That the problem that I come to visit all of the citation

310
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
For this Art Online

311
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,591
Taking. I've no idea what he's

312
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,615
Trying to sight

313
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,639
But

314
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,175
Thomas Watson and IBM

315
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,735
Did have involvement with giving Punch Cards

316
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,807
Technology to the Nazis were able to use

317
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,855
That made the camps more efficient

318
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:54,463
Right now the f*****-up piece of the ovens were made by a company name

319
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,231
Siemens

320
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:59,327
And semen get all of your s*** now to Leggett

321
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,935
It is like that IBM

322
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,959
They did

323
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,263
Provide punch project

324
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,287
Computing

325
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,871
But the real problem is not

326
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
Sports attic

327
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
Stop

328
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,735
Supporting the Germans when the Holocaust happen

329
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,039
The business relationship between Germany

330
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:23,647
And IBM a company that it was before which was a German company

331
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,695
Predated the rise of Hitler by 20

332
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
3 years

333
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,791
They were already doing all this business in Germany

334
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,863
Stop at parties

335
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,143
Credibly f*****-up

336
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,703
Should be deeply ashamed of himself

337
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,751
Because the the

338
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
The histories

339
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,079
All that that I bread

340
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
I have been so

341
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,407
Overflowing with this concept

342
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,455
Well we just couldn't believe

343
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:51,807
Like that kind of that kind of excuse kept coming up over and over and over again

344
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,831
Then where you talk about

345
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,111
The people who developed

346
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:54,879
The technology

347
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
That they use

348
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,951
When you ask them like

349
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
Well

350
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,791
We were told what it was being used for

351
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
This year

352
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,119
But we could not believe

353
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:08,447
And then two years later is like oh s*** that's real

354
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:13,311
Like the Holocaust the Holocaust now

355
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,919
The Holocaust deniers

356
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:24,319
During the war even right up to the end think about year-by-year the dishes

357
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,599
Between like

358
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:31,487
36 and 37 37 and 38 38 and 39 39 40

359
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,791
Like the difference between those gears and terms

360
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:37,119
The perspective what was publicly available information

361
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,191
Even even very difficult to wrestle with

362
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,983
Even soldiers in the

363
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,287
In like 44 were saying

364
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:47,871
Well we didn't believe that the Holocaust was real until we saw it

365
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,431
Yeah because how could

366
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,711
Possibly

367
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,807
What what kind of conception

368
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,343
If it weren't for the Holocaust

369
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,415
You wouldn't be able to conceive of a holocaust

370
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,975
Like it's impossible to imagine

371
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:07,583
Well I know there's another kind of right now

372
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,911
I meant

373
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,031
I think there is some sort of responsibility I believe that exist for likely

374
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,847
He's business people who were doing business with them

375
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,895
To have some sort of oversight of like

376
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,919
Whoo-wee contributing

377
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,967
But maybe I'm being idealistic

378
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,527
I'm not entirely sure

379
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,087
That's where we start talking about unregulated

380
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,903
Actual capital

381
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,951
Because unregulated

382
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,279
Corporations have no respond

383
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,583
All they are is machines

384
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,607
Money

385
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,167
Well yeah but

386
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,959
They're people who are machines built

387
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,983
To make money

388
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:52,127
I can't find any documentation or evidence

389
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,407
That size.

390
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,199
The numbers that were tattooed on people were used

391
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,271
With w and Arabia

392
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295
Continue

393
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:04,415
Similar punch-card systems as early as 1928

394
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,535
The first real computers

395
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,815
We're literally infinite

396
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,351
Biogenesis

397
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,191
He said literally technically the first computer was created

398
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,031
You could say that an abaca

399
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:26,687
Was technically a computer won't start let's just grab the name that he

400
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,711
As in electronics

401
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
Computing the

402
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,087
Decorative

403
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:42,815
That's why I got

404
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,959
Water claims there

405
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,287
In the formation of all done

406
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,847
Injustice

407
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,199
This government will be controlled by a scientific

408
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:07,391
Huxley creator

409
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,463
Former SS officer Prince Bernhard

410
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,279
Again

411
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,047
Again

412
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,071
The SS

413
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,375
Group he was in

414
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:20,191
It was a largely equestrian Social Club

415
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:25,311
To believe otherwise is to believe that space command guy that candle

416
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,359
Excellent oxtails

417
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,407
And Prince

418
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,015
In the event

419
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,063
I would like to return

420
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,391
In order to contribute something to solve overpopulation

421
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,231
Reported by Deutsche presse-agentur DPA

422
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
August

423
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,023
1988

424
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:51,679
Well we're at 43 now this is quotient

425
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:54,239
Number 7

426
00:19:54,495 --> 00:20:00,127
Statistics

427
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,711
It's a paraphrasing of something

428
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,479
He did say

429
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:09,855
Is a paraphrasing of the introduction hero to a book called Animal by fluke Howell

430
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,647
Here's the actual quote

431
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:18,303
I just wonder what it'd be like to be reincarnated in an animal numbers that it would endanger

432
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,071
Extinction

433
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,631
What would be its feelings towards the human species

434
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,167
He's a population explosion hits

435
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,703
Denied it somewhere to exist

436
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:29,311
I must confess that I'm tempted to ask for reincarnation as a particularly deadly virus

437
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:35,711
The book itself is just a compilation of famous people answering the question I am the title if I were an animal

438
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
What would I be

439
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:42,111
All right so this is kind of a its misleading use of this

440
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:46,207
Yeah burst of like explanation

441
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,511
It wasn't

442
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,791
Hey I got a question

443
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,327
What if

444
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,351
Songs

445
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,631
Green

446
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,447
I'm going to ask famous people we got a book

447
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:01,055
There is a cottage industry for that we all written by like

448
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:02,847
Publicist

449
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:06,175
You're right you're absolutely right

450
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,199
We got to go to Duke

451
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:10,271
This is a vaguely correct quote which is

452
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:15,135
A new a new high for Alex if you are up

453
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,464
To answer a banal question we will be writing a book

454
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,512
If I was a moose what kind of

455
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,048
The knowledge fight

456
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,328
That's damn

457
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,376
Surly moose

458
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,240
Aldous Huxley author of Brave New World

459
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,128
Shortly before his death

460
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,712
Best-selling book

461
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,736
New world

462
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,392
Implement

463
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:51,744
He didn't admit that this is about a half an hour long speech

464
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,608
I would have q-and-a session afterwards you can find it on YouTube there be a link on knowledge fight.com

465
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,424
Awesome speech Aldous Huxley

466
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,960
Very Charming order

467
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,008
Alex is going to

468
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:03,776
You play clip

469
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,848
That are selectively edited to make sound

470
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,408
Like you saying that there is an actual plan

471
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:15,808
Talking about but it's not if you wasn't the entire we don't have the time to listen

472
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,368
I recommend everyone Coronavirus

473
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416
Quick question

474
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,000
The context

475
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,280
Within which

476
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,072
Admitted

477
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:27,840
Would make sense

478
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:32,448
Are you torturing all the time

479
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:36,288
To get him to admit this information that he has been fighting against

480
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:39,104
Admitting this whole time you giving a Charming speech

481
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:46,016
Oh well then he finally admitted killer

482
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,808
The guilty

483
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,880
Knowing I wrote this amazing best selling books

484
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:57,280
That was actually stealing the plans of the wealthy and now finally in this charming speech

485
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
I can say

486
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,328
I admit it

487
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:03,936
That was it

488
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,752
How do you does that tire sometimes

489
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,288
Strictly speaking

490
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,848
Brave New World in 1984 or both

491
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,152
Technically better

492
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:16,224
Is it May 1st

493
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,272
To program a little context

494
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:21,088
Hear about the the speech itself

495
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,112
He's giving

496
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,904
Speech to

497
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,672
Student lecture

498
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,952
Berkeley

499
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,256
Screengrab you have up

500
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:32,096
Hurting me

501
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,144
Twinkle looks like

502
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:37,728
Sorry to get off the screen

503
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:44,128
Thank you very much

504
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,152
Discussion

505
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:51,552
The fears about the form of 3 like what form authoritarianism

506
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,112
Could possibly take and of course

507
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:59,744
I have primary point is whether or not be Brave New World model or the 1984 model is more likely

508
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,024
And of course he's like

509
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:07,680
Oh yeah I wrote it about how like

510
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,728
Well when I wrote that

511
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,752
Came up with

512
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:15,872
The drug that wasn't real

513
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:23,808
Yellow course you would never want to have an authoritarian regime that's a boot on someone's face all the time

514
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,600
That's way less efficient than making

515
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,136
Someone loved their slavery

516
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:31,232
Exactly how you talked mostly about how

517
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:35,328
I was right or well was wrong for what he's talking about

518
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,888
Write a little professional dick

519
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,936
Yeah I think better than the

520
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216
Right

521
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,544
All still just in the realm of like

522
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,592
He's could happen

523
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,760
I would actually probably stay the night

524
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,528
1584

525
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,576
I think it's easier to get people fight again

526
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,136
You know

527
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:06,560
Okay how you're going from harder to break free of the all the

528
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,608
Then the 1984 dystopia

529
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,168
Is my conception of dystopia

530
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:16,032
Get out well then you would rather live

531
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,640
No I'd rather live in the 90

532
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,664
Before 1

533
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:22,944
Fight against

534
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,248
But you're probably going to die

535
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:28,064
I'd rather die than live in

536
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,832
Either of the

537
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,928
Well I think there's a hypothetical

538
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,952
Fighting against

539
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,720
That woodworking

540
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:37,792
41

541
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,120
How long to the bottom of Wyatt is

542
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,912
You feel this way about our two

543
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,728
Death would be preferable to

544
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,520
Drug

545
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,544
Desperate

546
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,568
That's where everyone's

547
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,104
Genetic

548
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,128
Woody

549
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,528
I don't know I mean let's talk about the major

550
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:03,648
Alright alright

551
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,256
Comparable

552
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,072
The parable of Brave New World

553
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,376
We said another parable

554
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,912
Maurice's

555
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,240
George

556
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,544
1980s for the British

557
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,664
The scientific

558
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,832
Will be probably

559
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,696
Eventually

560
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,000
1984 pet

561
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,536
They will be

562
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,304
Cousin

563
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,608
Nhu minutes

564
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,336
If you can

565
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,360
Forget people

566
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:07,136
The nature of the ultimate Revolution

567
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:12,000
We are in process of developing

568
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,048
He made a cut there

569
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,072
He didn't call

570
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:15,840
Okay

571
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:18,912
He made for me to let this whole Alex Jones

572
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,216
Things go time to start

573
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,032
Alex made a cut right

574
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,568
Before you said

575
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:29,152
To me what we talked about with the revolution

576
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,712
The reason he calls it the ultimate Revolution is

577
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,760
Because it's the revolution where we will be able to

578
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:36,320
Change ourselves opposed to external forces change

579
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,624
But

580
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,512
Now running through my

581
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,560
Paper is about

582
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:50,912
Brave New World in 1984 comparison

583
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:58,080
Papers recreationally white Neighbors

584
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,408
Then later on I will

585
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,688
They have cancer

586
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:08,064
There's a slight pettiness in this beach I'll be honest

587
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,880
What cuz the the resolution of 1980

588
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,160
4 is the main character

589
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,440
To love his

590
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,208
Play

591
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,232
So that

592
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,280
Kind of the

593
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,072
The

594
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,120
Description that Elvis's pudding

595
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:21,888
Towards

596
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,912
84 is

597
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,192
Look at how a 1980

598
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,752
All of these horrible things happen

599
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,288
And there's a result

600
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,616
The same what other something that the person has to endure

601
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,152
Right

602
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,688
Brave New World

603
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,992
All of the bad things that happen or something

604
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,576
Where is what the main characters in

605
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,344
During

606
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,392
Brave New World is nothing but

607
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,440
But pleasure like that kind of

608
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:54,656
So the difference there and if you're all this Huxley I I suppose that

609
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,472
His his main difference

610
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,032
Between the two of them would be

611
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,080
With all the text Lee is writing Brave New

612
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:02,848
New world

613
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,664
He believes that human beings are capable

614
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,432
A break

615
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,712
Through

616
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,016
Taking off of that

617
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:11,552
That's kind of like

618
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,320
Blind

619
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,368
Drugged out blissed-out love

620
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,928
And find something better in the future

621
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,976
Whereas Orwell is like

622
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
People

623
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,536
If you beat

624
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,608
Enough they're going to love you no matter what

625
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,912
His

626
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,448
Like I get why

627
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,496
All this and no I've left Alex

628
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,544
Way of the path Alex and Alex

629
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,824
Alice Alex

630
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,224
God this is there's nothing there I'm just take on it is that

631
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,064
King Junior High paper on the two of them in my head improv Isley

632
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:49,184
I'll just his take on 1984 is that it was a product of the time it was written

633
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:52,256
And that the authoritarians pollotarian

634
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,560
Beers of the time informed

635
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,608
His version of the scary state

636
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,144
Supposed to hit

637
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,424
Perversion

638
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,032
I didn't expect

639
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,312
But

640
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,080
It's not

641
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,200
Technique

642
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,784
Will enable

643
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,880
Exist

644
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,416
Presume

645
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,888
That people can be made

646
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,192
To enjoy state

647
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,496
Do you need

648
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,288
Decent standard

649
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,224
Your assignment

650
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,416
Except

651
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:59,584
7th Street

652
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,888
This was one of the things

653
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,216
I talked about you in Brave New World

654
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,800
The results would be either

655
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,432
How to make people

656
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,904
The literal end of the speech is him saying that

657
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,952
Now that we have all these capabilities

658
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:28,768
Great task

659
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,304
To make sure that

660
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:35,424
All this technology is used to make sure and get a dignity

661
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,960
Blah blah blah

662
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:39,264
Some sort of dystopia

663
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,080
All the ways in which you can be

664
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:46,176
It's our responsibility for you now knowing how to f*** people over with us

665
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,000
Have left a massive wave of Destruction behind

666
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,864
As if we

667
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:13,312
A stream of congressional investigations as uncovered more than

668
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,664
Between 1910 and 2000

669
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,968
I bet that number is

670
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,760
Individual

671
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:24,064
Or like

672
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,928
There's no Citation for this but I have no idea

673
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,952
2 gauge this

674
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:33,792
I would I would bet that number is accurate or low

675
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:37,120
But I would also bet I would also bet everything I own

676
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,656
The bulk of those

677
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,704
We're closer to 1910s

678
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,240
Then they were 2,000

679
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,544
That's a wide swath of time

680
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,104
Where medical ethics was very

681
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,920
What he's doing there is cheating

682
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,944
Time in Seattle

683
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:51,968
Yeah

684
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,272
With a point

685
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:05,280
Alex you're not allowed

686
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,048
You

687
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:11,424
Personal are you not allowed to talk

688
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,008
Mini

689
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,336
Still others died

690
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:24,480
Radiation experiments

691
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,856
Hundreds of hospitals in the US

692
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:32,160
Men women and children

693
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,208
And plutonium

694
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,280
Dosage levels

695
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,840
Call Elsie

696
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,888
Medical ethics was really f***** up

697
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:46,752
Pregnant vitamins

698
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:53,920
Uranium

699
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,760
And the death of them

700
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:11,072
Soldiers Sailors and Marines were used as guinea pig

701
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,376
Atomic and hydrogen bomb test

702
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,472
Patriotic American

703
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,264
Shiny Bisharp

704
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,848
Oh man

705
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:35,648
This is really f***** I mean it's f***** up this this part of our history

706
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:47,936
This also goes to like they didn't know what the effects

707
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:53,568
Be good you would hope but they didn't

708
00:34:54,336 --> 00:35:00,480
US Army Health Ministry

709
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,016
3 million lira

710
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:06,624
Israel

711
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,440
Government-run Public School

712
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,280
The medical check-up

713
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,784
Mini of Wichita

714
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:39,904
More than 110,000 of the darker skin shoes

715
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,952
No

716
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:45,536
The maximum

717
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:51,680
All of them lost their hair

718
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,800
Alex is a f****** liar

719
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,104
Here's what he's talking about

720
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,944
So the only the offers for this are too late

721
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:05,248
To a documentary

722
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,528
2003

723
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,832
Children

724
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:13,696
I've ever heard of that you're turning the ringworms at all

725
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:17,280
Which is used by Mizrahi Jews

726
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,584
Jews they were descended from the Middle East

727
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:23,424
As evidence of Injustice as they suffered immigrating to Israel in the night

728
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,008
They're almost definitely very severe issues

729
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,032
Is there integration in

730
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:28,800
Israelis

731
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,896
The film claims at least

732
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:39,040
100000 Mizrahi Jews were subjected to radiation level X beyond the maximum recommended dose

733
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,832
For treatment of ringworm

734
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,600
That's not good

735
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,392
However the documented dosage

736
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:49,792
Just given to Israeli children were similar to if not less than those about 2,000 children treated for

737
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:53,120
At New York University Hospital between 1940 and

738
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,680
So it's very different

739
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,704
That's not this

740
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:01,056
No it's a it's a misrepresentation

741
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:01,824
Is the thing that

742
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:05,408
Is the documents show

743
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,808
I feel comfortable in this territory

744
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:15,136
Is really weird I was doing great right up until you said

745
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:19,232
Actually the real interesting

746
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,536
Definitely more

747
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,304
Real

748
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:28,192
4-wheel parts investigative

749
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,728
First name to live with

750
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,496
Pretty good

751
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:33,312
Shipper ship Arts it slows off the tongue

752
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,152
This piece of history and found something pretty interesting

753
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:42,272
It turns out that the protocols that were used in treating immigrants for ringworm in Israel in the night

754
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:44,576
Which is what all of these things were

755
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,904
They were called the cause of the use of Zion

756
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,024
Alex was

757
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,304
I did I got that reference

758
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,168
I was just presenting there's like these kids were sent to their

759
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,448
At the school

760
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,216
Nurse

761
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:06,336
And got radiant not one that's not what even the documentary

762
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,360
Keysight

763
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,128
Is about

764
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,920
About

765
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,992
Fear-mongering documentary sites is like

766
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,648
So that it was about using radiation

767
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,672
Worm

768
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,952
Immigrant

769
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,232
In the 1950s

770
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:26,560
In Israel and that protocol was based on a campaign from 90

771
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,584
8:39

772
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,352
38

773
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,120
Among Jews and

774
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,144
Eastern Europe

775
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,192
That is mostly among Ashkenazi

776
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,240
In course of which

777
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:36,288
27000 Eastern European

778
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,824
Children were irradiated

779
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,408
In part to allow their families to emigrate

780
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,224
Ringworm

781
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,504
Grounds for occlusion

782
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,272
For immigrants to

783
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,552
States and elsewhere

784
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,368
The folks running the program

785
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,904
1950s

786
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,696
That previous campaign

787
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,720
Headbands

788
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,488
Successful

789
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:58,048
And wanted to offer the treatment to the Mizrahi

790
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,352
As well as others were coming into Israel

791
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:05,984
Does Israel

792
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:12,384
What's a large proportion

793
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:18,784
Who were irradiated in the initial campaign has been killed in the Holocaust

794
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:25,184
They didn't know they didn't know my god dammit

795
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,024
These kids died in the Holocaust

796
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,584
And didn't live to the point where they would have head and neck

797
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,680
Tumors like they would have had they have survived

798
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,496
Terrified

799
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:42,080
But it's heartbreaking

800
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:46,432
It was a possible they could have learned

801
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,480
From the previous campaign

802
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,528
It's not like that

803
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:53,088
Like the head and neck Schumer's happen to everybody

804
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:56,160
So some of the people who survived may have not

805
00:39:56,416 --> 00:40:02,560
And even if they did they might have thought it was a side effect of living through whatever irate

806
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,584
Radiation or test

807
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,120
That we're done to them in the Holocaust

808
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:09,216
I don't know what it is about that story somehow

809
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,008
Even more heartbreaking

810
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,080
That x-ray treatment

811
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:17,664
Was incredibly infected effective at treating ringworm

812
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:21,504
And would not be it was never invented until 90

813
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
1059

814
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,320
Most of the world in

815
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,600
Employed the radiation

816
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,648
Not knowing the damage they were doing

817
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:30,464
Generally speaking ringworms

818
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,072
Radioactive

819
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,888
Usher Yeah

820
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:42,240
If you would your brush your teeth and be like look at makes your teeth Club

821
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:54,272
For was much more prevalent among immigrant populations in the early 1900s

822
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,552
Because the means of transportation

823
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,088
Rotation were so cumbersome

824
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:02,464
They ended up traveling and being held in really cramped quarters and hygiene was terrible back then

825
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:03,744
As Israel was the

826
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,048
It's forming in 1948 that led to

827
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,608
Waves of immigration

828
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,704
And this increased radiation treatment

829
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,264
You can see the tragic end result Bad Medicine

830
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,544
I'm here but not a coordinated

831
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,568
Attack on anybody

832
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:20,640
We had tons of immigrants that came to Ellis Island

833
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,920
They didn't get a raise

834
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:25,504
Results because

835
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,320
You were found to have ringworm which they would check for

836
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,088
Looking at people

837
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:32,416
Scalpicin what have you ate

838
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,208
To wherever you came from

839
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:37,280
This is just a really tragic piece of like

840
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:40,096
One of the few non-racist

841
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,656
Yes terrible immigration history

842
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,936
It's just a tragic

Alex Jones

844
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,776
To try and score some sort of weird points

845
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,568
And it is not working

846
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,848
It's one of the few situations

847
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,128
Where it's same

848
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,687
Literally everybody

849
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,479
Was rooting

850
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,015
For good things to happen

851
00:41:59,295 --> 00:41:59,807
Through

852
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,855
Just a bunch of oversights

853
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,623
Mistakes

854
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:03,903
The worst

855
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,183
The worst

856
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:05,951
God

857
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,791
The cover test

Blake Personnel in local hospital

863
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,023
Is f***** up that was in 19

864
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,303
8

865
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:44,607
There's a lot of things that have happened

866
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,399
Since then but all of them are like

867
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:47,935
Who's better really

868
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:48,959
It's not

869
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,495
It's not like anything that is

870
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:56,895
Actually damaging it'll be affected if there were an attack

871
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,455
So f***** up I'm uncomfortable with it but

872
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,511
Currently testing pesticide

873
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,071
Highly toxic experimental drug

Silverbacks graduate

878
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,415
Do it

879
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:48,095
Against the practice of eating mutton Bertrand Russell

880
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:54,751
So real quick understand Bertrand Russell

881
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:55,519
Coming back and bite me

882
00:43:59,359 --> 00:43:59,871
Some prisoners

883
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:03,199
Absolutely

884
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:06,271
That's so true that it's true

885
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,599
The argument that he should be making

886
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,879
King really is more about

887
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,463
Well there's that

888
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,487
Racing class

889
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:17,535
Certainly

890
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:18,559
But also

891
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,119
UB about the system

892
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:21,887
Prism

893
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:22,911
We have where we have

Do the point where your body is inflamed

897
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,359
Anyway

898
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,663
This Bertrand Russell

899
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,199
Yeah that sucks

900
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,991
Let's get into it sucks

901
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:39,039
Let's go on down and

902
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,063
Sucking

903
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,623
Quoting Bertrand Russell

904
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,647
God dammit

905
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,439
Actually real

906
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:51,327
I know this I know this

907
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,351
I do Coke

908
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,167
Look like

909
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:58,495
He has a lot of very smart things

910
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,263
Load him

911
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:03,103
Because most of what he says wind up coming back to bite yourself in the ass

912
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,919
Liz Ramona book Iraq called the impact of science

913
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:06,943
Open Society

914
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:13,343
Russell is describing to come into the World War I used to have one world

915
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,903
He's clearly and very

916
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,951
Sickly talking negatively about how things

917
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,999
Could become a dystopia very quickly

918
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:22,559
If it's a solitary and state where to apply

919
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,607
Some context

920
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:29,215
A totalitarian government with government with scientific bent light do things

921
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:33,055
These are more scientific than the price

922
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,591
Rulers of Russia

923
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:37,663
Ever more inclined toward the sort of atrocities that I have in mind

924
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,711
Probably

925
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,271
Does selective breeding

926
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:45,599
Animation which adopts best practice will within a generation

927
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,135
Insecure great military advantage

928
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,183
Assistant one may surmise

929
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,207
Will be something like this

930
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:52,255
Except possibly in the governor

931
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:55,071
Governing aristocracy

932
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,351
The males

933
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,375
Females will be sterilized

934
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:00,447
The 30% of females will be expected to

935
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,471
Spent the years

936
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,007
From 18 to 40 and

937
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,055
In order to secure adequate

938
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:05,823
And father

939
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,151
As a rule artificial insemination will be preferred to the naturalness

940
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:09,919
Method

941
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,223
Gradually by selective breeding

942
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:15,039
Congenital differences between router

943
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:17,087
Until they become almost difference

944
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,183
A Revolt of the plebs become

945
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,719
As an organized insurrection

946
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,487
Cheap again

947
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,511
Practice of eating

948
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,279
There's a club

949
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,839
Such possibilities on

950
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:36,287
But I firmly believe that if the Nazis had won the last war and if in the end they required worlds

951
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,079
To see if they would before long

952
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:38,847
Have established

953
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,895
The system as I have been to just

954
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,687
Prevent these scientific

955
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,479
As I've been suggesting

956
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:48,063
To prevent be scientific or as democracy is necessary but not

957
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:48,831
Sufficient

958
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:52,159
There must also be that kind of respect for the individual that

959
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,695
Inspired the doctrine of the rights of

960
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,255
So the Flash Forward a little bit

961
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:01,887
There's a tendency which is inevitable unless consciously combated for organizations

962
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:02,655
Sekolah

963
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,191
And so true increase in size

964
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,751
Until ultimately almost all become Birds

965
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,799
A scientific oligarchy

966
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,079
Accordingly

967
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:13,663
Is bound to become what it is called what is called totalitarian

968
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,455
Expect

969
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,991
I only important form

970
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:19,039
A power will become a monopoly of the

971
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,599
This model is system has sufficient Merit

972
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:24,927
Be attractive to many people.

973
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:26,207
Are far greater than its

974
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:29,279
49

975
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:34,143
I think the evils that have grown up in the Soviet Russia will exist

976
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:37,471
In a greater or lesser degree wherever there is scientific government

977
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:39,775
Which is securely established and is not the

978
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:41,567
Depended on popular support

979
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,103
Afford to pay

980
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,895
55in concrete fact

981
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:48,479
When it is when does pretended that the state as

982
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,759
A good difference

983
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:54,367
Oh a good different from that of its citizens

984
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:57,183
What is really meant is that the good of the government

985
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:00,767
Or of the ruling class is more important than that of other people

986
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:04,351
Such a Buchan have no basis except arbitrary power

987
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,935
I think that's so long as powerful democracies exist

988
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:10,751
Democracy will in the long run be victorious over.

989
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,567
I allow myself

990
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,847
Immoderate optimism

991
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:15,615
Into the future

992
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,663
F*** you Alex

993
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,455
But also

994
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,223
Fuckyoubaker

995
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,271
Yeah yeah

996
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:26,111
You are so wrong on all of that all of it

997
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:26,879
Well

998
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:36,863
That's why I get comes down to practical application and how shity people are

999
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,655
Anyway

1000
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,543
H g wagon 5.3

1001
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,615
And hundreds of

1002
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:52,479
Constantly

1003
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:08,351
Look at those pants

1004
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,727
Another word compound

1005
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,335
Develop a survival zombie

1006
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:33,439
But the authorities

1007
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,463
Possible

1008
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:38,303
This is the exact same book just the same context

1009
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,839
Yeah Bertrand Russell

1010
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:40,863
Yep

1011
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,143
Over how many years ago

1012
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:52,127
Bye 2007

1013
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,407
U.s. population

1014
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,687
Oran sometime

1015
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,223
Prescription antidepressant

1016
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:00,319
But in the case of foster children

1017
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,207
Are forced to take a cocktail

1018
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,791
7

1019
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:11,839
Feel like that's not true

1020
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,935
Prepositions

1021
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:21,055
Testified before the State House Select Committee hearing on psychotropic drugs in foster care

1022
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,335
Republic

1023
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:25,663
When he said that foster children in Texas

1024
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,711
I've been placed on psychiatric drugs

1025
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,247
Because they were

1026
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,039
Very very sick

1027
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:36,415
The kids come from Bad gene pool

1028
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:39,743
They don't have stable parents making good decisions

1029
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:46,911
Besides the gene pools that lemon traumatized by abuse neglect and problems and then they've been traumatized

1030
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,775
First of all the gene pool stuff

1031
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,311
I've been stuck Alex

1032
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:56,127
The end of that guy what he was talking about

1033
00:50:59,455 --> 00:50:59,967
So

1034
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,831
That's such a

1035
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,367
A guy

1036
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,391
Raised

1037
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:11,743
In a place where they say the n-word all the time trying to do his

1038
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:12,511
Nice like

1039
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:19,679
Look I'm just saying that the cultural pressures these it and then he just keeps using the n-word

1040
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,447
He's never

1041
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,847
Keep saying the n-word bungee like

1042
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:34,015
Breakage paragraph

1043
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,807
Heartbreak paragraphs at you

1044
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:42,463
Always going to be bad I don't know who this is about the big

1045
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,231
Bigger picture

1046
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:48,351
Statistically speaking children in foster homes are more likely to have experienced severe trauma

1047
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:51,935
Manufacturer in the definite separation

1048
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:55,007
Experience from their family

1049
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:57,567
More likely require pharmacological intervention

1050
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,847
This is not an unexpected

1051
00:51:59,103 --> 00:51:59,615
It's like Institute

1052
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:04,479
Literature on the mental health issues of Children and Youth

1053
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:07,551
In foster care review children

1054
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:09,343
Approximately 80%

1055
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:13,439
I'm having psychological social and developmental delays at compared to children

1056
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,719
The general population

1057
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,999
Approximately 8

1058
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,023
20%

1059
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,583
The regularity and severity of emotional problems

1060
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,959
Strongly related to their history of deprivation neglect and abuse

1061
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:27,007
And the lack of security in

1062
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,031
And any of their life

1063
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,591
Rate that you see in children

1064
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,615
After care Express

1065

Pacific mental issue

1066
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,919
Make some of this

1067
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:34,687
Clearer

1068
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:37,503
When you look at post-traumatic stress disorder

1069
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,551
21.5%

1070
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:42,623
And foster children as opposed to 4.5% in

1071
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,391
In the general population

1072
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,183
Panic disorder

1073
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,719

3.6% versus

1079
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:03,103
These are the sorts of things you would expect to see in elevated levels

1080
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,639
Compared to the general population

1081
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:08,735
Seeing as most people are not put into foster care unless there's something traumatic

1082
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,527
It happened in their young child

1083
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:12,831
Hood answer ptsb Spike

1084
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:13,599
Correlation

1085
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,135
What

1086
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:16,671
Okay

1087
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,207
Haha

1088
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:24,607
Frequently change living situations would give anyone tremendous anxiety not knowing

1089
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:28,447
We should be moving all around hold on

1090
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:31,775
Here's where here's another study that I found those really interesting

1091
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:34,079
A 2012 study by the national

1092
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,615
Survey of Children's Health

1093
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:38,431
Summit children living in non-parental care

1094
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:40,991
Actually more likely to experience quote

1095
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:43,295
Adverse family experiences

1096
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,063
Childhood

1097
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,903
They found that 70% of children living with two biological parents

1098
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:48,927
The household experience

1099
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,207
0 such events

1100
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,999
Compare to 18.7

1101
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:54,047
Children living in household

1102
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,583
With zero Biolage

1103
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:57,887
There's a difference of

1104
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,423
30% compared to

1105
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,447
281 point

1106
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,471

1107
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,751
Children who experience

1108
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:03,519
One such

1109
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:06,079
So there's that

1110
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,639
But the big difference comes

1111
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:10,687
When you look at children who experience

1112
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,711
Multiple event

1113
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:14,527

Headache Point 9% incidence of experiencing

1115
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:21,695
Compared to 29.9%

1116
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:23,743
For children living with no biological

1117
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,303
That's an almost three thousand percent

1118
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:29,375
What do you separate out kids in foster care

1119
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:31,935
So you exclude people who were living with their grandparents

1120
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:32,703
Something like that

1121
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:36,031
You find a 48.3% incident

1122
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:38,079
A four or more adverse

1123
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,871

00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:44,479
And a 15.7% of

1126
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,783
Deckhand

1127
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:47,551
This is

1128
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:49,343
So statistically relevant

1129
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,159
Yes such nonsense it's so cruel

1130
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,975
To imagine look now we're just trying to drug these kids up

1131
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:58,559
Just trying to drop these kids off now no one's taking care of them

1132
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:00,607
But

1133
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,375
Now

1134
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:02,911
That's it

1135
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,447
Yes

1136
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,727
We know all of those

1137
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,031
And yes they all make perfect

1138
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:14,431
But have you considered blaming the only people who are trying to help

1139
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:17,503
Yeah we could do that okay

1140
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:19,551
Do you know what it is

1141
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:25,951
Millennials millennials

1142
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:32,351
Traumatic event like

1143
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:36,703
Are you still cool with Lavoy finicum the guy who got shot

1144
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:39,775
The Wildlife Preserve

1145
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,567
When he had a child Farm

1146
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:42,591
Raised

1147
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,639
Money by having foster children

1148
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:47,711
He wasn't taking great care of them

1149
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:52,319
I imagine not all of them stay there for all that long you would probably a part of

1150
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,855
The problem Alex is thrilled

1151
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:55,391
To just ignore that

1152
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,439
And point a finger at the

1153
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,487
The aftermath

1154
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:02,559
That's embarrassing Alex's plan

1155
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,863
As far as I can understand

1156
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:05,887
Is

1157
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,703
Blame the victim

1158
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:10,239
If you can't blame the victim

1159
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,263
Play

1160
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,543
Blame the people trying to help

1161
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:13,567
Yes

1162
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:19,199
Everything

1163
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:23,039
And everything we reach Prosperity are we go

1164
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:29,951
Very sorry about that

1165
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:35,583
I had a friend

1166
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,655
It makes it a very

1167
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,679
Personal issue

1168
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:41,727
Now your f***

1169
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:42,495
Nailed it

1170
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:46,079
The Western World Is Now implementing eugenics

1171
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:51,199
Fetuses are now being priest

1172
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:53,247
From Portland Oregon

1173
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:54,527
London England

1174
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:57,855
Protective Services

1175
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:59,647
Criminal databases at Birth

1176
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,183
Forcing them to attend

1177
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:03,231
Probation hearings

1178
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:07,583
It's not true at all

1179
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:11,423
The source

1180
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:17,311
This already has on this is one article out of the Guardian I believe

1181
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,591
UK

1182
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,871
Auto Telegraph

1183
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:23,967
Really f***** up because it is

1184
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:24,735
Very much

1185
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:25,503
About

1186
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,551
Doing visit

1187
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:29,087
The children who are high-risk

1188
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:33,183
Their parents are drug addicts

1189
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:37,279
And the way I was reading it was like

1190
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:41,375
We can do some therapeutic interventions

1191
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,399
We're going to track them

1192
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,935
Yeah that sucks

1193
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,215
UK

1194
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:49,055
I've no idea what he's talking about in Portland

1195
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,847
Visits for two-year-olds

1196
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,639
He has no backing for that no other

1197
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:57,247
The overlords of scientific dictatorship

1198
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:59,551
Are ruthlessly Prosecuting a war

1199
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,087
Are most offensive

1200
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:05,183
In December of 1974

1201
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,207
The US

1202
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:08,511
World population reduction

1203
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,559
Central National Security issue

1204
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:15,935
National Security studies

1205
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:19,775
Chandelier regurgitation of the British Commission on population

1206
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:22,335
King George the sixth of England

1207
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:25,663
1844

1208
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:27,455
What's third world nation

1209
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:36,671
There's nothing to do with what he's talking about the National Security study memorandum was

1210
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,695
Written by Kissinger and

1211
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,487
April 1974

1212
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:45,887
President Nixon wanted

1213
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,423
Effects of rising population

1214
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:54,847
This study should focus on the international political and economic implications of population growth

1215
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:02,783
The memo internally even shows that it's possible the end result

1216
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:03,807
Quotes

1217
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:04,831
If any

1218
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:08,415
New initiatives by the US are needed to focus International tent

1219
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,207
Problems

1220
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,743
Correctly

1221
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:12,767
Kissinger was like

1222
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:13,535
Hey

1223
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:15,327
You guys want to find out if we should do something

1224
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:19,167
The most further goes on to edit

1225
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:21,471
The study should take into account the presidents

1226
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:26,847
Concerned the population policy is a human concern intimately related to the Dignity of the individual

1227
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,895
And be objective of the United States

1228
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,431
Is the work closely with others

1229
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:35,551
Rather than to seek to impose our views on others

1230
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:41,951
Whether or not we're actually reached by this this document itself is not evidence

1231
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:44,255
Of what Alex is talking about

1232
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:45,791
To do far more work

1233
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:50,399
If you wants to prove his point nothing nefarious and nothing evil in this

1234
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:51,679
The f****** a******

1235
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,471
You are mad

1236
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:56,031
I'm sorry but Kissinger offered us plan

1237
00:59:56,287 --> 01:00:01,151
It's a fun-filled mad at you

1238
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:06,527
I don't know Kissinger recommended tumescent World Bank

1239
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:10,111
Nations initiate aggressive population control program

1240
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:11,647
Russian sterilization

1241
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:19,071
Kissinger

1242
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,863
Reducing population

1243
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,935
1972

1244
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:24,959
Nixon White House

1245
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:25,983
Also implement

1246
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:30,079
Which was George Walker Bush

1247
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,687
Bush advised China

1248
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:36,991
The formulation

1249
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,319
Forcibly sterilized

1250
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:41,599
40%

1251
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:43,903
Native American women on reservation

1252
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:47,487
Nothing in this house citations at all

1253
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:51,071
Now I believe

1254
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:56,447
I believe it's possible to the natives

1255
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:59,007
Directly said

1256
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:01,567
Sterilize 40% of the Native American

1257
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:02,591
Women Poppy

1258
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:09,247
I believe that possible

1259
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:14,111
Is anything beyond the pale I definitely want a citation though if you say that

1260
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,135
George h.w.

1261
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:18,975
So legitimate lead the only citation the offers in the bibliography is

1262
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:22,047
The transcript of Nixon nominating Bush to be the ambassador

1263
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:23,839
December of 19

1264
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:28,703
70 nothing to do with China directly it has nothing to do with the natives

1265
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:32,543
79

1266
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:38,431
Wasn't into one child policy

1267
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:40,735
Searching for any backup on this plane is burnt

1268
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:46,879
All of the references are

1269
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:50,207
Like Bush stepped out of the agency

1270
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:56,351
Father's role in international investment banker

1271
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:59,935
Who chaired the First International Bank of Houston

1272
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:01,727
Then directed The First International Bank

1273
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:03,007
Ventures Limited London

1274
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:05,311
Drag boats

1275
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:07,103
The largest bank in Texas

1276
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,383
Bush travel bag

1277
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:11,711
The family's permanent place

1278
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:14,271
In the British Imperial financial and political in

1279
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:16,831
Middle East Asia

1280
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:18,879
Africa and Latin America

1281
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:23,231
During this period China adopted the brutal eugenicist one child

1282
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:29,631
So wild doing all kinds of other changes their policy in their life

1283
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:32,703
Even the f****** claims that are made of these

1284
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,727
Crazy blogs

1285
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:36,031
That I tried to find a support that

1286
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:38,079
Is a paragraph out of one of it

1287
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:41,663
Is it

1288
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:43,967
Got to do better than

1289
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:46,271
You have to prove your claim

1290
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:51,135
Do you know his documents been watched by more people tonight doesn't even work

1291
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:53,695
Documentary about us watching his death

1292
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:55,999
Little bit

1293
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:59,327
Club of Rome

1294
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:05,215
Advocated environmental it takes 6 hours to break out of nowhere on 9

1295
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,799
What is a band

1296
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,807
20 more minutes

1297
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:26,207
You're just going to hear

1298
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:29,023
The background

1299
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:34,911
Isabel

1300
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:41,311
Are we going to get back to the Texas pipeline or whatever we actually might

1301
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:44,127
Are we going to get Debbie did they build the road

1302
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:52,575
Spoiler alert so this is about

1303
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:58,975
I don't want to get into it,

1304
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,911
Artificial scarcity

1305
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:13,567
Club around creative you waited almost

1306
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:20,223
Yeah I was newly created

1307
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:20,991
Not true

1308
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:26,111
Rome was founded in 1968 by geologist

1309
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:29,183
1956

1310
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:31,999
Time is Sheldon Hubbard's assessment was

1311
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:33,535
Not really all that accurate

1312
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:37,119
But available information Technologies were not what they are today

1313
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,679
1836 on the underlying principle

1314
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:41,215
Warning people about

1315
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:43,263
Might not be materially in Korea

1316
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:50,175
Well it may be true that tie we keep developing new ways to extract oil from

1317
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:54,015
The new methods we develop all come with some form of diminishing returns

1318
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,551
At this point most

1319
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,575
Expert

1320
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:57,599
Except

1321
01:04:57,855 --> 01:05:00,415
Discovered pretty much all of the available

1322
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:02,975
Easily extractable oil on the plane

1323
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,767
There's not much more to fight

1324
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:09,631
From this point forward at the countdown till the liquid oil Reserves

1325
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:13,215
Start running out it which point we'll have to take on some addition

1326
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:15,775
No burdens along with the oil leaks

1327
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:17,311
Some of that comes out before

1328
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,103
Extraction of oil for

1329
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,151
From Shale is more expensive because

1330
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:23,199
Way less effective as an energy

1331
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:26,015
Resource required to achieve

1332
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:28,319
Similarly creating a lot of garbage

1333
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,343
I is

1334
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,879
Possible but it's incredibly

1335
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:33,695
A barrel of oil cost Saudi Arabia proxy

1336
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:34,719
Play $9

1337
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:38,303
He's currently opposed to about $45 for the United Kingdom

1338
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,607
Do the same using waste products

1339
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:42,655
To do it cost about $80 a barrel

1340
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:46,239
Beyond the much higher cost of these Alternatives there also

1341
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:49,311
Much more difficult

1342
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:53,919
Their expenses in the form of pollution

1343
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:55,455
Along with the

1344
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,223
Surprises

1345
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:56,991
Have some of these

1346
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:01,599
The fracking that's are required to access a lot of the more difficult oil Reserves

1347
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:04,159
They were fighting now has been shown to increase Airborne emissions

1348
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:07,999
Significant danger to contaminate

1349
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:10,047
Adam call seismic activity

1350
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,351
A further problem the complicates things

1351
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:18,751
Is there today found in the past of the people are

1352
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:21,567
The motivation to do so is pretty clear seeing is that it

1353
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:22,335
Inflate their busy

1354
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,895
There's no formal process

1355
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:27,199
Place to audit reserves of

1356
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:34,879
In January 9th of 2004 shell announced that it had overestimated its proven oil and gas

1357
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:36,927
Gas reserves by 20%

1358
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:39,999
Or fruits high 3.9 billion Barrel

1359
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:45,887
At seems really high instances like this make it increasingly difficult to get an accurate estimate of how much

1360
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:48,959
Easily available oil is really out there right now

1361
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:52,543
And how close we are to having to rely on the diminishing returns

1362
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,823
Right bottom line is

1363
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,615
Club of Rome did not come up with

1364
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:57,151
Further

1365
01:06:57,407 --> 01:07:00,991
People making definite predictions about people are kind of dumb

1366
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:03,295
Generally rabideau

1367
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:04,319
But

1368
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,855
There will come a time

1369
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:06,879
When we have

1370
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:09,183
We it's all going to be downhill

1371
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,463
It's just another day

1372
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,743
Right because of

1373
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:14,047
Good methods it'll be needed to

1374
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:15,327
Extract the oil

1375
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,607
It'll be too expensive

1376
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:21,215
It we can't charge people that much for it no no by it those are

1377
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,263
Argument

1378
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,311
Simple

1379
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,847
Prepare for that now

1380
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,151
It's not worth it to prepare them

1381
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,943
That's going to be a disaster

1382
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:31,711
We can do it now

1383
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:40,415
Z-CoiL might have been misleading

1384
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:45,279
You already understand the problem and realize we're being dumb and not fixing it

1385
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,047
Exactly

1386
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:51,167
Aggressively pushing

1387
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:54,495
Planetary government

1388
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:58,079
Nations Global biodiversity

1389
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,615
It states

1390
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:03,455
Very clearly that the human population

1391
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:07,295
For what current level

1392
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,319
Billion

1393
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:14,719
He just repeated the same thing from a different angle he's wide angle

1394
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,815
Calendar

1395
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:20,863
1970

1396
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:29,055
Subsequently

1397
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,895
This is not

1398
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:39,295
The idea of a race specific bioweapon comes from the 1942 Robert

1399
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,575
The sixth column

1400
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:48,255
DNA sequences

1401
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:49,791
Theoretically possible

1402
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,327
Which is kind of scary

1403
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:57,983
Desiree specific bioweapon

1404
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:00,543
There's a paper called the Sunday Times

1405
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:05,407
I posted an article in November of 1998

1406
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:07,967
But this is likely to complete misreading

1407
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:08,991
Fiction

1408
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:20,767
In the aftermath of the release of the article

1409
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:23,327
Vulcan

1410
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:24,863
The Sunday Times

1411
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,167
Planned a follow-up article but most likely due to

1412
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:30,751
Embarrassing backlash never wrote part 2

1413
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:34,079
I also the articles of the authors of the article

1414
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:37,151
Never have speaking about it spoken about it publicly

1415
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:38,943
So the article

1416
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:42,783
That tie was the source for the coverage there's coverage on like wired

1417
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:43,807
Inform report

1418
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:44,575
Of this

1419
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:50,207
That that's where Alex gets this idea those are the two authors from the Sunday time

1420
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:53,535
Never spoken about this ever again

1421
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:56,607
The Forum report and rent

1422
01:09:56,863 --> 01:10:00,191
Dot-com reported that they sold the

1423
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,983
Or it came from South Africa

1424
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,263
As an apartheid weapon

1425
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:05,567
It's all a lot of bulshit

1426
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:07,359
God dammit

1427
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:13,503
There's no there's no support for this anywhere in any credible

1428
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:16,063
What what what is there that because

1429
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:21,951
No it's not a thing

1430
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:23,743
Theoretical

1431
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:31,167
Just like there's no better there's no better proof of like well there's no difference in races or anything like

1432
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:33,215
Here's the best way to prove

1433
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:36,799
That there's no difference between white or black or Asian

1434
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:39,871
Like that train build a bomb just to kill one of

1435
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,151
People trying

1436
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:47,551
I know and they're not suggest that there's no real genetic difference they would have

1437
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:51,647
Already done

1438
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:54,463
Aunt f****** Sabrina

1439
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:58,047
Publix

1440
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,679
Useful

1441
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,983
Now I will say that I

1442
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:12,383
I want to change the channel

1443
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:13,919
This is

1444
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:15,711
Incredibly taken

1445
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,479
Out of town

1446
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:18,015
The idea of a Dick Cheney

1447
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:19,039
You saying that

1448
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,183
I don't want to I don't want to

1449
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:26,719
Ever I'll just

1450
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,071
He's talking about

1451
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:34,911
Change in the future

1452
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:37,727
Using drones

1453
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,775
Technology

1454
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:40,543
She's going to advance

1455
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:43,103
Here's the actual

1456
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:47,967
Advanced forms of biological warfare that can Target specific genotype

1457
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:51,295
Transform biological warfare from The Realm of Terror

1458
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:53,087
Three political useful tool

1459
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:55,135
This is this is merely a glimpse of

1460
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:56,159
Possibilities

1461
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:57,183
Processor

1462
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,463
The transformation not

1463
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,231
Precise

1464
01:11:59,487 --> 01:11:59,999
Prediction

1465
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:03,071
So what are you saying is that along the way

1466
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:04,863
As these things that we

1467
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:07,423
Don't necessarily want evolve into

1468
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:10,495
The Warfare may start using

1469
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:13,311
Biological warfare as a political tool

1470
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:15,871
Whereas before it was just in the realm of terrorism

1471
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:18,431
Context

1472
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:21,759
Will eventually be the

1473
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:22,527
People running come

1474
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:24,063
He's not

1475
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:26,623
He's not saying that like

1476
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:29,183
That's a very

1477
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:32,255
Infection but that's unfair

1478
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,119
Well

1479
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:39,679
Why would they want to reduce the human population

1480
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:46,591
Thereafter power

1481
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:53,503
The overlords of the New World Order

1482
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:55,551
Are now aggressively pushing

1483
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,831
For a worldwide

1484
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:59,391
One child policy.

1485
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:00,671
They're not

1486
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:04,511
It's pretty simple

1487
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:05,279
They're not

1488
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:13,215
I have a really long explanation would look at what

1489
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:16,543
Ended its one-child policy

1490
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:17,311
Right

1491
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:19,103
If

1492
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,383
Yours

1493
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:22,687
And you see that

1494
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:26,271
What possible way could you be like that's a great idea

1495
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:32,927
No way that that's possible I was going to skip past this but I'm going to read anyway cuz you need a little Leo zagami

1496
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:39,071
Senior Life

1497
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,607
It's a one-to-one

1498
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,399
We tried an experiment

1499
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:44,191
Here's how the experiment worked out

1500
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:46,751
It didn't work let's not do it what kind of in

1501
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:52,383
Even if you're imagining an enemy

1502
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:53,407
That would do that

1503
01:13:53,919 --> 01:14:00,063
Leo zagami writes in his book confessions of an Illuminati the time of Revenue

1504
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:02,623
Tribulation leading up to 2020

1505
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:09,279
His information perhaps not surprisingly a source to an article written by Paul Joseph Watson on Infowars

1506
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,047
Brooke

1507
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:18,495
His assertion that Bill Gates and George Soros and all The Usual Suspects are trying to kill off everybody is immediately followed by this

1508
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:19,775
Quote

1509
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:24,639
Is a trendsetter among the false philanthropic Monsters of the elite

1510
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:30,783
From ancient times to appease the gods of the astral plane they offered animal and sometimes even human sacrifices

1511
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:36,159
As I often heard personally during my time in the sects within the networks of the Illuminati

1512
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:39,487
From this point of view the plan to eliminate to limit birth

1513
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:43,839
And forced abortions certainly has a magical significance to the astral plane

1514
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:47,423
Hey Gibby considered as a human sacrifice when done intentionally

1515
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:51,519
At the end of March 2015 a drone pilot made a shocking discovery

1516
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:54,847
I was flying my Quadcopter over the Georgia Guidestones

1517
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:58,943
And found these crazies stains that look like blood

1518
01:14:59,455 --> 01:14:59,967
At the top

1519
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:02,783
Are the Georgia Guidestones

1520
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:05,855
These are

1521
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:06,879
Cited sources

1522
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:13,023
The Drone pilot to I was

1523
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:21,983
That look like one who works for phenomenal place.com

1524
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:28,127
Very intriguing

1525
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:32,479
Because you don't see any stains from the ground at all these Stones look completely normal for

1526
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:38,879
From the ground up

1527
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:41,183
Think of it but it does look like blood

1528
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:47,583
So I guess what he's suggesting is that they're sacrificing people or animals on top

1529
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:53,215
This is the sort of place where you get this

1530
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:56,799
Rhetoric have one child policy

1531
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:57,567
Again

1532
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:59,359
Leo zagami put this in his book

1533
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:02,943
Citing Paul Joseph Watson and then immediately got into

1534
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:04,479
So there we are

01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:11,647
The Shining

1536
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:15,743
Only later

1537
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:20,863
They imprisoned.

1538
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:24,959
Are being made

1539
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:26,751
England in Europe

1540
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:28,287
I want to promise you this

1541
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:30,079
The end of this is very

1542
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:31,871
Having large families

1543
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:32,639
Frowned upon

1544
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:38,271

I think tank in the UK says

1547
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:43,135
Too many kids

1548
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:45,183
What's Megan Planet worse

1549
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:51,583
Panthers

1550
01:16:56,703 --> 01:17:01,823
I taking long trips overseas

1551
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:07,455
Families in our rich country shouldn't have more than two kids

1552
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:11,039
Place to get more than 1 billion

1553

I love him

1558
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:31,775
Can we get a whole can we get ahold

1559
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:32,799
Can we get a ramble

1560
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:36,895
This quote right here a total world population of 252

1566
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:53,279
The actual quote from the magazine from November 1991 was dug up

1567
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:56,095
Panda it is screenshotted online

1568
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:00,703
We got to do it all together that's going to do away with the word foreign

1569
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:02,495
We've got to think of each other as Neighbors

1570
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:05,055
Instead of word foreign we need to use international

1571
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:07,871
Whether we like it or not we're going to swim together or sink

1572
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:12,479
Together we all five billion of us here on this little Earth swimming around in space

1573
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:13,759
There's too many of us

1574
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,807
And most of us are living in correct

1575
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:19,135
If we had a much smaller population over time we could

1576
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:20,415
Heaven

1577
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:27,839
Where we only had one child and maybe over 300 400 years we could cut back to 250

1578
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:29,631
250 300 million people

1579
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:31,167
We can replant or cities

1580
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:37,311
Where there's a Central Area you could walk or ride your bike to work so you don't have to drive 30 miles to work like do in LA

1581
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,079
Bets

1582
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:44,735
That's where we stopped being into this is a quote it's your Rambler

1583
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:51,135
Traffic in LA

1584
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:54,975
So logout

1585

1586
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:03,679
300 400 years

1587
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:06,495
The people just had less kids you would get the number down

1588
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:10,847
Unacceptable not talked about

1589
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:15,967
Whatever we would actually work out pretty well in terms of the amount of people who just died ever

1590
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:18,527
Everyday

1591
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:19,551
Accident

1592
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:23,903
No you wouldn't you just have to wait a long

1593
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:26,463
People have an epic where you just have left

1594
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:30,047
He's right about like the numbers

1595
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:32,863
And stuff like that

1596
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:37,215
A lot of stuff

1597
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:39,519
He's crazy

1598
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:43,615

1599
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:44,383

All you need to know about it

1602

The billionaire

1603
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:57,951
Duke Phillip Phillips

1604
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:05,119
Which is the best which is the best reasoning for why you shouldn't add him and your documentary if

1605
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:06,655
The globalist did exist

1606
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:08,447
And it was all these billionaires

1607
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:14,848
They would allow Ted Turner anywhere Focus

1608
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:23,808
Like legitimately is the world's largest owner of bison

1609
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:30,208
Largely because he has a restaurant that serves bison and doesn't want other people to be able to have us

1610
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:39,680
Mary conservation

1611
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:40,960
Either weird dude

1612
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:45,568
Source this quote but I remember it from an episode of

1613
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:46,848
Jordan Jesse go

1614
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:49,152
Yeah Jesse Thorn was talking about

1615
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:50,432
Seeing him speak at a conference

1616
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:54,016
He's like that he was asked about how he'd been married a bunch of

1617
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:55,040
He's like

1618
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,064
You know what

1619
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,344
Say what you want

1620
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:59,136
I didn't do anything with any kids

1621
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:08,864
That is why you do not laugh

1622
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:15,264
No absolutely not so he gave an interview to fortune in the 2013 that included the following

1623
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,312
Say what you want

1624
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:21,920
What does that mean

1625
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:24,480
So you give this interview to fortune in 2030

1626
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:31,648
What's your prescription for how to manage population that doesn't manage the environment

1627
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:33,696
Well we need that list

1628
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:37,280
Needs to be volunteer

1629
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,072
There's been tremendous progress

1630
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:43,168
In 1950 not one single country has a stable population

1631
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:45,216
They're all growing all 200 country

1632
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:48,800
Now I think forty or so countries have negative or stable population

1633
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:51,104
Japan is losing population rapidly

1634
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,896
And quite a few other countries are too

1635
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:57,248
The problem is at the rate that it's going losing out on the population

1636
01:21:58,272 --> 01:22:01,856
In order to have a really healthy long-term future we need to

1637
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:02,880
Two and a half billion

1638
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:04,672
Compared to

1639
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:06,464
Reply reply

1640
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:12,864
We've got seven seven and a half billion right now that's two and a half that two and a half billion goal came from Paul are like

1641
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:15,168
Who wrote population bomb 50 years of

1642
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:20,032
The good news is that it's able he's around the world choose to have one child starting right away

1643
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:23,104
We move back toward the two and a half billion without any abortions

1644
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:23,872
Population

1645
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:26,432
Control all we need to do is use Family Planning

1646
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:32,832
Look I had five children okay but when I had those five children 50 years ago the world population

1647
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:36,416
The world population was 3 billion

1648
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,720
Less than half of what it is today

1649
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,536
I don't know anyway

1650
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:43,840
Uno

1651
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:45,632
Oldest idea of him being a aunt

1652
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:46,656
Depopulation

1653
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:53,568
Reducing the population but only through voluntary mean

1654
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:54,336
At again

1655
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:57,152
Because if

1656
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:59,200
You get the kind of answer of

1657
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:01,504
I didn't do anything with any kids

1658
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:02,784
Come at me

1659
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:07,392
Say something like that and I was going to be like well I didn't kill anybody

1660
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:12,768
Like what like attributed to Ted Turner and Ted Turner I'll be like I probably

1661
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:15,584
He's actually into

1662
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,912
Activity population in one child policy being enforced

1663
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:19,936

There is no real Citation for everything only

As if we're going to be here as a species

1676
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:52,192
5000 years from now we're not going to do with 7 billion

1677
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:55,520
Anyway

1678
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:58,336
We're going to do with other far more far less

1679
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:01,152

1684
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,216
The population control

1685
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:28,032
Here's a spot about Bill and Melinda Gates

1686
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:31,104
They have a website they have all of their taxes

1687
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:37,504
Information on it that's publicly-accessible all of their tax return

1688
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:43,904
You can find everything that they've ever done everything they contributed

1689
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:44,928
Every president acting like

1690
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:53,120
For full Transparency International a transparency initiative Alex is totally wrong

1691
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:56,192
Unless you think literally everything counts as population

1692
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:57,472
Control freaks

1693
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:59,008
Between 2009 and 20

1694
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:01,568
50 - 5.6 billion dollars to infection

1695
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:03,616
Disease Control programs population

1696
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:06,944
Digital 1.4 billion to combat malaria

1697
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:07,968
Love that

1698
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,808
1.3 billion towards programs

1699
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:16,416
STD and AIDS prevention

1700
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:19,232
11 billion towards tuberculosis release

1701
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:23,328
Coming in at number five doesn't need relief

1702
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:24,608
Believe that to be

1703
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,424
Coming in at number five on their giving

1704
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,216
Productive

1705
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:30,752
That's their fifth Sia

1706
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:32,032
Giving thing

1707
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,336
At all

1708
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:36,384
Which isn't really

1709
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:38,432
Listening population

1710
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:39,200
Control really

1711
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:40,736
900 million

1712
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:42,784
Reproductive Health Care

1713
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,344
End up with about 1 points

1714
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,392
6 billion quarts

1715
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,672
375ml

1716
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:50,720
Towards

1717
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:53,024
Amongst so many f****** other causes

1718
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,584
221 billion dollars in Alaska

1719
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,608
6 years they've given

1720
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:57,632
How much

1721
01:25:58,912 --> 01:25:59,424
Has Alex given

1722
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:01,216
What I would be

1723
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:02,752
Mike Mike

1724
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,288
How much would it take

1725
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:05,824
For Alex

1726
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:09,664
Like legit

1727
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,272
You're giving out billions of dollars

1728
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:15,296
Alex

1729
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,904
How much does it cost to get you to go away you know it would be an awesome

1730
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,768
And be like

1731
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:25,792
I will give you

1732
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:27,072
10 billion dollars

1733
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:28,608
To shut the fuk up

1734
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:30,144
And record the call

1735
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:33,472
Sao Op

1736
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:34,240
And maybe like

1737
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:35,008
No way

1738
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:38,080
Now you've talked him out your release the tape

1739
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:38,848
No no

1740
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:41,152
I think I think you would have to follow through

1741
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:47,808
Know if you reveal that he wanted to go for it and you're pumping and

1742
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:53,440
Like that

1743
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:59,840
Because if I'm out since whatever work like you

1744
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:02,400
If we had Bill Gates money

1745
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:06,496
The way to go

1746
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:12,640
Because if you if you come to Alex I'll give you a

1747
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:13,664
Say yes

1748
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:15,712
He's got to

1749
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:17,504
10 billion

1750
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:18,528
Keep talking

1751
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:19,296
Nothing

1752
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,576
You'll never buy me

1753
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:22,112
You'll never find

1754
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:25,440
Billy

1755
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:30,816
Now I do not interested

1756
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:36,192
I took you down by 1000%

1757
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:39,008
No you haven't really cuz if you have the tape

1758
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:45,152
Matter if you follow through all that matters is getting it from your end

1759
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:47,200
Cuz he's never going to say yes until he has the money

1760
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:56,672
The preliminary negotiations are going to be like I will give you 10 million dollars through shot

1761
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:05,632
I will say yes when I do have money enough though

1762
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:10,752
Well let's get back

1763
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:16,384
The controlled corporate press cynically report

1764
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:17,152
To help

1765
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:18,432
Third-world children

1766
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:25,856
What is the world's most generous philanthropist

1767
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:27,136
When their friend

1768
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:29,696
Population reduction

1769
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:31,232
Warren Buffett

1770
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:32,768
37 Billie

1771
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:34,048
Defending Army

1772
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:35,072
Population control

1773
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:38,912
The headline says that he gave 37 billion

1774
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,192
Charity

1775
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:41,984
Play that at all

1776
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:42,752
There's no ref

1777
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,288
No citation

1778
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,824
Forgiving at the population

1779
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:49,152
What's what's on license

1780
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:50,688
Which

1781
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:51,712
We all know.

1782
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:56,832
Yeah but just all population

1783
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:57,856
Does he currently only has

1784
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:59,136
39 billion dollars

1785
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:04,000
So he gave $37 to charity in 2006

1786
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:05,536
Maybe who knows

1787
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:11,168
The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation donated

1788
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:12,704
The organization

1789
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:13,984
Dedicated to contraception

1790
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,264
Women's Health

1791
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:17,056
Specifically the development

1792
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:19,360
Accessibility of inter uterine device

1793
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:20,640
UD

1794
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:21,920
According to Bloomberg

1795
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:27,040
In 2013 the foundation gave away nearly half a billion dollars to organization

1796
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:28,064
Supporting reproductive

1797
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:31,136
Really cool about the

1798
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:32,416
They did it all

1799
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:34,464
For the nookie

1800
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:35,744
Come on

1801
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:39,584
That's a reference

1802
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:41,888
I got 75

1803
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:45,216
So they did it secret

1804
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:50,336
I went through a bunch of different companies didn't want to bring it back to

1805
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:51,104
Necessarily

1806
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,664
Funding all this

1807
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,736
Massive Research into

1808
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:57,504
The people would be f*****

1809
01:29:58,528 --> 01:30:01,344
Yeah and there was an article on Jezebel even though

1810
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,136
Like if you have an IUD

1811
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:03,904
Warren Buffett

1812
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:06,976
The lot of the funding for the development of them

1813
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:08,768
Was I able to be

1814
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:11,072
Happened because of his funding

1815
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:14,144
Judith disarno former director of domestic programs

1816
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,680
Berkshire Hathaway

1817
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:16,960
Lawrence

1818
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:19,520
Fun said for economic

1819
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:21,312
He thinks that unless women can

1820
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:24,640
Control their fertility and that it's basically their rights

1821
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:25,664
Control their fertility

1822
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:29,760
Are you sore ear sort of wasting more than half of the brain power the United

1823
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:34,112
Includes the contraception program in Colorado

1824
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:37,184
Which provided women with free iuds and resulted in a

1825
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:37,952
40%

1826
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:39,744
Declining birth rates

1827
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:40,768
Teen Mom

1828
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:41,792
And a forty two percent

1829
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:42,560
Santa Claus

1830
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:43,584
Abortions over the course of

1831
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:49,216
Five f****** gears the New York Times reported without the f****** and realizing

1832
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:54,336
So a lot of these initiatives

1833
01:30:55,104 --> 01:31:01,248
Incredibly effective rate of abortion

1834
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:04,064
Pull a f****** utilitarian argument

1835
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:09,440
Well then actually in arguments from all of your racism and bigotry in your life

1836
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:11,744
Oh yeah well women are equal in

1837
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:18,912
If you want to pull some sort of like well women

1838
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:22,752
Get rid of that b*******

1839
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:24,032
If you want

1840
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:25,568
To make the most

1841
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,872
If you want to be the most productive

1842
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:31,968
Recognize that you're wasting a half of a woman's light for whatever it is

1843
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:34,528
Or your f****** destroying all of this s***

1844
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:36,320
Just a petty

1845
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:42,720
Dumb sexist misogynist and then you finally made his unfortunately

1846
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:45,536
Post-capitalist

1847
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:51,168
Know this guy's evil because he hates women

1848
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:53,216
What's your f****** stupid

1849
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:55,776
I'm still mad.

1850
01:31:56,032 --> 01:32:02,176
I've been dealing with some sort of weird roller coaster up and down anger ride

1851
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,368
From Bianca

1852
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:17,024
Didn't come through the audio it actually much better

1853
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:19,584
There's only 10 or 20% of us

1854
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:22,656
Dr. Eric Pianka

1855
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:26,496
The dubious quote

1856
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:32,640
Receiving an award from the Texas Academy of Science

1857
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:36,224
The world

1858
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:37,504
It's too slow

1859
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:43,648
Because it would kill 90% of the world population quickly

1860
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:48,768
Traverse

1861
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,816
His graduate students

1862
01:32:57,984 --> 01:32:59,520
Most frightening

1863
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,152
Local newspaper

1864
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:11,808
Bianca sustained standing ovation

1865
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,952
Groves

1866
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:20,256
So here's what I want to say about Eric

1867
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:21,280
Pianca

1868
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:23,584
Based on what

1869
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,448
He called

1870
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:29,472
For the extermination

1871
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:35,104
I think you might've actually but I think he's one of these

1872
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:41,760
I honestly take you and Eric Pianka probably have a lot in common because I think that there is a common noun

1873
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:47,648
Terms of like behind that are inflammatory in order to sort of provoke

1874
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,952
I think that's kind of his style

1875
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:52,768
Cuz I looked into him bed scene like some of the position

1876
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:53,536
He's taken

1877
01:33:54,048 --> 01:34:00,192
Watch some of the interviews that

1878
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:04,288
I don't know I'm not sure isn't spoken on that list.

1879
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:11,456
Kind of like an a****** but also like my professors like heaven my time to colleges

1880
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:14,016
He's trying to provoke people into critical thinking

1881
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:15,296
Right typically answer

1882
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:21,696
He ends up getting trotted out on shows like Tucker Carlson and had him on and stuff like that

1883
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:24,000
Back to life throws quotes in his face and be like

1884
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:28,352
You're not really that's not really what I said

1885
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:30,656
Destroy Humanity

1886
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:31,424
Well

1887
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:33,472
Whatever

1888
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:34,496
This isn't going to work

1889
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:39,616
I bet he looks like that giant bearded everyone's like the crazy guy

1890
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:41,408
IHOP

1891
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:42,176
For them

1892
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:43,200
To want to do that with

1893
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:55,488
The right-wing would totally invite me on because they be like all he's going to say some s*** about white genocide

1894
01:34:56,256 --> 01:35:02,400
You goddamn right I'm going to say some s*** about score

1895
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:03,936
Kill all white people

1896
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:06,496
You I'm just going to if I was in studio

1897
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:10,592
High Point to everybody in there and then me and then I'd kill myself

1898
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:17,760
The new Lauren Duca Tucker Carlson

1899
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:20,832
From the transcript of the 1999 speech that

1900
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:21,856
Susan reference

1901
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:23,136
To hear some of the

1902
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:24,672
That I was able to find

1903
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,464
But here's what's going to happen

1904
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:30,560
Population collapse is there's going to be a lot fewer of us

1905
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:31,840
Who's going to be diminished

1906
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:34,400
Solutions going to go down which will be good

1907
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:36,704
But that is not going to be much to recover from

1908
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:40,800
Our descendants are going to curse us for the party we took

1909
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:44,128
The party we had that I recommend Richard heinberg book

1910
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:47,712
The party's over oil war in the state of industrial society

1911
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:49,760
This man is thought about these things deeply

1912
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:53,856
The end of oil is good to but it's not anywhere as good as the party's over

1913
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:56,160
Why is people for a long time

1914
01:35:56,416 --> 01:36:00,768
John Stuart Mill in 1858 took issue with the whole business of grow grow grow

1915
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,072
And he said he thought stationary cyst

1916
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:03,840
Made sense

1917
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:04,608
Stable system

1918
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:08,192
Where you don't have bubbles that are going to burst and you're going to go Bank

1919
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:12,032
He said he didn't think people had to elbows

1920
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:14,080
The top two fight struggle with each other to

1921
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:14,848
Just to get resource

1922
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:18,176
But if we could just live in a stable world

1923
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:21,504
Continue to grow and work based on this grow grow grow

1924
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:24,832
Then we could work on The Art of Living become better

1925
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:25,600
Being foreign

1926
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:30,464
And these are some of the things that John alametos that is in the end of limits

1927
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:31,232
To grow

1928
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:32,512
And this is the end

1929
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:34,304
In the sixties when I started

1930
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,352
Starting ecology there was a lot of sand

1931
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:37,376
At the top of the hourglass

1932
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:40,448
Remind short stint of 4050 years as an ecologist

1933
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:47,872
There's not much time left that you can get on an airplane go to Madagascar and study something while you can

1934
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:48,896
Thank you

1935
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:52,224
That's great

1936
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,528
I like this guy

1937
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:59,136
I like this guy I think he's wrong about John Stuart Mill but I like those guys kind of an extreme

1938
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:00,928
Speaker in terms of bikes

1939
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:04,000
Sensationalism

1940
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,792
I think he says these things

1941
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:09,120
Provoca intellectual conversation in a wreck

1942
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:10,400
He's also a geology

1943
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:12,960
Just threw his concern

1944
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:15,776
So cute he's kind of worried about the

1945
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:19,360
Sister more than he is about Humanity

1946
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:23,456
F*** your feelings your feelings

1947
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:24,992
F*** your feelings bro

1948
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:30,624

Spiritual kin

Dr. Eric Pianka

1954
01:37:56,736 --> 01:37:58,784
Not entirely sure if that's fully track

1955
01:37:59,040 --> 01:37:59,552
But

01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:01,856
I will be back tomorrow with

1957
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:02,880
Conclusion

1958
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:08,256
To the end the game coverage where we have completely lost interest in doing this for

1959
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:14,144
Spoiler alerts for tomorrow we get into climate change

1960
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,704
A little bit about that

1961
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:20,544
Super fun stuff so I'll check out that will be back with that

1962
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,312
Tomorrow

1963
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:23,360
But in the meantime

1964
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:26,432

We're people can get together and have messages and maybe I don't know Workshop a meme

1970
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:45,376
Whenever people do

1971
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:49,984
I have no idea anyway it's good place to have some conversations with like-minded policy wonk

1972
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:54,592
If you'd like to go over there and join up the name of the group is going to

Very helpful do appreciate it

1979
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,304
But I guess other than that

1980
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:18,656
This is exhausting and if you all have stuck around for all of this

1981
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:24,032
End game coverage we appreciate it and it will be done after tomorrow
