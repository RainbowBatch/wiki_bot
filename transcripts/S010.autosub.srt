00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,736
Knowledge party.com

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:33,536
We are the bad guys

4
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
Need need money

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,672
Everybody welcome back

6
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,208
A little

7
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,744
Intercontinental

8
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,048
Sneaky

9
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,840
Sneaky Snake

10
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:11,424
Evolved perhaps I forgot how to say snake in French

11
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:15,264
Has bit Rusty Xavier picked up a bit

12
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,800
Snake

13
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,360
Every time

14
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:23,200
That's my favorite part of being here every time because of my partner

15
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:28,320
She grew up in Canada and learn French through

16
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,600
Announcer

17
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:33,696
Every time she's tried to even come close to saying the French word

18
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,744
They just immediately go like

19
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,024
English

20
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:42,400
They don't even be cut you off before you even come close to being like

21
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:46,496
Bonjour there like 9 and suck you

22
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:52,896
My language named for her people who try to speak French which I think

23
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,432
The opposite of

24
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:58,016
Like what I've heard of in in Canada where there's everyone saved

25
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,040
Just saying if you don't

26
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
Give it a shot

27
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:01,856
Yeah

28
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,184
Jordan

29
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,048
We're recording this over Zoom I'm in Chicago you are in

30
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:10,816
Paris France

31
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:16,704
I am in the nicest bathroom in Paris France that I could buy the lighting looks

32
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,752
Terrible that I will say

33
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,896
Set a timer to 6 here so

34
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,456
30 ft away somebody is asleep

35
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,016
Fair enough

36
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:35,392
I don't want to get to it I think this is going to sound incredibly depressing but it's like

37
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,696
About midnight on Christmas for me

38
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,512
The day after Christmas at 6

39
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,536
M4u

40
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,096
And here we are here we are

41
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,680
Like totally normal people

42
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,704
God dammit

43
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:55,616
Yeah it's super good at it left and then everything happened

44
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:02,272
It was like she's going to be weak Jordan will be back and have no big deal

45
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,320
Alex Guzman

46
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,184
Yeah he turns on Trump

47
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,464
Besides

48
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,048
We have to deal with Trump saying that he got the booster and it's great

49
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,328
It's kind of amazing

50
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,912
It is kind of amazing that we have sex

51
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:22,496
At 2 months in the presence in almost holding pattern

52
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,776
Very much

53
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,080
Colvin Colvin

54
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,128
And then the moment I'm gone

55
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
Yeah it's

56
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,528
It's a whenever whenever if possible to

57
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,552
Cover the present

58
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,368
It sucks and then as soon as it's not possible

59
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,648
This a b

60
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:45,280
I'm listening to some of it you know I'm getting it ready for 14 we can record again at it

61
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,352
F****** sweet some of his real father

62
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,912
There's a real schadenfreude

63
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,312
That's actually kind of brings up why we're doing this little Zoom thing

64
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,336
Because

65
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,640
Who knows when you're going to be back honestly

66
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,224
Given the state of the world and international travel

67
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,576
We'd hope that Wednesday will you be back in time for us to have an episode for Wednesday

68
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,880
Probably isn't going to be the case

69
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:11,904
Doubtful

70
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,184
Very doubtful

71
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,952
We're looking

72
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,488
Probably a Friday

73
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,047
You can't leave people with a hole

74
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,863
A week till Friday we got to come in with a little

75
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,631
Something

76
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,215
Crazy to leave people with only what

77
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,775
One episode when we promised them 0

78
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,103
Right it's just not our style

79
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,431
Zero you're getting to up

80
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,551
So I guess before we get into something that I have prepared

81
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
For fun

82
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,623
A bright spot

83
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:47,487
I do have a break spot it is being aggressive

84
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,535
Bluespot just Soleil

85
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:04,383

86
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,223

I love it here

88
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,575
Have you gotten out to the countryside at all

89
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,623
No you literally

90
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,159
Do that

91
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,975
You cannot leave Paris and re-enter it

92
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,071
Without coordinating for like 10 days

93
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:27,935
Made me feel safer than otherwise sure

94
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:34,079
Gorgeous but maybe not that gorgeous not worth it that bad

95
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:38,431
Alside I'm an indoor kid anyways I like City man this is a good

96
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
Danny

00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,015
City I've been to outside

98
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,647
San Francisco

99
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,439
Felt like a a city

100
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:53,279
Paris feels like a city

101
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,303
Yeah yeah

102
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,119

107
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,687
Depends

108
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,551
They're famous for

109
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,183
God damn all of these breads

110
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,719
Are there

111
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:29,119
Walking down the street

112
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,423
Do you want to shop allowed opan

113
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:37,823
So good

114
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,383
Trip when you get back we'll be able to decompress and everything

115
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:45,759
I have a actual bright spot in that is some presents that folks have sent

116
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,039
But I want to wait until

117
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,343
I want to wait until you're here to actually like

118
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,135
Shout out to them but just

119
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,695
Thank you to those folks and well

120
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,023
Rosie of the mailbag whenever you're back

121
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:03,679
But my other bright spot is that with you out of town a little bit of a lighter workload and so I took the time to

122
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,727
To finally do something I've been meaning to for a while

123
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,031
The night is I went and I got an eye exam

124
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,847
And I got some glasses,

125
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,383
So I'm very excited about that

126
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
Yep

127
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,711
I've been putting it off about scissor readers

128
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,991
What's up

129
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,039
All the time glasses

130
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,343
Yeah yeah all the time glasses

00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:27,999
Gotcha I think a lot of the time

132
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,047
You know I don't know

133
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:36,703
I'm just going to wear the glasses looking forward to it a little bit of Adam

134
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
Fishing in my eyesight

135
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,543
Over the last like couple years and I-80

136
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:46,943
It's better to be proactive on that then not and I'm excited for the like to really work

137
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,223
Work on this professor look

138
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,759
I would like

139
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,807
Is going to cut starting to come together a little bit

140
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,855
So I know I'm telling you

141
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,927
When we do all we do you know how we do all of our lives

142
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:08,447
Sure all those live appearances we do

143
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,031
If you are free

144
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
Joe Jordan

145
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,615
Here's here's the deal

146
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:19,967
In your absence I've been trying to get a bit of stuff done

147
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,527
Until like I've been hitting some bases like

148
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,855
Reset Wars obviously I've been going through the reefs at worse.

149
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,951
But also I've been digging into some of the old

150
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
Files

151
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,743
But I've found

152
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
Various

153
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,071
RealPlayer

154
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,375
Things on websites that are long gone

155
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,423
X-Files

156
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,519
Applying for the little audio files

157
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,823
So today what I've got for you

158
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,103
Is a couple of cliff

159
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:51,967
From Alex's show on June 30th 1998

160
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,759
That

161
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,783
AR

162
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,807
So funny

163
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
So at this point

164
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,415
Alex's show is called exposing corruption

165
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,207
Andrea Lee

166
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:02,975
Yes

167
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,863
He also is part of another show in Austin called the freedom report

168
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
But that's not everyday

169
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423
Of the week

170
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,983
I think this is just a weekly show at this point but

171
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,519
Anyway he takes calls

172
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
Sometimes

173
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:23,711
2 today we're going to listen to a guy who's calling in and wanting to talk to Alex about like

174
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,759
Hey man what are you doing

175
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,551
Are you serious

176
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,111
I thought this is where we will start

177
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
With this collar

178
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,231
Very passive person I'd I watch you practically every week Alex year

179
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,559
I got you admit a lot of you as entertainment as far as

180
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,095
The reason why I watching

181
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,655
Good things to

182
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,983
And I'm one of those people that go

183
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:50,079
Okay settle down everything's going to be cool I think everything you know

184
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:54,687
Really what I think there's what are you going to do

185
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,319
Neighborhood

186
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,879
From my grandparents. The ones that

187
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,695
Not my father's parents but my mother's parents

188
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,719
Humble Home

189
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,279
Niceville backyard

190
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,607
And I worked hard their lives and they're not rich

191
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:13,887
Rihanna

192
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:20,799
Wheeless

193
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,127
78 years old war veteran

194
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,431
Lives in South Austin in a humble home

195
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,711
I have to stop here

196
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,783
Does humble home means something like

197
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,879
Is that is that something really specific or is it just like it's not that big of a home

198
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,671
I think

199
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,487
The idea behind Humble Home is

200
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,023
The person who lives in it

201
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,815
Is not embarrassed

202
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:48,447
But also not going to tell people all about it it's not like ostentatious

203
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,263
It's not that

204
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,311
Okay so Alex's Grandpa

205
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,335
Yeah

206
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,895
I'm just picturing the moment

207
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,455
Young Alex says the IRS tribe

208
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,015
Bastille my parents home

209
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,807
Jackbooted

210
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
Thugs

211
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,903
Breaking in the middle of the night and trying to put like little

212
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,951
Suspenders underneath

213
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,487
The house to lift it up

214
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:17,887
Put it on the truck and get it out of that you know I am seeing people coming from black helicopters repelling down

215
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,215
Attaching the house to the helicopter

216
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:28,127
Yeah I think it's probably just as they didn't pay their taxes.

217
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:35,039
So anyway Alex's grandparents have befallen this fate and also some other guy but Alex

218
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:35,807
Nose

219
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
Had a stroke

220
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,207
Bureaucrats Target oil p

221
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,999
Do you sit here

222
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,047
Because they can't stand up

223
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,887
Because

224
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,703
Another World War 2 veteran

225
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
Not there

226
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,007
On

227
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,287
West 37th

228
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,079
$2,000 a fine

229
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
43-inch grass I showed you the

230
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,999
I'm standing up for the people dammit

231
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,303
Oh I understand

232
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,455
I did not call you

233
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:49,535
I got a problem

234
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,471
Grow stronger someday I may do what it takes

235
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,799
Defending this country

236
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,359
The mass psychology

237
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
If you want to

238
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:10,783
I love this so much for the quick Alex's monologuing and his nonsense

239
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:17,183
Book stuff works so much better when he has a cough button and he could just not like people

240
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,071
Great

241
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,631
I'm okay

242
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:33,823
Alex Alex you're screaming too much

243
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
You're an alarm

244
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,383
What are you talkin about

245
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,479
Yes unfortunately the file that I have doesn't have like

246
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,783
Everything surrounding this but

247
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,111
From all the contacts you can get he's Galaxy's talking about the IRS

248
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,903
Trying to steal people's

249
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
Palms

250
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,487
And this guy is saying that maybe he's being a little bit

251
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,279
Over-the-top about it

252
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
Alex

253
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,447
I get it I'm with you

254
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,519
But screaming about it isn't going to do too much good is it

255
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,639
Okay I'm starting to see that this might be an issue for her

256
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,919
Further conversation

257
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:14,527
There's something so awesome about just the juxtaposition

258
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,551
Into that like

259
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,367
Makes Alex is yelling so much funnier

260
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,463
Having a straight man to his

261
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,559
Exactly what you kind of need to

262
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,631
The pierce the the real like these the reality of it

263
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,495
The board would more calling

264
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,775
The straight man in

265
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:39,103
The funnier it is to see Alex loses but mine

266
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
For sure

267
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
So

268
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,687
This caller brings up

269
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,967
Alex

270
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,247
Doesn't really

271
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,295
Use a whole lot of sources

272
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,183
In his reporting that this is where the conversation veers off towards

273
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:57,023
And this this kind of makes Alex angry a little bit you might say

274
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,375
You rely on a source when it tells you something do you want to know

275
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:08,287
Otherwise our sources crap

276
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,871
Saving play for a rainy day

277
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,831
Cheaper Age receive May save thousands of children

278
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,279
DNA transfer going to help children

279
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:34,655
Okay

280
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,983
Children

281
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,775
Call goddess.

282
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,991
Yeah answer the question

283
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,599
You are a child

284
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,671
Child beans

285
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:58,975
Babies

286
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,279
We are the children dumbass

287
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:05,887
Phone calls

288
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,007
Yeah but Alex stormed off his own show

289
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,199
98

290
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,247
We have gone back

291
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:27,647
23 years only to discover that he's not mad at the crew

292
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,743
But he just can't do this for a while I'm going to go to rebroadcast

293
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,023
This color

294
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:39,167
I got to play a video and get the f*** out of here cuz this guy is a child

295
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,471
I like that

296
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,263
Hey Alex

297
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:47,871
Do you realize that everything you do is built entirely upon confirmation bias

298
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,919
What the f*** are you doing

299
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,455
Donut Tire

300
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:57,343
I like this that you know that the sign of an artist

301
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:01,951
I think he's somebody who will do the same thing when they're rich

302
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,487
And when they're struggling

303
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,023
And Tony Alex

304
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,351
Breaking out and storming off his own show when he's a millionaire

305
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:11,935
Pretty awesome

306
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:19,103
Hiding the real Hallmark of a of an artist is to never involved in any significant way

307
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,407
Evolution

308
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,967
You made a point that in the present-day Alex

309
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,271
You know he's not mad at the crew

310
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:32,415
And here's what happened right after this video that I was played in 1998

311
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
LOL

312
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
Hope you're enjoying

313
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
Michelle tonight

314
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,583
We're making a new rule

315
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,119
Nobody goes with

316
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,399
We have no reason

317
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
When do the show

318
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,215
Because every time

319
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,751
Five or six people come up

320
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,799
And hang out in the control room this happen

321
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,359
I don't understand why

322
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,247
This is all volunteer but I mean

323
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,783
We got to bring the public

324
00:17:59,295 --> 00:17:59,807
Important

325
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,599
And I'm not mad at y'all

326
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,439
You still do the job what you do

327
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,999
We just got to keep

328
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,399
The crew

329
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:22,847
Exist outside of time is he right about one thing

330
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,687
No matter what

331
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,967
But it's not like

332
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,063
It's not

333
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,855
The same thing in terms of the

334
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,927
The content that he's putting out it's not the same thing in terms of

335
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,743
Even like a lot of the beliefs that he has

336
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,583
Petulant

337
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,631
Child

338
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,911
Yeah

339
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,191
This is what

340
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:52,543
Visit cautionary tale about people who are very suspicious about

341
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,567
Mental Health

342
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:58,431
Explanation

343
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,455
All of this

344
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,991
It's like when you get down to it

345
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:05,855
Alex

346
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,975
His parents didn't help him

347
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:15,071
He's not experienced any consequences

348
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,607
How do you get

349
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:25,567
I imagine it was years and years of him yelling at his parents and then coming back me like I'm not mad at the

350
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:34,015
Only conclusion that years ago

351
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,623
33 years ago when he was 12 or whatever

352
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:45,023
Scream with the teachers and then with storm out of the room and come back after talking to the counselor and be like look I'm not mad at Caesars

353
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
I'm sorry

354
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,423
Everytime I try to do math

355
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,959
We wind up doing this

356
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,031
But we got a sex man

357
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:02,943
Yeah I found that and I thought like well we cannot bring this to the world now I can't not

358
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,711
I can't sit on

359
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,247
I want night when I hear

360
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,063
1998 I'm not mad at the crew

361
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,415
Broadcast

362
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,719
And then rebroadcast

363
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:20,607
Whenever you get real Angry so Jordan I hope the rest of your trip goes well and you have a safe

Thanks for making time in the bathroom

367
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,543
To do that

368
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:29,823
Of course

369
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:35,711
Disable this is maybe one of my favorite it's not my favorite

370
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,527
Sit in the bathroom and talk to Dan

371
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,343
