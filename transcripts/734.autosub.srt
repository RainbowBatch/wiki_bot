1
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge babe I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

2
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,064
Knowledge fight

3
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

4
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:06,560
Brexit

5
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,352
Alex Jones

6
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,680
We are.

7
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:15,776
Quick question for you what's up

8
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,848
I took a little walk down to the mailbox

9
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:24,736
Boxer to drop off some but instead of making their way all around this great world of Art

10
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,528
And I'm walking back

11
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,344
Welcome back to my house I see a corner store

12
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,672
Okay I don't want to go wander in there so I can find a good snack

13
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,696
What where was it

14
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,512
Okay right on the corner

15
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,304
Very easy to find

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,376
Fits its name

17
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,656
So I go in

18
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,680
Looking for a snack

19
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:48,800
I love novelty I love things that I'm a drawn to things that I haven't

20
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,080
Seen before

21
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,896
So I bought like this apple energy drink

22
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,688
But I still haven't tried yet but

23
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,016
Why is it sounds

24
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:06,208
I mean it's fearful eye-to-eye.

25
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:11,328
Asking if you're afraid of it

26
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,352
Good mood for a

27
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,888
Actually I'm not

28
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:18,496
Beard I'm not scared I'm worried it's going to suck a little bit

29
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,568
But I also got this is my bright spot

30
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,592
These

31
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,640
Arizona

32
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,992
Arnold Palmer half & half fruit snacks those wound up being your break

33
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:35,136
Well here I want you to try one, explain why I need to to you almost

34
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,416
If people don't listen

35
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:42,816
Just listen to this don't know but almost every time we do an episode you have an Arnold Palmer half and half

36
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:47,936
Feisty

37
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,960
And so I

38
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,752
I looked at the packaging

39
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,032
And I couldn't tell

40
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,568
What the f*** it was

41
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:58,432
Because this is an Arnold Palmer is half lemonade half iced tea

42
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,576
To be iced tea gummy bear gummy fruit

43
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,136
I couldn't tell until I was staring at the

44
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:07,904
Front of the pack

45
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,440
Uno indica

46
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,720
Whatsoever

47
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:17,120
I mean other than you're like an Arnold Palmer that means that there's iced tea there's got to be iced

48
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:22,752
Iced tea fruit snack because it shouldn't be at like

49
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,568
I thought the idea was nut

50
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,640
What was nuts the Arizona was making fruit snacks

51
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,248
I think they're

52
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,808
Fine but not great great spot is

53
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,344
The confusion

54
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,160
Yeah that moment of staring at the package of being like

55
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:46,560
Is this half iced tea have fruit flavored fruit snack that is what you are getting novelty for that

56
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:52,192
You're about the mystery it's been a long time since I've stared at a package read everything on it and then like

57
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:57,824
I know this has to be half iced tea

58
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,640
That was fun

59
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,176
And yet

60
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,456
How can it be

61
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,272
I'm baffled

62
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,064
I'm impressed with the hustle

63
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,184
Respect the game of course but the product itself isn't that great

64
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208
Ice-T

65
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,536
It's not it's not like a strong iced tea

66
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:22,655
Steve Weimer though the fruit as was wise

67
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,959
I think some tea flavors are like

68
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:29,055
Maybe underrated in some other settings and I think

69
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,079
You know this

70
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:34,175
Done better could be better

71
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,199
I got price

72
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:40,575
So you know I haven't talked too much about the old baseball

73
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,879
This summer cuz the Cubs

74
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,159
I'm actively

75
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,951
Trying to avoid them

76
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:51,327
The ownership in Chicago

77
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,095
I hear about it

78
00:04:55,167 --> 00:05:01,311
This has been you know how last year I was like I was shohei ohtani is the greatest season of baseball ever put together

79
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
He got better

80
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,615
This year he got better

81
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,639
Well I mean huge

82
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,223
Coming into his own

83
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,623
He's going to do next year I think he's going to kill a man with his greatness

84
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:21,023
He'll just begin to Glow I mean his hair without becoming

85
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
That means

86
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:27,167
If it freezes right around the corner if we end up in a situation

87
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,703
It's just he's the whole

88
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:37,151
Believe that the ultimate baseball

89
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,943
Challenge now is cloning

90
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,991
Show Tommy eight more times

91
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,271
And having him

92
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:48,927
89 hymns play against the best fit the rest of the world has to offer at every position you could have

93
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,743
Person baseball team cuz once

94
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,071
So there you go

95
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,351
But if you're a good enough

96
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:02,239
Picture you don't need that Outfield

97
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:06,591
She used to it while he was pitching in in the League's you know he used to be like hey

98
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:13,247
I got the next three and he'd send the entire Outfield in the team behind him off the field and then he would pitch by himself

99
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,015
I did not know

100
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,063
And he would strike him out three-in-a-row buddy

101
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
Wow

102
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:23,231
What up what up you got to really be confident

103
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,791
Real talk

104
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:30,911
Cuz you're going to cuz even if it's like a but you're going to have to go run for it and then you have to

105
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,727
To tag him so it's going to be

106
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,287
Yeah you got to strike about that's brutal

107
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,871
Okay so if someone bumped

108
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,919
You run to get it

109
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,759
You have to chase them by the

110
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:52,415
Half of the bases no you do not have to be in a Crock-Pot

111
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
Possible

112
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:59,583
It's possible but you know the pictures aren't notorious for being the bestest chasing people down in China

113
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:05,983
I do Maginot fun scenario where

114
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,055
Run back to the base

115
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,615
I imagine that

116
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:18,015
But like the runner would be able to go all the way back to First

117
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,599
I imagine I think I would prefer if this was

118
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,135
Bore Badr day

119
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:29,535
It was a bad picture that everybody do is bad and he's somehow bzo

120
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,583
Outfield at Hilton

121
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,423
5e already like I listen

122
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,727
I got this one

123
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,799
It'll be awesome great

124
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,079
Batman I'm the batter

125
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:47,455
I hit a homerun and then I couldn't walk around the bases to rub it in

126
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:54,111
So Jordan 11 episode to go over excellent talk about October 9th 2022

127
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,647
That would be Sunday

128
00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:02,047
Haha

129
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:08,191
Stuff that I want to talk about nothing just him playing music and kind of mugging to the camera

130
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,215
God I wish

131
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,239
Man

132
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,031
You know what that

133
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:18,687
To me it was a bit refreshing and some back to like 2008 time

134
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,479
Yeah when you just like

135
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,271
Rock out to San Jose

136
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:28,671
There was more of a freedom it's about this a little bit one of the things I hate about

137
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
Does present day stuff

138
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
Hayes

139
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,511
He is such

140
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,047
Like

141
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,839
He chases attention so much

142
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,143
Like I think social media affect

143
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,471
I think the like I mean that's not

144
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,799
That's Not Unusual I think.

145
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:51,199
He's also got like an attention model that a business model that's so base

146
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,759
Based around that capturing attention and

147
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,575
I just I feel like it

148
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,647
Wouldn't have behaved the same way

149
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,951
Previous eras of his career

150
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:06,815
Like his information would be just as bad but he's going to be so annoyingly chasing down like

151
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,375
X Y or Z

152
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,399
What's to try and like

153
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,167
Seem

154
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:14,495
Get a little bit of attention off

155
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,263
A b

156
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,335
I hate to say that it's beneath him because it's not

157
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,383
Here's what I'll say here's a real say

158
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,783
Part of the reason that he can get away with saying that or he could get away with saying he was above the left-right Paradigm was

159
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,575
Not necessarily his political beliefs

160
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,903
It was also the complete lack of care that he gave tours

161
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,951
Like all the sudden you just listen

162
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,231
Turn this track

163
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:41,887
You know like yeah you're above the left-right Paradigm you're just having a good time sing along to a song right now

164
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:45,215
You would have gave that appearance

165
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,519
Meme people

166
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,823
Carpe donktum

167
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,383
Boring ass people like G Edward Griffin

168
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,431
Or like Jim Tucker

169
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:01,087
Like these boring-ass old dudes feeling if you're at a negotiating table with Alex about

170
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,135
Whether or not to listen to his show

171
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
Back then

172
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,695
He would have been able to walk away from

173
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,231
The table you know he'd have been like

174
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,815
F*** you don't listen to my show but now he's kind of got that like

175
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,863
Okay you don't like it now but how about that

176
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:17,471
Have I introduced you to my friend Laura Loomer

177
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,287
All right man away from the table that's nice

178
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
A little sad

179
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:26,431
Anyway we'll get down to business on today's episode

180
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:32,831
First I joined to help cover the cost of mailing to tell Jordan he does a great job too

181
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:39,999

00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,367

What

242
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
Massive

243
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,367
Layoffs

244
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,415

Patient Shirley on stage

246
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,023
What a way to find out your fire

247
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,119
You're just working at Goldman Sachs

248
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:01,215
She got your computer up listening to Little AJ and then you got no

249
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,007
It'd be great if your boss like

00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,847
Called you into their office more like

00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,383
No just listen to this

252
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,271
Keep an eye out if you can get the underlying message

253
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,575
He's going to be proven right

254

Yeah so Alex's is deep until that there's massive layoffs coming at unspecified companies later

257
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,839
This year

258
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,911
And I got to say it is going to be a bloodbath

259
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,191
I'll get to that next shower

260
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,519
Break the stuff

261
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,543
It feels dirty

262
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,591
Black people know

263
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,199
The companies

264
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
But

265
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
I've got to do

266
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,831
And I will do what I got to do

267
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
What

268
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
Added

Really bad

272
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,375
Charizard

273
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,655
As a Christmas present

274
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,447
In late November to kill

275
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,471

00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
They're going to have

277
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,799

278
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,567
Stock market

00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:18,015
Yeah they clear this is

282
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:24,415
Strategic flexibility or absolute plans that they could audible to it any

283
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
Given point in time

284
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:31,839
The layoff start in 2 weeks out helica internal issue for Alex

285

Holding the boom mic was going on but I'm going to be today

290
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:51,807
Out of nowhere spending a bizarre vague conspiracy about jobs

Disappearing in 2 weeks

292
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:59,999
I might see some writing on the wall I don't know I don't know we'll see in six months I might be replaced with a little butt

293
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,535

No one would be able to tell if I hadn't happened already a would be hard

296
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,359
I'm the only true AI I'm the first

00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:21,759

Everything that

321
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,079
Barry Goldwater said

322
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,359
Everything that

323
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,127
Joseph McCarthy

324
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,663
He said everything that

325
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,735
Call shed

00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:00,575
Yammy just one example on there that's fun is Aaron Russo

335
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:06,975
Everything you said came true alright well the person that he said was a member of the Rockefeller family was

336
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,511
The guy was pretending to be

337
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,071
Related to that just happened to have the same last name

338
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:16,191
Write a lot of that I mean didn't come true and he was either a participant

339
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:23,615
Fraud or he was conned by this guy himself most of those people have been in Paris

340
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,687
Or completely convicted of fraud

341
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:35,391
You can't everything you say can't come true if you've got a fraud conviction is deeply involved

342
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,975

You look man

346
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:58,431
The media will tell you that he's not a good guy

347
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:01,247
Do I because of all these people like

348
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,087
Influencing Alex when he was younger he knew all this was coming

349
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,415
Baby got down to the timeframe what year is it would happen

350
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:12,767
You know why because they have worked the highest levels of Corporations and government

351
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,327

00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,215
Some people in my family we're Patriots and said no

00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,127
Farmers Inn

358
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,927
Learn about this is child

359
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,255
The world

360
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,559
It was very venture

361
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,911
Programs you can

00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
Umbreon

363
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,727
What they built

364
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:58,079
We're facing a full-grown New World Order

365
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,615
It's not in

366
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,175

367
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,711

So we're not going to have to wait anymore

370
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,951
Everybody's

371
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,535
Because you're going to find one of the other cuz that's what's going on here

372
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,559
Find somebody

373
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,631
And I don't want to find one of the other

374
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,727
I'ma sit this one out

375
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:32,127
Man I don't have anything to do with it I didn't start anyting

376
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:35,199
Doing clip and I fully believe Alex is telling of his

377
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,223
Younger years

378
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:42,623
When he was a kid and his weirdo John Birch Society family members told him that they were involved in fighting a giant world

379
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,695
Worldwide communist conspiracy those being led by the devil

380
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,743
I thought that was pretty exciting for him

381
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:51,327
Your imagination and ability to immerse yourself in fantasy

382
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,911
Is very strong as a child really fun to create elaborate games

383
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
Escape

384
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,703
The Simplicity or

385
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,519
Boringness or shortcomings of your real life

386
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:03,103
Every kid's played superhero at some point right

387
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:09,503
Cape when I was a kid

388
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,807
Birch Society Bill Watterson

389
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,367
I'm not

390
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:17,952
Here is that Alex is still doing

391
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,864
He's a 48 year-old man and he's never really gotten past that point of experiencing life like a child casting himself

392
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,656
Does the crusading hero saving the world

393
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,424
Evil

394
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,824
When you realize that Alex was just a kid role-playing fighting evil globalist and now he's an adult role playing fighting you evil

395
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
Globalist

396
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:38,176
It's pretty easy to see that he's basically still that same child

397
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,480
Let me put this this way

398
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,248
Replace

399
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,528
Evil globalist with

400
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,320
Pirates and this dynamic

401
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,856
Becomes a little clearer

402
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:52,256
Maturity level is

403
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,328
I mean it is

404
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,120
Eddie's

405
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
Okay

406
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,424
So John Burke's

407
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,824
Society Calvin

408
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,360
Like calvinball

409
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,408
Should be called Schlafly ball

410
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,200
Alright alright and

411
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
You hit

412
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,016
Women in the stomach with the ball

413
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,344
But you can only you can't hit the same woman twice

414
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,136
That's the only rule

415
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,416
Absolute football

416
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,208
Okay

417
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:22,976
Oh my God

418
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:28,864
Maine is bad dad thinks that everybody is out to get him

419
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,424
Yeah but he still rides his bike a lot

420
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,824
That one is still fine and Hobbes is super into the free market

421
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,688
B-hop is the I suppose physical manifestation of Hitler

422
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,992
Okay

423
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,808
Bob's books up talking about the 2nd Amendment

424
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,880
Location of state laws

425
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:57,536
I bet the transmogrifier oh did you with my tax dollars please

426
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:00,608
Doesn't want the wagon to be all that you roads

427
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,424
Anyway yes there's some good new

428
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,776
Play tell you what's coming up now

429
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:13,152
Military news

430
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,688
Is some really good news

431
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,344
But I want to cover

432
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,392
With the good news

433
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,464
And they're all really splendid

434
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,024
And it shows the people are waking up and take an action

435
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,376
Michigan bankroll

436
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,264
Getting into the good news for

437
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,592
PayPal

438
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,152
Came out on Friday

439
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:51,552
We will find you $2,500 per infraction

440
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:56,160
Flash and they revoked

441
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,208
You mean for now

442
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:01,792
So much for so long I told you next Tuesday

443
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,096
Texas Universal basic income

444
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,888
Amazon store credit score

445
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,752
You said yes sir Master how high

446
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:15,360
There's a bit of a misunderstanding about PayPal that's not being misreported by Alex

447
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:18,176
Do you claim a non-existent victory

448
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:20,736
Here's the condensed version of what's going on here

449
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:25,088
PayPal has certain rules about what their service cannot be used for

450
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,416
For instance you can't use a peg assassins or sell drugs

451
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:35,072
Inversion of their acceptable use policy they included on their list of prohibited uses things that quote are fraudulent

452
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,376
Promote misinformation or are harmful

453
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:42,752
This language was subsequently removed from the policy statement which I guess Alex is taking credit

454
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:47,360
Great they never were going to find you $2,500 for spreading this

455
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,128
Information

456
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:54,528
This isn't misreporting of their policy that relates to PayPal's ability to charge you $2,500 if your suit

457
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,832
For doing any of the breaded activities

458
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,368
When using their service

459
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:04,768
Write a flat rate per violation that they assess to protect themselves and recoup expenses that may come from

460
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,328
You using PayPal to do things that they

461
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,608
Explicitly say you can

462
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:15,776
Anyway the story is more useful to Alex the way he tells it but ironically that's how it's spreading misinformation which

463
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,824
We won't get him find by PayPal and

464
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,128
Before either cuz there's a full of s*** narrative

465
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,432
So what why did I hear so much about it

466
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,248
I see so much about

467
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:29,856
Did everybody freaked out about it there was something with somebody

468
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,672
Considerable backlash

469
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,208
Folks

470
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:38,048
You know it take it probably does come down to the fact that

471
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:42,144
PayPal did remove that language from their acceptable use

472
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,448
Agreement

473
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:50,848
But that probably facilitated a larger new cycle because

474
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:56,224
Is that they were guilty about something I don't know

475
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
But that wasn't there which I'm not

476
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,296
Sure I fully Buy

477
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,088
The either way the

478
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,624
The reality of it is

479
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:03,904
You know

480
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,952
You did there's no find that

481
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,720
Was going to be assessed

482
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,280
I'm a look

483
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:12,352
Even within the language that was removed like

484
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,936
You can't use it for things that are fraudulent

485
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,704
Right

486
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,472
Still true

487
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,520
Oh okay well that's good right

488
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,872
How could you use PayPal to do fraud

489
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:30,272
That would be bad weather terms of service be happy about that cuz then people would be like oh you can use PayPal

490
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:36,672
Welfare fraud the government would be like you shouldn't be able to use PayPal for rot I would guess if I had to assume

491
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,464
That language was

492
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,512
I'm something that they wanted to be in there

493
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,536
But

494
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,840
Bethea published it before

495
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:48,960
You get your tweak it a little bit because promote misinformation and are harmful

496
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:55,360
I feel like was going on is that where they said they were like well promote misinformation eventually that

497
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:59,712
It comes down to who thinks what's misinformation and maybe we shouldn't be the people SE

498
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,504
Yeah it's real messy to get involved

499
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,392
Want to be in a situation where you couldn't kick someone off who was

500
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:14,048
You know running B information Empire it was hurting people really didn't want to be associated with

501
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:19,680
Choose the lies that service the accident was put that out without

502
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:23,520
Like realizing or floor finishing the job of fleshing out what those things

503
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,848
But either way I was just Aureus foolish it

504
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,200
Time to time to find your will

505
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,480
Find a spirit

506
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,064
Once we find our soul

507
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,856
Will darkspine

508
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,648
What are huevos

509
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,536
Once you find your brain

510
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,328
What you find your will

511
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:53,984
Twilight

512
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,848
We don't have to do this

513
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:03,200
Behind is trying to scare us to run off the edge of a cliff all I got to do is say no

514
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,736
I come back for real

515
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,064
Appetizers

516
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,976
We got time

517
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,840
This is a bad idea

518
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,864
I'm a swim

519
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,912
It's so easy

520
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:23,936
But you got to do it

521
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,312
These people are out to get you

522
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,456
Criminology

523
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,832
Couldn't believe it was happening

524
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,856
Or didn't even run

525
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,488
Comply with robber

526
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,560
Just makes it worse and worse and worse

527
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,704
When we comply

528
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,984
We die

529
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:01,824
Sure sounds like Alex is saying that if you're the victim of a crime it's because you didn't

530
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,152
Fight back enough yeah he is saying that because that's what he believed

531
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:10,272
That's why you think society would be perfect and polite if everyone is carrying a gun at all times

532
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,832
Because damn you can't be a victim if your arm but

533
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,600
Which is also bowls

534
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:18,976
This is disgusting mentality that Alex's espousing masquerading as a message of empowerment

535
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:24,608
Also to touch on that point he makes about corporations teaching you to comply with criminals like robbers

536
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,144
Really important and

537
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912
Good advice

538
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,544
I worked at a couple of gas stations in my life and I was even robbed at gunpoint once at one of them

539
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:37,408
If you work in a setting like this you will have your bosses tell you that if someone wants to rob you

540
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,688
You go along with every

541
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,504
Everything they're saying unless they want you to leave the store

542
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:45,344
Completely different crime and if you're looking to being kidnapped you shouldn't

543
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,624
Comply would never go to a sec

544
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:53,280
But in the overwhelming majority of cases the person robbing you doesn't want to hurt you they just want money which is replaceable

545
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,328
And the store is likely insured anyway

546
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,984
There's literally no point in fighting back and risking escalation to situation 21 where people would get

547
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,264
Even kill

548
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,568
The same is true in a lot of stores

549
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:12,480
Migraine since I worked at an Office Depot and they very clearly told us that if the alarm goes off that someone left without paying for some

550
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:15,296
Don't chase them just let them go why

551
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:20,160
Cameras up the stolen items just a stolen item you don't have to risk your well-being over

552
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:26,560
In reality there's an issue here where your employer doesn't want to get sued by your family if you're killed on the job then

553
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:30,144
Take me to hit of whatever the robber gets away with it from the Taylor small potato

554
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:36,544
But whatever the motivation is very weird these bosses incorporation seem to care a lot more about your well-being than

555
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:42,432
It is well I mean it's weird to me that people like instinctively want to fight back

556
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:46,528
You know they want to shooting people that like the people

557
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:49,600
Alex does

558
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:56,000
Thinking about the situation I mean the people in like the big news stories to do the thing

559
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:59,072
Where they're like hero saves that every time I'm like

560
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:02,912
All of that compared to your life is absolute garbage

561
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:06,240
You risked your life and you ended somebody else's

562
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,520
For nothing

563
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,080
You know like that kind of makes me feel crazy

564
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,384
That's somebody else's bulshit to

565
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,664
Does not even your garbage

566
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,224
Yet in terms of

567
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,760
Like a robber

568
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,040
Particularly

569
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,064
It's Wyatt

570
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,880
I think I think there is a difference

571
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,160
Impact

572
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:30,560
Is it different if there is a threat to other people or whatever

573
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:36,960
Negotiate a hostage negotiator

574
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:42,080
I would never intervene I would just talk my way out of that I don't I didn't program you for that

575
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:48,224
Think I could

576
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,016
Yeah I just I think

577
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:55,904
I think this is domni responsible people who are the survivors of crime

578
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,952
Talking about

579
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,744
Now we know that Alex like

580
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,024
But also he doesn't like

581
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,304
But he likes him

582
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:09,728
It has been reported in the news that he is gotten off the Trump train at least six times in the past room

583
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,264
8 years 8 months

584
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,312
Something like that how much does an interest

585
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,848
In comparison to make about

586
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,176
Popularity contest

587
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,184
The vaccine poison to it

588
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,424
You love your dad but you wish

589
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,472
He did not rob banks or

590
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,032
You know you know you love your cousin but you wish

591
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,080
You know that text was an arsonist

592
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,128
You just can't help it

593
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,944
Sometimes they don't make him president you want to mean

594
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:55,040
All of my cousin

595
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,864
Seems like you're going to forgive any and all crimes that's proving when Trump said that he could

596
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,400
Shoot a man on 5th Avenue

597
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,216
He was 100% correct in regards to you at least

598
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:16,032
Maybe I just don't have family values but

599
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:22,432
I don't think I care for my cousin if he was an arsonist

600
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,064
Well

601
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,416
Either that or accessories yeah absolutely

602
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,720
I mean it to at the very least

603
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,512
I wouldn't hang out with him

604
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,608
Maybe like family gathering with all the mail so say this

605
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,376
Maybe

606
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,936
The arson is a sign that they need help

607
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:50,336
Oh you care about your family member accepted there an arsonist

608
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:53,408
It leads me to believe that maybe you don't care about them as much as you think you'd

609
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:59,808
Yeah you know I care about them cuz I go to the store and sometimes he doesn't have the money so I loaned him the money to buy gas

610
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,832
Celine that's

611
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:01,856
Caring about

612
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:05,440
Very considerate

613
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,256
I like

614
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,280
Comparison to drop though

615
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:12,608
Well I mean it really does kind of pudding

616
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:16,448
Into relief that they really do know you know what we used to be like

617
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,544
Do they know he's a monster how can they not know he's a monster

618
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,312
Plano

619
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:28,736
He's like a dad bank robber steals from everybody and us

620
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,016
But at least he's our father

621
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,040
Yeah

622
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,624
So there's some other good news that Alex is God

623
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,184
Florida Surgeon General Joseph

624
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,048
On Friday released

625
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:45,376
Maxine

626
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:55,360
The guidance recommends the covid-19 MRNA vaccines for males

627
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,152
1839 years old

628
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,248
The doctor

629
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,784
The studying of a safety

630
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,880
Important

631
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:11,232
Visuals

632
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,768
Has been dismissed

633
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,816
Please report

634
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,352
We communicated to Floridian

635
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:24,032
Release the findings of a self-control.

636
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,824
Hey Siri

637
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:29,664
Which they use to evaluate the vaccine

638
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:33,248
Mortality risk following mRNA covid-19

639
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,880
Study wash

640
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,464
To see what would happen

641
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:52,192
Alex is making up what happened with the study here

642
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:58,592
And the self-controlled study thing isn't that they did it themselves chair it's a style of study where

643
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:00,384
You are your own control group

644
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,152
Bright

645
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:04,224
No idea what he's talking about

646
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,808
Become tradition

647
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:11,392
Will we reach the covid-19 of of the day theme song

648
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:14,720
Yeah I don't think we do this unsurprisingly is b*******

649
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:21,376
The Florida Surgeon General did say this and this is a real press release but the underlying study itself has some critical flaws with

650
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,424
It's designed to the point where one begin

651
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,984
Question if it was a study seeking the particular

652
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,520
Conclusion as opposed to one looking

653
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,312
The determined troop Wild

654
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:35,712
The daily the study does show and 84% increase in cardiac related deaths in people who got mRNA vaccine

655
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:40,576
Red flag that should make you would never rely on this study to report that data

656
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:44,928
The first of there's no authors listed which is really suspicious

657
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:47,488
No one's name is on them

658
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:50,816
They don't have Alan smithee yet the problem

659
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:55,168
Second the paper has not been published anywhere nor has it been peer-reviewed in anyway

660
00:36:55,936 --> 00:37:01,056
3rd and brats most troubling leave the paper just use death certificates to Define death

661
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,384
Us deaths with a code of 130

662
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,408
Through 150

663
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:08,736
D2 which covers quote other forms of heart disease

664
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,016
Included

665
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:16,672
This section of codes does include Cardiac Arrest but the section doesn't cover a number of other heart-related outcomes

666
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,208
That didn't make sense

667
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,744
For them to exclude

668
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:23,072
Did that excuse the data of that right

669
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:29,472
Also someone who has cardiac arrest on their death certificate may have died from something else that led to their heart stopping

670
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,008
It's not precise enough

671
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:34,848
To be helpful in this context at all for what they're trying to assert

672
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,712
Fourth the paper has some issues with who they included and did not include

673
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:46,624
They claim that they excluded anyone who's been diagnosed with covid-19 the limitation section they save this

674
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:51,232
This study cannot determine the causative nature of a participants death

675
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:54,304
We use death certificate data and not medical record

676
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:59,168
Covid testing status was unknown for those who did not die of or with covid

677
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,960
This makes things very

678
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,728
Confusing

679
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:08,384
They had no knowledge of the testing status of anyone who didn't die of or with covid but people who died over with Kobe

680
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,152
Excluded

681
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,176
From the study

682
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:13,248
Seem to indicate they had no idea of any of the people in the study

683
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,016
Head cold

684
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,320
Well it didn't occur to us

685
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,088
To ask

686
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,880
That seems like any

687
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,696
The limitation section even says this later

688
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:28,096
It's unclear what the contribution of asymptomatic or undiagnosed covid-19 infection is two more

689
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,888
For how this country

690
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,680
Contributes to excess mortality

691
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:38,592
I'm real tired of them always using these papers that are basically like

692
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,360
How about this

693
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:44,224
Nah this Harbor right by this I mean this just

694
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:44,992
It's not

695
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:51,392
Solid enough the methodology that

696
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:53,696
It's Kim's this feels like soda

697
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:59,840
Lisa gets to be perfect

698
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:03,424
God I will be replaced by a soundboard

699
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,240
So we got another Victory here

700
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,592
And yes it should it's a sad Victory but

701
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,152
Ninety-nine percent of people I show you the statistics

702
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,688
Two weeks ago again last week

703
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,760
Are not taking the new Pfizer and moderna boots

704
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,552
90

705
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,344
9 less percent up

706
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,976
California New York and other places

707
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,280
You're falling in Europe the Forsan Texas

708
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,328
Bum rush

709
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,680
Into submission but it didn't work

710
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,544
Massive people

711
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,592
Are really waking up

712
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,152
Took the poison shots

713
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,456
Coming on

714
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:48,992
Talk about how you

715
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,272
Got a Medicaid if you did

716
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,368
Intimidated

717
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,696
Bullied beat over the head into submitting to it

718
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:06,656
Exactly sure where Alex is getting his 99% number but it is fair to say that and not the number of people who've gotten the new boo

719
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,936
Booster is pretty low

720
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:14,592
That could be because Alex aside is winning the war of ideas or it could be that the CDC in the government is asleep at the wheel and terms

721
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,128
Providing messaging and

722
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,920
And the population is burnt-out and can

723
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,688
Confused

724
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,224
Or maybe it's a third thing

725
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:20,992
Yeah

726
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:27,648
Whatever the case I want to make a take a second here to point out this new trend analysis show it feels to me like this

727
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,696
Signals is growing disinterest in covid

728
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,464
Conspiracies

729
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:37,120
These gals literally every day about a new piece of information that proves conclusively that he's right about everything so you can

730
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,400
Trying to see how he wouldn't

731
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,168
Have much

732
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,216
More territory to cover on that front

733
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,008
Hard to think of Marta

734
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:48,640
Get if you believe the things that he saying this story has been covered and it's pretty much case closed

735
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,664
It's redundant

736
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,432
Yeah

737
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:56,320
So you need to find a new way to keep moving and everyone's going to get bored of the covid-19 of the day

738
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:59,904
It's stale repetitive and you're really preaching to the choir

739
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:05,280
The audience already thinks the vaccine to death shots given that over and over again is just Manata

740
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:12,192
However with Alex Lee Moyers dumb movie and Glenn Greenwald the glowing review in the mileage that he's been able to get out

741
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:15,520
How to things like that channel 5 interview and his book released

742
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:20,640
Any attention that he's getting from The Trial I wouldn't be surprised if I were to seeing some new eyes on his product

743
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:23,200
If some of these folks probably got back to Maiden

744
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:29,344
If you have a new initiative and you make them scared of this death vaccine that's killing million to the Duval ready taken

745
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,880
And there's no solution

746
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,672
Could be hard to make money off them

747
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,696
Conversely

748
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,488
If you start to come up with cures

749
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:38,304
Solutions to protect yourself if you've been vaccinated

750
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,840
Then you can create this intense

751
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:44,192
Fear about the vaccine and then sell people at Placebo to alleviate those fears

752
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:44,960
The trick

753
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,728
Brilliant

754
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,360
We heard somebody that got on our last episode The Caller who called

755
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:57,759
Just confused

756
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:04,159
Was stored at the wrong temperature probably already have these cracks in the facade of like the death shot

757
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:04,927
And all this

758
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:11,583
The explanation for why everyone isn't dying like Alex has insisted they are needs to start to be introduced and I

759
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,863
I think that's what we're seeing right

760
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:19,519
My only hope is that the solutions that Alex has found for talking to these alleged doctor's leads for the reintroduction of doctor

761
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:23,871
I need him to tell Alex on are the answer is drinking your own piss

762
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:30,271
And see if Alex goes along with it just got to happen we got to get the piss doctor back ultimate test

763
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:34,879
Like how far are we willing I think we should just have a series of escalating like

764
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,671
Oh drinking your pistol do it

765
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:37,695
Oh you'll do it

766
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,719
Alright well

767
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,255
Let's go to the next one

768
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:46,143
Well I just imagine a backroom deal in kind of thing where where doctor group comes any like I want to tell your audio

769
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:52,543
It's drink around piss never I can't do that right now checkbook

770
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,847
Rose on this how many zeros do you think you could

771
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:58,431
Salix Alba

772
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,479
Alright okay

773
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,783
Apple juice in my glass

774
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,575
I'm not going to actually drink the piss

775
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,647
PayPal stories is one of Alex

776
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,183
Is Big narratives today

777
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:09,951
And

778
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:12,767
He says something while you talkin about it that I thought was

779
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,791
Really weird

780
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,119
The good news is people went crazy Elon Musk

781
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,935
We need criminal charges against

782
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,519
Hey Palatine I got call saying hey

783
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,383
I know he helped found it here

784
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,175
That's weird

785
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:35,039
Scream 4 out to be defending Peter teal although he has done that a little bit recently but

786
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,063
That's not what I'm

787
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,343
I'm catching on this clip

788
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:43,999
To me is that someone or multiple someone's called Alex and blame Peter teal for this ruler

789
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,791
PayPal which Alex had to refuse

790
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,583
And why would that happen

791
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:53,215
Why do people call Alex and say hey this rule it PayPal is bad why is Peter teal allowing this

792
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:58,591
Indicate that these people calling Alex understand some kind of a connection between the two of them

793
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,455
Something weird

794
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:09,855
Well I mean it sounds like there's a guy who has an absurd amount of money that who might think that

795
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,647
Some sort of number like

796
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,671
10 million

797
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:19,071
Maybe maybe a little less maybe a little less than 10 on the invite have access to cryptocurrency

798
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:25,471
I can take a flyer on take a flyer on this just to keep the guy going somewhere seems really interested in fund

799
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:31,871
Ending a lot of really weird right-wing bulshit has connections to the people behind Alex

800
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:38,271
Documentary somebody who would be willing to actually build a readouts like Alex dreams of doing

801
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,807
Mites

802
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:43,135
I have honestly no solid evidence of

803
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:46,975
Anything involving connecting Alex and Peter Thiel.

804
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:56,191
Alex has no reason to bring up the people are calling him and say this is Peter Thiel

805
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:04,383
I went through a long time but was really invested in pretending Peter till didn't exist interesting

806
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,943
About this particular situation

807
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,967
Is because

808
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,503
So few people would be

809
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,551
Be capable of making it possible

810
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:18,207
In the game of guess who we've taken out a whole lot of those things real quick you know we made it to be your meaning

811
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:24,607
Bitcoin donation otherwise

812
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,655
Isaac can't you know they can't have happy

813
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:33,311
Right so easy on the list humblest but also I think that there's probably a lot of

814
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:35,871
People who maybe became crypto rich

815
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,663
Like

816
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:44,063
You have no idea whose, those people are they may have access to way more research resources than you even think

817
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,599
500 million dollars

818
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,135
10 million is f***

819
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:47,903
Nothing

820
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,439
Not that much

821
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:54,047
To take a flyer is he sick or on just take a flyer on it

822
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:57,631
Another big news and this is where they intersect with your world

823
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,679
Reborn

824
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,215
And very exciting

825
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,495
Positive

826
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,519
Things are app

827
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:09,407
Kanye West in a big part 2 interview

828
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,431
Weather

829
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:13,759
The ratings

830
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:15,551
I've been busy I've been watching

831
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,575
Tucker lately

832
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,343
I want

833
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,111
What's lighter

834
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:22,463
Kanye West

835
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,583
Kanye West talking about Infowars

836
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,447
So

837
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:37,567
Look I have nothing but a thief for people suffering mental anguish in

838
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,895
Be clear about that but I also think there's a line

839
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:44,735
I still can feel for people who are acting out in Manukau outburst

840
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:51,135
But when things that they're saying or doing are destructive and they've had multiple opportunities to have the resources

841
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,159
Uso

842
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:54,207
The primary concern that I have shipped

843
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:56,511
From their well-being to the damage that their action

844
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,535
It's going to have on others

845
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:01,119
Is well past that line

846
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:04,703
Is it really too often that he comes up in our travels because

847
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,751
I went to the dicey history with Kanye

848
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:13,663
When he was first doing his I like something and hang out with Candace Owens Alex head Owens on the show as a guest from time to time

849
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,967
Kanye was going to come on

850
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:17,247
And that never happened

851
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:21,343
Kanye Maga hat so Alex

852
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,623
Right everything was well

853
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,647
Chef

854
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:30,047
In July 2020 Alex got mad at into Connie didn't interview the publicly announced his split from Trump which wasn't cool

855
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,583
So close to the election

856
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,607
Particularly

857
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,911
And like that Kanye was once again evil

858
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:39,263
Which announces world really just translates to someone I can't use to make a buck

859
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:45,663
Kanye's doing tension in public again and talk about it so it's a pretty safe bet

860
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:49,503
He's pretty all right after all

861
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,551
Blues weapon following the

862
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:54,623
Current timeline here's a quick breakdown of what happened

863
00:47:55,903 --> 00:48:02,047
Kanye should show in Paris where they showed off Kanye's new t-shirt that just said white

864
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:02,815
Lives matter

865
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:05,119
This was stupid on a number of life

866
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:07,423
Obviously the intention was to shock

867
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:11,263
But if I was shocked by this it was a shock without depth

868
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,287
There's no art

869
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,335
It's a banal kind of shocking

870
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:18,943
Lazy shocking if shocking at all I heard that and I went

871
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:19,967
Okay

872
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:24,831
There wasn't an artistic or fashion based reason that this was happening

873
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:30,463
Challenging anything I was just hey look at me wearing this shirt that's crazy

874
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:36,863
Fashionable purse Aid is going to be received with eye rolls by most

875
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,167
Celebration by the right-wing media

876
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,703
Hello pretty much would have

877
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:45,823
According to outlets like Fox

878
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,151
Because he dared to wear this shirt is a brave and artistic statement

879
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:55,807
I'm not sure if this is true or if any woke mobs are in battling him I kind of think that most people's response

880
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:59,391
Students. Was along the lines of all this is happening again

881
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:06,303
Wearing a white lives matter shirt while hang out with Candace Owens is going to be viewed as a racist type Behavior

882
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,119
We're four years past

883
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:12,191
The point where he didn't interview and said that slavery was a choice

884
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:15,263
Tony did get some negative feedback from his shirt

885
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,055
Coming from P Diddy of all

886
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:22,687
Kanye which we we know about because

887
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,455
Scotty poster

888
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,503
A picture of the text on Instagram

889
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,319
Kanye parently Road

890
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,855
I didn't like our convo

891
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,391
I'm selling these peas

892
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:33,439
Nobody can get in between me and my money

893
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:37,535
Never called me with no bulshit like that again unless you ready to green-light me

894
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,071
Because anybody that got

895
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:39,839
On that

896
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,607
Tease me

897
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:45,983
This brings up an important point that is a cognac is selling these shirts at its core this is

898
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,263
Basically just a blessed

899
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:52,127
He asked for an address to meet with Kanye because his actions are causing distress

900
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,919
Kanye responds quote

901
00:49:54,175 --> 00:50:00,319
This ain't a game I'm going to use you to show the Jewish people that told you to call me that no one can threaten or

902
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,367
It's me I told you this is war

903
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,671
Not great

904
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:05,439
Okay

905
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:09,023
Pretty offended by this

906
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,047
Getting the boot

907
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:12,095
So we went to Twitter and posted quote

908
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:17,727
I'm a bit sleepy tonight but when I wake up I'm going desk on Freon all caps

909
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,007
Jewish people

910
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:24,639
Wow the funny thing is that I actually can't be anti-semitic because black people are actually do also

911
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:31,039
Is Megan tried to blackball anybody who opposes your agenda

912
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:34,623
Who you think created cancel culture

913
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:41,791
People really didn't enjoy this seeing as it's essentially swimming and anti-semitic Trope sand this says really just ask

914
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:43,071
Stone's throw away from home

915
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,095
Cross the Nile

916
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,375
The recap

917
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:51,775
This was an episode that began with him wearing a racist trolling t-shirt to a fashion show with racist roll Candace Owens

918
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:55,871
And ended up with publicly declaring that he's going to war with the Jews

919
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,919
This is a mess

920
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:00,735
I think people would be shocked

921
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:07,391
If they started scratching their favorite hip-hop artist yeah to discover how many of them are

922
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:10,719
Interested or dabbling in black is realism

923
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:12,255
Yeah sure

924
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:14,303
I mean there's a

925
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,327
Definitely

926
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,399
Some popular

927
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,703
Hendrik is for sure

928
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:22,751
Like you know how Kyrie 6

929
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:27,103
Weird stuff and people are like he shouldn't play basketball for some reason like

930
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,639
You don't know where you're at

931
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:29,663
Okay

932
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:36,575
Maybe not as much as Kanye

933
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:38,367
Nope nope

934
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:41,183
No he's going for in the middle of all of this

935
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:45,279
Sat down with Tucker Carlson interview that's a bit painful to watch

936
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:51,423
It takes a certain level of scumbag to exploit somebody who's clearly unwell and it turns out

937
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:56,799
You kind of expect that desperate grifters like Owens would take any opportunity to attach

938
00:51:57,055 --> 00:52:01,663
Since I was Kanye regardless of the contacts because it gets their name in the media

939
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,431
Tucker

940
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:05,759
Kind of hoping he realize that he doesn't even need to press

941
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:12,415
Like he's a big enough star and he's effective nothing pushing his talking points that interview and Kanye is more of a lion

942
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,951
Ability than it is an opportunity

943
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:20,607
What if like a day or two after your interview your interview subject who you spent two days of your show argue

944
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,655
Giving his singing an insightful person

945
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:24,959
Declares that he's going to war with the Jews

946
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:25,983
What's up

947
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:32,895
Or even worse what if it comes out that he said that kind of stuff in your interview but you cut it out of the finished product to make

948
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,687
More palatable for your audio

949
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:41,343
What is footage of leaks that shows you had every reason to suspect that your interview subject was unwell

950
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,671
And also clearly expressing anti-semitic views to your face

951
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:51,071
But then you decided those things out so you could exploit That Celebrity to put his celebrity behind your

952
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:54,399
Music this is a risk you wouldn't want to take if your Tucker

953
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,679
Yeah yeah

954
00:52:55,935 --> 00:53:00,287
This is a situation where everybody is making it worse

955
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:03,103
Yeah nobody's nobody's coming out being like

956
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,895
Hey let's try to help

957
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:08,223
No everybody's like that's money in my bank too

958
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:14,623
I think there's some people expressing that there should be some help here but I also think people are a little bit burned out on that

959
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:21,791
Egg someone should help Kanye West for a lasso

960
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:26,143
This is at the point now where I'm more angry with the people who book

961
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:28,447
Like the booker for Tucker

962
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:31,519
Got Kanye

963
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,311
He was like f*** this is a gut

964
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,335
Instead of like

965
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,359
Ima

966
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:38,175
Weird sociopathic person

967
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:40,735
Who's willing to do this s***

968
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,271
Money like that's crazy

969
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:44,575
It's it's

970
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:51,231
You don't have to put them on TV. It's not a requirement there's nobody who's like all man if you don't put Connie

971
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:53,279
TV family dies

972
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:59,679
Anna Merlin over advice just today as we were

973
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,703
Recording this episode

974
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:04,287
Gotten ahold of unaired footage

975
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,567
Kanye interview

976
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:06,847
Another turns out

977
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:07,871
Tucker censored

978
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:10,687
Quite a bit that didn't fit The Narrative of the story that

979
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,967
If you wanted to tell

980
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,759
Like for instance he cut out quote

981
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:16,063
Numerous anti-semitic sentiment

982
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:21,951
Here's one of the clips advice provided that seems weird the Tucker wouldn't let him say that's on the show

983
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:25,023
Planned Parenthood was made by Margaret Sanger

984
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,071
Anon eugenics

985
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,607
With the KKK

986
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,143
2

987
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,423
Control

988
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:32,959
The Jew

989
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:33,727
Population

990
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,007
When I say Jew

991
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:35,775
I mean

992
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:36,799
The 12

993
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:37,823
Tribes of Judah

994
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,103
The blood of Christ

995
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,383
Cool

996
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:41,919
The race

997
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:44,223
The people known as the race black

998
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,247
Really are

999
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,527
This is who are people are

1000
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:47,807
The blood of Christ

1001
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,343
This as a Christian

1002
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:50,879
Is my belief

1003
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:53,183
Yeah so that's

1004
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:53,951
Something

1005
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:59,839
Interesting fact

1006
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:00,863
Settings

1007
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:01,887
Extreme

1008
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:08,287
Yeah apparently there are many instances of weird comments surrounding Jewish people like

1009
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,055
Subway

1010
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:12,127
Biting my tongue on my political

1011
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:12,895
Opinion

1012
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:15,199
Because I thought it would be better for my children

1013
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,735
And now you look up

1014
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:19,295
And my kids are going to a school

1015
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,575
That teaches black

1016
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:21,599
Kids

1017
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,647
A complicated Kwanzaa

1018
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:26,463
I prefer my kids new Hanukkah

1019
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,743
In Kwanzaa

1020
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,279
At least will come with some

1021
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,583
Financial engineering

1022
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:34,911
Kwanzaa doesn't sew

1023
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:37,215
They don't teach even Christmas itself

1024
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:37,983
Price match

1025
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:47,455
Clearly hateful but equally detached from reality things to say that Tucker just decided his audience didn't need to know about

1026
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:53,855
Including any likely discussion about how we thought that a fake planted in his home to sexualizes

1027
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:58,207
This was apparently a child of someone he knew who he became convinced was an act

1028
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,999
We don't have audio this

1029
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:05,119
Because Vice chose to withdraw withhold the footage to respect the privacy of the child and their family

1030
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:07,423
Traffic is probably

1031
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,959
Knowing all of this

1032
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:11,263
Tucker starts his show on the 1st

1033
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,031
Today of this

1034
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:13,567
Seems a little bit unbelievable

1035
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,103
Days ago.

1036
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,479
Unveiled a t

1037
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,271
White wine

1038
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:24,319
The responsible

1039
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,183
Shock

1040
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:30,975
Rage

1041
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:31,743
There was no

1042
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:32,511
Excuse

1043
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,327
What is legitimate

1044
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:36,607
Freemason

1045
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,167
Etc

1046
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:40,959
Ceiling missing

1047
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,055
What was the

1048
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,455
It's at the end

1049
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,063
If we ill

1050
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:00,159
He's a mental

1051
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:05,791
You can judge me

1052
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:06,559
For yourself

1053
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:08,863
He has his own

1054
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:18,335
Tucker was sitting right there while Kanye rambled all this s*** and cut it all out to launder the perspective Kanye West

1055
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:20,383
Pressing into something that he could mark it to his audio

1056
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:27,295
Is aggressive anti-abortion positions it is vocal Christian

1057
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,063
Oprah Tucker

1058
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,343
So long as the audience

1059
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,647
Doesn't actually get all the information

1060
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:36,255
Tucker's whole game is that he's giving you this information so you can make up your own mind

1061
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:42,655
Kanye's crazy because he wears a white lives matter shirt and loves Jesus we decided to talk to him to see for ourselves

1062
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,679
You be the judge

1063
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:50,335
Course the next very important step in that game is to make sure that you don't show the audience certain things that'll make him

1064
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,383
Clearly unwell

1065
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,431
See what that is what

1066
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:59,551
Yeah yeah I mean I will also say that you know

1067
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:03,903
This this coincides with Kanye music sucks

1068
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:07,231
You know like what is music started sucking real bad

1069
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:09,791
And then you started doing the far-right grift

1070
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:14,143
I'm not saying that people stop buying his music cuz it sucked and then he went to the next

1071
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,167
Most

1072
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:15,935
Easy Griff

1073
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,471
Maybe imaginable

1074
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,007
For a guy like Kanye

1075
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:25,663
Music started to suffer from him being distracted by a load of b*******

1076
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,943
A mental unwell

1077
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:30,271
It's hard to make good music if you're talking to Candace Owens ever

1078
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,295
That is true

1079
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,599
The interview itself is

1080
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:34,367
Hard to watch

1081
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:38,719
Connie Rambles but very pointless personal Grievances and his divorce

1082
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:42,047
We talked a bit about political stuff but goes off course quite a bit

1083
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:48,447
Watching it even before the vice article came out I got the strong sense that stuff was missing from this interview and even so

1084
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,471
Stop Meandering

1085
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,775
It felt overly edited but yeah

1086
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:53,311
Yep still not concise

1087
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,615
What I'm saying is that I don't recommend

1088
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,151
It's kind of a dumb interview

1089
00:58:57,407 --> 00:59:00,479
Particularly the part where Kanye complains by the Democrats in the Clinton

1090
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:03,551
Wanted to get to his wife so they can take advantage of

1091
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,575
Push their messaging

1092
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:08,671
20 sitting next to a guy was doing exactly that just without his wife's involvement

1093
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:14,047
At the end of the interview series Kanye briefly mentions Alex Jones

1094
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:19,935
So you know that course is huge news on Infowars biggest news on the planet

1095
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:25,823
The complete section where this comes up which is where

1096
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:28,127
Great

1097
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:29,919
You know I felt like

1098
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,711
Like the people at the Gap knew about

1099
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,735
School shooting

1100
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:36,575
That Matthew McConaughey was talking about before it even has

1101
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,391
It was so in sync

1102
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,927
The information

1103
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:42,463
And then I heard about it

1104
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:43,999
On the radio

1105
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,815
Driving I was like am I in The Truman Show

1106
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,095
Right now

1107
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:51,423
Tell Candace she's got to watch Truman Show

1108
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:54,239
You have to watch

1109
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:56,287
School shooting in Uvalde Texas

1110
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,567
I'm not saying

1111
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:58,847
That

1112
00:59:59,359 --> 00:59:59,871
They did

1113
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:00,639
But it felt

1114
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:01,663
So in sync

1115
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:03,711
Ideas like

1116
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,503
Media Rush

1117
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,783
Over the 78

1118
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:07,551
Specific

1119
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:08,575
Outlets

1120
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,623
Influence

1121
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:15,743
Meanwhile it was a coordinated message I think it's what you said

1122
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,023
Meanwhile

1123
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,095
3

1124
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:23,679
Bears

1125
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:24,703
The same amount

1126
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,471
Kids getting

1127
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:26,495
Hilton Chicago

1128
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:27,775
Every week

1129
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,823
But there's no coordinated mess

1130
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:30,591
Message about that

1131
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:33,407
Alex Jones territory

1132
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,455
No I think you're telling the truth

1133
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,527
And it's okay if you do

1134
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:42,111
What I'm saying is I get they keep on using

1135
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,415
So he's crazy is crazy

1136
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:45,695
Fang

1137
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:46,975
And it hurts my

1138
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:47,743
My feelings

1139
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:49,791
When people say that

1140
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,071
Hurts my feelings.

1141
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,351
That people can ask me

1142
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:54,143
Hey are you okay

1143
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:55,423
Especially

1144
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:57,215
I got an ego

1145
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:58,751
Someone that's less

1146
01:00:59,263 --> 01:00:59,775
That's within me

1147
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:00,543
Having the right

1148
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:01,567
Acme

1149
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,335
About me

1150
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:04,127
Like their doctor

1151
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:08,223
What you want to put some ice on it

1152
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:09,503
Hoo-boy

1153
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:12,575
It's not a complimentary mention of Alex Jones

1154
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:18,975
That was Kanye recognizing that even if people think he's nuts there's a further level of nuts but he could have Chief which is Alex Jones

1155
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:23,839
And yeah I would say he's on Alex Jones to appear speculating

1156
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,631
Advance knowledge of the shooting

1157
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:27,167
I'm sure what that means

1158
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:32,287
Also real quick

1159
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,567
Breaking news

1160
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:39,199
It's because they're all reporting on the same with very limited information that's been released by the authorities or Witnesses

1161
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:42,527
And no one wants that you put ice on your head but the fact

1162
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:45,599
You're mad at the people less successful than you are

1163
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:48,671
Concerned about your well-being you should probably put the meds in your head

1164
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:53,791
I have a Litany of thought about this interview but most of it really isn't germane to the matter here

1165
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:56,095
Where intersects with our show is that

1166
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,375
Tiny little mention of Alex

1167
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,167
And the fact that he was part of a

1168
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:01,983
Anti-semitic breakdown that's still ongoing and

1169
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,007
But folks like Alex

1170
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:05,567
Kentucky are actively covering for and enable

1171
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:06,335
Right

1172
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,383
So beyond that I don't know the interview is

1173
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:15,295
Take what you can from it I guess we want to watch it have 2 hours to throw away

1174
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:17,087
Probably 2 hours

1175
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:20,927
I would say that we're we're looking at a guy who is being

1176
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:24,255
Cold stuff by people around him

1177
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:28,863
Surrounded himself with Elvis's yes-man

1178
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,679
And yet at that but they're also conservative right-winger

1179
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,447
You know like

1180
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,983
If they were like yeah Kanye

1181
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:36,799
Whatever you say is true and also the government

1182
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:40,895
Play into the kid inside your house if we like yeah everything I say is true

1183
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:45,759
I'm also one thing that I am saying is that the government planted a child in my house

1184
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,551
Are you like that seems very

1185
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:50,111
Reading books

1186
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:56,511
To to get this information people say all this stuff about this man but we wanted to know the truth

1187
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:59,839
We're going to show you the Good the Bad and the Ugly now we're also going to

1188
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:06,239
I cut out a bit of the Bad and the Ugly because it's a little bit at the battery

1189
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:10,591
Probably skew the audience's perspective and we clearly want them to land on

1190
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:11,615
Conclusion

1191
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,431
Go f*** yourself Tucker

1192
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,199
Wow

1193
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:16,991
Alex

1194
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,783
Wants to rationalize

1195
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:21,087
Kanye's feelings about the police shooting

1196
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,367
And took his workouts

1197
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:26,463
6 years ago

1198
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:29,023
Hillary did a town hall

1199
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,119
Super 8

1200
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,399
HD Dustin here

1201
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:38,239
Kids answer questions look like a movie it was produced

1202
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,031
So good

1203
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:44,127
But you could look at it and say this isn't a town hall

1204
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:44,895
This looks like

1205
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:45,663
The movie

1206
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,199
How did she say until live

1207
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,223
Townhall

1208
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:50,015
When it's all

1209
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,295
Super HD

1210
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:53,599
Comments

1211
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:58,463
No Mike's messing up no audio problems no video problems do nothing

1212
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:02,047
You can look at something say that is no one mad at the crew

1213
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,863
Purchase live in Rio

1214
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:12,287
These events didn't happen we were saying this look

1215
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:15,103
Control manipulative

1216
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:17,407
Melted it was not alive

1217
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:19,967
Call Hillary

1218
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:23,551
With actors

1219
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,999
So you can see

1220
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,815
When something synthetic

1221
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:42,495
Point was we could see

1222
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,799
That it wasn't a live feed

1223
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:45,823
It wasn't real

1224
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:51,967
I walked in a easy to the park

1225
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:53,503
Store but your bottom

1226
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,087
Like a table have fruit

1227
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:00,159
Fake fruit

1228
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:01,439
You don't need to go pick it up

1229
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,207
You even look

1230
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:04,511
You just know it looks too good it looks

1231
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:08,095
Too bright it just doesn't look right you know what a real pair looks like

1232
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,119
What a real

1233
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:12,191
What a real orange looks like

1234
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,471
You know

1235
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,591
That's all Kanye

1236
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:25,247
Exactly

1237
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:26,527
What kind of plastic

1238
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:27,551
The fruit

1239
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,855
Is it is it

1240
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,135
We don't know

1241
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,927
But we know it's fake

1242
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:39,583
For those of you who don't remember Alex's basically creating an elaborate fantasy story out of the Revelation in 2016 that

1243
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:40,351
It's Hillary took

1244
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:42,399
Pre-screen questions at a town hall event

1245
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:48,031
And one of them was asked by the then fifteen-year-old daughter of a state senator who happened to be a Democrat

1246
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:53,919
Premier Alex's extrapolated this attitude being an entirely faked evidence that school shootings are fake

1247
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:58,271
Now if Alex wanted to really blow some vines with this conspiracy

1248
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:02,367
The fifteen-year-old girl at that town hall was named Brennan Leach

1249
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:04,671
And that name rings a bell

1250
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:09,279
It's because she went on to be a senate aide who was photographed transporting the Electoral ballot

1251
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:10,815
On January 6th

1252
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:14,143
Some folks Miss reported that she and other aides were

1253
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:18,751
Texting these votes during the rioting but in reality it was a photo from the morning

1254
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,775
Check this is Peru

1255
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:20,543
Perfect for Alex

1256
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:26,943
It proves the January 6th with a with a Clinton false-flag in the planning's been going on since that town hall when this kid asked

1257
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:33,343
Wow this is what happens when you pay attention to detail helps get Kanye

1258
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,391
Sit in this conspiracy

1259
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:36,159
Leeches Jewish

1260
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,695
That should raise his suspicions

1261
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:38,463
Oh my God

1262
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:44,863
The point is that Alex's nonsense about this Clinton Town Halls meeting listen even if there is something to this it doesn't justify anything

1263
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:45,887
Conclusions about that

1264
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:46,655
Uvalde shoot

1265
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,191
Also I haven't

1266
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,727
Two friends

1267
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,007
Attic fruit when they were really drunk

1268
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:57,663
How much of a boozer Alex's this probably isn't the best analogy could be making several plastic

1269
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:00,223
Lansing my day I have had a good time

1270
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:03,551
They look real for real

1271
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,599
Did the

1272
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:06,879
The judgment

1273
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:11,231
Of a drunk when it comes to plants

1274
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:14,559
You know you don't worry too much about causing

1275
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,327
Infected that's a

1276
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:17,631
Cause and effect

1277
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:24,031
Alex does what he does affect waking people up naturally like Kanye West

1278
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:29,663
Kanye West comes out and wears a white lives matter shirt

1279
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:32,223
We shall shirts at all

1280
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,271
The black lives matter

1281
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,575
Brown lives matter

1282
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,135
White lives matter

1283
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:40,671
What he said is I figured

1284
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:45,023
Which absolutely our shirts has black lives matter

1285
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,655
He did that

1286
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:56,287
Stop the division and go against the system he has a lot of courage and so does Candace Owens

1287
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,615
This is all about

1288
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:09,343
She knows that this apologize to me on air

1289
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,647
That's okay

1290
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:15,487
You blown through a lot and you grown a lot your great leader now we

1291
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:16,767
We're so blessed you're there

1292
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:20,095
But that's the whole point is we woke up Kanye West

1293
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,679
Jones did that

1294
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:27,007
It means all you did that so

1295
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:30,079
Instagram boxing

1296
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:31,615
Boxing

1297
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:41,855
Give him the things that Connie has been saying I don't think I would want to be taking credit for waking him up nor would I want to say the by audien

1298
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:43,135
Responsible for it

1299
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:49,791
I understand the short-term gains being gift from cloud chasing here but considering what Alex is saying he should know

1300
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:51,839
What he's associating himself with

1301
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:55,423
Oz clear cover for Kanye's anti-Semitic

1302
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:01,567
Instagram post here by implying that the Tucker interview in the white lives matter shirt is the reason that he's kicked off the platform

1303
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:04,639
Instead of Connie posting private messages between him and Diddy

1304
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:05,407
40 threatened

1305
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:07,967
Things to use him as an example to the Jewish people

1306
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:09,503
Who told Denny to contact

1307
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,551
Alex knows what he's doing

1308
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:17,951
Kanye is useful in terms of giving the appearance of not being racist while simultaneously using his celebrity to push

1309
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:19,743
Dumb extreme right-wing politics

1310
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:20,767
To a different audio

1311
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:24,095
And Alex knows that comes with the byproduct of spreading

1312
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:26,911
Intense anti-semitic ideas to that white audience

1313
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:29,727
Holding up to your own audience at least tacitly

1314
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,263
Alex doesn't care at all

1315
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:37,407
This is probably at least partially due to the fact that Alex's ideology is underpinned by similar antisymmetric ID

1316
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:46,111
Alex complained that he woke her up but you've been very public about her experience moving to the right

1317
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:52,767
In high school Kansas received a settlement of over $37,000 when she sued the school board for failing to protect her from

1318
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,303
Racist death threats and harassment

1319
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:57,375
Norm Palace was her lawyer

1320
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:01,215
In 2015 she started a website called degree180

1321
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:05,567
Where there was a republican contact

1322
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:07,359
Bummer on that side

1323
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:14,015
She followed this up in 2016 the website called social autopsy which was supposed to be a site where online bullies would be on

1324
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:16,063
Liberty was taken away

1325
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:21,183
Everyone thought this was a terrible idea and would just lead to doxing and targeted harassment

1326
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,999
It's super easy to see the way the besides

1327
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:29,631
Concept could be used for evil particularly when it's being run by someone with his flimsy principles as Owens

1328
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:36,287
Zoe Quinn the target of a lot of the gamergate harassment apparently sent Owens a message warning her that this wasn't a good

1329
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:40,127
Idea was likely to become the target of harassment or selfish

1330
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,151
She followed through with it

1331
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:43,199
Unsurprisingly Owens

1332
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:44,991
Start getting harassed

1333
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:49,855
List conspiracy the Quinn

1334
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:52,927
Wasn't warning her of the result of her terrible idea

1335
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:58,815
She was actually threatening her that if she made this website Quinn would let loose team of online harasser

1336
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:02,655
And just like that Candace Owens became a right-wing conart

1337
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:06,239
And then started working

1338
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:08,543
A turning point USA what she continued to do

1339
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:14,943
Until she made those comments back in 2018 about how Hitler would have been totally cool if you didn't have aspirations outside of Germany

1340
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:16,479
So weird how these

1341
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:22,879
Percentage of people who go onto do not see s***

1342
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:24,671
Coincidence

1343
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:31,071
Anyway once she became ill black she was hooked to help Elevate her status in the right-wing media scam and

1344
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:33,119
More than happy to platform

1345
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:40,031
I would guess that in the interview she said something like you were the one who woke me up to flatter and ingratiate herself with Alex but she's been

1346
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:43,359
Really consistent with our gamergate Zoe Quinn story

1347
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:44,639
In other venues

1348
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:50,015
For fun I want to see how this is like doing with Kanye

1349
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:52,575
Anti-Semitism story

1350
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:54,111
When you read this

1351
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:55,647
You had

1352
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:56,415
No idea

1353
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:57,439
What the hell

1354
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,231
I had I had

1355
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:00,255
Had no idea

1356
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:01,279
When I read this

1357
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:02,559
What the hell

1358
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:03,327
He was talking about

1359
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,119
Inspired

1360
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:05,887
She's not answer

1361
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:07,679
What is

1362
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:08,959
Defcon 3

1363
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:10,495
Did he mean

1364
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:11,263
Death

1365
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,287
Convert 3

1366
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,079
Which would be a military

1367
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:14,847
Defense

1368
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,871
Position not

1369
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:16,639
An offense

1370
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:17,663
Offended

1371
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,687
A military

1372
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:19,455
Defense

1373
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,223
Expedition

1374
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:25,855
Seems like she's got a good angle on this one

1375
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:28,927
Melted cheese is Christ

1376
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:37,375
I can't imagine saying that I mean if your throat if you can really say that

1377
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:40,191
That with a straight face yeah I might pay you for that

1378
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:46,591
Show me the closest skill that I don't have the person who's like the problem with Hitler as he was a globalist totally

1379
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:51,199
Maybe you can say stuff like I know but man that's

1380
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:54,015
Defense what he said desk on

1381
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:57,599
What does he mean by that

1382
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:59,391
Everyone knows

1383
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:05,535
I think if you say you're going blank on the Jewish people think blank on the

1384
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:10,911
Going blank and then you capitalize Jewish people

1385
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:16,799
I'm typing what there's no positive

1386
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:23,967
The spin by the way I watched most of her videos on the first 10 minutes are about herself

1387
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:25,759
A Hitler

1388
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:32,159
Alright what did you think of is about yourself Lulu out

1389
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:38,559
Jewish people and give them twice as much s*** as I already have yeah man twice as many kids

1390
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:41,375
Today

1391
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,679
Wow

Excited stell's cuz he got named checked in Celebrity saying something on Tucker of the context

I'm not getting into Alec

1397
01:13:55,967 --> 01:14:00,319
Jones territory here than Tucker saying no but also it's okay if you do

Marriott

No.

1400
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:07,231
You get back to this PayPal story and Alex

1401
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:08,255
If my

1402
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,047
Feel like he's killing time here

1403
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:12,351
Only a two-hour show on Sundays

1404
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:14,655
But it still feels like he's just riding water

1405
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:17,983
New terms of service

1406
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:22,079
And said if we don't like what you say about Elizabeth shoes

1407

The first thing I thought when I saw that once I got off here Friday cuz I missed it

1415
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:51,263
It broke in the morning

1416
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,943
I thought was supposed to

1417
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:06,623
I don't want to do this

1418
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:07,903
I don't have to

1419
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:09,695
People should get

1420
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:10,975
Don't need me to tell him

1421
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:13,023
Don't use your brain

1422
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:15,839
What's the big elephant in the room here

Wow

1435
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:50,143
Tone-deafness that they think they can just do this and get away with it

1436
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:51,679
What's wrong with the Book of Revelations

1437
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:56,543
Marcus Bay

1438
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:59,871
Maybe I should over-the-phone shop and oh my gosh

1439
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:03,967
Oh my God

1440
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:04,991
This big deal

1441
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:07,807
Then some collars going to call in

1442
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:08,831
And they're going to figure it out

1443
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:14,975
This point I was like he's waiting for a caller to say something that he can say is this

1444
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:18,303
He's just stalling but he does stuff even more he goes off like I saw

1445
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:21,887
Denominator

1446
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:23,423
I spent hours

1447
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:28,543
Cut going all through all social media trying to find anybody making the Ford I found one person

1448
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:30,591
Seems like a real waste of time

1449
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:35,199
Probably not true but we get to it

1450
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:35,967
He

1451
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:36,735
Spend

1452
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:43,903
Way too much time not getting feels like he not only didn't land the plane he crashed it

1453
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:47,487
Into a giant ocean filled with Jell-O

1454
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,255
And it's

1455
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:49,023
Just garb

1456
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:55,423
Sully sullenberger landed the plane

1457
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:58,495
In the Hudson that's what happened

1458
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:04,383
So here's what it is here's the big enchilada that person was able to figure out and peed out

1459
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:07,199
What is it that so Criminal

1460
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,991
It's so evil that so wrong

1461
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:15,391
I'll tell you. I think most of you already know

1462
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:18,207
Anointed themselves

1463
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,583
Cannot just decide what

1464
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:24,863
Speeches okay and what

1465
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:26,143
Vine

1466
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:28,959
I want you put up adoption

1467
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,567
But what's even bigger

1468
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:36,895
Drum roll please

1469
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:43,295
That's offensive to drum

1470
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:45,599
That is effective

1471
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:47,135
Hang on you

1472
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:49,695
Watching what you say

1473
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:52,767
Google

1474
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,119
It's not just that you're saying something

1475
01:17:58,655 --> 01:17:59,935
When you're using PayPal

1476
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:03,007
Watching you

1477
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:06,847
Bailing you

1478
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:09,919
Buying on you

1479
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:15,295
So this is where Alex is stupid misreporting of stories becomes creating stories out of whole cloth

1480
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:21,951
He doesn't understand the underlying story about PayPal and how this was defined they were going to charge you is related to fees and replace

1481
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:24,767
In your account if your sued for crimes that involve the platform

1482
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:31,167
Because it doesn't understand the underlying story gear inches is a loose grip on the headline these red on black right way

1483
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:35,007
Blog 2500 dollars

1484
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:37,055
Did you write a post on your blog that says they

1485
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:38,591
Climate change isn't real

1486
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:40,895
This introduces a problem

1487
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:44,735
How is Paypal going to know that you're blocking about unapprove things

1488
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:45,759
Can find you

1489
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:49,087
In order to accept the inaccurate

1490
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:53,951
Version of this story there needs to be some mechanism in place for it to even work logistically

1491
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:57,023
Alex has written that part of the story for the audience pulled

1492
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,559
Straight from his imagination

1493
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:02,399
Consider how stupid all of this is if you believe Alex's version

1494
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:07,775
PayPal would have need to set up a super expensive part a i part manual system

1495
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:12,895
The monitor all of its users Behavior off site to see if they're doing anything that they could get them fine

1496
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:17,503
That would require spying on like 400 million people would be really expensive

1497
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:19,807
He'll be expensive to operate but the in

1498
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:23,647
Infrastructure to do it would also take Millions upon millions of dollars to

1499
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:24,415
The setup

1500
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:30,815
So they think all that money in knowing that they're going to be able to recoup their losses with this fine system the other than start raking

1501
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:31,583
In that sense

1502
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:34,143
Censorship

1503
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:36,959
The right-wing media is complaining about the terms of service

1504
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:42,591
And just like that years of investment and implementation of a worldwide censorship AI system

1505
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:43,871
Have to be thrown out

1506
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:45,919
The terms of service just go back to the normal

1507
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:49,247
This is legitimately what's implied by Alex's Meredith

1508
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:52,575
This is what you have to accept whether you realize it or not

1509
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:56,159
In order to take on Alex's version of the story which is inaccurate

1510
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:58,975
Because he didn't actually read the story or look into this at all

1511
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:01,279
I'm just making sure it up on the fly to freak out the listener

1512
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:03,327
I

1513
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,863
I'm going to go out on a limb

1514
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:09,471
And I'm going to say that it would be hard to sell the shareholders on that move

1515
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:11,263
Of like okay guys

1516
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:17,408
Here's what we're going to do I know spying on everyone BlackRock or whatever I know you like making money

1517
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,688
How about this

1518
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:25,088
We spend all of it on spying on everyone

1519
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:28,672
Going to be good cuz we'll find them sometimes right

1520
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:30,976
If they stop doing bad things

1521
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:37,632
Our whole business model goes out of the window

1522
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:38,912
Problem

1523
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,704
But at that point we'll live in a Utopia

1524
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:45,568
I will already be I will take the hit

1525
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:51,968
Ideal World PayPal size flyer on this one

1526
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:59,648
Surveillance

1527
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:00,928
Can you machine

1528
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:08,096
I can't text no PayPal's in your phone

1529
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,912
Encrypt anything either

1530
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:18,336
PayPal sees all think that maybe it would be limited to how you use PayPal as being

1531
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:23,712
The main deciding factor of whether or not they can cause a problem

1532
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:24,736
Like they couldn't

1533
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:25,760
They couldn't

1534
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:29,344
They could not be like one time on Twitter

1535
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:31,904
He said something me that's that's

1536
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:32,672
You can't do that

1537
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:34,976
No not really

1538
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:38,048
Kicking people off social media for off-site actions

1539
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:44,704
It would be something like you know you're engaging in hate rallies

1540
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:53,408
Use our platform to organize and gather an audience went off platform

1541
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:55,200
He's trying to

1542
01:21:56,736 --> 01:22:02,880
Go to Defcon 3 out there if if

1543
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:03,648
Himmler

1544
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:06,464
Was like making a lot of money

1545
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:10,304
Off of his bad people and we were helping him do that

1546
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,656
That's bad for us we don't want to do that that's bad I mean like

1547
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:15,936
Okay so like

1548
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:17,728
There is also something

1549
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:18,496
Things that are like

1550
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:19,776
Clearly all right

1551
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:20,800
We know what you're doing

1552
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:23,104
Maybe it's not on platform

1553
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:23,872
Like

1554
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:26,432
Let's say for example you started a GoFundMe

1555
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:28,480
And you pretended that it was

1556
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:29,248
Just to get like

1557
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:33,088
Surgery for your dog or whatever but in reality you're funding

1558
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:33,856
4

1559
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:38,208
Neo-Nazi newsletter that you wanted to put out

1560
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:39,232
Bright

1561
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:45,632
And that's all you know is that maybe maybe your dog does need surgery

1562
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:52,032
A ignoring it

1563
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:54,080
The point here is

1564
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:56,640
How to spell championship

1565
01:22:56,896 --> 01:23:02,016
This is what happens when there are like misunderstandings the underlying story that Alex has

1566
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,296
If that

1567
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,064
True

1568
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,112
Then what else is true

1569
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,440
The first thing isn't true

1570
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:12,256
The second thing is built on top of it is just

1571
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,048
Absurd

1572
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:17,376
Excessive bulshit it is fun

1573
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:23,776
Because you can say the premise of the idea and people will just kind of already be on board with it

1574
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:26,848
When if you even look at the premise Hugo

1575
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:27,872
That's not possible

1576
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:29,408
In a fundamental way

1577
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,736
PayPal has put in a kill switch inside everyone's heart

1578
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:33,760
No

1579
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:40,416
No turn away if you take the false version of this story and then exaggerated the way that Alex does

1580
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:45,536
With the implications of his Fall Story of course it's a lot easier to get really angry about it

1581
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:46,816
Stop words

1582
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:48,352
To describe this

1583
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,144
PayPal

1584
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,728
Call came out instead

1585
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,264
Platform

1586
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,800
What you're buying what you're doing

1587
01:23:58,848 --> 01:23:59,616
Watching you

1588
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:03,456
Well who is watching a criminal

1589
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:05,504
Who are they

1590
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:09,600
Global Entry

1591
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,208
The company

1592
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:15,488
Needs to be

1593
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:16,512
Shutdown

1594
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:19,328
The people that didn't need to go to

1595
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:20,864
Prison for the rest of their life

1596
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:24,960
And they're run by the big Banks

1597
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:27,776
Late in the year

1598
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:30,336
2022

1599
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,360
It was a good time

1600
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:36,480
Come out and say listen you dirty filthy American

1601
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,760
We're watching your ass

1602
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:41,344
21

1603
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:42,880
Kankakee Walmart

1604
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:44,672
What a group

1605
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,976
Is really pathetic

1606
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,072
Put up with

1607
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:52,352
Crap like this

1608
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,168
People

1609
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:57,216
Saying we've got

1610
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:03,872
Waking up to

1611
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:06,432
F*** you

1612
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:08,480
F*** you

1613
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:10,528
Mayweather

1614
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:14,624
I got it I got to go he brings a really good point

1615
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,392
Okay

1616
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:18,976
They will find you $2,500 and kick you off

1617
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:19,744
The platform

1618
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,512
No

1619
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:22,304
As far as I'm concerned

1620
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,840
All Things Considered

1621
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:27,168
That's not that bad as far as tyranny is concerned

1622
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:28,192
Okay

1623
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:34,080
I'm fine 2500 that's a lot of money for me but it's not going to bankrupt me I'm not going to go

1624
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,664
And I'm kicked out and I can't use PayPal

1625
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,480
Their father service to can't go to debtors prison

1626
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:41,248
No

1627
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:43,808
Continue to

1628
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:50,464
Find me I don't work I'm not. On their platform anymore

1629
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:54,816
Well they could do some damage on your credit

1630
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:57,888
Have you consider this

1631
01:25:58,144 --> 01:26:04,288
I didn't want the social credit score who's there

1632
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:10,688
1 * surveillance no that's not true that. Truly cuz they kick you off the platform in terms of being able to

1633
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:17,088
Use it.

1634
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:26,816
I guess they ordered cost fallacy is why they

1635
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:30,400
In order to find you then I guess it would imply that they would stop

1636
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:32,192
After they kicked you off the platform

1637
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:33,728
But

1638
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:38,592
Going out I think there's probably something else going on here

1639
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:44,992
Creating 30 dossiers literally everybody so they have leverage or something to you

1640
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:48,320
Kind of a Battlefield Earth scenario

1641
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:49,344
Alright

1642
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,416
I don't know this is a great idea from there

1643
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:54,720
I was exhausted I watch

1644
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:57,792
All of the Tucker interview

1645
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:58,816
Alex's s***

1646
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:03,424
And I just heard him say the transgender Mafia I'd like

1647
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:06,752
I'm out of here

1648
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,544
This sucks

1649
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:10,336
What is Sunday

1650
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:13,664
You do hey pal narrative

1651
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:15,712
Conspiracy of the day

1652
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:19,552
And Alex not realizing that Kanye was not compromised

1653
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:23,392
You know for it for as much of a Christian as he professor

1654
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:29,024
Message to be considered not doing his Sunday show and going to church instead I think we'd all be better off

1655
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,048
Jokes on you

01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:31,584

1659
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,288
Yeah whatever

1660
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,872
The text Mars's Church though

1661
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:47,200
Which is another guy who seems to have a problem with Jewish people

1662
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:48,736
Yeah weird

1663
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:50,528
All over the place now it's as well

1664
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:52,576
