Alexandra Thurston color

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,112
Two years ago I moved into this apartment actually we've done this entire podcast in this

3
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:28,928
Interesting

4
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,584
As of like just a short while before

5
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,448
Like a couple of months

6
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:43,008
We started this podcast

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,592
We've not Rick we've not done this show outside

8
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:56,320
That's fair to live

9
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,160
Is it not always been

10
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:08,352
Call me up at six months

11
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,656
The new knowledge site

00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,424
Headquarters

13
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,544
Is

14
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,336
Chicago real estate is

15
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,384
Pain in the ass

16
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,664
It sucks

17
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:26,016
Anywhere suck

18
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:30,880
You have Apartments

19
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,416
They all know

20
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,208
Did they hold all the cards

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,232
They are in in

22
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,280
Tire control

23
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,560
And

24
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,328
They do not

25
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:45,216
Like I remember moving into my old place

26
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,496
I like

27
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,824
Maybe six years ago

28
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,872
And I got a super great deal

29
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,712
Like they were going out of their way

30
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,528
And then over that time span

31
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,320
Raising the rent and raising the rent

32
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,672
Cost of living

33
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,208
Whatever

34
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,744
Did you know that you can

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,536
Say no to that

36
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:15,936
I didn't know that Joel just the other day

37
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,216
I was complaining about how

38
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,032
Is there a Zurich

39
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,568
You know he could just say like

40
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,384
I'm not going to pay that much how about we say twenty bucks

41
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,664
Extra

42
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,200
It's perfect

43
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,248
Crazy

44
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,600
Keep you in

45
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,624
Look what the f***

46
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,256
Right I was never do that to eventually it got kind of silly

47
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,328
But I see there for another year because I was like

48
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,888
I just don't want to have to

49
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:50,752
Fight series of fights a Non-Stop

50
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
Pretty rocks

51
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,712
I couldn't

52
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,760
I lost my job

53
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,808
And I had no income

54
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,856
And I couldn't break my lease

55
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,928
So I just started finding people on Craigslist

56
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,256
And there were a bunch of weirdos

57
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,792
1

58
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,120
Weird but there was this one dude

59
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,448
He was super cool

60
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,544
This is important to the

61
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,568
The story

62
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,336
He was black.

63
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,616
Okay

64
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,176
And I was like f*** yeah you're the guy to Subway

65
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,992
And he's sending his

66
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,296
Requesting all that stuff

67
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
And they were like

68
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
Your credit

69
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,440
Which in Chicago real estate is code for

70
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
Your bike

71
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,792
Significantly

72
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,072
So what I did

73
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,496
Gave me his pay stub

74
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,776
Edit was

75
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:02,176
Who's all right okay

76
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,504
And so I was just

77
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
You pay me right now

78
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,392
Which is against the law

79
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,583
Dangerous

80
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,471
Somebody came around to my apartment from the real estate

81
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,495
Company and they

82
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,567
And he was like

83
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,407
A while now

84
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,735
They were like that's not okay

85
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:43,391
Email the guys like no you could have supplied I'm just I just stay in here

86
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,415
Mirror

87
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,975
I'm watching the

88
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,279
Anything

89
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:55,679
There's a thousand possibilities

90
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,495
He got a cosigner and they're like whatever

91
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,359
I guess at that point what are you going to do

92
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,407
You know you already got someone

93
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,967
Squatter's rights

94
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,271
Level of conversation right

95
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
Fruition

96
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,575
So

97
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,327
Take a moment

98
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,935

Refrigerator it would be delightful and extremely helpful

120
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,399
Frustrating

121
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,727
You just go you see apartments that look like

122
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:10,079
I've been out of the loop it's been a long time since I've been a part

123
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:10,847
Hunting

124
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,871

00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,175
I'm really starting to gain a day

126
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,199
Appreciation

127
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
The people who take pic

128
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,247

Because they make them look amazing

130
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,183
Cuz you just do CDs

131
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,719
Apartments they look amazing

132
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,023
Pictures and other profiles online

133
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791

It's crazy yeah

137
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,031
I've just I've had so many

138
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,567
Dead ends of run

139
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,359
I have I have some

140
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
And I think things

141
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,175
Going to workout with

142
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,199
Back to normal pretty

143
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,247
Yeah but for now

144
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:53,599
We missed Monday and this is going to be a little bit of a weird episode also in addition

145
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,671
That some of that I got to talk about this

146
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:03,839
Life as we know it is only compounded by what's going on

147
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,191
Speak with

148
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,751
An episode we talked about Paul Joseph Watson leaving

149
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,567
Merry Christ Robert Evans

150
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:19,967
Came in and did that bonus episode of Me about

151
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:26,111
Fantastic

152
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
But he tried to do Oreos have

153
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,695
Breakdown

154
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,231
Because he knew that the neck

155
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,767
De Paul was announcing that

156
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,791
He was leaving

157
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
He was in a

158
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
My working

159
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
In theory is that

160
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,447
Wheatley emotional state having a breakdown

161
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,495
He was also drunk

162
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,567
Motivated by

163
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
Reality

164
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,175
DePaul

165
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,711
That's a high-stress situation

166
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,759
The only thing that could have made that better is if

167
00:08:55,551 --> 00:09:01,695
When was like

168
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:08,095
Great job they do that Alex knows that he has to be in studio on Wednesday

169
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:13,983
Because balls make that announcement

170
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,031
And then Alex is gone

171
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,079
David Knight hosted on Thursday

172
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,639
I hosted on Friday

173
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:27,039
Hosted on Sunday Monday

174
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,575
I really wanted to

175
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
Continue the story

176
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
Because the pieces

177
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,647
That we saw there at the end

178
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
End of last week

179
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,975
Right

180
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,999
This is big

181
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,583
For sure am I I was getting very self-conscious

182
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,887
Maybe I misinterpreted

183
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
Pieces

184
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:45,983
Right

185
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,007
And then when I

186
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,031
Look in the night

187
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,311
Try and find new stuff

188
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
The cover from the present

189
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,359
I see apps

190
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,687
Alex Alex is gone

191
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,503
He's missing in action on his own show

192
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,575
Scheduled vacation

193
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:06,975
Immediately after he has a freak out during an SB anything session and Paul announces he's sleeping

194
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:12,095
He's on a galleon doing it

195
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,167
Ethan saying I don't I don't accept the explanation

196
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,191
But he's on a vacation

197
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,751
And honestly I was starting to take the

198
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,519
But he might be dead

199
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,079
I don't like

200
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,407
Like I started

201
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,711
Tuesday I started watching Owen

202
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,479
Cover

203
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,551
He look like he was going to cry

204
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,111
Ocean

205
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
Severely looking like you

206
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,671
But his eyes were red

207
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,719
There was a reddish yeah

208
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,047
He was distracted looking all over the studio as if

209
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,887
Something was going to break in at anytime

210
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:54,079
We saw that Alex was a broken was a shell of a man

211
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,359
After all that

212
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
He had a

213
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,663
Interview with Steven Crowder

214
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,687
Run louder with Crowder

215
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,991
That came out I really can't believe that

216
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,391
It was prior to the AMA

217
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:16,351
He was not nearly as f***** up

218
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,167
There's no

219
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:19,935
Rio Linda

220
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
No signs of

221
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,823
I didn't know how any of that was possible I didn't

222
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:26,847
The real

223
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
Deeply

224
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
Goodbye

225
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:36,319
But Alex called in his own show

226
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:42,719
Start a website

227
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
Still alive

228
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:48,095
I don't know if we would ever know if he wasn't

229
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,887
But if it's really

230
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,935
Confusing and

231
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,215
And heavy

232
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,007
Trying to wrestle with

233
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
The present day

234
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,591
And I've been trying to

235
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,383
Reconsidering

236
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
Looking at

237
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,199
From different angles practice

238
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
Figure out like

239
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,503
Alex isn't.

240
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,527
Vacation what is he

241
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,551
You doing right

242
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,343
Like could he have gone to rehab

243
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:14,207
Probably not

244
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:18,047
I see that is working against his recovery make you like

245
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:24,703
Not have any contact with the outside world rightly 7-Day especially your own propaganda radio show.

246
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,239
The part of your addiction

247
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:31,871
I think that's unlikely in my mind I thought that was a possibility

248
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,175
I also thought it was a possibility that

249
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
You finally getting

250
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,223
Surgery for his big stick

251
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,015
Mac

252
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
That's probably unlikely

253
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,159
Cuz he just got surgery

254
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,975
And I don't know how okay

255
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
Two surgeries in

256
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,839
Surgery

257
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,863
Essentially put

258
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:58,751
I probably wouldn't be able to record or or even really

259
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,799
Get left for

260
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,079
What three months

261
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:06,687
Maybe also I think is that were the case then they would be upfront and say that that's

262
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
That's what happened

263
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,991
Announcement

264
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:09,759
Surgery

265
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,807
Saving surgery

266
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:13,855
No

267
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
I don't know what's going on

268
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,719
Very well possibly could

269
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,743
Just be legal s***

270
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,791
He's been so preoccupied with all the

271
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
These lawsuits

272
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,327
Possible

273
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,631
Maybe it's gotten to a point where the lawsuit

274
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,959
That is lawyers

275
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
I'm not to host

276
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:37,663
If you saw him on that you would absolutely advise him

277
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,943
Right

278
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,967
Mira hot mic

279
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,527
You can call into your show for like 2 minutes

280
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,063
Extreme about the globalist

281
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,391
But that's it any price to liability

282
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,975
I don't know I ate a weird situation for me to be in that I

283
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,047
But none of the possibilities look good

284
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,351
The only

285
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
Pictures of

286
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,519
Because

287
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,055
The only person who

288
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,335
Could have filled in

289
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,895
Should take a long leave

290
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
Absent

291
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,223
Is the same person who just left

292
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
Strongly

293
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,783
Paul is not good without at

294
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:27,071
His is his bench players are are not court-ordered gone

295
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,351
Rodger

296
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:35,007
They're not Clippers

297
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,311
Heart attack

298
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:42,431
Supposed to

299
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,199
Music

300
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,223
Is playing right now

301
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,039
Hear it

302
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,087
The man who can

303
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,623
Oh

304
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:57,023
Save the music I thought you were going to go Lionel

305
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:04,703
Lionel stew into qanon I don't think Alex and I had arrived super tight at this point

306
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:09,055
You know the present day I spent a lot of time that I have had available

307
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
Trying to

308
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:14,431
Trying to put together a present-day episode

309
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:19,807
Do you want to talk about how

310
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,111
The truth wins in the end

311
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,391
I don't want to do that

312
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:31,583
Still not worth it

313
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,447
You want to hear that I don't have to listen to a lot of it already

314
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
The great beer though

315
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,687
Mispronounced at

316
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:50,015
The one who is Super Bowl

317
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,319
I know I know

318
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,647
Who is boring

319
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,927
I just don't know what

320
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,975
He does have a beard

321
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,303
Okay

322
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,351
In addition to that

323
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,375
It's almost like

324
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,143
Everything

325
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,935
Coming up

326
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,311
With no Rosa

327
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,871
No trying to find a new apartment

328
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,735
Right I keep going to these goddamn places look what the places that I went to

329
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:27,135
I swear to God the landlord was taking me up to see the apartment I walked he's like it's not great is it

330
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:36,607
What he said was a great sales

331
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:48,127
I think there's a big story in here but it's really inaccessible.

332
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,175
There's debt that's

333
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,199
Re-up

334
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
To the Past

335
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,039
Tried to find

336
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,343
Extend

337
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:03,743
We can always do that

338
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,767
Alex

339
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,047
Is in a

340
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,839
F****** awful holding pattern

341
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,631
The end

342
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:13,727
Guns guns guns we get to

343
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,775
We're going to go a little bit over the

344
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,823
From December 23rd to

345
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,591
December

346
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
31st

347
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,895
Today okay

348
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:25,247
Morgan Spanish the year 12

349
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,527
Pretty quick fashion

350
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:30,367
Because there's not a lot

351
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,927
December 21st

352
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:38,303
Huron Allison programming absolutely

353
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,327
Desert

354
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:43,167
Ideas of the desert of interesting things

355
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,959
It's all gunship

356
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
It's all

357
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,007
They're coming to take

358
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:47,775
You're gone

359
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,079
So get ready to have a civil war

360
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:50,847
Cuz they're going to start

361
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:56,735
Underlying message

362
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,319
Well it's like

363
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,343
You're gone

364
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,903
And a certain number of you are going to kill them

365
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:10,559
Lisa come to take your gun

366
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,631
So that's why they're doing the gun grab to begin with two

367
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:17,471
It take to shooting cops which will start a civil war

368
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,775
It's almost all he talks about

369
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,055
Repeatedly

370
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,871
Over and over and over and over again

371
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:30,271
Dave's hours

372
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,135
There's nothing

373
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,183
The drives own

374
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
Sorry

375
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,559
I'm just saying that that man that's the first plane by the globalist

376
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:43,839
That makes

377
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,631
It's a it's a

378
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,423
Multi-stage lamp

379
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:55,871
Has a lot of bullet points let's put it that way

380
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,687
Relies on

381
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,479
An accurate assessment

382
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,039
Of what the other side will do if we

383
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,623
We do this

384
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,439
Because it's a boy

385
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:16,863
It's a globalist plan written by Alex

386
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,959
More accurate than the one he just tries to write

387
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:27,359
You know it's like a male screenwriter writing bad female character

388
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,663
For the global of course terrible job

389
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,039
Thinking of what the cabal would do but agree weirdos with guns

390
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,855
Really tied up tight

391
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,183
Start on the 23rd

392
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,463
And this is another

393
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
Piece of

394
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
What Alex

395
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
Spend

396
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,327
Much of his time

397
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,095
For the next week

398
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,375
Of the show on

399
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,127
Topix

400
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,431
White House petition

401
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,623
Several thousand

402
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:16,511
So Alex Piers Morgan

403
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,791
Sonofabitch

404
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,095
You have no teeth

405
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,215
I'm going to sit this one out however the chips

406
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:30,591
Fault let them as they may I don't care about this at all it's always interesting because Alex's

407
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,151
Obsessed

408
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,431
Evicted

409
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,199
Newspapers

410
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,015
And then

411
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:41,599
You spend so much time on this because drudge reposted

412
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,671
Alex's

413
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,767
Piers Morgan

414
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:52,351
Everyone else starts picking it up because it's on Drudge

415
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,679
But Alex about how no one credits

416
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
Infowars

417
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:03,103
And

418
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,151
Call the messages

419
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:08,735
Yeah how many which country would you most like a morgue

420
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:16,672
I don't know man in America

421
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:21,024
You got to deport him from a better country

422
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,304
To get deported from

423
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
Right

424
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:32,288
He's got dual citizenship in order to answer your question you requiring me to

425
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:37,152
To choose a new home for Piers Morgan alright

426
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,176
Tanzania

427
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,224
I don't know

428
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,832
From there they have marsupials

429
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,856
Snap

430
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:51,232
Absolutely

431
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:54,304
A couple days after this Alex

432
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,376
Realizes how much press and how much Buzz Marketing

433
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,912
You've gotten out of starting a

434
00:21:59,424 --> 00:21:59,936
Dot-org

435
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,984
Morgan

436
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:07,104
Charges filed against

437
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,736
Feinstein

438
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,624
Yeah

439
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:25,536
I don't have a backer on this one I think I'm good I think I'm going to let this it's really fascinating

440
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,072
He's

441
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,096
He's trying to get these three

442
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:28,864
Treason charges

443
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,632
Feinstein

444
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,704
Whatever you right now I'm not a fan

445
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,200
Alex keeps insisting

446
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,224
He's going to do like

447
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,272
A big expose on her

448
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,344
Does

449
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,624
Murdered her ex-husband

450
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:55,488
Is all right. That's not number one in what I would go with could be worse

451
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,512
Right right

452
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,280
I feel like

453
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,328
If you murdered her ex

454
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,632
It's a sad display of like

455
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:04,448
She does insider-trading but then doesn't really go

456
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,472
Get specific

457
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,032
Insinuating that she helped

458
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:18,528
There's another serial killer in that help serial killer

459
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:24,928
I don't know

460
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,024
Fun

461
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,304
I think that he's just

462
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,096
ReDiscover change.org

463
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,888
And their potential to be

464
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,912
Used as

465
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,032
Like the end of 2012

466
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,056
Chock-a-block

467
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,080
With him doing that

468
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,104
Just a bunch of change

469
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,128
Change.org possession

470
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:44,896
Frazee

471
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,200
23rd

472
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,992
The Feinstein one is

473
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,296
Talk about it cuz

474
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,832
The same thing.

475
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,904
It would be ironic

476
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,208
Barack Obama's

477
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,488
Change.org

478
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,256
Idea of

479
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,816
If you get 100,000 people

480
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,352
I will respond to

481
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,376
Regardless

482
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,424
If one of those was

483
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,216
Alex Jones would like to

484
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
To kick out.

485
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,264
That would be

486
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:12,800
Yeah

487
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:23,808
Respond to it I don't know I don't know we're going to see how this plays out

488
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,488
Obama saying

489
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:39,168
Alex doesn't talk about that for a

490
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,984
Okay that's right

491
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,264
To dress it there's no way out

492
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,080
So we'll know

493
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,640
Shortly what ends up happening

494
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,944
I'm put seven the 23rd

495
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,736
24th 25th

496
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,504
26

497
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,088
I am so when he comes back

498
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,136
It's just all guns all the time

499
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
Just sucking

500
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,208
Gun gun gun gun gun to come take the gun

501
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,232
Be very afraid

502
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,304
Normal Alex Jones Show

503
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,096
It is 18

504
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,632
Business as usual

505
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,680
Yeah you could be 2012 could

506
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,216
15

507
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,288
P2009 it really doesn't matter

508
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,824
Surrounded

509
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
Other than

510
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,152
He's really afraid

511
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,200
About them taking the gun

512
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,248
There's an intensity to it

513
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,272
Yeah

514
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,040
Really

515
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:32,416
So if you played a context for me I wouldn't be able to guess

516
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,464
It'll be like

517
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,024
This could be Mal this could be 10 years

518
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,328
Probably not

519
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:50,592
Yeah but yeah you could be almost it could be many many different times

520
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,872
Career

521
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
Adolescent

522
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:54,944
Cuz it's like

523
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:58,016
Directions to world is having a conversation about

524
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,808
Like how important

525
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
That

526
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,344
Was

527
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:07,744
Not like there's very little about that

528
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
Which is

529
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,792
Again why were

530
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,584
Looking back at this time

531
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,864
Just need his coverage of it

532
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,144
It's all just

533
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:17,472
Like if Sandy Hook is a

534
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,264
He's talking about CMD

535
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,544
Which is the

536
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,360
Perceived gun grab

537
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:28,480
And then the Civil War that would be triggered because of the potential gun threat

538
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,040
Global is not talkin about the actual event

539
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,088
And I think some of it is because it is

540
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,368
Incredibly

541
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,136
Painful

542
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,160
To be honest

543
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,696
There's a certain part of me that

544
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,464
That is

545
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,256
Relieved by that

546
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,816
Because while doing the show like

547
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,608
When he did talk about it

548
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,400
So f***

549
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:48,960
Harmful

550
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,984
Yeah it's a bummer

551
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
FedEx

552
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:54,080
Like even now while you're playing those clips

553
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,872
And we deal with the date

554
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,920
We know how close this is

555
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,272
And you can you can listen

556
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,064
To this end forget

557
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,368
You can forget that happened

558
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,160
While ago

559
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:14,560
Because we don't live in that we know exactly

560
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,656
Right

561
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:22,240
Right I'm having to go into a holiday season with that

562
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:26,336
Weighing over their hearts to lose it

563
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:29,152
Holiday after the worst

564
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,944
Sting

565
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,224
Yeah so like

566
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,504
Is it real

567
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,296
Cultural moment

568
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,064
It's happening

569
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,160
And it's barely not at all

570
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,976
Somewhat comforting because it would

571
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:48,352
It would be awful Sandy Hook investigation

572
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,656
Where every show was just the worst

573
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,680
S*** that he's ever

574
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,008
Like a greatest hits

575
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:55,776
Sandy Hook

576
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,056
It would be

577
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,384
Devastate

578
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,176
I think we are

579
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,760
But it's also kind of Interest

580
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:06,784
Because Alex

581
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,088
Black guy in present day

582
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,928
I talked about it and then I moved on to other stuff yeah

583
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:16,256
Kind of accurate no he's not terribly wrong there

584
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:21,632
On the 19th

585
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:24,192
Suggest that the father was an actor

586
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,472
He's already

587
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,264
Suggestive very heavily

588
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,360
That he believes that the government did this

589
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,640
Killed all the kids

590
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
Use data plan

591
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,504
December 27th episode

592
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,344
We get the first time that Alex makes a really full throated declaration

593
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,368
About what

594
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,392
About Sandy Hook

595
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,952
Most

596
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,744
Coverage of

597
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,512
In the episode

598
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,328
What are the rare moment

599
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,352
City comes up

600
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,848
Bushmaster

601
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,496
That's a bet

602
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:36,896
Harshest or at least the most concrete statement that this is a false flag

603
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,480
Right you still not committing and anyway to the actors idea

604
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,272
Student brought up

605
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,040
He's not getting

606
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,064
Crazy with

607
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,112
Course of these days

608
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,648
His collars don't seem to

609
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,928
Super interested

610
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,256
Becoming Civil War the globalist

611
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,280
The kickoff

612
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,560
Good job

613
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,328
Corral in Conroe

614
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,608
Versation in that direction

615
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,168
Is really interesting

616
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,704
I think the worst

617
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,496
Thing about America

618
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,056
In that case

619
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,592
Is when he says

620
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,224
Do you really think somebody would just steal grab a Bushmaster and start killing firefighters

621
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,344
Someone who tried to kill his mom with a hammer where Maybe

622
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,368
Yes

623
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,904
Unequivocally yes

624
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,184
I do think

625
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,976
That could be a headline

626
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,024
Tomorrow

627
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,560
I'm surprised you right.

628
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:29,120
I don't know if it would have surprised you

629
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:29,888
Too much you

630
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,936
I mean you would believe that it happened

631
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:35,776
Yeah for sure

632
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:38,336
Perhaps

633
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:46,016
We've already had enough mass shootings in 2012

634
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,040
Respond

635
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,088
Fish

636
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,672
Dumb dumb

637
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:58,560
In all of the time

638
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,584
The day of

639
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,632
All of Alex's

640
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,400
Have been

641
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,448
Gun propaganda

642
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:08,544
They have all the people who have either Financial

643
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,360
People who

644
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,640
Work for gun

645
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,712
Manufacturers people like Larry Pratt has been on

646
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,784
Twice from gunownersofamerica

647
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,856
The group that the more extreme NRA

648
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,672
Stewart Roads from The Oath Keepers has been on twice

649
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,464
Like all of these people who are just

650
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,744
Gun people

651
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,768
Heptagon

652
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,328
But none of them have had weird ideas about that

653
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,888
Right

654
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,704
People who have either Express

655
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,984
Condolences

656
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,312
This is really sad or try to deflect

657
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,872
Into guntalk really is true

658
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,640
Yep isn't

659
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,944
Little bit like

660
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:49,760
Every single person agrees

661
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,296
The worst thing that we could

662
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,320
Could do is

663
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,344
Dress this

664
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,368
Correct

665
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,160
Because that breaks

666
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,208
The part so many of our narrative

667
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,232
Still info

668
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,048
So they they still have that

669
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,072
To protect

670
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,936
Is that Alex likes

671
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,728
Bring these ideas

672
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,800
Yeah you know and so far we've seen no evidence

673
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,848
Racine only

674
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,152
Alex letting his own mind

675
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,968
And responding to maybe a bloggy Sawyer's

676
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,992
Something like that

677
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,272
To get him to the visit

678
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,184
That's not

679
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,256
Caruncle

680
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:35,072
Research right that leads them to that so his attempts to

681
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,096
Dependent on other people

682
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:38,656
All these other people Poison by mind

683
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,424
Falls on Deck

684
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,216
Not just that

685
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,752
He's other

686
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,056
Instigators are is

687
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:45,824
Truecaller

688
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,872
So there

689
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:50,432
Re-enforcing they're creating that

690
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,968
Calera

691
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,248
He says something crazy

692
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,016
Is he in there like

693
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,064
Yeah I know I heard it was this

694
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,344
With no

695
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,624
You didn't hear anything

696
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,608
People running away from the callers are going to call in and

697
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,656
Repeat that back to Alex at reinforced

698
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,680
The talking point when they

699
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,960
Absolute

700
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,776
So we finally on this 27

701
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,080
27th 2012 episode

702
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:21,152
We finally get a guest is bringing Alex

703
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,200
Doug Hagmann

704
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,248
Aussie Northeast intelligence

705
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,272
Right

706
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,040
He sucks

707
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,832
I told you this before

708
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:29,856
And I'll say it again

709
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,392
All you need to know

710
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,672
About Doug Hagmann

711
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,696
Is that

712
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,464
Currently

713
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,488
In 2019

714
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,560
One of the regular guest on his broadcast

715
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,840
His coach Dave dobbyn

716
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:42,656
All you need to know about him

717
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,704
Rug Manhattan

718
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,496
From now on I have

719
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,776
More to say about him

720
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,568
Another day

721
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:51,104
Do I do a deep dive on

722
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:02,112
Oh that's

723
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,648
It does with these guys a lot of

724
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,696
I'm looking at you Alan Walker

725
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,608
The plural

726
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:19,008
So Doug heckmann comes on and he pretends

727
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,824
Department of Homeland Security Source

728
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,408
Sure who's telling

729
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,224
And

730
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,504
By the way Alex

731
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,392
At least 14

732
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:37,440
It's a really

733
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,720
Solidify

734
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:46,656
Ugly puppy pads

735
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:53,568
My source would not go to that level however he did that there was

736
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,664
It looks like tomatoes research at you will find things

737
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,456
Better not right with it

738
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,224
Your Source sucks

739
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,808
Even if even if you was trying to lead you in a

740
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,600
Real direction that

741
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,368
Witchy weather

742
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:07,904
The dumb

743
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,440
What's the

744
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:16,608
Station there's no parts of it might have been looped in

745
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,400
Really

746
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,424
Yeah

747
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:25,312
I would assume that there is a Homeland Security aspect

748
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,336
2

749
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,384
I think I could be a compelling argument

750
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,248
Especially in the early points of it when you're not sure the nature of the attack

751
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:37,088
Ride

752
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:48,864
Green children

753
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,888
One of the issues

754
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,424
It's gotten Us in so much trouble

755
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,472
In terms of

756
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,520
These sorts of things

757
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,288
Is

758
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,312
Beginner Department

759
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,592
Inability to

760
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,360
Communicate with you

761
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:03,456
From

762
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,248
DHHS even if they're not active

763
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,272
If we involved like

764
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:11,392
If there is a paths

765
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,696
Right ears on it

766
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:17,536
First of all

767
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:20,864
Communicated

768
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,888
With our

769
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:29,056
Examples exist Beyond even 9/11

770
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:35,456
How to reach other

771
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:39,296
I would like to think it was I think like the salary negotiations on Friends

772
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:45,696
Like if they were only then Gunther could have got it

773
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:48,256
What are the great

774
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:51,840
Great Injustice has of art I've never intentionally

775
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:54,912
We watched an episode of Friends

776
00:36:56,192 --> 00:37:00,544
Not much there

777
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,848
Very much of note that Doug Hagmann is

778
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,872
Dispersed person

779
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:08,224
To enter Alex's world

780
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,016
Rockman hack

781
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,040
Rock band

782
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:14,112
He is the first person to enter Alex's world with us

783
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,648
Supposedly realsource

784
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,928
Who's telling him

785
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,720
Sandy Hook does that up baby

786
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,744
So he

787
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,280
Is patient zero

788
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,840
The publicly facing

789
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:28,448
Part of Infowars the radio show with someone who is

790
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,984
Leaving out

791
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,800
Cuz nobody nobody is pretended to have any

792
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,336
Not yet

793
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,872
And this is our first

794
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,408
Doug Hagmann

795
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,224
We go to the 20

796
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:41,760
And much like

797
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,552
The present day in 2019

798
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,088
Alex Jones

799
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,136
Butt implant

800
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:50,208
Mike Adams is hosting the first two-and-a-half hours of

801
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,744
The show because Alex is

802
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,888
Alex's behind-the-scenes working hard on special

803
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:00,448
Investigative research

804
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:04,032
He's not it leads him to his declaration

805
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,432
Reveal once Alex does get on there and it's f****** disappointing is

806
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,736
But it's not as disappointing as look

807
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,808
He is fat

808
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,392
We will

809
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,160
Exchange

810
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,488
OST

811
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:32,192
Dianne Feinstein

812
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,752
Can't quite at the meter

813
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,824
Mike Adams starts the show

814
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,104
Is a guy who runs

815
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,384
Glock Outlet

816
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,832
These they're filling in

817
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:55,232
I really don't think you can be a health Ranger and a huge gun guy right like that

818
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,536
Michaels

819
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,560
Contains multitude

820
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,328
Fair

821
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:03,680
Crab Coronavirus

822
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,216
That broadcast

823
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,240
Across-the-board

824
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:09,056
But that's totally

825
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,336
I get it

826
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:16,736
Pattern of olives

827
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,112
Understand the author of

828
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:26,976
Okay

829
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,512
Kelly O'Mara

830
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:33,632
The author of psyched out isn't she know she's not the Doctor Who's no longer allowed

831
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:44,640
Author who wrote the books

832
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,176
Colon

833
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:49,760
How psychiatrist mental illness

834
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:52,832
Oh I thought it was more about like how

835
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:59,232
Okay I brought together while somebody's

836
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:02,304
Newsela

837
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:08,192
She's not a psychologist or psychiatrist

838
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:12,544
Political science from the University of Maryland

839
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:17,920
I will give her that her bio repeated verbatim on tons of website

840
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,200
Flames

841
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:22,016
Congressional staffer for for different members of Congress

842
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,576
But nowhere do they ever say who they are

843
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:30,976
But I'm guessing that they were whoever these four craziest people in Congress were at any given time

844
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,256
I have no idea

845
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,888
His speech writer

846
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,680
Coming back 20 years later

847
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,472
Barbra

848
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:46,336
Sure

849
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:52,224
Insight ran from 1985 to 2008 but with the magazine is probably best remembered for is being

850
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,504
The first ones to report

851
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,528
Completely fabricated

852
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,576
Story that Barack Obama

853
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,368
At least 4 years

854
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:02,464
Islamic madrasa in Indonesia

855
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,488
Clinton campaign

856
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:09,632
Provide them with that story leave us alone

857
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,656
We didn't say that

858
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,216
Not that one

859
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:18,336
Believability

860
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,640
Someone from the Clinton campaign

861
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:27,040
Did give them that story that does not let inside off the hook for notch

862
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:33,440
Absolutely

863
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,976
22 involved

864
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,536
Use the conservative

865
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:40,096
Media as a weapon

866
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,376
Good like

867
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:42,400
What now

868
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,192
It's 2019

869
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,984
So we're all good

870
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,520
12 years of the Clinton

871
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,312
Campaign staffers being

872
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:53,663
I mean I don't know I'm not saying that they did obviously

873
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,431
I'm just saying that

874
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:58,271
If it if someone were to give me evidence that they did I wouldn't say that

875
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,951
Put that out

876
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:06,975
Campaign

877
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:07,743
Bandits

878
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:12,095
The world of right-wing propaganda

879
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:18,751
I know that for sure I've heard Alex at least allude to it

880
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:19,775
Fairly recent

881
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,311
If memory serves

882
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,079
Correctly

883
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,639
Something real

884
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:28,223
Whatever the reality about their story have it their sourcing

885
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:31,039
Important

886
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,855
The holes are the inside has no rats

887
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:40,767
Also Insight magazine is owned by Reverend Sun Myung Moon the head of the Moon occult

888
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,143
The Washington Times

889
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,423
Really yeah

890
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:52,543
That makes a Larvitar with the Washington Times and insight

891
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,871
Cornerstones of Reverend Sun Myung

892
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:58,431
Infiltration into right-wing media

893
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:02,783
So it gets more.

894
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,855
Kelly just right for inside

895
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:09,695
She's also a contributor for the citizens Commission on human rights

896
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:13,023
With a name like that we know we're dealing with a straight-up organization

897
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:17,887
All those words are really good

898
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,679
Center for American progress

899
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:22,239
Commission commission implies collaboration

900
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,775
Right

901
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,591
Organization of the people

902
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,127
Not the fact

903
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:31,967
I think it also implicitly as a right-wing

904
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,503
New source

905
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,295
Excludes people

906
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:42,207
The cchr was founded by the Church of Scientology in 1969

907
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:44,255
It seems to exist

908
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:50,911
Front group for the church to whitewash their extremist Auntie psychology messages

909
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:56,031
A search of deceased ehrs website turns up

910
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:59,103
33 pages of Articles written by Kelly O'Mara

911
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,455
Perhaps most importantly articles written by her for cchr dating back to

912
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,223
2 / 4

913
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,783
December 2012 when this episode is from

914
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:14,463
Did she was working for a straight-up Scientology funded anti-psychiatry propaganda organization

915
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,279
Original name was the CCC

916
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,839
L.ron Hubbard

917
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:22,143
I believe that's what it was

918
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:24,703
ABC order

919
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,471
New York

920
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,495
I like that

921
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:31,615
Throwing the baby out with the bathwater and I tried

922
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,407
People regardless of their affiliation

923
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,431
But even I have to

924
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,199
You can see that I think

925
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,223
Disqualifying

926
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:39,807
Critic of the psychiatric

927
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,623
To work for the Church of Scientology

928
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,647
Yeah you lose

929
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,439
That's not good you lose.

930
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:50,047
Different standards

931
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:58,239
Is that the discount

932
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,519
Text Magic

933
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:02,335
As a legitimate

934
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,871
Escape the Fate

935
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:08,479
Got to keep them forever

936
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,783
Yeah I thought that was great

937
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,855
Oh it's one of those things

938
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,415
Jessica

939
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:20,767
Do you have somebody who's now bring it cuz they talk about the psych stuff

940
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:26,399
You know they talk about how these are suicide pills

941
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,263
Don't really have any guests on who can back that up

942
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:33,567
Is it claims and assertions that Alex's make

943
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,103
Claim these red studies

944
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,407
Finally they get somebody on alike

945
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,431
What's up with her

946
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,455
What's up with you

947
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,111
People on

948
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,135
Where it's like

949
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,927
They're not

950
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:49,695
Climate

951
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:50,975
They're not

952
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:52,767
Doctors

953
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:53,791
Where's they're not

954
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,815
Anybody with an a

955
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:55,583
Expertise in there

956
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,351
Fairfield

957
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,399
There's somebody with a degree in Paw

958
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,167
Political

959
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,471
That's more like

960
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:04,287
You have a degree in law

961
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,663
For whatever it's worth.

962
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:11,711
Positive

963
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,479
Necessarily

964
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,247
Patrice

965
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,271
Pretty passionate

966
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:17,343
Like she's written articles about this stuff

967
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,111
4 years

968
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:23,999
It is possible that she's on

969
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,279
If you don't have someone who's

970
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,071
Makeup expert in the fee

971
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:31,167
Field went to school for it and opportunist

972
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:31,935
Right

973
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,727
I don't think that she's an opportunist

974
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:36,287
How many

975
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:41,151
I can't find hard evidence that she is a Scientology

976
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,455
Gotcha do I will say

977
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,039
The cchr for years

978
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,575
Heavily implied

979
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,623
EBay suspected

980
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,183
Scientology pays well-to-do propaganda for the

981
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:55,999
Either

982
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,535
I think there's two possibility

983
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,583
Either she is a Scientologist

984
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,375
And then she has a religious

985
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,655
The psychiatry

986
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,703
Is evil possible

987
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,751
She's not a Scientologist

988
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,359
Accentuate

989
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:13,151
For at least

990
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,223
Yeah yeah

991
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,015
He's fit like

992
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,551
She has to know

993
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,367
It's the Church of Scientology

994
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:26,719
It's behind this organization

995
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:33,631
I would say I mean I mean everybody

996
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,679
To have butter

997
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,703
On the bread

998
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:43,871
I hear you land the metaphor

999
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,663
Bread is buttered

1000
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:53,343
Who cares where butter in the cross sign

1001
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,367
Just butter the crust

1002
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:57,695
Look if you wanted to take a crust buttering job

1003
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,487
She could have her own blog

1004
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,535
Fulex

1005
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,071
Yep

1006
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:05,375
Weird but also stoic

1007
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,143
Like

1008
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,567
Much talk about Sandy Hook

1009
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:15,359
I mean Mike Adams says that

1010
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,127
He believed like

1011
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:19,967
He's perpetuating the this was only handgun

1012
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:25,343
In the school dress Master is because

1013
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,647
He is operating off bad reporting

1014
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,671
He plays a name

1015
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:31,231
ABC clip where they has bad earlier

1016
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:35,839
Information that the rifle was in the car as opposed to once

1017
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:38,399
The information

1018
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,191
In the car at the rifle was

1019
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:42,751
Nbcnews

1020
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,799
He's saying that the rifle wasn't in

1021
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:45,567
The school

1022
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,359
The car never only handguns

1023
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,407
The school so I'm giving Mike Adams

1024
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,431
A good bit of leeway

1025
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:54,015
At this point

1026
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:55,807
Put hue

1027
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,087
Reporting

1028
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,623
On misreported

1029
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,927
Yes so are you right

1030
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:01,695
You're right

1031
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:04,511
I think the credit is

1032
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:08,607
Well I mean there's so many times

1033
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:13,215
Do the stuff and they never show their homework or anything like that

1034
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,519
Like argument that goes a bad Direct

1035
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:19,103
Yeah it does end up in there be multiple shooters

1036
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,919
Like that because

1037
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,199
You only have two hands

1038
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:30,111
No it's not but

1039
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:34,975
The misreporting of MBC

1040
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,511
Cnews they did say right

1041
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,119
For sure

1042
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:44,191
That I am report

1043
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,007
When people bring up

1044
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:47,775
Bushmaster

1045
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:49,823
A gun

1046
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,847
I'm not just

1047
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,615
Crocodiles

1048
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,151
It is a very

1049
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,199
I wish I had

1050
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:55,967
This whole episode.

1051
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,271
The real Crocodile Dundee

1052
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:01,087
Be about 40 f****** time

1053
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:10,303
No it's because Alex has narrative about the real crocodile. About

1054
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:16,447
Tried to come take his guns and he shot some cops and then

1055
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,215
And they killed him

1056
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,175
But he repeatedly as an example of this is what

1057
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,479
Grabbers work

1058
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:30,783
It's ship

1059
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,807
Sowega

1060
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:32,575
To the 30th

1061
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:34,367
And again

1062
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:39,999
Rock not a lot that interesting to our investigation

1063
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:42,559
Is this

1064
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,631
On the Rogan show

1065
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:46,911
Recently

1066
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:48,959
Alex came back on Joe Rogan

1067
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:53,055
Podcast I remember

1068
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:55,359
Recruiter back when he was a kid

1069
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,383
And he f*****

1070
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:02,783
Haha I believe that was the thrust of his story

1071
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,807
Braids girl was

1072
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:08,415
Being abused by her

1073
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:10,975
Edna and Alex

1074
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:17,375
Right

1075
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:21,215
7 years ago

1076
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:23,263
We finally found it.

1077
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:29,919
Hi

1078
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:41,439
Do you think it's possible this is one of the times he did crack

1079
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:42,463
I could

1080
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:45,023
He has talked about being out like on a beach doing crack

1081
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,047
With attractive girls

1082
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:50,911
Stuff like that

1083
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:55,263
Smoke smoke some

1084
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:58,335
Music cracker map

1085
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:02,687
It's entirely possible these are the same story

1086
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:08,831
Cuz it's 8:00 girls at a bonfire outdoorsy kind of thing

1087
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:50,559
13

1088
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:12,575
Progress

1089
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:17,183
Differences

1090
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,463
Between Alex's

1091
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:21,279
2019 version of the story and this 2012

1092
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:27,423
There's no relationships that he

1093
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:33,055
Has become aware of his daughter for sure the walk home from

1094
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,335
Love the idea

1095
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:36,639
Like this mental image is so funny to me

1096
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:39,199
The idea people inviting Alex to parties

1097
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:45,599
It every time you shows

1098
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:51,231
I'm 13 but I look 16 and I like to party

1099
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:53,023
I'm at fistfights I drink beer

1100
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:59,679
I like to go to parties

1101
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,983
Good like the Craigslist

1102
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,799
Missed connections where the guy is a cannibal

1103
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:07,871
Hey I'm looking for somebody to eat

1104
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,663
And then you show up

1105
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:18,879
We're just hanging out

1106
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:19,903
Bulshit

1107
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:22,719
Bulshit more like an entire

1108
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,999
Like group prank

1109
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:24,767
Luther like

1110
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:25,535
We are going to

1111
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,303
F*** with this kid

1112
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:31,423
Esps behavioral issues

1113
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,703
Did you get it

1114
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:33,727
Just

1115
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:38,079
Put on a wig and invited to a party cuz party

1116
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:39,871
He's going to recognize you

1117
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,151
Put on a wig

1118
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,431
Wear black

1119
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:45,503
Whatever

1120
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:51,135
And then barbering we're all saying this is going to be disappointed people are

1121
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:54,463
What is going to propel our documentary 2

1122
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,047
I think it's going to be hard cuz

1123
00:54:59,327 --> 00:54:59,839
Exist

1124
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,119
I feel like that interview

1125
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,911
How that is going to be

1126
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:03,935
Yeah

1127
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:08,543
When you invited Alex to your parties where you f****** with him about being a Satanist

1128
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:19,551
Might be saying

1129
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,951
Well you're doing a great job

1130
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,743
He's hanging out with John to Grandpa

1131
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:34,655
I do know that he is

1132
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:37,471
I think the end is exactly why

1133
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,495
Retained

1134
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:41,823
Personal story because he believes it gives him this like

1135
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:45,407
Authenticity that other radio other radio host his

1136
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:48,479
Have never experienced that have never been brushed up against

1137
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:55,135
I know what the real reality

1138
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,159
Is it supposed to their man

1139
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,183
Manufactured bulshit

1140
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:58,975
Reality

1141
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:00,511
Swap meet

1142
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,279
The parties

1143
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,303
Tired of it

1144
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,071
Walk home

1145
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,167
Regular parties

1146
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,447
I would assume so

1147
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,983
I mean

1148
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:13,311
F****** do what thou wilt

1149
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,359
That's the extent of the house rules

1150
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,639
At the same time

1151
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,663
If your 13

1152
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:26,111
I'm not even the most

1153
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:31,487
You should probably not have 13 year olds at all right

1154
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:34,559
60 minutes

1155
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:42,751
Clip left

1156
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:43,519
The 31st

1157
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:44,799
I think

1158
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,335
To give a demonstration

1159
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:47,359
Alex's hair

1160
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,455
He's been really Doom and Gloom for like this entire week

1161
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:54,527
Just Dance

1162
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,415
News I believe

1163
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:02,207
Antagonize someone

1164
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:02,975
And his audience

1165
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:03,999
Do something

1166
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,815
I think that there's a day like this year

1167
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:07,583
Trying to

1168
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:08,607
Somebody to

1169
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,655
Cause

1170
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:12,447
That's a big one

1171
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,983
Yeah I don't know it's

1172
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,007
Feels like

1173
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,823
It feels like

1174
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:18,591
He is

1175
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,615
It really

1176
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,151
But I don't know how much of it

1177
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:21,919
Conscious

1178
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:23,199
Like I wouldn't accuse

1179
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:24,479
Of intentionally trying

1180
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,759
To get someone to call the shooter

1181
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,063
But it is

1182
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,599
It is a big

1183
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,903
Logical extension

1184
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:36,255
If that is the truth

1185
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:38,303
But that's going to kick off a civil war

1186
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,327
Why wait

1187
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:43,423
For that to happen

1188
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,703
Yeah or whatever

1189
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,751
It is easy for one of his listeners

1190
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:47,519
To hear that

1191
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:49,567
And then the other piece that is important to me

1192
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,335
Is that

1193
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,359
If

1194
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,407
Someone

1195
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,175
Do that

1196
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,479
Where to like go shoot up something

1197
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:58,527
Inspired by this

1198
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,391
It would help out

1199
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,415
Because then

1200
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:06,207
His arguments that there's going to be

1201
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:06,975
Copycat

1202
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:12,607
Doug Hagmann saying there's going to be more

1203
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,143
Rug Hagman

1204
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:17,471
Has the same

1205
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,239
Intense

1206
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:22,335
So you're Alex

1207
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,871
Consciously or unconsciously

1208
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:27,711
I lean more towards unconscious but right

1209
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:29,503
So he's kind of

1210
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:32,319
Instigate

1211
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,367
Whereas

1212
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,391
Is rugby

1213
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,951
Seems to be aware of his

1214
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:38,719
Narrative

1215
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:40,511
Do you think he's insta

1216
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:47,423
I don't know I don't know I don't have enough time with him

1217
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:50,239
But I really not enough

1218
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:52,287
Even second-guesses

1219
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,055
Intentions

1220
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:56,895
And I don't question of intention is so important

1221
00:58:57,151 --> 00:59:00,479
Because if he's intentionally trying to rile up his audience

1222
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:01,503
In such a way

1223
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:03,295
That they will go attack somebody

1224
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:05,087
Really really sucks

1225
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:09,183
If he's accidentally doing it it's still super f***** up super

1226
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,487
It's not like

1227
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:15,071
Legally actionable

1228
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,351
It it's not

1229
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:20,959
Yeah technically

1230
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:26,079
Drug rug

1231
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:28,383
There's going to be another

1232
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:29,663
Malik singer

1233
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:30,431
Be copycat

1234
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,455
Right

1235
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:34,015
If Alex's rhetoric does inspire some

1236
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,295
Go out

1237
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,063
Shooting

1238
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,855
That validates the rhetoric

1239
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:40,159
You've been putting out there's going to be more

1240
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:44,255
Inspired by the right that's

1241
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:45,791
And then further

1242
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:48,607
Inevitably the person who did it to have

1243
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:00,895
Tightly

1244
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,687
So much

1245
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:03,711
But he's been putting

1246
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,271
Now that still doesn't

1247
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:07,295
Make it

1248
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:12,927
But the elements are all there of

1249
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:15,231
There is no real downside for him

1250
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,279
If he doesn't care right

1251
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:22,911
Right what's the temperature

1252
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:28,287
Every month

1253
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,847
For this to occur

1254
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,919
Like I can't imagine putting myself in a place

1255
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:34,687
Swear

1256
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:35,967
The best circumstances

1257
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:36,991
Stanford

1258
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:39,551
Lake pictures

1259
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,087
Like at the end of the day

1260
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,879
When a mass shooting

1261
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:49,279
Their sales go up even talk about that house

1262
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:54,655
Contacts

1263
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:57,215
I'd like isn't it great that more Americans have guns

1264
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:00,031
When are the same

1265
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,823
Maybe a couple more

1266
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:08,223
People getting guns but mostly people getting bored

1267
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:14,111
See what I would be a reflection percent 1% of gun owners

1268
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,135
75%

1269
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:21,535
Something along those lines in the ballpark

1270
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,303
Yeah

1271
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:24,607
Regressing

1272
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:27,167
There

1273
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:32,031
Where is it a totally open about that phenomenon and almost celebratory

1274
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:34,335
Yeah

1275
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,687
We've made a s*** ton of money

1276
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,991
Exactly

1277
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:43,039
And it yet

1278
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,831
Which is heartbreaking on its own

1279
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:47,391
But still none of it

1280
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:48,671
None of it

1281
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:49,951
Intentionality

1282
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:52,255
Because I ate

1283
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:53,535
Easy to hear the things I'm saying

1284
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,071
And get the idea that I make

1285
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:55,839
Accusation

1286
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:59,423
Play right now

1287
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:02,239
Everything Alex is doing his super dangerous

1288
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:07,871
Even if he's not playing with these people at Hooker actors

1289
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:08,639
Buddies jumped in

1290
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:11,199
Civil War is imminent or going to take

1291
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,735
You're gone that's her to stop

1292
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,783
Is that Justice

1293
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,135
The circumstantial evidence

1294
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:19,903
What is

1295
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:20,927
Overwhelming

1296
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:24,511
I'm even the queen Bono argument doesn't really

1297
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:25,279
It doesn't help me

1298
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:28,095
Solidified

1299
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:32,191
How much is just like an

1300
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,471
You know what I'm saying

1301
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:37,823
No matter what

1302
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:41,663
Because if he makes these arguments and one of the listeners

1303
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:42,687
Does that then

1304
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,479
Things could play out the way I described

1305
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:46,527
Or if nobody doesn't

1306
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,063
Great

1307
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:49,855
Because there aren't more shooting

1308
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,647
And stuff like that

1309
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,415
Can then be like

1310
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:56,255
We stopped it

1311
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:03,167
If I wasn't the Watchman on the wall scream my lungs out about

1312
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:03,935
They

1313
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,727
My behavior

1314
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:08,799
The things that I was making you afraid of right you're welcome

1315
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:13,919
It's kind of in

1316
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:14,687
Incredible

1317
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:16,223
How

1318
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:17,503
Good position

1319
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:18,271
He is in

1320
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,551
12

1321
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,343
As as

1322
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,623
He's doing such

1323
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:23,903
Monster

1324
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:25,951
Or at least defensible position

1325
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:29,023
He's behind a wall of

1326
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:32,863
Deniability about stuff

1327
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,143
More importantly

1328
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:34,911
His

1329
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,447
Profile is so much

1330
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,215
Lower

1331
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,239
Do you know

1332
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:42,591
Cuz he's trying to get that.

1333
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:47,711
Dance clothes

1334
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:50,271
2012 I'm mad at Nancy Pelosi

1335
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:55,391
Publicity stunts right well for him and then also

1336
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,159
He's going

1337
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,439
Inevitably

1338
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,975
Run afoul of

1339
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:00,767
Good taste

1340
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:05,631
These RV Sandy Hook

1341
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,679

1343
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:16,639
At this point

1344
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:17,407
Because

1345
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:18,943

1347
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:21,247
Which is of course

1348
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:23,551
Something that like reinforces

1349
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:26,879
Decisions up until

1350
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:27,903
2060

1351
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:28,671
27

1352
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:29,951
Words like

1353
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:33,023
I am in a position where

1354
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,327
Probably

1355
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,119
Things that are somewhat legally action

1356
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,143
Right

1357
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:40,703
Nobody

1358
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:43,263
Like people are paying attention

1359
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,055
But not enough people to

1360
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:45,823
To cause me

1361
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:47,871
You know

1362
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,151

01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:50,175
He's a huge

1364
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:54,015
So much in 2000

1365
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,039
2015

1366
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:56,575
He is so

1367
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,135
In 20

1368
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:02,463
Dumb s***

1369
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:04,511

1370
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:06,815
No fear of reprisal

1371
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,583

1372
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:12,191

01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:20,383
Harnessing

1378
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:25,503
Severe paranoia gun narrative stuff

1379
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:26,271
But that's

1380
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,551
Entire career

1381
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:28,319
So

1382
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:34,463
He's been going on and on about how like they're coming for the guns going to be civil war all that stuff

1383
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,999

1389
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,967
All the cares of laughs

My New Year's message

1416
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:41,951
For about 4 years running has always been

1417
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,999
Goodbye to a shity

Just gloomy is it is it still

01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:03,199
There's still a moving on aspect of

1424
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:10,111
Goodbye

1425
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:12,415
There is a difference to that where this is

1426
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:18,047
I know this is all, we're all dead we're all dead this year

Happy 2013.

1431
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,735

At this point

1438
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:51,839

01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:09,407
For the record Dan is still make

1462
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:11,199
Taking the juggling Mojo

01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:16,575
Triple threat

1465
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:17,855
While you're juggling

1466
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:23,743
Do we have a Twitter account

1467
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:30,143
Pizza Hut

1468
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:41,919
Me and there's one last thing like we're podcast

1469
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:44,735
Is it always that way

1470
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:47,039
So I would say

1471
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:49,087
These people

1472
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:50,879

Kelly O'Mara

1474
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:56,767
I mean she's been a shell

1475
01:10:57,023 --> 01:11:01,631
Certainly giving bad advice probably lead people to not take medication when they probably should

1476
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:04,703
To be medicated

1477
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:07,775
It's an accessory accessory to murder

1478
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:10,335
Bright but not not with her bare hands

1479
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:13,407
So she's in the clear

1480
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:15,711
Probably have done just that

1481
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:16,735
The young man

01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:27,743
