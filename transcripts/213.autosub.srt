1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Alex Jones

3
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,920
Yes sir

4
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
Great Bud's Chicago dragon games

5
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:30,208
Cubs

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,840
Buds

7
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:38,400
Walking funny out in like a social life

8
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:46,848
Funny guy on Twitter

9
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,920
He had this thing with you

10
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,224
Is B that he kept doing where he was a

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,296
You kept accusing the guy was selling.

12
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,392
Progressively got worse

13
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:01,184
As we got drunker but

14
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,488
It's a super fun time

15
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,560
I know I don't care about baseball or the Cubs really at all I know

16
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:12,960
I always go Cubs Go is the stupidest song in the world

17
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,640
This game that we went to was the end of the regular season for the Cubs ended up winning the

18
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:25,248
There was electricity in the room

19
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,016
And it was

20
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,832
They won it was an exciting game

21
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,136
Like the game is ending everyone

22
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,440
Can stadium is singing Go Cubs Go

23
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,256
Find myself singing along to you

24
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:42,656
Baby is insane I really it's one of the types of warsong that everyday

25
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,680
Way worse

26
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,496
Boston one

27
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:52,896
That.

28
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,176
A lot better

29
00:01:54,432 --> 00:02:00,576
I like Chelsea Dagger

30
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,368
It was that really interesting experience

31
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,672
I said I hadn't really had much of an my life is

32
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,720
Just like really blending into the hole

33
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:11,840
Like I became part of the stadium of got it but

34
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:18,496
Well because we're recording this on Wednesday and last night they lost of the Rockies in video

35
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,776
And are eliminated

36
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,568
Sorry about that

37
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,384
Sorry about that, Stan

38
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:29,760
Time I tried to go to Cubs game was on Friends

39
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,784
New York comedian

40
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,808
Rhinebeck

41
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,856
Tile layers were both

42
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,184
And we tried to go to a Cubs game I got rained out

43
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,232
25 bucks on beaters

44
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:44,864
That was a bummer

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,960
That was that's more like a Cubs fan

46
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,264
That is a bummer

47
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:58,432
A couple of new donors

48
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,648
Thank you so much

49
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,184
I'm a policy wonk

50
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,584
David David

51
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,448
It was just join up

52
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,776
I'm a policy wonk

53
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,688
You could have bumped it up a little

54
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,272
Appreciate it very much if you'd like to

55
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:38,880
Support the show what we do

56
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,440
Helping us out

57
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:46,304
Mayfield pitch a couple episodes to cut it out of the episode

58
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,936
Really gross about it if you want

59
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
If you donate

60
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,032
Bucks a month based on the number of episodes we put out that's like

61
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,800
Expensive

62
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,128
I don't know what that means I don't know if that's compelling

63
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,408
Deal

64
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,736
More people supporting the show makes things much easier

65
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,808
Not only just logistically in LifeWise

66
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,344
But

67
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,624
Freedom's that I don't

68
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,904
Experience in my life

69
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
Website

70
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:19,071
Like having all of your blood at all times

71
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,191
Another thing to is that like I've been

72
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,727
If I can't go sell my blood

73
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,031
Because I'm sick I risk getting tons

74
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:28,799
People sick

75
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,847
Who are also in the

76
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,871
Plasma center

77
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,919
If I do you responsibly go in there

78
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,991
Freedom of my license taken away

79
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:45,695
And I can't do that if it's been almost a year-and-a-half

80
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:50,559
I don't know if we can do that

81
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:56,959
Look at Rodger Stones ass with

82
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,311
I don't know I'm not here to

83
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,615
I'm not going to stop doing the show at any point

84
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,663
Tattoos

85
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,943
What does things that I've liked

86
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,223
And if you guys

87
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,527
Support the show and you like what we do

88
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,063
Little bit any little bit helps

89
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,879
And thank you to everybody who don't support the show

90
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,463
If you don't want to support the show financially and you just like listening to it

91
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,487
Fuckingawesome

92
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:25,887
Enough will all of my everything

93
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:29,727
Help us out at the end of the day

94
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,175
If you wanted to donate to charity

95
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
I did

96
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
How dare you

97
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,575
We can hear our show

98
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,135
That's exactly right

99
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,183
A hundred percent I agree with that

100
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,047
Today we are interested

101
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,863
As always

102
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:02,239
Is the case whatever we have a really fun episode like we did on Wednesday

103
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,591
Today weather

104
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,895
The chat afterwards about the idea of like

105
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,223
Are we just abandoning the present and Alex Jones

106
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,783
And we both realized.

107
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,575
It's outside of our job

108
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,415
We have to talk about the present

109
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,439
MLM

110
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,743
Middle management guy now

111
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,583
Even if he's publicly deconstructing to a gross degree

112
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,399
We kind of still have to talk about the present or else

113
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,727
We're kind of leaving part of the equation

114
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:38,847
Unsung

115
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,175
I'm so today we would just forget what the present is is

116
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,967
We constantly live in the past like

117
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:50,367
Where we would be like like we were in Futurama

118
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:56,511
Which is an unending stream of being poured upon all of our faces

119
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,327
All day everyday with no chance

120
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:03,167
The station today we're going over Tuesday October 2nd

121
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
2018

122
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,519
I don't know I told you

123
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,799
That I didn't

124
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
Go to the present

125
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,943
I can kind of predict

126
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
I was wrong

127
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:23,391
Yeah that we have known and listen to

128
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,743
Iraq

129
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
I have

130
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:34,911
No idea. No one would have predicted that alright so here is an out-of-context drop from

131
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
Today Show

132
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,495
I don't claim Jack diddly

133
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,519
Squad

134
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:46,687
I don't know what's going on me neither babe

135
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:53,087
You know what's going on cuz I realize this and that drunken Hotel interview

136
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:56,159
Like I don't know did 9/11 I have no idea

137
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:01,535
I recently watched on Rogan show

138
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,983
Right all the time

139
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:15,871
He knows what's going on 99% right ninety-nine percent of the time and

140
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
Everything

141
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:23,551
It's possible it's unlikely that the gambler's fallacy is that

142
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,879
Does October 2nd

143
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,671
2018 episode

144
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,743
Is a thought going to be super fun

145
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
F****** hysterical

146
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,351
Alright

147
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,631
Beginning of the Rock

148
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:42,239
35 days until the most historic election in

149
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,519
World history

150
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,287
I know

151
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,103
Referendum on nationalism vs. globalism

152
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,431
Global

153
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,967
Emily Dark Age

154
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:01,183
Really really dropped

155
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,047
The Weeknd

156
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,095
Tidewater research

157
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,679
And by then a lot of other people have done research

158
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
Cool

159
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,519
And now

160
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:20,383
We have all the documents

161
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,151
What is

162
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,999
Big ball information no wonder

163
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:41,887
Social media are able to share information virally

164
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,775
Because they're going to make a bunch of dirty moves the next 35 days

165
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:55,967
The information we're going to

166
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,807
Stunning

167
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,463
Can't

168
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:12,607
Alex Jones I have dropped the ball

169
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,655
And let me tell you how bad I dropped it

170
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:21,055
But only because the other side hasn't picked it up yet

171
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,943
Anythink

172
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:34,879
I mean your first instinct

173
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,559
Believed Anita Hill

174
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
Nope

175
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:49,727
Oh no

176
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,407
Is Captain Obvious

177
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:02,015
Crazy bulshit

178
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,879
His narrative about it has been constantly evolving as

179
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,719
He posted a story couple days back about how like

180
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:17,119
She has travel pictures and that proves he's a liar and s*** like that

181
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,959
Well maybe that's

182
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:27,359
If it's not a hundred percent truth and that means that she's a hundred percent

183
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,407
Can Amplified and exaggerate

184
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
Conservative talk

185
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,479
Pinpoint about her

186
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:43,231
When we get to what the ball he dropped his

187
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,255
Oban

188
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,423
This is what I'm saying this is what I was talking about at the beginning of the episode I predicted that like Alex is going to be running

189
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,215
Interference for Kavanaugh

190
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:58,591
It wasn't like I don't need to go listen

191
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,127
These angle on this

192
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,687
Is unbelievable and he begins

193
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
To get into it here

194
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:08,831
Last Friday because

195
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,975
Gaston Ford

196
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,399
Our story didn't add up

197
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,639
Write for criminal trial

198
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,943
You do for criminals

199
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,479
Not for a job

200
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:42,879
Began to look at her CIA connection

201
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:08,223
Or she is just the embodiment

202
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,743
It's on

203
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,815
I bet it's unbelievable

204
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,031
Okay I'm listening

205
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,103
And then her

206
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,383
Father

207
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,919
Grandfather

208
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
Brother

209
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,735
Brother-in-law

210
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:44,319
Work in the CIA officers that produced

211
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,367
Dossier

212
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:52,767
State lawyer

213
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,303
Believable

214
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:03,519
Rosetta Stone of everything

215
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:09,919
She's finally come for now know that she is part of the team that set up the field

216
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:15,039
She's part of the team that is behind the eyes

217
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:20,927
Well her brother

218
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,463
UPS open involved

219
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
At some point

220
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,119
I'm gonna leave alone

221
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,447
Play Bingo

222
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:40,639
Vicky is a right course it's not a surprise but he's with me.

223
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,967
Listen regulated does one thing

224
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:48,831
In terms of her family being CIA I don't know if that's true I don't think there's like a database

225
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,135
I can just type someone's name into it pops up

226
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,671
I don't think it works that way

227
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:18,015
Betty would obviously be true because his dad is totally insulting somebody

228
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,807
Version of the CIA

229
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,391
Saudia her lawyer is

230
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,415
Involved with

231
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,231
McCabe I also don't know if that's true I don't care

232
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,023
Mukbang

233
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,351
Your lawyer represent the daily Stormer

234
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
Like

235
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,679
I don't think it's a problem that they do

236
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,519
I don't I really don't if that's free speech issues and they take our clients

237
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,799
Who are like

238
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:47,711
Disgusting to most people and have like absolute

239
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:53,087
It's part of the whole affair.

240
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:57,183
That but I don't think they like just because you're a lawyer who has represented a Nazi

241
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,207
Makes you a Nazi

242
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,279
I don't think Zack version of Association really work

243
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,815
ACLU

244
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,839
F***** if that were the

245
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:10,239
I think there are lawyers who are.

246
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,007
Equivalent

247
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,103
So I don't judge Alex for having a lawyer who also represents.

248
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,127
I don't think that

249
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,663
Frankly I judge

250
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,991
Having a lawyer that helps also represent Al

251
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:30,463
A little opportunistic representative

252
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,743
You can do better

253
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,511
Right

254
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,815
So all of this is kind of

255
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,095
She's involved

256
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,375
Mind-control

257
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,911
Yes that sounds right

258
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,959
Where do we go

259
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:57,855
I'm not going to try and pretend but he's right like I did on that

260
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:00,927
Know this

261
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
Before

262
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,767
We recorded that episode about Sophia

263
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,839
You claim to Matrix and Terminator

264
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,631
I did some research

265
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,191
Two dice radio

266
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,727
Vista illegitimate

267
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:18,591
Supremacist radio show its legitimate whites

268
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:23,711
White supremacist

269
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:27,807
I was looking into it cuz I was like I noticed that there were a number of Alex Jones as guest

270
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:32,415
NY

271
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,207
For some reference

272
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,279
John Rappaport been on there four times

273
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:43,167
He's not leaving the house

274
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,359
Sophia Stewart

275
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,407
So that's an interesting little Rico

276
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,455
Her business

277
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,039
Now we get back to the

278
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,575
You can't get around that voodoo.

279
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:08,767
And Alex's life ezclaim doctor

280
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:12,863
Is involved

281
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
It's even worse than

282
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,727
Follow your specialty is implanting false memory

283
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,711
God help us

284
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,295
Psychology professor

285
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:35,647
Are you a Scientologist now what is that

286
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,999
You're at the fields all the enemies are psychologists

287
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,279
Alright

288
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
Whatever

289
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,519
Go I think I think already we can start with

290
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,335
Her specialty is implanting false memory

291
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,407
False memories

292
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,943
It is not the

293
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:02,015
Anything other than the actual Act

294
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:06,111
Oven planting false memories into a human being

295
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,391
The movie Inception

296
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,183
But in a person

297
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,511
Before we get to any of this

298
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:18,143
Tries in heaven quotes

299
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,703
Dumb Road

300
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,519
And this one's my favorite

301
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:30,687
2018

302
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,063
Adjust the midterms

303
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,927
Brett Kavanaugh

304
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,335
Kill Kavanaugh

305
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,687
Shut off

306
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:10,367
I'm get to that later

307
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
Look

308
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:15,999
I'm not saying I'm for it I'm just saying if somebody would have come out and say that that's what we should do

309
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:20,351
Let's not there's a Georgetown Professor tweeted some stuff

310
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,143
Analog reviews

311
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,959
Been up to

312
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,543
Reinforcing the system

313
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,847
That allows people to assault women

314
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,895
They deserve to be made

315
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,199
If you're uncomfortable as this makes

316
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,991
Survivors of assault

317
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:47,743
I'm liking this person so far

318
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:53,119
Painful death

319
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:02,847
Cuz I think she got kicked off Twitter for it

320
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:08,223
Prominent woman getting kicked

321
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,271
Twitter for Scotia

322
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,087
At the very least

323
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:20,512
A response to a horrible Injustice that is being committed

324
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,304
Odd

325
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,840
Weird

326
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,864
Very weird

327
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,656
Justices

328
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:33,312
So I don't think his delivery especially if they want to cut

329
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:39,968
You're welcome I'm fine with it

330
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,504
Already did

331
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,832
I'm kind of for that for Supreme Court Justices

332
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,600
You know what I mean

333
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,904
Interesting things to do

334
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,768
You want to have

335
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:59,168
Well ovaries of the female Supreme Court Justice

336
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:05,056
Supreme box but it would be interesting to put on some sort of

337
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,080
You can't have kids

338
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,872
If you're on the Supreme Court.

339
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,664
Because that would buy us your opinion

340
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:17,088
Future stuff

341
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,112
Saying is that

342
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:21,184
The Fantastic thing about what's going on right now

343
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,280
Is that reveals the Supreme Court to be the Sham that is always be

344
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:31,680
Subway has never been anything anybody has ever had

345
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:36,288
Impartial Justice is all they need to do is look at this now and be like

346
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,848
Anal that's full of s***

347
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,784
You assume it has especially like in earlier times

348
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,600
20 years where the Supreme Court wasn't awful

349
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,160
Baby where the Supreme Court

350
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,208
Aurelia get your argument

351
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,768
I'm still not convinced the black people are people

352
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,072
Right right there was a tough time

353
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,608
Something for every

354
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,448
Here's the deal

355
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,496
I'm not telling you the

356
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,776
The truth about the story again

357
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,824
But part of that is because

358
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:14,944
Point in the show we're maybe like 20 minutes into Alex's episode little bit less than that

359
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,504
But Alex realizes on air

360
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,808
He hasn't read the story either

361
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,368
Like he doesn't actually

362
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,928
Of course.

363
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:29,792
He doesn't realize he realizes in the middle of talking about stuff

364
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,560
He needs

365
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,864
More contact than the headline

366
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,144
And he doesn't have it

367
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,496
She just knows brain control program

368
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:42,592
She implanted memories whatever you got like the bullet

369
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,360
But he can't

370
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,640
You can't do it you realize

371
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:48,480
Two important of a story for me I should probably skimm this thing

372
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,272
So he fakes

373
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,040
Beyond air

374
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,344
Very regularly

375
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,368
This is pretty funny

376
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,672
Surprise surprise

377
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,768
Long

378
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,888

380
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,056
Plainview

381
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,080
In Plainview

382
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,896
The most information

383
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,992
It's right there in front of us

384
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,088
Try

385
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,696
Is the most

386
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:33,024
Crap I have ever seen

387
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:39,936
Tell us what they've been trying to do

388
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:55,040
Comeback

389
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,136
How long is the Oscar for

390
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,160
Like 10 minutes

391
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,000
Commercial Insurance

392
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:10,656
Eddie comes back and most of what he's prepared is not so much about this

393
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,680
Got a couple more Beats

394
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,056
What he's done is he's gone in Ringgold articles about the Unabomber

395
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,848
Extra

396
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:22,176
James Holmes the Aurora shooter

397
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:28,576
And that's about it

398
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,672
Quite literally went back into his office

399
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,232
Cauldron

400
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:39,072
Said toilet and then here we are

401
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,424
He just went to his office

402
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,704
Found that little

403
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,288
Wall mount that says in case of emergency brake

404
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:52,896
MK Ultra stories

405
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:57,760
That's my theory now the story is a little bit more robust

406
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,296
We can talk about a little more

407
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,088
Any has this basis of

408
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,112
The Unabomber

409
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,904
And James Holmes

410
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,928
In order to

411
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,744
Into the idea that she's running a mine

412
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
Control

413
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,280
Operation

414
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,816
And

415
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,120
Way ahead of time

416
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,424
I think Alex could get sued

417
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,776
I think this is liable not a lawyer

418
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:23,104
I don't know exactly but if I were doctor Ford

419
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,384
I would sue the s*** out of Alec

420
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,456
He is absolutely lying about her

421
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,736
And it is

422
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:35,392
Dead to rights live if the lawyer for the daily Stormer isn't listening to this

423
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,184
He's on this episode

424
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:51,264
He herded in The Ether

425
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,592
What I don't again

426
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,408
If I were her I probably wouldn't

427
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:00,992
Because of the difficulty and how much of a burden

428
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,272
Some process it would be

429
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,552
But I think she has ground

430
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,048
Dr. Ford

431
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,912
Father brother and brother-in-law CIA

Stanford College

435
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,944
Bald in the recruiting

436
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,968
Can't prove that

437
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,040
Then it got even worse

438
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,064
Connecticut

439
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,024
And more

440
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,840
Instead and how dare them

441
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:52,704
Yeah she was in some program to help people

442
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,080
She Wrote

443
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,872

444
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,152
Murder She Wrote

445
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:09,344

00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:37,248
Last night

450
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,296
Physically ill

451
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:43,648
Because I already knew all about this at my stomach

452
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:49,024
Yeah so cuz he already knew all about it

453
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:55,936
But you heard what you were there at the end there I think one of the very important pieces that just might slide under the rug to most people

454
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,984
But it's that Mike Adams

455
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,520
The health Ranger

456
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,056
Is the one who wrote this story

457
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,896
Natural news is Alex's source

458
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:11,296
For all this we're basically the equivalent of Paul Joseph Watson

459
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,952
Spiritual health

460
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,792
Apparently super rich

461
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,584

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,608
Sky Zone

463
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,960
He makes a lot of website

464
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,496
Like really good urls

465
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,544
Good feo kind of management

466
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,336
I meant Bells advertising on

467
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,616
Network

468
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:39,200
This is what I understand I haven't fully looked into it but from what I understand he has

469
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,248
Hon's if you are elves that are

470
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,528

Epic searches

473
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,600
Just makes tons of money

474
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,136
From the ads on those website

475
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:53,536
Which one

476
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,304
Of the main one

477
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,840
Being this site to put that

478
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,656
Disinformation about help stuff all the time

479
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,704
It's so frustrating

480
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,312
It's so frustrating that we do show where we study all of these people running great

481
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:10,176
Lack of morals

482
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:16,576
Fiber to do whatever it is

483
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,512
Requires a certain

484
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,376
If you will

485
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,400
I don't think you do either

486
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,448
You

487
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,240
Can have my daughter I have

488
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,032
Nothing to do with that

489
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,336
Sorry

490
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,736
Then I saw this last night

491
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,112
The article

492
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,928
I forgot today

493
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,000
Does Media Matters article is

494
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,352
He's more guilty than he knew

495
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:04,448
I don't care about that I didn't look into the letters article because

496
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,240
I'm going based on

497
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,264
The primary source

498
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,616
Oh that's the actual information

499
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:15,456
Alex Jones

500
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,760
Then they're not making that claim

501
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,296
So whatever

502
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,832
Like Media Matters and Light

503
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,624
Be saying which I'm sure Alex is

504
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,392
Misrepresenting

505
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,416
I don't give a s*** about

506
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,464
Yeah I care about what Mike Adams

507
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,232
The health Ranger

508
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,512
And Alex Jones

509
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,536
The freedom range

510
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,888
I have no response

511
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,936
Joe Carroll

00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,224

Author of a mind control study

515
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:02,560
Very clear like what is claim is is not changing

516
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,584
It's very consistent

517
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,888
He's running these

518
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,680
Mind control studies

520
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,008
I think you were

521
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,824
This is not at all what you would expect his ankles

522
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:20,480
No I was not going to I was I I actually kind of appreciate

523
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:26,880
Women are always lying about sexual assault

524
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:33,024
What's great about this

525
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:39,424
You would probably saying that women are always lying a week ago talk about

526
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,288
This is great

527
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,336
Because it gives us an Avenue to

528
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,640
To discuss Alex Jones is crazy

529
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,664
David Cavanaugh

530
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,432
Ford

531
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,736
But at the same time we don't have to dwell

532
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,760
Deeply in

533
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:58,624
Basic stuff that you hope humans just understand

534
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,416
Very very first off

535
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,024
You shouldn't be on the Supreme Court

536
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,048
No matter what

537
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,328
Because of his views

538
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,984
Behaviors outside of the

539
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,800
He should not be anywhere near anywhere

And propped up

544
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,272
And and

545
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:29,856
Defended by the people who probably did this

546
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:34,464
Attacking a woman

547
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,768
It's literally

548
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,328
I don't know if there's any way you can

549
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,608
Comeback

550
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,656
Like her life is never the same

551
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:49,056
No

552
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,616
She's it's not that I don't want to I don't want to say

553
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:54,688
Oh she's gone and ruined her life she has

554
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,528
John something in one moment that will a revocable

555
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,064
Any aspect of her life

556
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,648
Forever and ever and ever

557
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:07,232
China irrevocably changed his life

558
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:13,632
Exactly like 121

559
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:17,472
To that but you have to stand up

560
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,800
No matter what

561
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:26,432
Speak it to death and I drink

562
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,968
Look who is

563
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:35,648
I think for most of us there's that that sort of Mighty Mighty Bosstones

564
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,744
Thank God I've never had to knock on wood

565
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,816
But I wonder if I could do it

566
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:48,192
Don't have to make that decision

567
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,240
And I think that anybody who judges

568
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,800
That decision without

569
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
Understanding of

570
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,616
He's being

571
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,640
Remarkably

572
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,688
Not only to her but

573
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,832
Mini

574
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,904
Many other people have done much better analysis

575
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:08,928
This situation

576
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,464
Weary

577
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,304
But that is

578
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,144
Is a bisque

579
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,192
In this next

580
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:22,752

582
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,336
Ford like the kind of things that you would expect

583
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,360
Figure Alex

584
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:38,112
It's just regular old there's no bottom to how bad conservatives bowl-shaped

585
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:41,184
Alex

586
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,048
Dr. Ford

So I did the Hillary Clinton won is because that's basically what you do

591
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,392
Back there 100

592
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:17,792
Anybody who gives us why we need only

00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:20,352
People who believe in the right on the Supreme Court that makes perfect

594
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:25,984
About being an executive for an ru-486

595
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:32,128
Cuz I have no idea

596
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:36,992
Selectors the morning-after pill that isn't supportive Phil but if you are

597
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,528
Too late for that

598
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,808
Rent-A-Car will u46

599
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,112
And it will cause

600
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:47,744
An abortion intermediate period between

601
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:54,144
Late enough for you to have to

602
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:59,776

603
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:04,896

Reposted or natural

605
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:16,928
So the Smoking Gun that Mike has dug up the doctor blasey Ford is listed as one of the authors on

606
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,256
It is Publications put out by a business

Capitalism is crazy but it's not back

612
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:43,296
I have no idea what has been around

00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:47,648

619
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,176
Because of her financial stake

620
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,456
This business course

621
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:12,992

Efficacy in the olanzapine model in the

Okay correctly

638
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,800
What she is doing

639
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,568
Is

640
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,360
They've got this product

641
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,128
That

642
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,176
Risperidone

643
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,736
Which is

644
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,016
And she is like

645
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,320
Early they were like hey

646
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,416
We could use it for other stuff

647
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:28,000
And she was like

648
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:32,352
Reduces weight gain because of the effect

649
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:39,008
Is abortion has to do with corticoid levels and 41

650
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:41,568
Chemical that can be used to do all kinds of things

651
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:47,968
And we just found out that I remember from when I was younger with Wellbutrin

652
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:52,576
Under another name

653
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:54,880
The things in the

654
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,184
The pharmaceutical industry of very common

655
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:00,000
So none of this research has anything to do with abortions

656
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,024
It's not

657
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:05,120
Palo Alto University document

658
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:07,168
Sport is the director of biostatistics

659
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:13,824
So even allowing that she might have been employed by them 3 years ago that doesn't prove that she is now

660
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,872
Which kind of hurts this motives are

661
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:16,896
Strike before

662
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,432
But you trying to protect this

663
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,456
Pro Financial

664
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:23,808
Further it appears that if anything Ford was working to study new application

665
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,832
Crystal

666
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:27,136
Is a pill that can induce abortion

667
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,184
If anything this should be seen as proof

668
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,744
The Destroyer

669
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,120
To keep abortion legal is the argument is that she's financially motivated by the interest in the company

670
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:41,472
The article and the basis of his argument will be flimsy as hell on its own

671
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,240
But it's made

672
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:47,360
Completely unacceptable by Mike Adams inability to stop himself from also calling for the hor

673
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:49,408
Throughout the article

674
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:56,576
Christine Baisley scrubs her internet history to eliminate evidence of hazy drunk and sex parties documented in her High School

675
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:59,392
Yearbooks school yearbook of Christine blasey

676
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:03,744
It's full of accounts of wild drunken sex parties attended by Glaceon others

677
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,096
He concludes by patting himself on the back for a job well done

678
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,728
Now it all becomes clear Christine blasey clearly fabricated the false allegation

679
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,008
Kavanaugh

680
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,288
Protect her own income

681
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:22,432
It profits from an abortion pill drug company whose future might be impacted by Kavanaugh's confirmation on the court

682
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:27,296
What I have to say about this ru-486 angle

683
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,320
It makes no sense

684
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:31,392
And the article that Micah Adams wrote about his full of s***

685
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:35,488
I mean

686
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,536
It doesn't just remove the motive

687
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:38,816
It actually

688
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:42,656
Complete 180 degrees

689
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,448
Where at

690
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,752
If abortion made illegal

691
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:53,151
Her research would be even more important to the company because they've got this thing and they got to find another use for

692
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,967
Yeah Subway but I still

693
00:41:56,223 --> 00:42:02,367
This whole thing is bulshit but I'm just saying that if you're going to pull that argument then it doesn't make any f****** sense.

694
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,143
Make

695
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:17,471
The actual fact make your argument week

696
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,239
And

697
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:21,055
Lightly.

698
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:26,175
Ru-486

699
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:35,647
Organization

700
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,727
Instead of looking at what she did

701
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:52,287
University

702
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,407

Control operation

704
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,135
So again

705
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,183
Very clear

706
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,463
His assertion

707
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,023
I just want that

708
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:16,351
To be driven home

709
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,423
Implant memories

710
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,447
Better not real

711
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:21,727
But

712
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:25,311
She can also remember he's that are real

713
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:28,895
I don't think that that's legally actionable if you think that she can do that

714
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,503
I'm just calling you a wizard

715
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:40,159
You don't like ours I think it is legally actionable to claim that she's involved in that sort of

716
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,719
Study for nefarious purposes

717
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,767
And s*** like that

718
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,887
I wouldn't be there but I think you

719
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,215
To the point where Alec

00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:54,751

722
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:58,335
And now let's see what is actually in there

723
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,359
According to Alex

724
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,407
And then I'll tell you on the other side

725
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,431
What's in there

Don't think that they're hiring I don't think that the hierarchy is like a

755
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:35,775
What are the difficulties of being on the mend from this

756
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:50,111
Now it's time to Barrel I enjoyed listening

757
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:52,671
Alex repeatedly bring up the cheese in mind

758
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:53,695
Control studies

759
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:56,255
And all this because here's the exit

760
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:02,911
Alex Jones claims he's found and red studies the doctor blasey Ford was engaged

761
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:09,311
Are there evidence of Mind Control

762
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,591
2008

763
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:13,407
11 researcher

764
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:15,711
She wasn't even on it

765
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:20,831
I would guess that Alex was very intentionally not reading out the name of the study

766
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,391
Because even that would make it look Super Why

767
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:24,415
Here's the name

768
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:29,535
Meditation with yoga group therapy with hypnosis and psychoeducation

769
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,327
For long-term depressed mood

770
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,863
A randomized pilot

771
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:38,239
The pilot study participant

772
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,799
If there were any differences

773
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:41,567
Outcome

774
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,591
Depressed

775
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,383
Treated with medication

776
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,943
Which is really just a form of therapy that involves Edge

777
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,223
Vacation about mental illness

778
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,247
Weather

779
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:53,855
Educating the actual patient generally it'll be their family members

780
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:56,927
Some friends to help them be a support network for the purse

781
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,719
That's all psycho

782
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:03,071
Let's rejoin mysticism around this this is

783
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:07,167
Here you are a depressed person

784
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:09,471
Medication

785
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,239
What

786
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,007
Depression is

787
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:15,615
Experience

788
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:22,015
You better in that way you don't feel the friction that you get whenever you're depressed all the time where you feel like you're alone and miserable and nobody

789
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:26,879
F****** around it's been shown to be there's been indications

790
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:28,159
Successful event

791
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,439
Visual therapy

792
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,487
But I don't know if there's

793
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,511
I don't I don't know if that's

794
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:36,095
The consensus opinion

795
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,119
Education

796
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:43,519
You know when you're depressed your default is I am being ostracized

797
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:48,639
Gives you a like a workaround for that where you like

798
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:54,015
Not only am I not actually being ostracized but I know that I'm not right

799
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:56,063
I'm all I'm saying

800
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:59,391
It sounds

801
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,951
So you got psychoeducation that's one

802
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,487
In this

803
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,279
Tripartite

804
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:07,839
23

805
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:13,983
The 2nd is meditation and yoga in addition to

806
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,287
Hypnosis

807
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,311
Again with the addition

808
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,335
Psychoeducation

809
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:21,919
Is a pretty standard experiment with a control group in two variables

810
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:25,247
There's nothing nefarious or scary about hypnosis being used in a clinic

811
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,391
Control

812
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:35,487
I've been in therapy that used hypnosis before

813
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:36,511
NetSpend

814
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:40,095
Sometimes a very very useful tool

815
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,119
Incredibly annoying

816
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:47,519
Not this isn't doing anything

817
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,543
I am not

818
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,079
Getting in any kind of

819
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,615
Comfortable

820
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,639
In fact

821
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,919
Annoying me

822
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:58,015
The article in Infowars is written by the health Ranger

823
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:01,087
There's a textbook case of cherry-picking words in order to war

824
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:07,487
And it should serve as a perfect demonstration of how Mike Adams is a less trustworthy source for medical information than me

825
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,767
High School Dropout

826
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:15,167
I was getting a little petty what I have.

827
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,311
I do like this all made me very mad

828
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,615
So in the article Mike says quote

829
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:26,175
The full text of the research paper describes methods

830
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,479
Create artificial situation

831
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:31,551
He then goes on to start a quote from the tech

832
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,575
Text with an ellipsis

833
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:37,951
Assisting the retrieval of important memories and create artificial situation

834
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:41,279
Sonic

835
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,303
Emotions in a safe

836
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,071
Manor

837
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:43,839
So

838
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:44,607
Right there

839
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:51,007
The create artificial situations planted false memories

840
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,823
Who trying to make

841
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,151
So that there is there that start Steel

842
00:50:59,455 --> 00:50:59,967
Situations

843
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:01,759
Contacts

844
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,831
Sounds a little bad but it also sounds like bad grammar

845
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:11,231
What is the first Indiana Jones

846
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,279
Jason Dawson

847
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:21,983
Is this rhetoric

848
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:27,871
Does that quote very intentional

849
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:31,711
As just before we start discussing how hypnosis

850
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,247
Therapeutic tool

851
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:37,855
And in fact this goat is bold is not from the discussion of the study at all

852
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:40,159
Hypnosis

853
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,183
Here's the quote

854
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:44,767
Hypnosis is a form of Highly focused attention

855
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,327
The relative constriction of peripheral awareness

856
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,119
It has been used successfully as an

857
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,143
Adjunctive therapy

858
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,959
In 1964

859
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,751
Abraham's suggested that hypnosis

860
00:51:55,007 --> 00:52:00,639
Could be used to improve Rapport in the therapeutic relationship assist in the retrieval of important memories

861
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:03,199
A pretty artificial situations that would permit

862
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,991
Client expressed ego-dystonic

863
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:05,759
Emotions

864
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,527
Genesis Manor

865
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:12,159
Gotcha so you have right there that he's completely taking this out of context to imply that

866
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:17,791
That quote isn't relation to the actual study

867
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,071
How about the history of the

868
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,351
The use of hypnosis

869
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,631
In therapeutic session

870
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:23,679
Like this is incredibly

871
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,983
This is the clunky thing I've ever ate

872
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,775
It's not monkey it's intentional

873
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:30,591
But like if this was someone who is head good

874
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:37,247
It was coming from a place of like I actually believe what I'm putting down

875
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:40,575
I've ever seen in my life

876
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,343
Your

877
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,135
Doing it terribly

878
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:47,231
It's intentional an interesting

879
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:47,999
Situation though

880
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,023
There is that

881
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,303
He kind of

882
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,607
He kind of gives us into this place where you ask

883
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,375
Stop the question

884
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:54,655
Should we

885
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,959
Sad face

886
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:57,983
How to read

887
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:01,823
Who acted in bad faith had a

888
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:02,847
Or

889
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,919
Should we teach people who act in bad faith how to read better

890
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,711
Because he is doing both

891
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:14,623
The points that would

892
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,903
Show him to be a liar

893
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,535
See what that's what I'm talkin about that would be

894
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,583
What I would believe if someone was operating

895
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:24,607
Promo codes

896
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,703
Position that they don't understand there's

897
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,983
This is not stupid

898
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,031
This is Louis.

899
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:35,359
Malicious

900
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:40,735
Oh yeah you're right now

901
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:44,575
So I'm guessing that Alex Jones Mike Adams uses

902
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,855
Selective use of quotation

903
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:46,879
Stuff like that

904
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,927
Involves math

905
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,719
Because the study setup

906
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,487
Had a group

907
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,279
Is referenced

908
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:54,559
Hypnosis therapy

909
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:00,959
The reasoning of the researchers is that group therapy

910
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:01,727
Effective in treating

911
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,775
Has depression often includes

912
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,823
Cuz you clearly already brought up

913
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,615
A major Elementary field isolate

914
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,151
Like no one understands lyrics

915
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:09,919
Experiencing

916
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:12,735
So putting people in the situation where they're getting

917
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,503
What is jump

918
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,271
Really

919
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,319
A guided way to focus

920
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:18,879
Your attention and two

921
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:25,279
Cut-off peripheral stimuli or meditation or whatever

922
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:29,887
So did its basically too

923
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:30,655
Lightfoot

924
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:36,543
What is Hypnotic Focus

925
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,079
And the other is

926
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:38,847
Meditative

927
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:40,639
Yoga mat

928
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:48,063
I don't see anything suspicious that the idea of like having a group therapy session that involves hypnosis

929
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:51,647
Whether or not that provide

930
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,671
Is it better outcome for

931
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,583
With those memories

932
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,143
Here is the study of

933
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:02,911
Conclusion

934
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:07,775
The present pilot study examined whether meditation with yoga and cycle

935
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:10,847
Patient education

936
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:13,919
Could affect diagnostic status

937
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,967
Compare to psycho-educational loan

938
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,039
Among the sample of adults suffering from long-term depression

939
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,599
We found promising preliminary support

940
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:23,903
The use of these interventions to improve diagnostic

941
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:27,487
Status in ward off the development of further major depressive episode

942
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,791
We did not vote demonstrated

943
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:32,351
Stickley significant Improvement in overall symptoms

944
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:34,911
To report over the course of the study

945
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:39,263
The conclusion of the study is the most effective

946
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:42,335
But the hypnosis is better than just psychotherapy

947
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,663
Irrelevant

948
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:46,943
Conclusively

949
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:52,831
It's a little strange that Mike Adams makes this declaration in his article about this site

950
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:56,927
Bliss paper co-authored by Christine blasey Ford

951
00:55:57,183 --> 00:56:02,303
We know she's intimately familiar with Max hypnosis hypnosis in mind alteration process

952
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:06,655
All of which are being deployed in this assault on Brett Kavanaugh

953
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,983
Through carefully crafted leaks cover-ups and media narrative

954
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:12,799
Almost half of the nation is already been Mass hypnotized

955
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:16,127
If it believing that it isn't man is a deranged serial rapist

956
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,967
Such is the power of CIA mind-control to Floyd

957
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:20,735
Nationwide

958
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,015
So

959
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:24,319
You see the argument that developed

960
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,135
Because

961
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:29,439
She is involved with a

962
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,743
Mass mind control

963
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:34,559
Study that's what she's doing

964
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,351
To the world

965
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:39,423
You know it's really fascinating

966
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:43,263
Because

967
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:49,919
To see the diva level by which they

968
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:55,039
Give me where they're like there's no

969
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:58,111
I mean obviously yes if they're doing a study they can control mine

970
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:00,159
Like even if the study's results

971
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:06,047
Well we did a lot of stuff and

972
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:08,863
You know us to Pista clean it was

973
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:12,191
Maybe better and kind of insignificant we would need to do more research

974
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:15,263
Yeah yeah yeah

975
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,055
And what they're coming up with it

976
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:25,759
Do any of this other controller

977
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:26,527
What's the winter

978
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,575
Alex

979
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,343
Mike Adams

980
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,623
Relationship with science

981
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:38,047
It didn't send through the way you're describing which I think is pretty accurate

982
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:42,399
Like they have 20 forever

983
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:48,799
Sort of nebulous force that they're up against they have to be omnipotent and also completely f****** stupid

984
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:51,359
The only authorized their enemies

985
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:52,639
Is because that's the only

986
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:55,199
Space in which the con really work

987
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:58,015
Howard

988
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:58,783
2

989
00:57:59,039 --> 00:57:59,807
Craziest

990
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,343
What is convenient

991
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:07,743
You can't you can't tell anything about the climate from research like that

992
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:13,375
It is with

993
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:14,655
Stupid

994
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:21,055
Look there these infinite beings who can travel through space and time and all this

995
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:24,639
Fly B-25 bombers

996
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:27,199
Your imagination is s***

997
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:30,271
Kind of like eyewear

998
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:33,855
Historic black

999
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,903
You can't even imagine a wave

1000
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:41,023
Your liens to be prosecuted about you pay for them

1001
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,839
F****** figure it out

1002
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:44,607
Right

1003
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:51,007
Do a second draft on your b*******

1004
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:56,127
First Niagara

1005
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:57,919
This stuff

1006
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,943
Isn't done yet

1007
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,223
Unfortunately

1008
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:04,063
This is the main

1009
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:09,439
Tell good

1010
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:12,767
Pilot podcast project

1011
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,399
So unfortunately

1012
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:23,007
All of this idea of mine

1013
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:23,775
Control trailer

1014
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:28,639
But Mike Adams articles actually about a whole lot more

1015
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,687
And Alex in this next clip starts

1016
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:31,967
To touch on that

1017
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,247
Edit

1018
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,015
So

1019
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,231
Exception

1020
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:45,791
Neuroimaging

1021
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,839
Biological

1022
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:54,495
Drugs chemicals

1023
00:59:54,751 --> 01:00:00,895
Voices for some audible frequency emotional mood

1024
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:06,015
So this is from

1025
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,551
A study that Alex's again

1026
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,319
Taking out a contest

1027
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:09,599
But

1028
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:11,647
The stuff about

1029
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,415
The

1030
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:13,951
Implanting voices

1031
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:14,975
Stuff like that

1032
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:21,375
Talking about what

1033
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:22,911
Have that weapon

1034
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,447
And s*** like that

1035
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,335
You shouldn't

1036
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,687
How how is it that we live in such a

1037
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:36,223
Tiered world of like

1038
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:39,807
Alex doesn't even understand the words that he's

1039
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:48,511
Like you shouldn't even be he shouldn't even be allowed to read articles about science without take

1040
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:49,535
Making a f****** Bachelor

1041
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,815
Please course

1042
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:53,119
Because he just doesn't understand

1043
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,911
Like in this situation

1044
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:57,471
Obviously he's using them in bad faith

1045
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:00,031
But he also has no idea what they're f******

1046
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:08,479
If you didn't read this or stuff about it all literally only operating off like atoms

1047
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:13,855
No

1048
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:15,391
Stuffy's operating off

1049
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,671
Paul Joseph Watson

1050
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:17,439
Sympathy

1051
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:23,327
All of these people like Mike Adams like Paul Joseph Watson like curtain Mo back in the day

1052
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:26,911
Like Steve Watson all of them serve the most essential purpose

1053
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:28,191
And that is

1054
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:33,055
They take whatever Rob material is there and turn it into fuel that Alex

1055
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:33,823
Confused

1056
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,127
Use the raw material

1057
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:37,663
He's not creative enough

1058
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,431
And

1059
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,199
He is

1060
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,223
Can't be bothered

1061
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:44,319
So he couldn't take these original articles or those studies

1062
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:50,719
And do this with it well that first one actually wasn't

1063
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:06,335
You guys got to learn how to throw f****** there before I pay any attention

1064
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,871
Dr. Ford was involved in

1065
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:12,479
In 2009

1066
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:15,551
The second one

1067
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:18,111
One was a little bit more

1068
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:23,231
The beginning of the clip Mike Adams

1069
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,767
He's making this argument

1070
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:27,583
That this group the mental Insight Foundation

1071
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:28,863
Funded

1072
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,679
The original study 2008

1073
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:34,239
And another study

1074
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,031
On interception

1075
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:37,567
So you can say they're a bit miffed

1076
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,103
Interoception

1077
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,015
They're trying

1078
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:48,575
They're trying to bridge the gap between these two

1079
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,927
Was involved with

1080
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,487
Dr. Ford study

1081
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:56,767
Simultaneously

1082
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:57,791
Dido

1083
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:58,559
Even

1084
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,327
Broom Orchard

1085
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:04,191
Set the second study that they're talking about doctor for today

1086
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:10,079
So here is Alex talking about this

1087
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:10,847
I can study

1088
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:13,407
And I will tell you this ahead of time

1089
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:18,271
Is looking at a diagram from the study and imagining what it means

1090
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:28,255
Organs

1091
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:34,655
That talks about in this huge paper

1092
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:42,335
Vagus nerve stimulation presentation of information during different phases of visceral rhythms

1093
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:43,615
Assessment

1094
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,783
Look at these documents

1095
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:51,807
I did

1096
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:57,183
Document

1097
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:58,207
It doesn't

1098
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:01,279
Include a picture of the human body

1099
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:04,095
Pictures of

1100
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,399
And then wait for me

1101
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:08,191
Alright and

1102
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,727
It's very clear

1103
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:13,567
From about

1104
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:15,103
A hypothetical

1105
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,639
Amplitude modulation

1106
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:18,431
Superimposed on a static

1107
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:20,991
They're talking about

1108
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:23,295
The 3rd of homeostatic

1109
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:26,111
Rhythm that those organs are

1110
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:28,927
It's important because this article and it's not

1111
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:36,095
Waves that are happening to

1112
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:42,495
Worst incline these like this is how bad the

1113
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:45,823
Liver stinks like I'm fine with that

1114
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:48,895
Facilitating Zack misunderstand

1115
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,175
The first one

1116
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,455
The first article is weak

1117
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:55,551
The title of it is yoga meditation

1118
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:57,343
Hypnosis

1119
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,391
As a treatment for depression

1120
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:01,695
If they read it they will find the conclusion being

1121
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:04,767
Maybe

1122
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:11,167
Statistically significant

1123
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,191
Participants in this

1124
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,727
Has nothing to do with anything

1125
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:14,751
Nefarious adult

1126
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,055
So

1127
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:19,359
Demonstrate

1128
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:27,039
Because that's the case they have to dig a Little Deeper so they come up with the most flimsy connection to dr. forge

1129
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:27,807
Make their argument

1130
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,343
Mike Adams

1131
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:35,487
If you ventured even deeper down this Rabbit Hole you find the same mental inside Foundation that funded the master

1132
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:37,023
Hypnosis mind control study

1133
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:39,071
On which Christine Ford work

1134
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:41,375
Also help another study

1135
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,423
Wealth fund another study called

1136
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:45,983
Interoception and mental-health a road

1137
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:51,359
What problem is this article nor any of its Lake prove that Mental Health

1138
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:54,431
Foundation funded the depression

1139
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:57,503
Speculative Anansi

1140
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:01,087
Shaky start

1141
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:03,391
The health Ranger then tries to make Ford look super

1142
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,159
Suspicious

1143
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:10,559
Because the company that allegedly provided funding for 11 researchers on

1144
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:11,327
Daddy that she was

1145
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:15,167
Wasn't involved in a later the McAdams is scared

1146
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,703
Smoking Gun

1147
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:18,751
Even if everything you saying there is

1148
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,519
True

1149
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:21,311
Has zero to do with Ford

1150
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:24,127
This is deeply disgraceful and so f****** a

1151
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:27,199
Because this s*** is weak to

1152
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:32,831
Mike Adams has to play a three-card Monte game with this article in order to distract her from realizing he's saying nothing

1153
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:36,671
He brings up the entire reception article talked about in the middle

1154
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:40,511
Very quickly go to how the globalist have created Sonic weapons

1155
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:45,631
In order to implant that idea in his readers heads the article must be about

1156
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:49,471
Talking about

1157
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:51,519
Right

1158
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:56,383
There are wiggling

1159
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,663
And then

1160
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:59,711
Related to that says

1161
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:01,247
You know

1162
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:05,599
Things are real and then comes back to it only Joe

1163
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,415
As though those two were related in the instead

1164
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:10,975
Sonic weapons are like a non sequitur

1165
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:20,703
Squiggly lines

1166
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:22,495
Sonic Sonic

1167
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,871
Of this idea that

1168
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,663
The mental

1169
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,431
Foundation

1170
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:32,479
Has done both of these studies

1171
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:33,759
Ford isn't

1172
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,295
Wichita

1173
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,063
Not at all

1174
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,879
The Sonic

1175
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,647
Crimson ghost

1176
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,183
Even playing tonight

1177
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,719
Which don't exist

1178
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,999
Then he excused

1179
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,023
His main flight of

1180
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:47,071
Warm it is unbelievably dishonor

1181
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:50,399
After implanting the idea of Sonic weapons in his readers

1182
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:54,495
Quote getting back to Christine blasey Ford's working

1183
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:56,287
Interoception neuroimaging

1184
01:07:57,055 --> 01:08:00,127
The paper funded by mental Insight Foundation openly admit

1185
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:04,223
That the neuroimaging roadmap can alter decisions behavior and even Concha

1186
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:06,015
It explains quote

1187
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:08,063
Recent years have witnessed a surge of Entry

1188
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:09,599
The topic of Interest option

1189
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,391
To doing part 2

1190
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:16,767
Emotional experience self-regulation

1191
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:20,863
Importantly interoception is not limited to the conscious perception or even

1192
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:23,935
Dr. Ford

1193
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:26,495
0 to do with its article about interoception

1194
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:28,543
Nothing

1195
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:30,335
Her name isn't on it

1196
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:31,871
No organization

1197
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:32,895
He's involved in

1198
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:33,919
Is involved in this art

1199
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:39,295
So getting back to Christine blasey Ford's work on interception neuroimaging

1200
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,575
Is a

1201
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:41,599
Dishonest

1202
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:42,879
Deceitful

1203
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:44,415
Way to present

1204
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:45,695
So-so

1205
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:49,279
Oh s*** so he pulls the the trifecta

1206
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,303
Chico's

1207
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:52,607
Unrelated thing up top

1208
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:56,959
By the way I'm related things

1209
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:59,263
Now let me

1210
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:02,335
Getting back to the thing that she was not involved

1211
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:07,711
But I'm just going to say getting back to dr. Christine blasey Ford and then grammatically

1212
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:11,039
You have no choice but to accept that when I say

1213
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:17,439
Really

1214
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:21,279
Not saying that they're related at all

1215
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,351
He's very clearly

1216
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:26,399
Grammar

1217
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,215
In this

1218
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:32,799
Really which isn't

1219
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:35,615
It's really it that's why I said the sleight-of-hand

1220
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:38,431
He's unprofessional

1221
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:40,223
It's trying to paint a picture

1222
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:42,015
Absolutely not real

1223
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,855
She's only the health Ranger

1224
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:49,183
She's only involved in that study about yoga and depression

1225
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:51,487
Mike link to article

1226
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:57,375
Company found funded them ten years apart

1227
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:58,655
You can even prove that

1228
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:00,703
Additional

1229
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:02,751
About interoception

1230
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:03,775
It's not about what Mike

1231
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:06,079
Interception is basically just

1232
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,359
Internal perceptions

1233
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,383
What one's body is

1234
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:09,151
Experience

1235
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,687
Essentially it's a word used

1236
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:11,967
Describe how the information

1237
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:13,503
From your body goes to your brain

1238
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,807
From your experiential Oregon

1239
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:19,903
And if it's paper which is not a

1240
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:23,999
Just described how external input is interpreted by the body and

1241
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:26,047
Experienced by the brain

1242
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:28,351
Ultimately

1243
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:30,143
Interoceptive feeling today is 1

1244
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:34,751
Because Mike Adams got me to read this long boring science article for no reason

1245
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:37,567
Even if it was about mind control Wichita

1246
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:40,383
It has nothing to do with Doctor four-door anyone

1247
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:41,919
Shown to be involved

1248
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,711
Mike Adams is nada.

1249
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:45,503
Nor does he have any qualifications

1250
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:51,391
But because he called himself a health Ranger and runs of bulshit medical conspiracy website

1251
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,439
Lend some authority to his disgraceful

1252
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:57,279
Embarrassing charades only intended to create a grand conspiracy

1253
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,303
Rug Doctor blasi

1254
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,071
Before

1255
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:01,631
Not believing her is not cruel enough for people like

1256
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:03,679
Not caring is not cooling

1257
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:04,703
People like Alex

1258
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:05,983
He's lost for being a

1259
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:10,335
Is not satisfied unless you publicly argues that her story

1260
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:13,663
Or actually attack on himself and all men

1261
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:15,455
Digital Foundry

1262
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,991
They've no further words.

1263
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:19,551
Is

1264
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:20,319
Shameful

1265
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:22,879
Done now

1266
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,671
There's a little bit

1267
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:25,951
You know

1268
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:27,487
You did you did get it right

1269
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:28,511
I think

1270
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:29,535
Right there

1271
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,583
This entire list

1272
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:32,351
Entire thing

1273
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:35,935
If

1274
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,983
Like to the point where

1275
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:41,823
The only reason cuz you you have to

1276
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:42,591
Think about this

1277
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:44,383
There're others

1278
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,687
Who would be Justice

1279
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:49,503
There's so many other judges

1280
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:50,783
It would be just as awful

1281
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:52,831
This isn't about

1282
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:56,159
This isn't about him being judge this is about

1283
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,487
This is about men

1284
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:01,535
Isabel Mendez

1285
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:02,815
Drawing with like

1286
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:04,095
Beastly

1287
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:06,911
These dudes yeah absolutely

1288
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:09,727
Clarence

1289
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,263
Clarence Thomas's in there

1290
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,431
Like

1291
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:19,967
Infinity I feel like

1292
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:22,783
This is probably not true but

1293
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:26,111
If you go to a place in your head hypothetically where it's like

1294
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,391
Some guy

1295
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,415
Goes in front of Congo

1296
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:30,463
This dude was

1297
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,743
Is drunk all the time

1298
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:33,791
Terrible decision making

1299
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:35,839
He cheated and all that stuff

1300
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:37,375
There would be none of them

1301
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,935
Because it was a woman

1302
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:40,959
And it was specific

1303
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:42,495
Prickly about sexual

1304
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:43,263
Violin

1305
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,055
Every one of these

1306
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,895
F****** planet

1307
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,687
Who are are

1308
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:51,455
Predisposed

1309
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,223
To say that

1310
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:53,759
Women can never

1311
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:54,527
Experience

1312
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:59,647
And if they do they were asking for it was always their fault all of those dudes came out of the woodwork

1313
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:01,439
And the subconscious level of

1314
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:02,463
Just screaming like

1315
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:04,511
It's not real

1316
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:07,583
That's what all of these guys are screaming shortly

1317
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:09,119
Real

1318
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:09,887
Ever

1319
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:12,447
It is not possible to do this

1320
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:16,031
Because women are either asking for it

1321
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:17,311
And then it's their fault

1322
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:19,103
Or they're lying about it

1323
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:29,087
That's sort of the mainstream right

1324
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:31,135
Especially Collins

1325
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:35,487
A lot of those people because Alex the band

1326
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:36,511
To be special

1327
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:37,535
In some way

1328
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:41,631
Breast specialist

1329
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:43,167
Is by abject cruelty

1330
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:48,543
That's not good enough for him this is his manifestation

1331
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:51,359
Funny like we can laugh

1332
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,943
Sheila falconer

1333
01:13:58,527 --> 01:13:59,039
Behind it is

1334
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,063
Deeply cruel

1335
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:02,367
The motivation behind it is

1336
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,439
I think he takes his red

1337
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,719
It didn't happen

1338
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:12,863
He doesn't care even if it offends most

1339
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:14,399
Right-thinking people

1340
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:19,263
Is just like in place

1341
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:25,151
What do it look if you want to just hear about how all women are lying about this s*** go somewhere else

1342
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:27,455
Let me tell you about what's really going on

1343
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:31,551
She's lying about that

1344
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:35,391
Clear in that Mike Adams article

1345
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:37,439
The entire charade

1346
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:40,255
The entire thing of her coming in

1347
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:42,047
Speaking to the Senate Judiciary

1348
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:43,583
Isn't a temp

1349
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:45,119
And also the

1350
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:46,655
Did it come out about it

1351
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:48,191
It's all a mask

1352
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,215
Gnosis

1353
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:52,031
That's being perpetrated on the

1354
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,055
The public right

1355
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:55,615
That's the way to invalidate everything

1356
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,919
Even if you are somebody

1357
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,223
Normally support

1358
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:01,247
Conservatives

1359
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:03,295
Normally support everybody

1360
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,831
But you listen to her

1361
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:07,135
Can you realize holyshit

1362
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,415
I can hear a

1363
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,439
Human beings voice

1364
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:11,231
And a human beings voice that is

1365
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:11,999
Experience

1366
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:15,071
And even as far gone as I am

1367
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:16,863
There's something

1368
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:19,679
Intrinsic about when a human voice cries out in

1369
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:21,471
That I identify with

1370
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:27,871
Let me tell you what I got for you sir you are you are

1371
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:28,895

It's really funny

1387
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:22,655
He's trying to paint this

1388
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:23,935

Circle

1392
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:34,175
He shows off his ability to Google things

1393
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:34,943
Eastbound

1394
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:36,223
That's a good skill

1395
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:40,319
It's so funny without like throughout this entire article he says things like that

1396
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:45,951
We are not fairies unethical or illegal activities on the part of mental Insight Foundation

1397
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:52,351
However to help other internet researchers follow the money leave now uncovered in all this we're publishing public information about the

1398
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:55,935
Foundation that's readily available

1399
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,727
He just got done

1400
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:01,567
He just got done in control your mind

1401
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:05,407
Dr. Ford's testimony was a literal attempted brain control the country

1402
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:10,527
Hey

He ends up listing a bunch of

1405
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:17,439
Resemblance to persons living or dead

1406
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:20,767
Is purely coincidental

1407
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:23,327
At this point like really steps

1408
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:29,471
The mental Insight Foundation took 80 million dollars in 2015

1409
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:34,847
538 Broadway Suite A Sonoma California

01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:37,407
Which appears to be a single family house

1411
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:38,943
This is complete b*******

1412
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:44,063
You can go to Google Street View and see if the address is in the commercial downtown district in Sonoma California

1413
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:47,135
Is across the street from Sonoma Valley Museum of Art

1414
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:48,927

63 ft away from Sonoma Plaza

1416
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:52,511

1417
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:53,791
Not to mention this week

1418
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:57,887
The address which generally isn't a single family home

1419
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:04,287
Also you can find Adventure Race run his locations

He would know that they share an office

01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:35,648
Listed in a public document

1502
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,720
These individuals are any list off the officer

1503
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:41,536
Which is not

1504
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:42,816
Unless

1505
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:47,424
If your nose is a lot of Captain names on this list

1506
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:50,240
It's probably because one of the primary sources of income

1507
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,008
For the Metrolink

1508
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:51,776
Play Foundation

1509
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:54,336
Kimpton Hotel Group LLC

1510
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:57,664
Which generated 2.3 million dollars in revenue for the foundation

1511
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,432
In 2015

1512
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:00,224
There's nothing illegal about that

1513
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,760
It's just an interesting.

1514
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:03,808
No it's not

1515
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:05,600
There's nothing illegal about this

1516
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:11,232
And there's nothing interesting to know

1517
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,512
Old money

1518
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,840
The patriarch of the family

1519
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:16,864
You went to the Army

1520
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,912
And after he got out he became a typewriter sale

1521
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:25,056
I assume you're not reading from Mike Adams articles

1522
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:30,176
If I kind of just went into the history of the Kimpton family

1523
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:36,576
Mike Adams research for this article is so bad that I feel the need to show off by telling you about the history of the computer

1524
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:43,744
The patriarch of the family Bill Kimpton

1525
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,072
He eventually got into Investment Banking and made a whole lot of money

1526
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:50,656
What you use to make even more money by opening the kitchen family Hotel

1527
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:52,448
No

1528
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:56,032
There was a time where you could go for bigger typewriter sales

1529
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:57,824
Investment banker

1530
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:05,504
This door

1531
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:10,624
Created this hotel group represents now over 35 high-end hotels in 29

1532
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,928
But money was not his God

1533
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:18,304
Once during an interview with Success magazine

1534
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,840
Was over

1535
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:20,608
Earning money

1536
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:24,448
Real success you said came from devoting oneself fully to family and friends

1537
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:27,776
She said I've been partially success

1538
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:34,176
Mr. Coronavirus

1539
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:36,480
Mental Insight Foundation

1540
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:39,040
Is thunder the number of research projects into

1541
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:40,064
The various forms of metal

1542
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:46,976
The foundation is particular interest in treating depression using therapy and meditation as alternatives

1543
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:48,000
Prescription drug

1544
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:49,536
Would you something to Alex should be

1545
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:53,632
You would think

1546
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:56,960
Kempton and his life's work

1547
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:58,240
Should be something to Alex

1548
01:24:58,496 --> 01:24:59,264
A hundred percent

1549
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,032
Rent

1550
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:01,312
Bill died

1551
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:02,848
April 2000

1552
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:09,504
Elemental Insight Foundation lives on his wife Isabel

1553
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:16,928
Husband land dell'amico and other family members that I can't sort out who they are

1554
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:17,952
Actually Sophia's mint

1555
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:22,048
There's nothing strange

1556
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:24,352
And seeing the family's Hotel Group.

1557
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:30,752
This family's charity all this information is public

1558
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:31,776
At all

1559
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:35,104
Later just Googled Kipton light goes on to say quote

1560
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:37,408
The foundation donated money to the following

1561
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:44,064
We're not alleging anything nefarious on this list by the way

1562
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,624
Disclaimers in one article

1563
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,160
You're lying out your ass

1564
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:54,560
And he also knows how unhinged

1565
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:57,888
The people who are the internet researchers that might

1566
01:25:58,144 --> 01:26:04,288
Follow up we want internet family's house

1567
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:09,152
Bodone on them and then Byron.

1568
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:13,760
Potential harassment

1569
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:15,296
Right exactly

1570
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:22,976
Braiding damage control in the article interesting

1571
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,256
Music pathetic

1572
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:27,840
He was probably pissed that he had to put it in there in the first place he was

1573
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:34,240
He was probably like I can't even make these.

1574
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:39,616
Created

1575
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:42,688
Tell me about harassing David Hogg

1576
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:46,528
In the aftermath of Parkland shooting

1577
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,576
He created Hogwarts

1578
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:55,232
God that was just a webcam of some Hogs that would actually probably be great by the way

1579
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:59,328
Sarah Shahi

1580
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,120
Tweeted something recently

1581
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:02,144
About

1582
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,448
There's a fat bear watching

1583
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,848
Eyes on fares

1584
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:12,128
I love it

1585
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:19,552
Bear watching

1586
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:20,576
End

1587
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,344
Gritty

1588
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,880
The mascot

1589
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:28,768
Are the only thing

1590
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:35,936
Sack bears

1591
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:39,776
We're so familiar with

1592
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:45,152
I hate to say this

1593
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:51,552
We're getting into a very bear v shark

1594
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:53,856
Nail this home

1595
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:55,904
Read it over Mike Adams

1596
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:57,440
All I have to say is

1597
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,720
This is the definition

1598
01:27:58,976 --> 01:27:59,744
Of pathetic

1599
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,536
Sloppy amateurish

1600
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:05,888
H & H getting the bottom of these stories

1601
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:09,984
I personally offended by how lazy and childish this article to my cat

1602
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:10,752
Put out it

1603
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:13,824
There's literally no substance other than outright lies

1604
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:15,104
And irresponsible

1605
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,128
Conjecture

1606
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:17,152
He could disprove

1607
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:18,176
For 10 minutes of work

1608
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:19,456
F*** him

1609
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:20,224
And f*** out

1610
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:23,296
Cuz we know why they're doing it

1611
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:25,856
Very clear

1612
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:31,488
You know what dance sometimes you got to

1613
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,024
Pull out all the stops

1614
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:37,376
To confirm a monster to the Supreme Court and then just destroyed

1615
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:43,008
Alex actually later in the episode with all his cards on the table accidentally

1616
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,568
It makes it very abundantly clear

1617
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:46,848
The only reason

1618
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:47,872
You fight hard

1619
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:49,152
4

1620
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:50,176
For Cavanaugh

1621
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:51,456
Is because he supports

1622
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:55,040
Trump agenda Alex literally says Cavanaugh

1623
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:55,808
I told Trump

1624
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:57,344
He's going to push his agenda

1625
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:01,952
That's true that's disqualifying pretty much the only thing that

1626
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:10,656
Is the greatest

1627
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,448
Liberal possible

1628
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:14,496
A dream

1629
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,032
Liberal

1630
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:16,800
President was

1631
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:19,104
Yeah

1632
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:23,200
No come on after the first couple of

1633
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:36,768
Present

1634
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:40,864
If they had some sort of backdoor meeting or backroom meeting

1635
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,144
With potential

1636
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:43,168
Supreme Court candidates

1637
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:44,960
And I'm going to put

1638
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:46,240
Push your agenda through

1639
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:48,800
I would say that's absolutely just qualifying

1640
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:49,824
Even though

1641
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:56,992
That is not how the courts should work the point of what we're living through right now

1642
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,528
Becoming right

1643
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:01,600
Absolutely

1644
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:03,904
Recognize it

1645
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:09,024
Complacent

1646
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:13,120
4

1647
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:14,912
Treating it like War outside

1648
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:17,728
Recognizing that the other sites

1649
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,264
I don't think

1650
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:22,336
I don't think the right-thinking normal people should see it is

1651
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:25,408
Prepare themselves

1652
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:28,480
Like actually f******

1653
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:29,248
Protest

1654
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:32,064
You don't like I mean I don't I don't mean that and I needed like

1655
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,344
Hey let's go

1656
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:37,696
As long as there is anybody in there

1657
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:39,744
I'm I'm saying

1658
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:40,768
You know

1659
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,304
We might

1660
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:43,840
End up seeing night

1661
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:45,120
68 convent

1662
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:48,448
We might be in that position where

1663
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:50,240
We all on the left

1664
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:51,520
To get ready to get hit

1665
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:54,848
Where there

1666
01:30:55,104 --> 01:31:00,736
That's it that we've been real for f******

1667
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:07,136
Can you get elected president

1668
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:10,720
We were all like well as president

1669
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:12,512
Maybe things are going to be better now

1670
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:18,912
And they just been f****** fighting a war that we thought was a thought was I think

1671
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:21,728
Maybe I can speak for everybody but I think that a lot of people

1672
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:23,008
Probably thought like

1673
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,312
Conversion therapy

1674
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:26,592
You don't like yeah

1675
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:28,640
Spiders going to room with spiders

1676
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:31,200
Yeah you don't like my brother keeps

1677
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:34,528
I'm terrified of me

1678
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:36,320
As his friend of the show Matt drop

1679
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:38,624
Tuesday bee house

1680
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,440
And next week is not f****** with me

1681
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:42,976
Recognizing the generally

1682
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:45,024
They're doing something

1683
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:48,352
You're flying all around me and not touching me

1684
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:50,144
Feel like I'm not f****** with them then

1685
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,448
That is a form of immersion therapy

1686
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:56,544
We're kind of hoping the idea of like a black man being an office is very scary

1687
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:57,824
You right but

1688
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:04,224
Do you want was going to happen

1689
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,760
And then

1690
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:10,880
Propaganda

1691
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:12,416
Information Warfare

1692
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:13,696
Of the like that

1693
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,768
It's too effective and it doesn't

1694
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:17,792
Respond to reality

1695
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:18,816
Response

1696
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:20,096
What is the meth

1697
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:21,632
What is the

1698
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:22,912
What is the targeted

1699
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:27,264
Because we've already talked about all these studies

1700
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,056
It's f****** b******* we don't need to talk about it more

1701
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:31,616
Yeah

1702
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:33,408
Alex says that she advocate

1703
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:34,432
Torture method

1704
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:36,736
In one of these studies

1705
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:41,600
Unusual this specific language

1706
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:46,720
Trees down where in the studies.

1707
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:48,512
Paragraph about using

1708
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,048
As a therapeutic

1709
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:51,840
Who are guys

1710
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:52,608
What because

1711
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,656
Select application text

1712
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:57,216
Like they're talking about it or contacts.

1713
01:32:57,728 --> 01:33:00,032
It could create an emotional response

1714
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:06,432
It could create a right

1715
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:09,760
Warping it

1716
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:12,320
To report it

1717
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:15,648
There's a big difference between saying hey get a loan in this tank

1718
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,440
By yourself and

1719
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:18,720
Deal with your own thoughts

1720
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:20,256
And

1721
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:23,328
Hey we're going to pour water in your throat

1722
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:29,216
Choosing

1723
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:31,776
Call the United States

1724
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:45,600
Course

1725
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:49,696
Literally

1726
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:59,680
Destroy the Supreme Court nominee

1727
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:02,496
I think you meant to say 2 + 280

1728
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:03,776
Echoes 5 cuz that's a sort of

1729
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:05,056
Normal thing

1730
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:09,664
For which means it's two plus two equals five.

1731
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:10,944
+ 2 equals

1732
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:13,504
How dare you

1733
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,784
What is this

1734
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,576
What is non-euclidean

1735
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:19,392
Get the f*** out of a recent episode Alex

1736
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:20,416
The ministry of Truth

1737
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:24,768
Which is the people who put out two plus two equals five

1738
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:27,328
Not sure what to think about anything anymore

1739
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:30,400
Tell you what I think about the truth

1740
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:32,192
Don't matter

1741
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:34,496
I told you earlier today

1742
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:42,688
Shows up on the show a little bit

1743
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:47,040
He shows up and we have gotten

1744
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:56,000
Is Mark Randazzo

1745
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:02,656
We have filed a action

1746
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:05,984
My rights in California

1747
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:08,288
In San Francisco

1748
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:11,616
Because they tell us the last 10 years

1749
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:16,992
After we filed an injunction Infowars Falls emergency injunction against PayPal in federal court

1750
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:23,392
Doesn't know about Alex

1751
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:27,232
His Wares

1752
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:31,072
Interesting Lee's been kicked off everything else didn't do anybody else

1753
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:33,888
You chose this is the one I'm going to f****** because

1754
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:38,752
Bottom line

1755
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:41,056
Firebird

1756
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:42,592
They posted that online

1757
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:43,616
Posted

1758
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:44,384
Complained

1759
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:53,344
Outside come on

1760
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:57,184
Okay seems to boil down to two

1761
01:35:57,696 --> 01:35:58,464
One of them

1762
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:00,256
Is about

1763
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:01,536
The idea that

1764
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:04,352
His civil rights are being violated

1765
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:08,448
Doesn't sound right because they are targeting him because of his

1766
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:09,472
Political

1767
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:12,032
Now protected

1768
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:13,312
Classes political beliefs

1769
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:14,080
This is not one of

1770
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:21,248
Just because it's not listed as one of the classes in the you like in the actual

1771
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:28,416
Doesn't necessarily mean that it could not be in later on in ya does include

1772
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:34,816
Separate sexual orientation isn't listed as a being included

1773
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:36,864
The idea on that basis

1774
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:42,496
Can make an argument I don't think that's what PayPal already be people to do it I don't think it's

1775
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,032
How

1776
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:44,800
You keep

1777
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:47,360
Doing things like you're doing on this

1778
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:48,896
Argument was like

1779
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:52,480
Oh I was only attacking me because I support Brett Kavanaugh

1780
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:54,016
Right you're like

1781
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,552
Alright well know

1782
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:57,344
Probably not okay

1783
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,392
Or like you could make prep

1784
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:00,416
Probably is in

1785
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:01,440
Huge scare quote

1786
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:03,488
If you wanted to make the argument of

1787
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:07,328
Something like I got kicked off because I believed in trickle down economics

1788
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,888
I believe in small government

1789
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:11,936
I believe in the right to own guns

1790
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:12,704
Right

1791
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:19,104
I think of you

1792
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:19,872
Unruh

1793
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:23,456
Human rights civil rights

1794
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:25,504
In order to make that argument

1795
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,832
Kicking Alex is because

1796
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:29,600
He keeps

1797
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:30,368
Being

1798
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:33,696
Dick ruins people's lives

1799
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:38,816
Nmd don't need to prove a criminal act in order to kick him off the platform

1800
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:41,120
It's not like they're a bank

1801
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:43,424
Or anything like that

1802
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:45,728
Oakes financial transaction

1803
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:48,800
They can do that all they want

1804
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:51,104
I don't have a problem with that

1805
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:53,920
Cuz it's not his political beliefs

1806
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:54,688
They're getting in

1807
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,016
The second argument that he's trying to

1808
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:59,296
To make in this brief

1809
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:00,320
Is there

1810
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:01,856
Infowars

1811
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:03,904
Is the news

1812
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:06,720
Infowarsstore.com

1813
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:08,000
Is not political

1814
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:10,304
And that is the only site that

1815
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,584
Uses PayPal

1816
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,888
So PayPal

1817
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:16,704
By cutting off infowarsstore.com

1818
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:19,008
Forum contest

1819
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:26,176
All right this is an interesting argument anyone outside of a courtroom

1820
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:32,576
I don't know how that works cuz I can I can absolutely

1821
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:35,392
Truly understand like where that argument is coming

1822
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:39,232
Speech Systems Incorporated

1823
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:44,352
Tough to see a disconnect between the two is being operated as separate

1824
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:50,496
Right foot sure you doesn't post harassing content on infowarsstore.com right

1825
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:52,288
So I don't know

1826
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:58,176
That like all of them everything

1827
01:38:58,688 --> 01:39:01,248
With the sales

1828
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:05,856
From infowars.com

1829
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:07,392
None of it is hosted on

1830
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:14,048
So all of the PayPal stuff is all on Infowars store.com

1831
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:15,072
Lose

1832
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:17,888
At least it's at least like

1833
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:29,408
That's a classic

1834
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:32,992
Has the portugee wrote the law realize that you were full of

1835
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:34,272
Bulshit like this

1836
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,856
Yeah cuz if we'd written those laws we were like

1837
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:41,696
Oh and also if you have a URL that's similar like

1838
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:44,768
I don't like to be deposed in this case like I would like them

1839
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:48,608
Cuz I would like to give testimony about

1840
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:50,400
Live.com

1841
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:02,688
Absolutely

1842
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:05,760
For survival

1843
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:08,320
Weirdo

1844
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:09,344
So

1845
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:11,392
That's why Mark Randazzo is

1846
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:15,232
Not going to work

1847
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:18,304
Although I'm interested in it more than

1848
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:21,120
Interested

1849
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:21,888
Because like

1850
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:24,192
High-speed is a desperation

1851
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:25,984
Because it's all he can

1852
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:28,032
Like he knows he's

1853
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:30,592
Probably going to lose it but because

1854
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:33,152
Legal action

1855
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:33,920
Into place

1856
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:36,224
He's allowed to use PayPal for like

1857
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:42,624
Two weeks long

1858
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:46,464
Results of the court case we cannot kick you off PayPal yet

1859
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:51,328
And maybe that'll by him enough time to

1860
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:52,608
The setup

1861
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:59,008
Whether or not exactly yeah

1862
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:03,104
Completely different thing

1863
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:07,712
Gold

1864
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:09,504
I don't know man

1865
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:11,808
Now this is where

1866
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:15,392
Brooklyn.

1867
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:17,696
He does.

1868
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:18,720
But

1869
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:22,816
Here's my theory

1870
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:24,096
Mark Randazzo

1871
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:25,120
Is actually Gray

1872
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:26,912
No he's figured out the game

1873
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:29,216
She has taken these

1874
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:31,264
Like he is taken

1875
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:33,056
F******

1876
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:36,640
What are remoras

1877
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:38,688
What are the ones that the little

1878
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:39,712
Fish that

1879
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:40,992
Suckle on the shark

1880
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:49,184
Dammit this is a weird

1881
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:54,816
Never going to get the lawyers that the sharks

1882
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,608
So he's like

1883
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:59,680
Lawyer up on these dudes nobigdyl

1884
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:02,752
Like white heat if he is filing this lawsuit

1885
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:06,336
The best thing that he could do to say to Alex Jones

1886
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:08,896
Don't make me file this lawsuit

1887
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:10,176
We're going to lose

1888
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:11,456
But

1889
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:13,760
He does not make any money

1890
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:19,392
If he says don't file this lawsuit we're going to latest episode

1891
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:23,232
Billable hours billable hours building hours

1892
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:26,816
This is a great place to go cuz he's

1893
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:27,840
Desperate

1894
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:28,608
But

1895
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:31,936
If he was super Craven and just some sort of like

1896
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:33,216
44

1897
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:35,776
The billable hours and horror for all this stuff

1898
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:37,824
You probably kiss Alex

1899
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:39,616
This clip

1900
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:40,384
Alex is going to

1901
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:41,152
Compare himself

1902
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:46,784
Martinez

1903
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:48,064
A great response

1904
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:54,976
This whole move by Holt Industries

1905
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:57,024
Black folks

1906
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,304
Oh my God

1907
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:08,288
I also would not go that way

1908
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:14,176
Superiority

1909
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:22,112
You know you're going to lose

1910
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:28,512
Hippie the great spotted publicly I will not agree with that

1911
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:34,912
For sure it's exactly like black people anyway

1912
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:36,192
So the check

1913
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:39,264
Clears on

1914
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:46,688
Zero's on this that you did not maybe expect they were going

1915
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:53,088
Alright alright

1916
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:53,856
Send it

1917
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:59,488
Comparison tool

1918
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:02,304
The next comparison

1919
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:06,144
WhatsApp

1920
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,960
Everybody knows system

1921
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:14,592
Ecobank

1922
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:36,608
And so this is happening I'm all the free market your business

1923
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:41,728
Are you butt

1924
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:47,360
Beard

1925
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:49,408
People

1926
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:51,712
In those companies of said we were not working

1927
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:57,856
Colin Kaepernick is proof

1928
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:03,232
I'm sure that nobody within those companies

1929
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,768
To be like look we're cowards

1930
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:06,816
We're just waiting for someone else

1931
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:12,960
Incoordination

1932
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:16,288
All right we all going to get rid of him

1933
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:20,384
Contextualize the world around him

1934
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:21,408
Do anything against him

1935
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:22,944
Giant

1936
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:23,968
Broad

1937
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:25,760
Giants

1938
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:30,624
Cowardly

1939
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:32,928
Jews in the Holocaust

1940
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:36,512
According to Alex

1941
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:44,192
Imagine Alex

1942
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:46,240
Like this whole situation

1943
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,520
Brings me to this like

1944
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:50,080
Mental picture of

1945
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:52,128
Like in the 1920s

1946
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:53,152
All of these

1947
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:55,712
Rich investment banker sitting around the ticker

1948
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:56,480
Tapes

1949
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:59,040
Showing the stock prices and all that s***

1950
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:01,088
M Emmet one of them just seems like

1951
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:07,744
Oh my God PayPal kick him off and then the rest of her like

1952
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:15,936
It's all

1953
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:17,728
Just fantasies about

1954
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:19,008
Life and how would the world

1955
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:25,408
Randazzo's.

1956
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:26,944
But also he doesn't suck

1957
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:27,712
Totally

1958
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:32,576
He's clearly pushing back at least publicly on Alex's dog bowl

1959
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:35,648
And he's also not all that into Kavanaugh

1960
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:38,720
Which is nice too

1961
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:03,296
And

1962
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:16,096
Listen to Alex Azar

1963
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:23,776
Outrageous

1964
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:31,456
Supreme Court

1965
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:47,328
Intentionally or unintentionally

1966
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:54,496
For prejudice you against

1967
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:57,824
Experiencing that was a great moment

1968
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:59,104
Yeah if you

1969
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:02,944
If you take all the argument out of it

1970
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:13,696
9 people who do this for like

1971
01:48:13,952 --> 01:48:14,976
Forever

1972
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:18,560
I assume maybe we shouldn't find a normal guy

1973
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:19,328
How about that

1974
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:20,608
Alex Cooper

1975
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:21,376
Super defense

1976
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:24,192
That's about it

1977
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:26,240
Come back after the break

1978
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:31,104
On the spot

1979
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:32,384
If you're innocent

1980
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:36,480
And they accuse you of

1981
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:42,112
Because of are there was Alex Alex

1982
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:44,416
No

1983
01:48:45,184 --> 01:48:45,696
Goodbye

1984
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:46,720
Also

1985
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:51,840
You owe me Double H

1986
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,448
I almost I almost halfway expected

1987
01:48:57,984 --> 01:48:59,520
Blackadder

1988
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:06,944
The bottom line

1989
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:08,480
Specifically for these hours

1990
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:14,880
I do know however that if he's going on Alex's show that's because there was a line item somewhere in the invoice

1991
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:15,904
I was like

1992
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:17,952
For bulshit that you need me to do

1993
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:22,048
It's interesting because Mark's been on the show before we even covered in episode

1994
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:23,328
He was on before

1995
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,888
When he was just his lawyer in others

1996
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:30,496
Nothing I hope never

1997
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:34,592
I remember this guy cuz he was in my lawyer from

1998
01:49:34,848 --> 01:49:35,360
Others are

1999
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:39,456
This instance has far more than other times

2000
01:49:40,992 --> 01:49:42,528
He seems a very unhappy

2001
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:45,856
He seems like he's under duress a little bit

2002
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:49,440
Alex lays out

2003
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:50,720
Beef

2004
01:49:51,488 --> 01:49:53,280
List of accusations

2005
01:49:53,536 --> 01:49:54,048
I got stalked

2006

Ford

2007
01:49:55,072 --> 01:49:55,840
And then make

2008
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:57,120
Very unfair

2009
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:57,888
Comparison

2010
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:04,544
That's a reason she doesn't like

2011
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:11,968
Or are you again.

2012
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:15,808
False memories

2013
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:17,344

A cooperator studies

2015

You got a whole family in the CIA basically

2016
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:28,608
You got this

2017
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:29,632
Project

2018

And stuff like that

2027
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:56,768
He also showed articles where James home

2031
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:08,288
Continue

2032
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:09,312
Yeah

2033
01:51:11,872 --> 01:51:12,384
Came back into my life

2034
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:17,504
I told him earlier the show

2035
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:19,296
Looking into Red Ice Radio

2036
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:24,928
Big fans

2037
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:26,720
That really bummed me out

2038
01:51:27,488 --> 01:51:31,072
Anyway

2039
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:34,144
This list of accusations

2040
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:35,168
Is really talk

2041
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:37,472
Based on everything we talked about already

2042
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:40,288
I meant he gets

2043
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:44,640
Home they're involved

2044
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:45,920
MKUltra program

2045
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:46,944
The only thing

2046
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:47,712
He's trying to

2047
01:51:48,992 --> 01:51:51,040
Is that the people who were the subject

2048
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:52,320
Of the studies

2049
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:55,392

Curing depression that had ambivalent result

2056
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:11,776
That's how we got the Reds

2057
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:18,944
The Red Skull I'll tell you that right now

2058
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:21,760
Sure

2059
01:52:30,976 --> 01:52:33,536
I don't know

2060
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:35,840
He's talking about the

2061
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:37,376
Ideas

2062
01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:38,912
Sol Cavanagh withdrawal

2063
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:40,448
And then of course

2064
01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:41,984
The next choice

2065
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:43,264
Is Judge Amy Barrett

2066
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:45,568
Presumption

2067
01:52:45,824 --> 01:52:46,592
And she would be the person

2068
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:47,616
Victor

2069
01:52:47,872 --> 01:52:49,408
Gets put in his place

2070
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:50,688
So he lays out

2071
01:52:50,944 --> 01:52:51,968
This is Mike.

2072
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:56,064
Okay no problem

2073
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:00,160
Circumstance

2074
01:53:00,672 --> 01:53:03,744
Amen at the end of this Alex says something

2075
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:04,512
Stalking

2076
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:05,792
That is so far

2077
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:13,472
We left

2078
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:23,200
I saw her slip

2079
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:30,624
Whoever they put me

2080
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:49,056
So is that a plethora negative

2081
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:55,456
I don't know what he's doing there so weird

2082
01:53:58,016 --> 01:53:58,528
F******

2083
01:53:58,784 --> 01:54:00,064
Free Speech lawyer

2084
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:01,344
Is trying to

2085
01:54:02,624 --> 01:54:08,256
Stupid idea about what could happen if Aries mean

2086
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:14,656
That's one of the weirdest deliveries I've ever heard

2087
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:20,032
Real life

2088
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:23,360
If somebody staying under their breath

2089
01:54:23,616 --> 01:54:25,408
Lawyer is talking

2090
01:54:25,664 --> 01:54:26,176
Bear rape

2091
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:28,736
God dammit

2092
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:30,016
The implication

2093
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:32,832
Presented

2094
01:54:34,368 --> 01:54:36,672
Update then say that

2095
01:54:37,184 --> 01:54:43,072
Little kid throat and drinker but the only person who makes

2096
01:54:43,328 --> 01:54:44,352
Is named Alex

2097
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:48,960
Jim Jones

2098
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:54,336
Use words from the 1300

2099
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:56,128
F****** amazing is that

2100
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:57,920
11:00

2101
01:54:58,688 --> 01:54:59,200
No

2102
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:02,528
I bet if she was nominated in the court

2103
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:09,440
She would have been approved by like 56 members of the f****** send it because the Democratic Party

2104
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:10,720
Are you speaking garbage

2105
01:55:10,976 --> 01:55:13,280
Probably they managed to pick for you

2106
01:55:13,536 --> 01:55:14,816
Only

2107
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:21,216
Who would not immediately confirm and the reasons

2108
01:55:21,472 --> 01:55:25,312
Their masculinity

2109
01:55:27,872 --> 01:55:30,432
I would act in 880

2110
01:55:34,272 --> 01:55:37,088
But they still have to f****** allow the guy because

2111
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:43,488
How dare you say that men could possibly do s*** like that f*** you but unfortunately

2112
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:46,816
I don't think

2113
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:48,352
Certify

2114
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:50,656
What is that when

2115
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:52,704
Entrapment

2116
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:57,568
Defending these positions the way they have

2117
01:55:57,824 --> 01:55:59,616
Was there first

2118
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:02,176
I think the reason they got back

2119
01:56:02,432 --> 01:56:03,712
This is Victor

2120
01:56:03,968 --> 01:56:04,480
Chose

2121
01:56:04,992 --> 01:56:10,112
Who would win

2122
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:11,904
Exactly

2123
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:12,672
Call disappear

2124
01:56:13,952 --> 01:56:14,464
Recharge Buffet

2125
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:16,000
Like they could just

2126
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:18,048
You know what

2127
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:23,680
F*** you Kavanagh go back to being whatever bulshit you are exactly

2128
01:56:23,936 --> 01:56:25,728
The best move for them right now

2129
01:56:29,568 --> 01:56:33,152
For them in the Strategic move is washing your hands

2130
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:38,784
Even trying someone else isn't going to play at work like Barrett

2131
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:39,552
But

2132
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:42,368
What they are doing is exactly what

2133
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:48,256
Is happening to what they're all watching happened to Collins and murkowski right now where they're like

2134
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:49,280
Well

2135
01:56:50,048 --> 01:56:51,584
What if they don't vote for

2136
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:52,352
Kavanaugh

2137
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:53,376
Cut Vero

2138
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:54,144
Women

2139
01:56:54,656 --> 01:56:55,680
Not because

2140
01:56:56,448 --> 01:56:58,240
Any other possible reason

2141
01:56:59,264 --> 01:56:59,776
Cuz they're women

2142
01:57:00,032 --> 01:57:04,384
So we can't trust women to always do the things that we want them to

2143
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:05,152
To do

2144
01:57:05,664 --> 01:57:06,688
Even as they watched

2145
01:57:06,944 --> 01:57:08,992
Collins IND murkowski be the

2146
01:57:09,248 --> 01:57:10,784
Dumbest f****** senators in hits

2147
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:12,832
I don't know what to say

2148
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:19,744
Is they're all dumb as strategic as well as tactical level

2149
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:24,608
When I hate it

2150
01:57:24,864 --> 01:57:25,376
Really

2151
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:26,400
I don't really know what

2152
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:29,216
We're done

2153
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:29,984
I guess

2154
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:31,008
For the minute

2155
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:33,056
The sort of

2156
01:57:33,312 --> 01:57:34,336
Bernard defense

2157
01:57:34,592 --> 01:57:35,104
Weird shoe

2158
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:36,128
Weird

2159
01:57:36,384 --> 01:57:36,896
Yeah

2160
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:40,736
Can control minds

2161
01:57:42,016 --> 01:57:46,624
Presented enough evidence where I can safely say that she

2162
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:48,160
Controls the minds of anyone who

2163
01:57:49,696 --> 01:57:53,024
Is a narrative

2164
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:54,816
Different narrative

2165
01:57:57,376 --> 01:57:57,888
F******

2166
01:58:04,032 --> 01:58:07,872
The lgbtq p.i. pedophile

2167
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:08,896
That's not part of it

2168
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:14,784
Love Letters to learn

2169
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:17,088
Reply the video of that

2170
01:58:27,584 --> 01:58:28,096
Your children

2171
01:58:28,608 --> 01:58:29,120
No it's not

2172
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:31,168
This is a story out of the BBC

2173
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:33,216
It was about a classroom

2174
01:58:36,032 --> 01:58:36,544
Discussing

2175
01:58:37,824 --> 01:58:38,592
Wasn't in America

2176
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:43,200
UK so

2177
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:50,624
Sprint

2178
01:58:56,512 --> 01:59:01,632
Is the teacher of the teacher of the class made an assignment where the kids

2179
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:02,400
Right

2180
01:59:02,656 --> 01:59:04,192
Love letter from

2181
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:05,472
To the other

2182
01:59:05,728 --> 01:59:08,032
It's not if you're a girl write to a girl

2183
01:59:08,288 --> 01:59:08,800
If you're a boy

2184
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:11,872
It's a write a love letter to somebody else

2185
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:18,528
Within the context of this story from the perspective of another character in the story

2186
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:23,648
Gave an interview and she's talking about the idea of it like

2187
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:25,440
If you grow up

2188
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:27,232
You're fine just divorced

2189
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:28,000
Be around you

2190
01:59:28,256 --> 01:59:29,792
You're going to end up running

2191
01:59:30,304 --> 01:59:31,328
People of different identities

2192
01:59:32,096 --> 01:59:33,120
Different orientations

2193
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:34,400
If we

2194
01:59:34,656 --> 01:59:35,168
Makepeace

2195
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:36,192
Comfortable with

2196
01:59:36,448 --> 01:59:37,216
That is children

2197
01:59:37,728 --> 01:59:40,032
We won't be weirded out by it later in life

2198
01:59:40,544 --> 01:59:41,824
It'll be something to be able to

2199
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:42,848
Empathize with

2200
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:44,128
Going forward

2201
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:44,896
The icing

2202
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:46,432
Nothing wrong with it

2203
01:59:46,688 --> 01:59:47,712
Because it's not like

2204
01:59:48,224 --> 01:59:48,992
The teacher is

2205
01:59:50,528 --> 01:59:51,552
Write a letter but I want to suck

2206
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:52,832
Don't

2207
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:54,624
Yeah it's not that at all

2208
01:59:56,416 --> 01:59:58,464
If you really want to take issue

2209
01:59:59,488 --> 02:00:01,792
You have to take your issue with all fairy

2210
02:00:02,816 --> 02:00:05,120
You have to take issue with heterosexual stories

2211
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:11,776
Being in park like romance jewelry

2212
02:00:12,032 --> 02:00:15,360
She was 14

2213
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:21,760
Coba

2214
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:28,160
So desperate to me is

2215
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:29,440
Opus Bumpass

2216
02:00:30,976 --> 02:00:32,768
You hear Alex again now every time he

2217
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:40,704
He makes a point of bringing in the P making it worse out of amazed that you make

2218
02:00:44,288 --> 02:00:44,800
You can

2219
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:46,592
Absolutely wrong

2220
02:00:46,848 --> 02:00:47,616
In one sentence

2221
02:00:47,872 --> 02:00:48,896
In all directions

2222
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:52,736
Hey America's just an amazing

2223
02:00:53,248 --> 02:00:59,136
Inclusive country

2224
02:00:59,392 --> 02:01:02,720
The first thing you said was invalidated by the second thing you said

2225
02:01:02,976 --> 02:01:03,744
Weed makes me think so

2226
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,536
That the first thing you said wasn't even

2227
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:10,400
True in the first place

2228
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:11,936
Not an inclusive place in it

2229
02:01:12,448 --> 02:01:15,520
Hens to f****** be in the people who were trying to make an inclusive flights

2230
02:01:15,776 --> 02:01:18,336
Are the 12 ring murdered by your f****** dumb

2231
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:23,456
How dare you how dare you

2232
02:01:23,712 --> 02:01:24,480
What did I do

2233
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:27,296
I don't want him kicked off of Facebook

2234
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:33,696
And all of that for all of the horrors that he's done

2235
02:01:35,744 --> 02:01:39,328
Being able to say America's an inclusive plan

2236
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:40,352
But why

2237
02:01:40,608 --> 02:01:45,984
Have everybody that would make an occlusive

2238
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:49,056
Language

2239
02:01:49,568 --> 02:01:50,336
Three falls under free

2240
02:01:50,592 --> 02:01:52,640
Free speech like I don't think you should kick somebody off

2241
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:56,224
I just wanted to make sense

2242
02:01:56,480 --> 02:02:02,624
Oh I would love I would love for free speech

2243
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:07,744
Advocate Alex being

2244
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:08,768
Sing for saying things like

2245
02:02:09,024 --> 02:02:13,376
Lgbtq equals p

2246
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:15,424
And this is why I should be

2247
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:20,288
No it's fine

2248
02:02:22,336 --> 02:02:24,896
Education campus

2249
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:27,456
Trigger

2250
02:02:37,952 --> 02:02:38,720
Do you know what happened

2251
02:02:38,976 --> 02:02:42,304
Christine Ford planted in that memory

2252
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:45,632
What's 20 *

2253
02:02:45,888 --> 02:02:46,912
Camp to you you think

2254
02:02:47,168 --> 02:02:51,520
Call Larry Nichols office

2255
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:53,312
He haunts me

2256
02:02:57,664 --> 02:02:58,944
FEMA

2257
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:00,480
Provisional government

2258
02:03:05,088 --> 02:03:05,856
Which is

2259
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:11,232
I thought it was very weird today on the 3rd

2260
02:03:11,488 --> 02:03:12,256
Recording it on

2261
02:03:12,768 --> 02:03:14,816
Cuz you are you have a show on Thursday

2262
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:17,888
Today

2263
02:03:18,656 --> 02:03:20,192
All of us got a text

2264
02:03:20,448 --> 02:03:20,960
From the Press

2265
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:27,104
You didn't now lucky you I did everybody almost everybody got a text

2266
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:28,640
From this

2267
02:03:28,896 --> 02:03:29,664
Of the

2268
02:03:30,176 --> 02:03:36,064
FEMA emergency alert system run by the president

2269
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:37,600
Alex

2270
02:03:39,648 --> 02:03:40,160
You have this

2271
02:03:40,672 --> 02:03:41,184
Super

2272
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:42,464
Terrible fear of

2273
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:43,744
FEMA camps

2274
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,280
Which were Hearing in 2000

2275
02:03:46,816 --> 02:03:47,328
He hates me

2276
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:49,632
It's all about

2277
02:03:50,144 --> 02:03:51,680
Vog the continuity of government

2278
02:03:53,728 --> 02:03:56,288
In order to put people in f****** camp

2279
02:03:56,544 --> 02:03:57,824
And then kill him off

2280
02:03:58,080 --> 02:04:03,968
I'm not going to wait my family

2281
02:04:04,736 --> 02:04:07,296
He had her article on infowars.com today

2282
02:04:08,064 --> 02:04:08,576
About

2283
02:04:08,832 --> 02:04:09,344
This

2284
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:12,416
Text message to everybody in America

2285
02:04:12,928 --> 02:04:14,208
Babies being put out

2286
02:04:14,464 --> 02:04:15,488
President

2287
02:04:17,536 --> 02:04:19,328
Right now it's a great idea

2288
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:25,472
He's mocking the idea that anyone would be against

2289
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:29,056
The article on Infowars legitimately was

2290
02:04:29,312 --> 02:04:35,456
No telling all these dumb Council and knock you with move

2291
02:04:39,552 --> 02:04:40,320
All for it

2292
02:04:40,576 --> 02:04:46,720
I would generally have the artist this existence is miserable I had the article up on Infowars

2293
02:04:46,976 --> 02:04:48,256
Dot-com

2294
02:04:48,512 --> 02:04:50,048
Screen I was going to keep it up so I could

2295
02:04:50,304 --> 02:04:51,072
Look at it

2296
02:04:51,328 --> 02:04:53,632
Yeah but my browser

2297
02:04:55,168 --> 02:04:56,448
Yeah Google

2298
02:04:57,728 --> 02:05:00,032
No longer a super smart

2299
02:05:00,288 --> 02:05:01,056
Close that window

2300
02:05:01,568 --> 02:05:04,640
But the entire thing is just this long

2301
02:05:04,896 --> 02:05:06,176
Making fun of

2302
02:05:07,968 --> 02:05:08,736
Libtard

2303
02:05:08,992 --> 02:05:09,504
I got

2304
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:12,064
Who are shocked by and against

2305
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:13,856
The president using

2306
02:05:14,112 --> 02:05:16,416
FEMA in order to text all of them at the same

2307
02:05:17,696 --> 02:05:18,208
Then

2308
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:19,744
At the end of it

2309
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,304
No don't do this don't give me a stinger

2310
02:05:23,072 --> 02:05:23,584
Selfie

2311
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:24,864
Don't do it

2312
02:05:25,376 --> 02:05:25,888
Alex

2313
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:32,032
But if you want Infowars news on your phone

2314
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:38,432
It's amazing you f****** a****** it's crazy

2315
02:05:38,688 --> 02:05:39,712
Juicy in French

2316
02:05:40,736 --> 02:05:41,760
Topeka that pivots

2317
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:47,904
But he's got it

2318
02:05:55,584 --> 02:05:57,120
Shut up now

2319
02:06:00,192 --> 02:06:04,032
The Frog creator

2320
02:06:05,312 --> 02:06:07,360
Settle for nothing

2321
02:06:08,896 --> 02:06:13,760
Because they just want to tell me what images I can use when it's very used and he said it was very good

2322
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:23,232
I need you to find her operation

2323
02:06:29,376 --> 02:06:30,912
Hold on hold on

2324
02:06:31,424 --> 02:06:31,936
Hold on

2325
02:06:32,448 --> 02:06:33,728
You did not get to do it at pivot

2326
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:35,008
After you say

2327
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:37,056
You think I want to see this guy

2328
02:06:37,568 --> 02:06:39,104
He wanted to settle for nothing

2329
02:06:40,128 --> 02:06:41,152
He did he did

2330
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:48,064
Literally said he literally said do you think I want to see this guy who just wants me

2331
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:49,088
Me to save

2332
02:06:49,344 --> 02:06:50,112
Whoops

2333
02:06:50,368 --> 02:06:52,160
I don't want to do that

2334
02:06:52,672 --> 02:06:57,280
We need your money to fund this lawsuit for no reason with no steak

2335
02:06:57,536 --> 02:06:59,584
06

2336
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:04,448
This thing and I missed it

2337
02:07:04,704 --> 02:07:06,240
I wonder if he misspoke

2338
02:07:07,008 --> 02:07:08,032
Like I do Wonder

2339
02:07:08,544 --> 02:07:09,824
Cuz you're right

2340
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:15,712
I wonder if he misspoke

2341
02:07:15,968 --> 02:07:16,480
Just that all four

2342
02:07:16,992 --> 02:07:18,016
No I think he wanted

2343
02:07:18,272 --> 02:07:19,552
Settle for nothing

2344
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:24,160
I bet he would just apologize

2345
02:07:24,672 --> 02:07:30,560
Yep something like that

2346
02:07:31,072 --> 02:07:32,608
Way before the others

2347
02:07:33,376 --> 02:07:35,424
The first one was against

2348
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:37,472
Rutgers cernovich use

2349
02:07:37,728 --> 02:07:38,496
The cover of his book

2350
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:41,824
Right

2351
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:45,664
Use it in any like I mean the other lawsuit

2352
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:46,688
Against Alex

2353
02:07:50,272 --> 02:07:55,392
That was way earlier than those right

2354
02:07:55,648 --> 02:08:01,792
There's a little bit earlier and it was literally the other lawsuits

2355
02:08:03,328 --> 02:08:06,656
If he'd known that there were going to be eight other laws

2356
02:08:11,776 --> 02:08:15,872
Sorry for using pepper the Frog anyways it's just a f****** frog character moving on

2357
02:08:16,128 --> 02:08:18,432
It was earlier than these other lawsuit

2358
02:08:18,688 --> 02:08:19,968
But it was later than like

2359
02:08:20,224 --> 02:08:22,528
Elefante and Hamdi ulukaya

2360
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:24,576
Which word in the middle of

2361
02:08:27,136 --> 02:08:28,928
It's sort of like you know what

2362
02:08:29,184 --> 02:08:31,488
The f****** entire modern history of Alex Jones

2363
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:38,144
Is jumping from lawsuit making apologies and likes Hazard of not

2364
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:39,168
Having to pee

2365
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:45,824
Like settlement settlement General Lee over libel lawsuit

2366
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:47,104
I on the kindness of

2367
02:08:52,224 --> 02:08:56,832
But you survived only at the whim of people don't want to crush him

2368
02:08:57,088 --> 02:08:59,392
Yeah like hungry look higher could have owned

2369
02:08:59,904 --> 02:09:00,416
Probably

2370
02:09:00,672 --> 02:09:06,816
God dammit hungry now you're alright we love you and now you're William B

2371
02:09:07,072 --> 02:09:07,584
I still think

2372
02:09:08,608 --> 02:09:11,424
I still think that even is an admirable choice

2373
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:12,448
I understand

2374
02:09:12,704 --> 02:09:15,520
Because there's no reason to be vindictive about it

2375
02:09:15,776 --> 02:09:16,800
Based on

2376
02:09:18,592 --> 02:09:20,128
You did make a video apology

2377
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:21,152
Yeah

2378
02:09:21,408 --> 02:09:23,456
Here's my view on that

2379
02:09:23,968 --> 02:09:26,016
And this is something that I didn't

2380
02:09:26,272 --> 02:09:26,784
Really learn

2381
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:27,808
Until

2382
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:29,088
A couple nights ago

2383
02:09:30,624 --> 02:09:36,768
Watch she was watching

2384
02:09:37,024 --> 02:09:38,816
Latest season of The Walking Dead

2385
02:09:39,072 --> 02:09:40,864
The end of it

2386
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:44,448
What is f*** doesn't kill the other f****** guy

2387
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:49,056
After there's been a whole f****** fighting like-for-like

2388
02:09:49,312 --> 02:09:55,456
50 people have died but then it's just like the one guy in the other guy that's like I said I'm going to kill you and then he doesn't kill him and his

2389
02:09:55,712 --> 02:09:56,992
Like you're going to be an example

2390
02:09:57,248 --> 02:09:58,528
The whole time I'm sitting there like

2391
02:10:02,368 --> 02:10:08,512
Zombie situations for sure what is Alex Jones but a zombie situations

2392
02:10:10,048 --> 02:10:11,328
You just got it look

2393
02:10:11,584 --> 02:10:12,096
Look

2394
02:10:12,352 --> 02:10:12,864
I get it

2395
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:15,680
I'm all for it we got to Build a Better World

2396
02:10:15,936 --> 02:10:22,080
But don't build a better world with this guy we got other guys to be like all look this is the guy

2397
02:10:23,104 --> 02:10:29,248
I sincerely sincerely believe that we live in a society that

2398
02:10:29,504 --> 02:10:30,016
What is room for

2399
02:10:30,784 --> 02:10:32,064
I don't think

2400
02:10:32,576 --> 02:10:33,344
Instachat

2401
02:10:33,600 --> 02:10:34,368
Terrible play

2402
02:10:34,624 --> 02:10:38,720
What about that one

2403
02:10:38,976 --> 02:10:45,120
Well look dude

2404
02:10:51,776 --> 02:10:57,920
Because I did not want any of that I don't know

2405
02:11:00,992 --> 02:11:04,064
Actually I thought it was actually good

2406
02:11:05,344 --> 02:11:10,208
Thoughts were as I had watched any of the season

2407
02:11:10,464 --> 02:11:12,512
I watched like the last episode

2408
02:11:13,024 --> 02:11:15,584
I know I know but her point of view is like

2409
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:21,984
I know this is really good

2410
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:28,128
Claire's

2411
02:11:32,224 --> 02:11:32,736
Contain

2412
02:11:32,992 --> 02:11:34,272
Something like an Alex G

2413
02:11:34,784 --> 02:11:35,296
Force

2414
02:11:35,808 --> 02:11:36,832
It's just that it requires

2415
02:11:37,088 --> 02:11:37,856
Everyone else

2416
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:39,392
Aware

2417
02:11:39,904 --> 02:11:41,440
Unaware

2418
02:11:41,696 --> 02:11:42,976
Healthy Society

2419
02:11:43,232 --> 02:11:44,512
Can contain Alex

2420
02:11:44,768 --> 02:11:46,048
Because people read stuff

2421
02:11:47,072 --> 02:11:48,096
Have a good night handsome

2422
02:11:48,352 --> 02:11:50,400
In a society that's already

2423
02:11:50,656 --> 02:11:51,168
Kind of

2424
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:52,192
Rotting

2425
02:11:52,704 --> 02:11:55,776
Or there's there's a cancer within that Society already

2426
02:11:56,288 --> 02:11:58,080
Their defenses are going to be

2427
02:11:58,336 --> 02:11:58,848
Be there too

2428
02:11:59,104 --> 02:11:59,616
To fight

2429
02:11:59,872 --> 02:12:00,384
Or two

2430
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:01,152
Mitigate

2431
02:12:01,408 --> 02:12:02,176
The damage that

2432
02:12:02,432 --> 02:12:03,200
Alex Jones

2433
02:12:03,712 --> 02:12:06,272
Do right right now we're living in a

2434
02:12:06,528 --> 02:12:07,040
Cancerous

2435
02:12:07,296 --> 02:12:08,320
Awful Society

2436
02:12:08,832 --> 02:12:09,600
It Alex Jones

2437
02:12:09,856 --> 02:12:11,136
Exploiting

2438
02:12:12,416 --> 02:12:12,928
The cancers

2439
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:14,720
Yeah

2440
02:12:15,232 --> 02:12:16,000
Trump is the cancer

2441
02:12:16,768 --> 02:12:22,400
The Avatar of the cancer

2442
02:12:22,656 --> 02:12:23,424
Nugenix for sure

2443
02:12:25,216 --> 02:12:25,728
Yeah

2444
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:28,032
Proper

2445
02:12:28,544 --> 02:12:29,824
Everything going well

2446
02:12:30,848 --> 02:12:32,640
Our society could happily flourish

2447
02:12:33,152 --> 02:12:33,920
With Alex Jones

2448
02:12:34,176 --> 02:12:34,688
Doing his

2449
02:12:34,944 --> 02:12:35,968
Crazy fun bowls

2450
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:38,272
And have fun

2451
02:12:38,528 --> 02:12:40,832
But unfortunately we live in

2452
02:12:42,112 --> 02:12:42,624
No

2453
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:44,160
We don't have the immune system

2454
02:12:44,416 --> 02:12:44,928
Fight back

2455
02:12:46,464 --> 02:12:46,976
And it sucks

2456
02:12:47,488 --> 02:12:48,000
But just

2457
02:12:48,256 --> 02:12:49,536
Because we don't have the immune system

2458
02:12:49,792 --> 02:12:50,560
Reply back against

2459
02:12:51,072 --> 02:12:52,352
Doesn't mean that he's any different

2460
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:57,472
You don't think

2461
02:12:57,984 --> 02:13:00,544
We are more susceptible to it and the damage is

2462
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:01,312
Worse because

2463
02:13:01,824 --> 02:13:04,384
That doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to do what you

2464
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:05,664
You do it

2465
02:13:07,968 --> 02:13:09,504
Some of the counter ice cream

2466
02:13:13,088 --> 02:13:14,624
We could handle somebody

2467
02:13:15,136 --> 02:13:15,904
Like Alex

2468
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:17,184
That's all

2469
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:20,256
Exactly

2470
02:13:22,304 --> 02:13:24,352
If we can handle somebody like Alex

2471
02:13:24,608 --> 02:13:27,168
Do you have to take away the clock.

2472
02:13:27,424 --> 02:13:28,960
Which Alex Jones

2473
02:13:29,728 --> 02:13:30,240
Maybe we take

2474
02:13:30,496 --> 02:13:33,312
The Alex Jones to which the extent Alex

2475
02:13:33,824 --> 02:13:37,408
And put his f****** head on the Pike and then the other

2476
02:13:43,552 --> 02:13:45,344
I want to cut off smell so bad

2477
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:51,744
Hellboy

2478
02:13:52,768 --> 02:13:57,632
Novelty menu cocktail

2479
02:13:57,888 --> 02:13:59,424
So

2480
02:13:59,680 --> 02:14:00,192
I don't know

2481
02:14:03,264 --> 02:14:05,056
You wouldn't enjoy our nephew

2482
02:14:05,824 --> 02:14:06,336
Famous

2483
02:14:06,592 --> 02:14:08,640
What you and Elsa's bald getting married

2484
02:14:09,664 --> 02:14:10,176
I would not go

2485
02:14:12,224 --> 02:14:12,736
Think you can do better

2486
02:14:13,248 --> 02:14:14,016
Okay Paradise

2487
02:14:21,952 --> 02:14:24,512
Girl triggered

2488
02:14:24,768 --> 02:14:25,792
Triggered

2489
02:14:26,048 --> 02:14:32,192
Angry whenever somebody accuses of his

2490
02:14:32,448 --> 02:14:38,592
So angry all the time

2491
02:14:43,456 --> 02:14:43,968
In that sort

2492
02:14:46,528 --> 02:14:48,320
Because that's not what this is about

2493
02:14:48,832 --> 02:14:50,624
This is Alex being triggered by

2494
02:14:51,136 --> 02:14:53,696
Watch that

2495
02:14:53,952 --> 02:14:55,232
Which I would argue

2496
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:06,752
Flashlight

2497
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:11,104
Watching Kavanaugh being accused

2498
02:15:11,616 --> 02:15:14,688
Call Chic you so much

2499
02:15:15,456 --> 02:15:15,968
That

2500
02:15:19,552 --> 02:15:25,440
I want to get very aggressive

2501
02:15:44,128 --> 02:15:44,896
Nothing to do with that

2502
02:15:45,152 --> 02:15:51,296
Over you

2503
02:15:54,112 --> 02:15:55,136
I just don't know how to

2504
02:15:55,392 --> 02:15:56,416
Deal with that

2505
02:15:56,928 --> 02:15:58,464
In any sense other than

2506
02:15:58,976 --> 02:15:59,744
For him to say like

2507
02:16:00,512 --> 02:16:02,816
If you're a Democrat and you say anything

2508
02:16:03,072 --> 02:16:03,840
I can't believe

2509
02:16:04,352 --> 02:16:08,704
For me the only reaction is well if

2510
02:16:09,216 --> 02:16:11,776
I can't believe you

2511
02:16:14,336 --> 02:16:18,432
Yeah there's no way for us to communicate if you're a medium

2512
02:16:18,688 --> 02:16:19,968
Your immediate position

2513
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:21,760
Is

2514
02:16:22,016 --> 02:16:25,088
Nothing you say is Meaningful and everything you say is a lot

2515
02:16:25,856 --> 02:16:26,624
What do I say to

2516
02:16:27,392 --> 02:16:28,160
You know

2517
02:16:28,416 --> 02:16:29,696
Right like you you just

2518
02:16:30,208 --> 02:16:30,976
Goodbye

2519
02:16:31,744 --> 02:16:34,816
Any possibility for communication

2520
02:16:35,072 --> 02:16:35,584
Basically

2521
02:16:39,680 --> 02:16:41,728
Okay well then goodbye

2522
02:16:41,984 --> 02:16:45,312
F*** off

2523
02:16:45,568 --> 02:16:47,872
By so many women

2524
02:16:48,128 --> 02:16:50,432
How many women a long

2525
02:16:50,688 --> 02:16:56,832
Laundry list of women who have falsely falsely accused me of so many like rough

2526
02:16:57,088 --> 02:16:59,392
Sleeve for 25 hundred women

2527
02:16:59,648 --> 02:17:00,928
Have falsely

2528
02:17:01,184 --> 02:17:05,792
Definitely not any of them being correct 100% all of them

2529
02:17:07,584 --> 02:17:09,632
I think that I was a lot of like

2530
02:17:10,144 --> 02:17:12,704
Legitimately I'm making a motion

2531
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:15,008
You are

2532
02:17:15,776 --> 02:17:17,056
Actionable

2533
02:17:17,824 --> 02:17:20,128
Against

2534
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:21,920
Agree

2535
02:17:23,456 --> 02:17:23,968
Not

2536
02:17:24,224 --> 02:17:24,736
Zagg

2537
02:17:26,016 --> 02:17:27,296
But actual statement

2538
02:17:27,808 --> 02:17:28,320
She's running

2539
02:17:28,832 --> 02:17:30,624
A mind control CIA

2540
02:17:31,136 --> 02:17:33,952
DARPA funded operation

2541
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:37,536
But yeah

2542
02:17:39,328 --> 02:17:39,840
This is

2543
02:17:40,864 --> 02:17:41,376
Okay

2544
02:17:41,632 --> 02:17:42,400
It's not funny

2545
02:17:44,192 --> 02:17:44,704
Stove top

2546
02:17:45,728 --> 02:17:46,240
Aesthetic

2547
02:17:46,752 --> 02:17:48,288
But you says this towards the end of the

2548
02:17:49,312 --> 02:17:52,384
You don't want to go on there and say that Christine

2549
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:53,920
Wazee Ford

2550
02:17:54,176 --> 02:17:56,224
Is a CIA mind-control operative

2551
02:17:58,272 --> 02:18:04,416
You did she works on

2552
02:18:04,672 --> 02:18:06,464
False memories on

2553
02:18:10,560 --> 02:18:16,192
Program is connected to that that's helping really is a whole thing

2554
02:18:16,448 --> 02:18:19,776

And it's like it never ends

2556
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:30,784
Embarrassed

2557
02:18:35,648 --> 02:18:39,232
I was assigned to stuff like that

2558
02:18:43,584 --> 02:18:44,864
Christian

2559
02:18:46,656 --> 02:18:52,800
Isn't it funny how you parody did exactly that clip earlier in the show it's weird isn't it f****** weird

02:18:53,056 --> 02:18:56,640
That you were like

2561
02:18:58,432 --> 02:19:03,296
Funny how joke can imitate propaganda

2562
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:07,904
It's like a

2563
02:19:08,160 --> 02:19:10,464
Bummer that no matter how

2564
02:19:11,488 --> 02:19:13,280
Full disclosure

2565
02:19:13,536 --> 02:19:17,376
No matter how far you try in Paradis this

2566
02:19:18,656 --> 02:19:19,168

2567
02:19:19,424 --> 02:19:20,192
Go far enough

2568
02:19:20,448 --> 02:19:21,216
No no

2569
02:19:23,776 --> 02:19:26,336
Crazy these guys are

2570
02:19:26,592 --> 02:19:27,616
The next

This is exactly how crazy we are what am I supposed to

2572
02:19:32,992 --> 02:19:35,808
Jokes about the insane clown

To hear that

2574
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:47,328
This world

2575
02:19:47,584 --> 02:19:49,120
Like especially now

2576
02:19:49,376 --> 02:19:50,912
It wasn't this way years ago

2577
02:19:51,424 --> 02:19:53,984
It was fit more restrained

2578
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:54,752
Dishonest

2579
02:19:55,008 --> 02:19:59,360
Absolutely I agree

2580
02:19:59,616 --> 02:20:00,384
The level of

2581
02:20:01,152 --> 02:20:02,176

2586
02:20:10,112 --> 02:20:11,648
Oh yeah

2587
02:20:11,904 --> 02:20:14,208
Unrestrained

2588
02:20:16,512 --> 02:20:17,280
Themselves

2589
02:20:17,792 --> 02:20:18,304
Right

2590
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:20,608

Sing for me somebody who's

Not old enough to have lived through it by like

2600
02:20:50,304 --> 02:20:52,352
If you watch the late eras

2601
02:20:52,608 --> 02:20:53,120
Between

2602
02:20:55,168 --> 02:20:56,960
Carson and then like

2603
02:20:58,240 --> 02:20:59,008
You like Carson

2604
02:20:59,264 --> 02:21:00,800
Could tell a joke

2605
02:21:01,824 --> 02:21:02,592
That was

2606
02:21:03,104 --> 02:21:03,872
Devastate

2607
02:21:05,152 --> 02:21:05,664
That was like

2608
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:08,224
How could you do that

2609
02:21:08,480 --> 02:21:09,248
And no

2610
02:21:09,504 --> 02:21:12,576
Jimmy Kimmel tell a joke that is just like oh that's just a

02:21:14,112 --> 02:21:15,136
Sure like that's just

2613
02:21:15,392 --> 02:21:17,440
Like the late-night host gig is

2614
02:21:17,696 --> 02:21:18,464
Turn from

2615
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:21,024
Parroting to just like reporting

2616
02:21:21,792 --> 02:21:24,096

Using of humor

2618
02:21:26,144 --> 02:21:32,288
Activity vision is even better

2619
02:21:32,544 --> 02:21:36,384
But just like with a little bit of Comedy

2620
02:21:36,896 --> 02:21:43,040
Brian stelter

2621
02:21:43,296 --> 02:21:44,576
And Johnny Carson just be like

2622
02:21:46,112 --> 02:21:47,392
The next thing they want to do is

2623
02:21:47,904 --> 02:21:49,696
Remove kids from their parent

2624
02:21:50,976 --> 02:21:54,816
I honestly think I'm going to give you a contrarian position

2625
02:21:56,608 --> 02:21:57,376
It's exactly what we

2626
02:21:59,424 --> 02:22:01,984
Because the start of state of times

2627
02:22:03,264 --> 02:22:04,032
Do volatile

2628
02:22:04,288 --> 02:22:04,800
An awful

2629
02:22:05,056 --> 02:22:06,336
If you had somebody

2630
02:22:06,592 --> 02:22:07,104
You was making like

2631
02:22:07,616 --> 02:22:08,640
Really

2632
02:22:09,152 --> 02:22:10,688
David blows

2633
02:22:11,456 --> 02:22:12,480
You don't need that

2634
02:22:12,992 --> 02:22:13,504
Zipline

2635
02:22:14,016 --> 02:22:14,784
Because

2636
02:22:16,064 --> 02:22:16,832
Deserve

2637
02:22:18,368 --> 02:22:19,648
What does

2638
02:22:19,904 --> 02:22:23,744
I like that I like where this is going

2639
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:24,512
Totes

2640
02:22:25,024 --> 02:22:25,792
People like

2641
02:22:26,048 --> 02:22:27,072
Jimmy Fallon

2642
02:22:28,096 --> 02:22:28,608
You know

2643
02:22:28,864 --> 02:22:29,888
Rub Trump's hair and B

2644
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:30,912
Call f***

2645
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:32,192
School

2646
02:22:32,448 --> 02:22:33,472
And then James Court

2647
02:22:33,728 --> 02:22:34,240
Avenue

2648
02:22:36,288 --> 02:22:37,056
But mean nothing

2649
02:22:39,104 --> 02:22:39,616
Should be just

2650
02:22:39,872 --> 02:22:40,384
Yeah

2651
02:22:41,408 --> 02:22:42,432
He's great

2652
02:22:42,944 --> 02:22:43,968
James Corden

2653
02:22:44,224 --> 02:22:44,992
A couple of great Epic

2654
02:22:46,528 --> 02:22:47,296
I do

2655
02:22:47,808 --> 02:22:53,184
Love Doctor Who

2656
02:22:53,696 --> 02:22:54,976
Row

2657
02:22:55,232 --> 02:22:56,000
You could do it

2658
02:22:56,256 --> 02:22:57,024
You do it easily

2659
02:22:57,280 --> 02:22:59,072
Yeah in this climate of like

2660
02:22:59,328 --> 02:22:59,840
Comedians

2661
02:23:00,352 --> 02:23:01,632
The various voices that are out

2662
02:23:02,656 --> 02:23:03,424
You could do that very

2663
02:23:03,936 --> 02:23:04,704
You could set up

2664
02:23:05,472 --> 02:23:06,240
They would not make you any

2665
02:23:06,496 --> 02:23:10,080
Free money

2666
02:23:10,848 --> 02:23:11,872
That's why there aren't those

2667
02:23:12,128 --> 02:23:13,664
Plenty of comics who could

2668
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:17,760
Develop that's caving row but they're not allowed anywhere near the shows

2669
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:21,088
Here's what I would say

2670
02:23:22,624 --> 02:23:24,160
The internet is allowed everybody

2671
02:23:24,672 --> 02:23:25,184
Just make what

2672
02:23:27,744 --> 02:23:28,256
You can just

2673
02:23:28,512 --> 02:23:30,048
How late night show

2674
02:23:31,072 --> 02:23:32,352
If you just rent out a theater

2675
02:23:32,864 --> 02:23:33,376
50 bucks

2676
02:23:33,632 --> 02:23:34,144
And have some.

2677
02:23:35,168 --> 02:23:36,448
Camera equipment

2678
02:23:36,704 --> 02:23:38,752
Or if you're on Facebook watch

2679
02:23:39,008 --> 02:23:39,776
Are any of those like

2680
02:23:41,568 --> 02:23:42,592
You can do it yourself

2681
02:23:42,848 --> 02:23:46,176
Is it the soft launch for our Facebook watch

2682
02:23:49,504 --> 02:23:50,272
Geisinger

2683
02:23:52,832 --> 02:23:54,368
Like Autumn map

2684
02:23:54,624 --> 02:23:55,904
Level I don't know if they have

2685
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:03,072
But not to the level of like

2686
02:24:03,584 --> 02:24:05,632
All right we got a demagogue

2687
02:24:05,888 --> 02:24:06,400
Yeah

2688
02:24:06,656 --> 02:24:07,168
I don't think

2689
02:24:07,424 --> 02:24:08,448
The time deserves

2690
02:24:09,472 --> 02:24:11,008
And I also don't think it would work

2691
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:12,544
Because then that person would

2692
02:24:13,568 --> 02:24:14,336
Unilaterally

2693
02:24:15,104 --> 02:24:17,152
By all the various propagandist

2694
02:24:17,664 --> 02:24:18,176
Right right

2695
02:24:18,432 --> 02:24:20,224
Mike cernovich would accuse them of something

2696
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:21,760
Answer the f****** crime they didn't commit

2697
02:24:22,016 --> 02:24:24,320
Drinking children's blood

2698
02:24:24,576 --> 02:24:27,648
And all of a sudden they get bogged down in a lot of bulshit as I can do with

2699
02:24:29,696 --> 02:24:32,768
What you're describing a Zafar show

2700
02:24:33,536 --> 02:24:35,072
I'm not I'm saying

2701
02:24:36,864 --> 02:24:37,376
Lend itself

2702
02:24:40,192 --> 02:24:40,704
I mean even

2703
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:41,984
Early David Letter

2704
02:24:44,032 --> 02:24:45,824
Butterly

2705
02:24:52,224 --> 02:24:53,504
Early David Letterman

2706
02:24:54,016 --> 02:24:57,344
Late David Letterman

2707
02:24:58,112 --> 02:25:00,160
I think about this I don't know if this has anything to do with it

2708
02:25:01,952 --> 02:25:03,232
Cultural entertainment largely

2709
02:25:05,536 --> 02:25:06,304
Liking things

2710
02:25:12,704 --> 02:25:15,520
Like I'm not saying that isn't

2711
02:25:17,056 --> 02:25:22,688
You know that I've made it clear that I get sucked into these Rabbit Hole Irish people try thing

2712
02:25:22,944 --> 02:25:25,504
Have you ever seen Irish people try things

2713
02:25:31,648 --> 02:25:34,976
But like there's there are there are things like that

2714
02:25:35,232 --> 02:25:35,744
Million

2715
02:25:37,024 --> 02:25:39,840
I started to look into it a little bit more

2716
02:25:40,608 --> 02:25:41,120
Empire videos

2717
02:25:41,376 --> 02:25:42,656
I watched a couple

2718
02:25:42,912 --> 02:25:43,424
I don't understand

2719
02:25:51,104 --> 02:25:52,384
BuzzFeed

2720
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:53,664
Diculous YouTube

2721
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:56,736
He has videos on it

2722
02:26:00,064 --> 02:26:06,208
Are we all just get old at this moment right now

2723
02:26:06,464 --> 02:26:08,256
BuzzFeed has

2724
02:26:08,512 --> 02:26:09,024
Millions of

2725
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:11,840
Millie workout videos

2726
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:14,656
Crazy

2727
02:26:14,912 --> 02:26:15,680
And I'm so I got

2728
02:26:16,192 --> 02:26:17,472
Watching

2729
02:26:18,496 --> 02:26:19,008
Speakers

2730
02:26:19,264 --> 02:26:22,848
I would watch one and it would be like there's one there's one

2731
02:26:23,360 --> 02:26:24,128
They have work

2732
02:26:24,384 --> 02:26:25,920
These two guys going

2733
02:26:26,432 --> 02:26:27,200
Tri-C

2734
02:26:27,968 --> 02:26:28,736
At different price

2735
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:30,272
It's called

2736
02:26:30,784 --> 02:26:31,296
So the two

2737
02:26:31,552 --> 02:26:32,576
Go to

2738
02:26:34,112 --> 02:26:34,624
When's really cheap

2739
02:26:35,136 --> 02:26:35,648
The middle one soup

2740
02:26:35,904 --> 02:26:36,416
Super expensive

2741
02:26:36,672 --> 02:26:37,440
Riley

2742
02:26:37,696 --> 02:26:38,208
Which one is

2743
02:26:38,464 --> 02:26:38,976
The best

2744
02:26:39,232 --> 02:26:43,584
It's priced right and that at the end of the day after the supermarket

2745
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:45,120
Fill their cart with the most

2746
02:26:45,376 --> 02:26:46,144
Supremacy

2747
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:48,960
A pretty interesting premise

2748
02:26:49,728 --> 02:26:51,264
I guess with good editing

2749
02:26:51,776 --> 02:26:52,288
It's something

2750
02:26:54,336 --> 02:26:54,848
You get to see

2751
02:26:55,360 --> 02:26:56,384
Three different restaurant

2752
02:26:57,152 --> 02:26:58,176
Which is what all those

2753
02:26:59,200 --> 02:26:59,968
Like food TV

2754
02:27:00,224 --> 02:27:05,856
TV shows really about Diners Drive-Ins and Dives Guy Fieri right about

2755
02:27:06,112 --> 02:27:07,392
These fun restaurants

2756
02:27:07,648 --> 02:27:08,160
So you could imagine

2757
02:27:08,416 --> 02:27:08,928
Turn yourself in

2758
02:27:09,184 --> 02:27:10,464
Right

2759
02:27:10,976 --> 02:27:11,744
So you get to

2760
02:27:13,792 --> 02:27:14,560
I think you also get

2761
02:27:15,328 --> 02:27:15,840
Yourself into

2762
02:27:16,864 --> 02:27:20,448
Because who were they but 20-somethings who have a good job

2763
02:27:20,704 --> 02:27:21,728
Right ba

2764
02:27:21,984 --> 02:27:22,496
Gifted

2765
02:27:23,008 --> 02:27:23,520
This position

2766
02:27:25,056 --> 02:27:25,568
Because of their

2767
02:27:28,128 --> 02:27:29,920
Yeah protect yourself there a little bit

2768
02:27:30,432 --> 02:27:32,480
Kind of Bud and then oftentimes it's

2769
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:37,600
Hahaha

2770
02:27:37,856 --> 02:27:38,624
Vigo dolls

2771
02:27:44,512 --> 02:27:45,280
Videos

2772
02:27:48,608 --> 02:27:49,376
What are the guys in it

2773
02:27:49,632 --> 02:27:50,400
Seemed to have a really good

2774
02:27:50,656 --> 02:27:51,168
Comedic sense

2775
02:27:51,424 --> 02:27:52,448
Ability

2776
02:27:52,704 --> 02:27:53,472
I enjoy this

2777
02:27:53,984 --> 02:27:56,288
I accidentally started

2778
02:27:56,800 --> 02:28:00,384
Videos no

2779
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:01,152
I ended up down

2780
02:28:01,408 --> 02:28:03,200
Cole of following him

2781
02:28:03,456 --> 02:28:05,504
By the way it's Andrew

2782
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:06,784
Gru from the

2783
02:28:07,296 --> 02:28:08,064
Steven Andrews

2784
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:08,832
Two guys on

2785
02:28:09,088 --> 02:28:11,904
No idea fine I don't know you

2786
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:13,440
Too excitable.

2787
02:28:13,696 --> 02:28:15,232
You just described me

2788
02:28:15,488 --> 02:28:20,352
You don't have the frosted tips

2789
02:28:20,608 --> 02:28:22,656
Frosted tips

2790
02:28:22,912 --> 02:28:27,264
So I started

2791
02:28:27,520 --> 02:28:28,544
I watched other

2792
02:28:30,592 --> 02:28:31,104
Finding myself

2793
02:28:32,896 --> 02:28:33,408
3 minutes

2794
02:28:33,664 --> 02:28:34,432
Videos about

2795
02:28:35,968 --> 02:28:36,736
And I I don't

2796
02:28:36,992 --> 02:28:37,760
I didn't join

2797
02:28:39,552 --> 02:28:40,320
But I kept watching

2798
02:28:41,088 --> 02:28:43,136
And I didn't realize what was going on

2799
02:28:43,392 --> 02:28:44,416
It sold the other night

2800
02:28:44,928 --> 02:28:45,952
I was sitting there like

2801
02:28:46,208 --> 02:28:47,488
I'm to watch one more

2802
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:48,512
And then it was

2803
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:50,048
So disappointed

2804
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:51,072
As I watched

2805
02:28:51,584 --> 02:28:52,352
Because there's like

2806
02:28:54,144 --> 02:28:54,656
Just

2807
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:57,472
People doing something boring

2808
02:28:58,496 --> 02:28:59,008
Commenting

2809
02:29:00,288 --> 02:29:01,568
But I want I want

2810
02:29:01,824 --> 02:29:02,336
More

2811
02:29:02,592 --> 02:29:04,640
Sonic

2812
02:29:04,896 --> 02:29:05,408
Next

2813
02:29:06,432 --> 02:29:07,200
And I click the next one

2814
02:29:07,968 --> 02:29:08,992
And then an hour later

2815
02:29:09,504 --> 02:29:10,272
You just repeated that promise

2816
02:29:10,528 --> 02:29:11,296
Over and over

2817
02:29:12,320 --> 02:29:13,856
And I realized along the way

2818
02:29:14,368 --> 02:29:15,904
All of these videos that I've been watching

2819
02:29:16,160 --> 02:29:18,976
Over 7 million views each

2820
02:29:20,256 --> 02:29:21,536
There are tons of people

2821
02:29:21,792 --> 02:29:23,072
I think much like me

2822
02:29:23,328 --> 02:29:23,840
Hookah tender

2823
02:29:24,096 --> 02:29:24,608
The end

2824
02:29:25,120 --> 02:29:27,168
Caught in the cycle without realizing it

2825
02:29:27,424 --> 02:29:27,936
Of like

2826
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:30,496
Slightly Charming

2827
02:29:31,008 --> 02:29:32,800
I want better

2828
02:29:33,568 --> 02:29:36,128
You guys can do better and then the none of them

2829
02:29:36,384 --> 02:29:38,432
You can do better I think

2830
02:29:40,480 --> 02:29:41,760
I don't know what that mean

2831
02:29:51,488 --> 02:29:55,840
I totally feel like I think a lot of

2832
02:29:56,864 --> 02:29:58,144
Are craving Escapist

2833
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:00,448
Videos of like

2834
02:30:00,704 --> 02:30:03,264
I don't f****** know that's watch these people leave dumplings

2835
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:04,544
It somehow

2836
02:30:05,056 --> 02:30:05,568
Like a good jump

2837
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:07,616
And then you're never satisfied

2838
02:30:08,128 --> 02:30:08,640
Are you looking

2839
02:30:08,896 --> 02:30:11,200
Little bit more

2840
02:30:11,456 --> 02:30:12,224
It Never Comes

2841
02:30:12,480 --> 02:30:15,296
2 hours later and you've watched a ton of their ship

2842
02:30:15,552 --> 02:30:16,576
And I think the people mop

2843
02:30:16,832 --> 02:30:18,112
Is that really well

2844
02:30:19,136 --> 02:30:20,416
Yeah I don't know if that's

2845
02:30:20,672 --> 02:30:22,208
Intentionally a business model

2846
02:30:22,464 --> 02:30:27,584
I think it's f****** stupid

2847
02:30:27,840 --> 02:30:30,912
Addicted

2848
02:30:31,168 --> 02:30:32,960
Candy Crush

2849
02:30:33,216 --> 02:30:34,496
Are the game of vacation of

2850
02:30:35,008 --> 02:30:35,776
Addiction

2851
02:30:39,104 --> 02:30:43,456
Small bit of

2852
02:30:44,992 --> 02:30:47,296
Well I'd now that I've reset base level

2853
02:30:47,552 --> 02:30:49,088
Keep going for that bass level

2854
02:30:49,344 --> 02:30:51,904
And no matter how far you're always chasing the

2855
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:54,208
I'll tell you the Irish people trying stuff

2856
02:30:55,744 --> 02:30:58,048
Because at least I actually like

2857
02:30:58,304 --> 02:30:58,816
A couple of their fur

2858
02:31:00,096 --> 02:31:00,864
Like I watch

2859
02:31:01,376 --> 02:31:03,936
Damn High Point from the radicals that I've

2860
02:31:04,448 --> 02:31:05,472
That lead dope down

2861
02:31:05,728 --> 02:31:06,240
Haha

2862
02:31:07,008 --> 02:31:07,520
I've watched

2863
02:31:10,336 --> 02:31:12,384
Too many watched

2864
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:18,784
0 of those BuzzFeed videos but I still think that's too many

2865
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:22,368
I've watched too many of those videos just

2866
02:31:22,624 --> 02:31:24,160
Only like

2867
02:31:24,416 --> 02:31:24,928
Baby

2868
02:31:25,440 --> 02:31:25,952
2 or 3

2869
02:31:26,464 --> 02:31:26,976
People

2870
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:30,048
Of The Buzz

2871
02:31:30,816 --> 02:31:31,328
Empire

2872
02:31:31,584 --> 02:31:32,608
Which is why I drink

2873
02:31:33,376 --> 02:31:34,144
Little red all over

2874
02:31:35,168 --> 02:31:35,936
A personality

2875
02:31:36,448 --> 02:31:37,984
As depicted in their V

2876
02:31:38,496 --> 02:31:39,776
Meanwhile

2877
02:31:40,032 --> 02:31:41,056
Were the Irish people

2878
02:31:42,336 --> 02:31:42,848
I would say it

2879
02:31:46,432 --> 02:31:47,200
Pretty cool

2880
02:31:47,968 --> 02:31:48,992
Have you ever been to Ireland

2881
02:31:49,248 --> 02:31:54,368
I want to go so bad.

2882
02:31:54,624 --> 02:32:00,768
Ireland is one of the most fascinating groups of people who hate everyone

2883
02:32:01,024 --> 02:32:01,792
One you will ever be

2884
02:32:02,304 --> 02:32:03,584
Let's do a show credit

2885
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:05,120
Let's go to Ireland

2886
02:32:06,144 --> 02:32:06,656
People love

2887
02:32:08,192 --> 02:32:13,824
Uncomfortable conversation never been made more uncomfortable by saying hi than in an Irish bar

2888
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:15,104
And that person

2889
02:32:15,616 --> 02:32:16,128
Love me

2890
02:32:17,152 --> 02:32:18,944
The other Irish bars I've been to

2891
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:21,248
I felt more comfortable

2892
02:32:21,504 --> 02:32:22,272
Super Bowl then when the person

2893
02:32:22,528 --> 02:32:23,040
Images like

2894
02:32:24,320 --> 02:32:28,160
And that was it that was and I was like I love you too I don't I didn't know how to

2895
02:32:28,928 --> 02:32:30,720
I'm not positive

2896
02:32:31,744 --> 02:32:32,256
But

2897
02:32:38,912 --> 02:32:40,960
I do it I do respect that like wipeout

2898
02:32:41,472 --> 02:32:47,104
I don't want to say that for it is of hooking

2899
02:32:47,616 --> 02:32:49,920
That's not okay

2900
02:32:50,176 --> 02:32:53,760
In this next court Alex

2901
02:32:54,016 --> 02:32:56,064
A bunch about whether or not he

2902
02:32:56,320 --> 02:32:56,832
She wants there too

2903
02:32:58,368 --> 02:32:59,648
And I'll let you decide

2904
02:32:59,904 --> 02:33:00,416
Where he come

2905
02:33:02,208 --> 02:33:03,488
I'm saying is

2906
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:17,056
It's not martial law if the president calls out the military to protect the White House

2907
02:33:17,312 --> 02:33:22,432
It's a military protecting us from Global's funded enemies

2908
02:33:22,688 --> 02:33:25,760
Better

2909
02:33:26,016 --> 02:33:27,552
Of what we're going to do

2910
02:33:27,808 --> 02:33:28,832
Polish

2911
02:33:45,728 --> 02:33:46,240
But

2912
02:33:57,248 --> 02:33:58,016
You understand

2913
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:14,144
Could I'm not backing down to interview people

2914
02:34:14,656 --> 02:34:15,680
Let me do nothing

2915
02:34:16,448 --> 02:34:20,032
Not that was so

2916
02:34:22,336 --> 02:34:23,104
That was crazy

2917
02:34:23,360 --> 02:34:24,128
Hey Alex

2918
02:34:26,688 --> 02:34:27,200
Isis

2919
02:34:27,456 --> 02:34:27,968
Is Jordan from

2920
02:34:28,224 --> 02:34:28,992
Chicago

2921
02:34:30,016 --> 02:34:31,552
Hello.

2922
02:34:35,136 --> 02:34:35,648
Speak

2923
02:34:36,928 --> 02:34:37,696
So you just said

2924
02:34:43,072 --> 02:34:43,584
Use Force

2925
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:45,888
Oh man the cop should

2926
02:34:46,144 --> 02:34:46,912
Fun

2927
02:34:47,168 --> 02:34:47,936
If a cop

2928
02:34:48,704 --> 02:34:51,520
You know if I were to use Force against you

2929
02:34:52,288 --> 02:34:53,056
Then the cop would be

2930
02:34:53,312 --> 02:34:53,824
Be justified

2931
02:34:54,336 --> 02:34:55,360
But what if I

2932
02:34:56,128 --> 02:35:00,480
What if there was a standardized response

2933
02:35:00,736 --> 02:35:02,528
Swearinger

2934
02:35:02,784 --> 02:35:03,296
Kid

2935
02:35:04,320 --> 02:35:05,856
And you're walking away from a cop

2936
02:35:06,624 --> 02:35:07,904
How many f****** murders

2937
02:35:08,416 --> 02:35:08,928
Is that

2938
02:35:09,952 --> 02:35:10,720
Is that okay

2939
02:35:11,232 --> 02:35:12,000
Set okay

2940
02:35:12,256 --> 02:35:12,768
Alex

2941
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:14,816
Should there be standardized rules

2942
02:35:15,328 --> 02:35:19,168
You know you know what I'm starting to think that maybe it only

2943
02:35:19,424 --> 02:35:21,472
F****** matters whenever it's on your

2944
02:35:23,008 --> 02:35:23,520
You know it's super

2945
02:35:23,776 --> 02:35:24,544
Thought about this like

2946
02:35:26,592 --> 02:35:27,360
Experienced

2947
02:35:27,616 --> 02:35:28,384
Bending over

2948
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:29,664
So far back

2949
02:35:30,432 --> 02:35:30,944
In order to

2950
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:32,224
To justify

2951
02:35:32,480 --> 02:35:33,504
Cavanaugh's

2952
02:35:34,272 --> 02:35:34,784
Discretion

2953
02:35:36,832 --> 02:35:38,112
Everett

2954
02:35:38,368 --> 02:35:40,672
Tapestry of b*******

2955
02:35:40,928 --> 02:35:41,440
Stupid article

2956
02:35:42,464 --> 02:35:42,976
Just

2957
02:35:43,232 --> 02:35:43,744
2

2958
02:35:44,512 --> 02:35:45,792
Get away from

2959
02:35:46,816 --> 02:35:48,096
This guy knock

2960
02:35:48,352 --> 02:35:48,864
Getting on this

2961
02:35:49,376 --> 02:35:52,192
Court like we've already been

2962
02:35:52,448 --> 02:35:53,984
Someone else could probably get into

2963
02:35:58,336 --> 02:35:59,360
Neil Gorsuch

2964
02:36:00,896 --> 02:36:03,456
It's not some sort of thing like they're going to

2965
02:36:03,968 --> 02:36:06,272
Create demonic smears of anybody

2966
02:36:06,528 --> 02:36:07,040
No

2967
02:36:07,296 --> 02:36:09,344
It's really crazy to have a situation like

2968
02:36:09,856 --> 02:36:10,624
For such a loose

2969
02:36:10,880 --> 02:36:11,392
Expulsion

2970
02:36:11,648 --> 02:36:12,160
Alex's

2971
02:36:12,416 --> 02:36:12,928
Defending this

2972
02:36:15,488 --> 02:36:16,512
There's a piece of self

2973
02:36:19,072 --> 02:36:20,352
When you see things

2974
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:21,888
Laquan McDonald

2975
02:36:22,144 --> 02:36:22,656
Or

2976
02:36:22,912 --> 02:36:23,424
Other

2977
02:36:24,192 --> 02:36:25,216
Is of unarmed

2978
02:36:27,520 --> 02:36:28,032
Murder

2979
02:36:29,056 --> 02:36:29,568
He doesn't

2980
02:36:30,080 --> 02:36:30,592
He doesn't

2981
02:36:30,848 --> 02:36:31,360
Create

2982
02:36:31,872 --> 02:36:32,384
Fabricated Naruto

2983
02:36:33,152 --> 02:36:33,664
He doesn't even talk

2984
02:36:34,176 --> 02:36:35,456
You just never covers

2985
02:36:38,272 --> 02:36:38,784
F*** off

2986
02:36:40,320 --> 02:36:40,832
F*** you

2987
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:49,024
This is this is weird

2988
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:52,864
Laquan McDonald nightmare. This is a punchline

2989
02:36:54,656 --> 02:36:58,240
Listening now

2990
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:02,080
Record

2991
02:37:02,336 --> 02:37:04,640
But in a world leaders top box

2992
02:37:04,896 --> 02:37:06,176
Top Fox News hosts

2993
02:37:06,688 --> 02:37:09,248
Congress

2994
02:37:10,016 --> 02:37:12,320
But this is like Fight Club

2995
02:37:12,576 --> 02:37:16,928
You can shut him down for a reason it's the gas

2996
02:37:17,184 --> 02:37:22,816
It's why the system wants infowars.com shut down

2997
02:37:23,328 --> 02:37:25,888
What scares them so much

2998
02:37:26,400 --> 02:37:32,544
The truth on 60 Minutes

2999
02:37:40,736 --> 02:37:43,040
Willington

3000
02:37:43,552 --> 02:37:47,648
You might have missed it in there but Alex just broke the first and second rule of

3001
02:37:49,184 --> 02:37:50,464
What's that

3002
02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:52,768
You talk about

3003
02:37:54,304 --> 02:37:57,632
Did the shows basically Fight Club

3004
02:37:59,424 --> 02:37:59,936
What

3005
02:38:00,448 --> 02:38:04,288
Almost like even in his fictional argument

3006
02:38:04,544 --> 02:38:09,408
The sentence he makes an argument he invalidates that argument mean

3007
02:38:09,664 --> 02:38:11,712
To bring up the

3008
02:38:11,968 --> 02:38:14,016
Jordan

3009

Jordan what's the latest episode if we can

02:38:26,048 --> 02:38:28,864
Whatever women aren't allowed to speak

3011
02:38:33,984 --> 02:38:37,312
Episode

3012
02:38:37,568 --> 02:38:38,336
Demonstrate

3013
02:38:38,848 --> 02:38:40,384
Simultaneously

3014
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:41,152
Present

3015
02:38:41,408 --> 02:38:42,688
Answer same time why we

3016
02:38:42,944 --> 02:38:43,968
Kinda gotta talk about the

3017
02:38:47,040 --> 02:38:48,064
You're not going to get this

3018
02:38:48,320 --> 02:38:49,600
It's B Razors Edge

3019
02:38:49,856 --> 02:38:50,880
That we end up walking

3020
02:38:51,904 --> 02:38:52,928
It's awful

3021
02:38:53,184 --> 02:38:55,488
To sit here and listen to Alex Jones Davis

3022
02:38:55,744 --> 02:38:56,256
Disrespect

3023
02:38:56,768 --> 02:38:57,792
Falafel stop

3024
02:38:58,048 --> 02:38:59,072
About someone who

3025
02:38:59,328 --> 02:38:59,840
You

3026
02:39:00,096 --> 02:39:00,864
Can hear her speak

3027
02:39:01,888 --> 02:39:04,192
Look at the reality of the situation

3028
02:39:04,704 --> 02:39:05,984
Oh yeah

3029
02:39:09,056 --> 02:39:10,592
Court week

3030
02:39:11,616 --> 02:39:12,128
Very

3031
02:39:12,384 --> 02:39:13,152
Clearly is credit

3032
02:39:13,408 --> 02:39:14,176
Like I don't

3033
02:39:14,944 --> 02:39:15,968
I'm not I wasn't there

3034
02:39:16,224 --> 02:39:16,992
I can't say it happened

3035
02:39:17,248 --> 02:39:20,320
But there is no part of my body or my being

3036
02:39:20,576 --> 02:39:21,088
That thinks

3037
02:39:22,112 --> 02:39:22,624
Right

3038
02:39:23,136 --> 02:39:24,160
It sucks

3039
02:39:24,416 --> 02:39:26,464
To hear Alex create this elaborate

3040
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:28,512
About

3041
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:29,792
Situation

3042
02:39:30,304 --> 02:39:35,168
But it is going to talk about the idea.

3043
02:39:35,424 --> 02:39:41,568
Vicky has created right yeah that's how I know

3044
02:39:41,824 --> 02:39:42,848
Crazy defense

3045
02:39:43,360 --> 02:39:44,640
I don't think Trump would even try

3046
02:39:45,408 --> 02:39:51,552
We'll see in the day we've already talked about how parody is not

3047
02:39:51,808 --> 02:39:52,576
Existence

3048
02:39:55,136 --> 02:39:56,160
Pastor like

3049
02:39:56,416 --> 02:39:57,184
Call for the bench

3050
02:39:57,696 --> 02:39:58,208
But like

3051
02:39:58,464 --> 02:39:59,744
This this

3052
02:40:02,048 --> 02:40:02,560
I don't see

3053
02:40:04,352 --> 02:40:05,120
This level

3054
02:40:05,376 --> 02:40:05,888
Complete

3055
02:40:06,400 --> 02:40:07,168
Bucked up

3056
02:40:07,680 --> 02:40:08,448
High strangeness

3057
02:40:08,704 --> 02:40:09,728
80s

3058
02:40:09,984 --> 02:40:10,496

02:40:12,288 --> 02:40:14,592
Arch I will say at the end

3061
02:40:15,616 --> 02:40:16,128
Respect

3062
02:40:17,408 --> 02:40:18,432
Of having to go into the

3063
02:40:18,944 --> 02:40:19,456
As much as it is

3064
02:40:20,480 --> 02:40:21,248
Payroll check in

3065
02:40:23,808 --> 02:40:24,320

3067
02:40:27,136 --> 02:40:29,696
Anything from this except for

3068
02:40:29,952 --> 02:40:30,976
About the law

3069
02:40:31,488 --> 02:40:32,000
You know

02:40:33,792 --> 02:40:37,888
80's phone on some level I like learning about that to Bill Cuban kiptyn

3071
02:40:40,960 --> 02:40:42,240
It's family I don't know

3072
02:40:42,496 --> 02:40:43,008
Not yet

3073
02:40:43,264 --> 02:40:44,800
So what

3074
02:40:45,056 --> 02:40:49,408
Tell me some s*** about Laura

3075
02:40:49,664 --> 02:40:51,712
It actually doesn't want to work at Burning Man

3076
02:40:52,736 --> 02:40:55,040
She created

3077
02:40:55,552 --> 02:41:01,696
I know I know my love I know

3078
02:41:04,512 --> 02:41:06,816
A lot of it is about the like

3079
02:41:07,328 --> 02:41:10,144
Symbolic destruction of it

3080
02:41:14,496 --> 02:41:17,056
Violent

3081
02:41:17,312 --> 02:41:18,336
Destruction of her own artwork

3082
02:41:18,592 --> 02:41:19,104
Like shooting it

3083
02:41:22,176 --> 02:41:22,688
A ritual

3084
02:41:22,944 --> 02:41:25,760
Yeah

3085
02:41:29,088 --> 02:41:30,368
It was a parody of money

3086
02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:40,608
No s*** it's hard to take that away from me

3087
02:41:41,376 --> 02:41:41,888
Begrudge

3088
02:41:42,144 --> 02:41:42,656
Having

3089
02:41:43,680 --> 02:41:45,216
You should give away a bunch

3090
02:41:45,472 --> 02:41:45,984
Which

3091
02:41:46,240 --> 02:41:46,752

3092
02:41:47,008 --> 02:41:53,152

3095
02:42:04,672 --> 02:42:07,232

3096
02:42:14,144 --> 02:42:15,936
