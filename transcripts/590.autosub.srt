00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:33,536

00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936

Text Joe

7
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,400
For you

8
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:15,520
My bright spot today Jordan is wrong

9
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,896
This is our after Sesame Street

10
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,664
Episode

11
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,736
Okay there's something in life

12
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,904
Sometimes things are going to worry about it then it's not really that big a deal

13
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,280
You start doing stand-up one of the best things that can happen is your first bomb

14
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:43,680
And you're really really worried about it then you do how do you do it how do they live like this you go through it

15
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:47,008
Experience how horrible it can be to be on stage in be like

16
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,664
They hate me nothing is happening here only hating me person then you go to bed

17
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,200
Wake up the next day and you're fine

18
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:55,968
You know like it

19
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:01,600
I have a reminder that experience

20
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,672
Are you think

21
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,232
The people who caught this because it

22
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:11,840
Cripplingly embarrassing

23
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,888
What our last episode Alex was

24
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,936
Talking about North Vietnam

25
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,984
And I swear I could

26
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,520
I heard him say North Korea

27
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,848
And I responded as if he had 90

28
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:28,224
Oh my God that was embarrassing a I went along with you so eggs on my face as well

29
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,784
Q&A bad helper

30
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,832
I'm here for support

31
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:39,232
He's not getting in the way I've tried to like analyzer

32
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000
Next happened

33
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:40,768
Dolittle

34
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,816
Trincity North Korea

35
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,656
I think I've been listening

36
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,960
2003 South Andes

37
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,544
Singularly preoccupied with war with North Korea

38
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,312
I think I was

39
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,128
Is this North

40
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,688
Going to be North Korea

41
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,480
It's pretty remarkable to me

42
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,760
Experience

43
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,784
Realizing

44
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,832
Oh my God

45
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,648
I couldn't hear him say the right word

46
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,696
Yeah I know it's weird

47
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,488
It's okay

48
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,024
Nothing

49
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,816
Nobody's nobody's hurt

50
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,120
Everybody's everybody's doing just fine

51
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:23,520
The folks who emailed me about another bright spot

52
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,664
Everybody was like

53
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,224
Hey I'm sure this was a normal accident that

54
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:32,992
We all make me

55
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:38,368
Mistakes all the time Turtle transparency I'm bringing this up now because I cut it out of the past

56
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,928
Episode of the last episode reposted

57
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,720
Because I kind of felt like

58
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,304
I know how this goes like I'll still get emails about

59
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,096
Chumbawamba

60
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,680
I don't I don't want to correct they thought they were

61
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,008
I guess we got there the next episode

62
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:59,616
Yeah I know and I just don't want to have more lightning rods for that so

63
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:04,224
I just called myself episode

64
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,248
I said what's your B.

65
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,064
My brights Montana's I got my new tattoo

66
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,856
It's really really great

67
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,136
I was this

68
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,440
So I'm probably

69
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,000
15 to 20 somewhere in that range

70
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,071
Whataburgers like eight or nine different artists

71
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,375
This was the first guy where I was like

72
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,447
Oh this is not a guy who does

73
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,263
Just tattoos is not a tattoo guys are they

74
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,031
He's at like

75
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,823
Sponsored by people in

76
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
The guy

77
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,919
And as he was doing the tattoo you don't have sometimes you're like

78
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,223
What's that but there's not that much of a

79
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,295
Difference between yeah that kind of

80
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:45,951
This is a 95 mile an hour fastball I get to 80 mph where you're like okay there's a whole different world

81
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,231
I got it

82
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,023
Minecraft yeah yeah yeah

83
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,559
Is my guy now here

84
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,631
Amazing

85
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,959
I'm still still great I love all my other tattoos to break out

86
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:02,079
I love all my other tattoos to their fantastic but this guy was

87
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,639
The alternative would have been

88
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
You're not happy with it

89
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
That's implied that

90
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:11,295
This is the act of the follow-up

91
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:15,391
Because what I did was mirroring the other side seems it was

92
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,951
It's fairly simple to just go okay well he wants

93
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
Something like that bird on the wrist

94
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,279
Bird on the other side of the wrist

95
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,351
And then but the way that he just handled

96
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,167
The coloring in the shading in the way that he put all that

97
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:31,007
Just so good I'm excited to see plastic comes up

98
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,335
Today we are going to be talking a little bit about

99
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,663
The present-day of Alex Jones Show

100
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431

101
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,807

00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,879
How old are you

103
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,671
Quiet

104
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,231
Quite the Machinery whatever the answer is

105
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:54,303
This is this is this week

106
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,375
I wanted to check in and see how things were going.

107
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,423
Tuesday Alex's

108
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,983
Coming off of a very disappointing

109
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
Trump rally

110
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,567
Yep where you said the people to give axe

111
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,383
Happy about that

112
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
Hayden Lake Jackson

113
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,759
Simultaneously Owen Shroyer is turned himself into the

114
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:14,783
The feds

115
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,319
I don't know

116
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:21,439
I do like I do like the idea of trump being like in this headspace of like

117
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:28,351
What are all these idiots mad at me I just told them to get the vaccine like clearly having no idea that this is entirely

118
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,935
He's like what are you guys

119
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,495
Can't believe it

120
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,775
So

121
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:39,103
I mean you encourage an audience

122
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
In certain direction and then you

123
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,479
Directly contradict what they believe you to believe

124
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:48,063
And then sometimes they're going to be

125
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,647
We're going to get to business on the 24th but before we do Jordan let's

126
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,927

The sort of subtitle

132
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
All of their name

But most people abbreviated

144
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,135
The chaos but I'm not going to judge

145
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,719
I wasn't the KN in bed and now I can't fall asleep without dance

146
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,511
Some Jordans

Ocean waves occasionally

151

Not penguin old

166
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:14,751
For some reason whenever I see that word I want to add like two syllables in the middle of it

167
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,871
I keep finding myself

168

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
Wife

189
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,815
Eliza

190
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:11,839
I supported

191
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,143
Take over his life studio audience a couple times

192
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,703
If I was blown up

193
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,287
When you get things right

194
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,335
Don't block Ivermectin

195
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,895
Internet down

196
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,223
I really be curious

197
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,807
To know if when Politically Incorrect I cancelled Alex

198
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,343
Was speaking out on behalf

199
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,415
Abbeville mall that you should Wonder

200
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,463
I don't know

201
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:44,351
Increase might not have been on the air

202
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
Yeah

203
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:49,727
I don't know I'd be curious about that but I don't have any of those those episodes

204
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,775
Maybe he wouldn't have even mentioned it

205
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:58,431
So this is one of these instances here this clip where Alex begins of thought that he ramble so much that the second half of the 8th

206
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,455
Then statement.

207
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,991
Totally lost

208
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:06,111
He doesn't like Bill Maher but when he says things that Alex perceives is true

209
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,647
Alex's got to support it

210
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,719
I fully agree with that under normal

211
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
Circumstances

212
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,255
Princeton's

213
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:16,607
I think Alex is a lazy dumb fraudulent buffoon and I hate his worldview with a passion

214
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,631
But

215
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,935
I do agree with him about civil asset forfeiture

216
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,495
We may arrive at our positions differently

217
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,567
And we may never actually be able to work together toward

218
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,127
Opposition to this thing that we

219
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,407
We share opposition towards

220
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,479
I can understand that even the person I think is the worst

221
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,039
Can be in alignment with my beliefs on occasion

222
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,087
It's possible that a fundamental level

223
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,367
The government shouldn't

224
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,927
Steal from you seems very obvious

225
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,487
That's not what's up with Alex and Bill Maher

226
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:48,607
I don't believe the Bill Maher is one of the main mouthpieces of the globalist conspiracy on the media

227
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,911
Alex constantly claims that quote

228
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,935
The last door

229
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,959
The globalist

230
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,751
Have made some announcement of their

231
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,591
Plant and the only thing he has to back it up is a clip from Bill Maher's show

232
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,943
The entire narrative that the left wanted to crash the economy in order to punish drop

233
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,247
I just got a bad joke

234
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,271
The bilmar made

235
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,319
And I guess maybe a bad dream that Alex had

236
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,951
The explanation for why Bill Maher is now saying things that I look

237
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:18,815
Disagrees with is not a simple matter of someone you don't like has the same perspective as you do on a point

238
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,399
If anything Alex says means anything said bilmars on the global

239
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,215
The payroll would never be allowed to say the sort of thing

240
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:30,591
That Alex is now applauding him for saying if he was saying those things

241
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,151
He is a shield for the global as soon as can

242
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,967
Controlled opposition there's simply no way to trust him

243
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,759
Because he's working for the global

244
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
Perhaps

245
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,111
The issue isn't as easy to dismiss as just saying like I got to give it up

246
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,951
Bill Maher has larger contradiction and Alex's ignoring in that is

247
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,999
The bilmar works for the devil

248
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:55,679
Devil remember all those times whenever people would like

249
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,751
I know gurbuz does a lot of that

250
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:03,871
He's really said nice things about me so I got to give it up

251
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
Sehitlerimiz

252
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:09,503
Who's Alex says like he's the official mouthpiece of the globalist

253
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,063
What is trying to say is I don't like

254
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:16,927
I suspect that Alex knows that he showed look really pathetic if you replaced all the ink

255
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,719
Intrigued and supposedly documented

256
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,487
Conspiracies

257
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:23,071
But just him whining about how he doesn't like people at certain ideas

258
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,351
That's pretty much what's underneath

259
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,399
Need the entire show it's pretty remarkable

260
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,959
Examples

261
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
The people being mean to

262
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,799
Now I will tell you why I don't like them

263
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:38,943
There's a document in the white papers that I think this guy's pretty

264
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:46,367
Cool guy

265
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:50,719
Is this clip from Bill Maher show that is like pretty encouraging

266
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
F*** are we doing

267
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,095
Now they want us to do all boost

268
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,375
The boosters Wichita

269
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
Xander

270
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,191
I mean I don't want a booster item

271
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,983
I never wanted the vaccine

272
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
15

273
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,567
By the way

274
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,359
You know doesn't get a lot of vaccines

275
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,407
Millennials millennials

276
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,199
20/20

277
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,271
I don't want it they wanted they don't think they need it they're probably right

278
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,319
I told him I didn't want it either

279
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
Took 14

280
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:24,255
But a boost every eight months you're going to put that s*** in me I don't know about

281
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,791
Maybe I don't need one

282
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,839
I don't want a one-size-fits-all

283
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,399
My body may be different in your butt

284
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:35,007
Nothing screams hip like a 65 year old dude who knows a lot of millennials

285
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
Oh my God

286
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,591
Chesterfield billion on I-20 roads are millennials

287
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,175
We're old now

288
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,623
Also there's no reason to just conclude the booster shots

289
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,671
For covid-19 48-month

290
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:56,767
A lot of times people are recommended to get booster shots are vaccines on a two

291
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,791
Particular schedule like

292
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,839
Like every 10 years

293
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:05,471
What's going on here is the bilmar is falling into the same trap that the right-wing media is exploiting where they take the

294
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,495
Cdc's announcement

295
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,775
The people who are 8 months

296
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,823
Their point of full vaccinations

297
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,847
Could be eligible to

298
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,871
To get a booster shot

299
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,455
Mmm reporting that is if it means the people are going to need booster shots already

300
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
Slots forever

301
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,503
That's a lazy conclusion

302
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,039
To come too and I understand life

303
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,599
Hypertonic conversation that plays on Bill Maher show

304
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,159
His whole brand is like trying to be edgy

305
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,439
Sort of funny and

306
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,487
Gently iconoclastic so

307
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,535
This is exactly how he would have that talk

308
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,071
Just not a serious point

309
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,935
Department Health and Human Services put out a press release discussing the option of getting a booster

310
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,215
Rashad and it's exactly that

311
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
An option

312
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,543
It'll offer greater protection but there's no indication

313
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,847
Mission for the text to anyone's going to be required to take a

314
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,639
Some people

315
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,943
Like dr. Celine gounder of the

316
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,479
NYU medical school

317
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,015
They're little bit wary of the booster

318
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,063
To plan but not for the same reasons as Alec

319
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,855
And some dump dump

320
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,623
Bucktail bar

321
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,183
Calgary plane to NPR

322
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,719
Vaccines need to be thought of

323
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,767
Population-level interventions

324
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,815
Also from the article

325
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,631
She argues that getting a higher percentage of people that

326
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,655
Animated wheel protector

327
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
The community board

328
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,983
The giving already vaccinated people Edition

329
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,263
Because it provides

330
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
Community immunity

331
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,335
Which reduces the amount of Ira

332
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:20,735
I think she's clearly forgotten that we don't give a s*** about community and I only care about myself give me

333
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,527
Protection and no one else

334
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:28,159
Another voice criticizing the plan is Doctor Mike Ryan the head of the World Health organization's Health emergencies program

335
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:33,535
Writing makes me very solid point that there are tons of people in the developing world who are in need of vaccine

336
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
Enterprise

337
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,167
Planning to hand out extra life jacket

338
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,983
It's the people who already have life jackets and leaving other people

339
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:42,751
The brown

340
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,127
There's a lot of intertwined issues the touch on this planet have booster shot campaign to the United States but

341
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,919
All of the actual reality

342
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,455
Hastings have nothing to do with it

343
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,479
What these idiots

344
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,247
Alex

345
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,783
Bill Maher make their careers

346
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
Complaining about

347
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,111
There's there's real There's real discussion

348
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
To be had

349
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,671
It's not these

350
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,487
That's such a great analogy

351
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,535
That's such a great analogy because

352
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
Is it so f******

353
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,351
Airtight like I imagined somebody

354
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,655
Hearing that guy say it to their face

355
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
Isn't going like

356
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,263
Why we try me when you put it like that it does sound bad

357
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,335
Okay

358
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,199
Food with other than like

359
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
Yeah you're right

360
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
Buck

361
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,343
I think the best argument you could have to that it was sort of like

362
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,159
Staring at the person quizzically

363
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,535
Closed

364
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,303
The door

365
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:42,143
Little bit of yelling

366
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,167
He likes to

367
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
Animated for

368
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,079
Kids having

369
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,383
Underwear mask

370
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:56,735
No it's not no no I mean it's directly there.

371
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,039
So you're holding us hostage

372
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,135
You're the Reason

373
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,183
Two-year-old got to wear mask

374
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:10,303
People through you

375
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:34,111
We should count in law there's enough of a pause there that I bet somebody in a

376
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,391
Is your peace just went

377
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:39,487
Yeah exactly know if somebody's like

378
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,767
Alex if you would

379
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:46,399
Include that in the in a f****** trial and they're like wealthy he said it at the end

380
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,679
F*** you

381
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,727
You you know he didn't mean that f******

382
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,407
Sojourn

383
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,175
I have a question

384
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:01,759
This is time for knowledge fight Infowars quiz

385
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,343
So what's the plan

386
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,719
Okay

387
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,255
Everything you know about

388
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,303
The covid conspiracy that I

389
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,607
What is the

390
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,143
What does it lead to

391
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,959
What is the end goal of all this

392
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,727
For the global

393
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:26,079
I believe the globalist want to wipe out 90% of the population and then

394
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,871
Quipe utopic

395
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,407
State just for themselves

396
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,431
After the devil

397
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,711
What station is

398
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
Settled

399
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:38,879
I'm not even positive I'm going to do they want to get off-planet now

400
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:43,743
But I don't know how permanent that is forever

401
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,023
Solution

402
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
You got to get off

403
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,583
And they're working with

404
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
Extra dimension

405
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,143
No beings who I assume have promised them

406
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
Take it off

407
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
So

408
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,239
Yeah they're just trying to get rid of us

409
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775
That's so towards the end

410
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,079
The covid thing is

411
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,103
To kill off most of

412
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,127
The population right

413
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,687
No no the code thingy to get us

414
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,223
Take the vaccines

415
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:04,991
Taqueria La famosa

416
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,015
The population

417
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,551
Right good clarification

418
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:08,831
Apparently not

419
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,647
Apparently this is all just to cause a financial collapse

420
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,767
Government on TV

421
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,327
Only God cuz they're getting ready for a total

422
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,119
Financial collapse

423
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,167
We really should just talk about that because

424
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:28,031
Tomorrow ization is poison shots

425
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,615
News today

426
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,919
I don't even give that to you tomorrow

427
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,039
What's coming next to the total collapse because

428
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:42,111
Brazil time to mitigate how bad it's going to be but not much

429
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
What

430
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:46,207
Yeah man so it's apparently all about the summer of Rage

431
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:50,559
There's still time to mitigate

432
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,631
Bunker I don't know

433
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,423
This is just

434
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,447
This is nonsense

435
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:00,031
Yeah like this is secretly actually

436
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,055
About

437
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:06,943
Precipitating a Global Financial collapse of his head for a while

438
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:10,015
The vaccines and the killing off of

439
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,343
The population is a financial collapse

440
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:19,744
Misconception is that the financial collapse is supposed to cause civil unrest which allows for a Crackdown

441
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,560
To the extermination of the population

442
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
That's

443
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,632
You can't have

444
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:28,960
A leading to be but you also leads to a

445
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,776
Let me let me try and visualize this better for you

446
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,800
So

447
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,104
This is like a perpetual motion machine of

448
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,640
Conspiracy

449
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,944
Alright so he's got a pot

450
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,736
Apocalypse's every morning

451
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,016
Lined up

452
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,040
The starting line

453
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,576
Write like a horse race

454
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,648
And every morning whoever wins the horse race

455
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,464
Is the globalist final plan

456
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,744
If if it's like

457
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,144
Well we got the appointment everybody

458
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,984
And that's the day

459
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,520
You know and then the next morning

460
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,312
It's a new race

461
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:10,944
Did you ever see that web series Brody Stevens interview challenge

462
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:15,040
It was as if it was a web series where Brody Stevens

463
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:18,624
Pennswood interview

464
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,648
And

465
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,696
There was a mysterious man

466
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,512
Who was pulling the strings who would give Brody Steven

467
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,536
Challenges

468
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,096
But he had to accomplish during the interview

469
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,120
It's like

470
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:35,264
Brody Stevens so great was he couldn't let Pat and eat bread

471
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:43,456
And there's bread all around there's bread all around

472
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:47,296
Set up to make for warriors as

473
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,600
I like to imagine that maybe

474
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,648
Alex wakes up every morning

475
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,720
There is like the shadowman there

476
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:58,560
The apocalypse today

477
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,888
Cockatoo make

478
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,704
I like that show point that reference

479
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,520
To Brody is a good one

480
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,152
Alex plays this

481
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,432
Bill Maher clip

482
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,224
And that takes up a good part of the beginning of

483
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,504
Another clip

484
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,784
It's very important

485
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,552
We also get

486
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,088
Its 2 here in this sub is open

487
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,512
Info that the vaccine is safe

488
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,048
Activate needed and is

489
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,888
Matter

490
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,680
Courage Your

491
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:39,008
Coronavirus vaccine

492
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:46,432
No

493
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,968
Get the vaccine

494
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,016
I think that's a matter of choice

495
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,832
All individuals

496
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,112
That's why we live in

497
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,256
Don't trust vaccines

498
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:06,400
Hey lady when's the last time you visit your gynecologist

499
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,056
Keep your medical records

500
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:16,128
He's got his medical record number your body your choice

501
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,712
My body

502
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:26,112
That's really weird I'm going to go as a reject that

503
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:30,720
Cherry picking stuff from the CNN interview with Brett Favre

504
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:34,304
Instant Alex's conveniently cut out this little nugget

505
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
Get from the interview

506
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,144
And in this is from experts experts

507
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,912
From both sides

508
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,496
And

509
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,568
The vaccine or

510
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,664
Maxine

511
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,760
I've been has been administered it within the last

512
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:54,784
What's 6

513
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,368
Didn't go through

514
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,672
20 or 30 years human trial study

515
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,464
FDA

516
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,488
Requires

517
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,280
So

518
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,048
We're sort of

519
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,584
Trials if you will

520
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,864
Alex probably doesn't

521
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,936
Want to play a clip like that because it makes bread sound like what he is

522
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,008
Ex-football player who doesn't really know what he's talking about

523
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,824
Trying to Bluff his way through a fairly polite TV interview

524
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,104
Also

525
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,872
It's probably in Port

526
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:23,200
Brett Favre wasn't on CNN to talk about his vaccines

527
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,248
Suspicions that was just something that came up

528
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,856
He was on because he recently put out a PSA urging parents not to let their kids

529
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,136
Play tackle football

530
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,672
Because of concerns about CT

531
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,440
Teehee

532
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:37,280
In 2018 far-field Megyn Kelly that he probably had thousands

533
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,304
Concussions over the

534
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,328
Expand his career

535
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,888
This leaves me and really if you territory

536
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,960
On the one hand I applaud far for speaking out and trying to

537
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:48,544
Protect the Next Generation from suffering head trauma and potential brain damage

538
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:53,664
But on the other hand I think if he's doing it while he's also spouting b******* about covid vaccine

539
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,712
I worried that he might not be the best

540
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,504
Concussion awareness ambassador

541
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:04,416
Big picture I'm not really sure I care about what a former football player says about medical advice on AT&T

542
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,696
TV show that I don't watch

543
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,768
Apparently for Alex Jones the most serious chronicler

544
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,304
The collapse of Western Civilization

545
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,584
This is big news

546
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,888
I can't stress this enough

547
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,448
If you are someone

548
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
Who is played

549
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,496
Professional football

550
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,544
And has received the number of

551
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
Concussions that Brett Favre has

552
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,360
Which is astronomical

553
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:27,968
He said when I was when I watch football he was playing and yeah

554
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,272
I believe it

555
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,576
I believe that kind of number from him

556
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,136
He should talk about concussions

557
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:40,512
Do you know what somebody who has had thousands of concussions doesn't know about

558
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,280
Vaccines

559
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,560
That's just how it goes

560
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,584
I'm fine with that

561
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,144
Amount of

562
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,704
Feeling on my part that like

563
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,984
I don't know how much

564
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,776
That was what he planned to talk

565
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,056
So maybe that's

566
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,640
Just on a poorly structured interview

567
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,712
What he thinks about that at all not relevant

568
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,016
What you think about a post route

569
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:06,112
Concussion movie End Brett Favre

570
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,696
This is kind of embarrassing

571
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:15,328
It feels like the headlines on out to show her just kind of boiled down to improving Twitter for a few clips of things that are

572
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
Kind of in pop culture

573
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,168
Lenny just yells about them for a few hours

574
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,472
Like imagine the opposite version

575
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,128
How seriously would you take an ostensibly left-wing truth-teller who insisted they had all the details about the

576
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,920
Nefarious plans of the right-wing

577
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,736
Weirdly took most of their time on their show Court

578
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:37,856
Points made on like Greg Gutfeld show where people are trying to be funny

579
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,416
I am celebrating something like I don't know

580
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:46,304
Randall Cunningham or John Elway saying that vaccines are cool

581
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:52,704
If someone took their time like really thinking that these were important like these are headlines we need to really focus on

582
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,240
You look pretty f****** stupid

583
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,544
Yeah we're staring down the barrel of

584
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,104
Climate change extinction level event

585
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:03,968
First I got a s*** ton of guys on the morning Zoo crew

586
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,248
Look

587
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,552
90 am up my butt

588
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:12,672
Red Wings got some really in the Feria things but in good news

589
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:16,512
Dan Marino likes to recycle

590
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,048
What

591
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,864
Oh damn

592
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,168
Next clip Alex

593
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,960
Teases that he has a guest coming up

594
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,728
Exciting

595
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,776
Political prisoner

596
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,312
Owen Shroyer

597
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,408
Will be joining us

598
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,992
Coming up

599
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,576
Is he ignoring us 45 minutes of the

600
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,368
4th power

601
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:46,208
He was only in jail for about 45 hours in the federal jail

602
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,744
Yesterday

603
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,816
And the judge put some restrictions on him

604
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,632
Two people involved January 6th about the

605
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,400
Okay

606
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:58,752
How do you use a talk show host everything you did is on body cam

607
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,824
So what we did is he is giving his all right

608
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,616
This is not good

609
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,384
I'm a good idea

610
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,664
I think what are you should

611
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,200
All right now

612
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,480
And you're going to say no

613
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,272
Stick with me through the end

614
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,040
Okay then

615
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,320
Stinky does he comes out

616
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,880
Any places a million-dollar bounty on whoever

617
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,928
This is work

618
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,000
Yeah I think

619
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:24,352
This is such a testament to how minor the situation with

620
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,632
Petfinder

621
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,912
Go back on TV

622
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,448
No one cares

623
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:34,848
What a political prisoner gestapo State we live in where

624
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,384
He had to be processed

625
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,176
A couple of hours and then

626
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,712
He is free to

627
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:46,368
Go back to work on a propaganda you know it was really strange when I read about it that

628
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:52,000
Cuz we all know the story of Nelson Mandela

629
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:58,400
What was so strange is that he only had to go to jail for like 45 hours

630
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:02,752
Like most political prisoner

631
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:03,776
Yeah

632
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:11,968
It's fighting against the power but it's often forgotten that's what the Mandela effect actually refers to

633
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,016
Dude against the guy that's kept him

634
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:19,392
Under house arrest for two years because he fought against they're destroying a population

635
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,928
But you know what

636
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:24,256
He's still allowed to go on his goddamn radio show

637
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,816
Yeah but I hate

638
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:32,704
And I think one of the other things that really is important it is going to come up whenever Owens on

639
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,472
Michelle

640
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,240
Is that like

641
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
Whatever

642
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,544
The cases

643
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,336
He's being allowed to profit

644
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,616
His arrest

645
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,664
If you're Alex

646
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,712
You have to get like some

647
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,480
Bad news

00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,016
Your boy got popped

649
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,064
He's going to that he's going to the clink

650
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:51,392

Yeah anyways I was arrested

658
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,848
For January 6th

659
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,408
I am going to do almost

660
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,688
0 jail time

661
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:19,808
Bring me Lee Ann McAdoo

662
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:24,672
Replace you demented

663
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,720
Alex Jones

No I got to get this bad news is maybe going to be in

665
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,936
Convenience for a couple hours

666
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,752
Not going to make it

667
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,520
Your son's

668
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:43,616
Baseball games to make matters worse you have to see the last

669
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:46,176
Sono Bella braided on Twitter

670
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,224
Celestron very upset

671
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,040
Very very very upset

672
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,576
To learn

673
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
Owen

674
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,672
I was not

675
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:59,744
Taking away to DC to be put in solitary confinement there's

676
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:03,072
Literally it is named trending yesterday so did mine

677
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,376
In the top 10 of a Twitter

678
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,192
When the people wishing for his death

679
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:10,240
Evil wishing for his execution

680
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,336
I don't even hate these weird people on

681
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,664
Another word for excuses all the time

682
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,456
Sorry for because

683
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,016
They are such a Thor attarian

684
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,856
There

685
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:30,208
Like a mob wanting to exact revenge on those of us

686
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,792
I'm just simply trying to save the country is very sad

687
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,608
Wow could you get more protective

688
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,376
Then that

689
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,424
It's pretty fun

690
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,448
Wow

691
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,216
Wow

692
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:45,312
Again it's just it's just it's a remarkable thing of like I saw a random tweet

693
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:48,384
Maldives the doctor in position of the left

694
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,968
I know I know but to stand next to the

695
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,992
The people on the sick

696
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,808
When that happened

697
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:58,368
And then to turn and look at the left and say

698
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,648
They're just a mob

699
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,928
Wild

700
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,976
Wild s*** Wild

701
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,048
Do you know Alex Jones you know that he likes two things

702
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,072

00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,096
Talkin

704
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,376
2

705
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,680
Going off air

706
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,216
Powerful

707
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,544
John bowne reports they've been doing lately and

708
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,592
I enjoy talking on the show

709
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:23,200
What's the same time we get really really powerful reports and things in

710
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:30,880
And so we're going to play August report right now

714
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,424
So Alex

715
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,704
Covid news

716
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,336
Here's one from Forbes

717
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,640
Mustache

718
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,176
I done lost it

719
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,760
Pfizer shot just 39

720
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,296
Percent effective

721
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,904
Against, now all my gosh 39%

722
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:08,768
But you heard it work so well first of all I just love the way Alex answer

723
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,304
Surprised by articles

724
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,352
But he sees that headlight me like oh look

725
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,656
It's like you found something

726
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:18,752
I mean you know for somebody who does so much research

727
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:24,896
It's it's always nice to be surprised by the research you've found something under a rock

728
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,176
Excited

729
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,712
Second this isn't the new article

730
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:34,112
This is a month old piece that was going over some data from Israel where some indications were showing that the Pfizer vaccine was about 30

731
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,136
39% effective

732
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,160
By protecting people

733
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:36,928
From covid

734
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,208
Including the Delta Fair

735
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,512
But Alex is intentionally only telling half

736
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
Story

737
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:47,936
The same Forbes article also covers have these included a finding that the vaccine offered 92% protection against off

738
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,240
And 91% protection

739
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,264
Severe illness

740
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,568
Intentionally ignoring

741
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,592
The part of this article that

742
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,640
Discusses the other research that is

743
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,664
Conflicting numbers on

744
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,200
General efficacy

745
00:34:59,456 --> 00:34:59,968
Of the VAC

746
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,528
Do not adjust Alex's cherry-picking

747
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:06,880
The detail from a month old article and ignoring the rest of it in pretending that it's

748
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:13,280
Tomorrow's news today or a month ago news tomorrow yesterday

749
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:18,144
It's tough because what you want the headliner the article.

750
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,168
2B is the Sun

751
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:19,936
So you know like

752
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:26,592
90s summer percent chance that you won't get sick or die so you know what maybe the vaccine doesn't print

753
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:31,200
Protect against the virus forever perfectly but you know what you're not going to get sick and die so

754
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:33,504
Pretty good overall

755
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,552
And that's just too long for a headline

756
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,600
It's it'll be tough

757
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:42,464
Get that into like MLA grammar headline is what that

758
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,816
That is yeah so long for

759
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,608
Specifics talking about specific

760
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,168
Because there are the things that you're able to really

761
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,448
Assess more than his

762
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,008
Fauci should be hung

763
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:58,080
Whatever

764
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,104
Just drift into the

765
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,176
Can't believe those bloodthirsty people on the left a loop

766
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:05,248
Want violence to happen gross unbelievable

767
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,064
25 seconds

768
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,136
Specifically

769
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,256
Is it conspiracy theory that mothers

770
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,096
PetSmart not a selfie

771
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,144
Natural

772
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,680
Colostrum

773
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,776
Most births are cesarean

774
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,736
Asleep

775
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,504
How to make

776
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,272
Two statements

777
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,296
The Weeknd

778
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,856
Here we go most people give birth by C-section

779
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,136
And most people don't breath

780
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,256
According to data from 2019 C-section rates in the United States are approximately 31 per

781
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,304
Does a bit shy of the most people

782
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:54,400
A lot of folks I can find commenting on this Tuesday that the rate is too high

783
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:57,472
And it's very unlikely that all of these represent necessary

784
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,496
C-section

785
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,288
In many cases

786
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:05,920
They're absolutely necessary but apparently it's also an area where there could be intentional or unintentional

787
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,688
Applications

788
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,456
At the medical

789
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,480
Conservit

790
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:09,760
For one thing

791
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,576
Many hospitals have unlimited space for people in labor

792
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:16,160
And in the interest of making sure that they can cater to all their patient

793
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:18,976
It's possible that some doctors could do more C-sections

794
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,512
Gyms that are strictly necessary

795
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,280
In order to keep

796
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,048
Space open

797
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,352
So maybe those stories were it's like

798
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:27,424
28 hours and labor are also

799
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,288
What they're leaving out is that that's because the doctor didn't have anybody coming behind base

800
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,640
And if he needed the space maybe I would have been in labor for 6 hours and got nafisa

801
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,944
Maybe maybe is a

802
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,712
Just saying that that's

803
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:42,016
That's now in my brain

804
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:47,648
Before an article in the Atlantic points out how data seems to indicate that a lot of the prevalence in C-section

805
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,440
Can be attributed to this type of behavior

806
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:55,328
If there's any doubt that the culture of individual hospitals can have an effect on a on a

807
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,608
Choice of a C-section

808
00:37:56,864 --> 00:38:01,984
One only need observed that hospital C-section rates vary from 7% to seventy percent

809
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,032
Differences in patient

810
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:04,800
Complexity

811
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:11,200
Cannot account for that spread wow wow capitalism to the rescue again

812
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,992
Issues that are related to fix

813
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:18,112
Hey Mike the doctors get for performing as opposed to a vaginal delivery

814
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,416
Apparently C-sections net around

815
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,976
It is much as 15% more per surgery

816
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,256
So there are some

817
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,792
Confounding factors that are

818
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,840
This is this is where we go back

819
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,120
Back to the ship

820
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,168
Mayonnaise

821
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,496
Face level of corruption it would be as easy to f*** around

822
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,544
You know some of this is

823
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,592
Understandable even possible is

824
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:43,200
The subconscious corruption doesn't even need to be like

825
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,992
Intentional scam

826
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,552
There are things that people could

827
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:49,856
Just said

828
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:56,256
It just said operational pressure of not even not being told ever once like hey we need this bed we need to get

829
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:59,072
Get this out you got to do the C-section but just like

830
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,096
A constant awareness

831
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,144
We're running low on hospital beds

832
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,216
There's all this stuff going on the budget's tight

833
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,752
Hey all this stuff is in the back

834
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,056
Is mine and that happen

835
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:12,384
Humanity

836
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,432
What is the culture of individual

837
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:15,968
Okay thanks

838
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,760
Some places may have more

839
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,832
Pressure

840
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:22,880
The effects

841
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:25,952
Treatment hey when the bottom line is profit treat

842
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:26,976
When's going to supper

843
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:30,048
A lot of interesting issues to unpack as it relates to the issue

844
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,072
C-sections

845
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,888
Completely wrong about the numbers and he's also wrong about the idea.

846
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:34,912
C-sections

847
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,680
Child

848
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,472
Breastfeeding

849
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:44,128
The CDC releases an annual breastfeeding report card for the United States

850
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:48,224
Do that a thing like that existed or why

851
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,600
You can find the 2020 report card and if you do you'll find that 84.1% of Americans who gave birth

852
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,928
In 2017 breastfed over 25%

853
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,464
Exclusively breastfeeding

854
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,512
For the first 6 months

855
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:03,840
The call the action on this report card includes both quote

856
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:06,656
Celebrate state of treatments and breastfeeding and breastfeeding

857
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,424
Supportive matern

858
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,216
Ready Care practices and quote

859
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,752
Bring together partners

860
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:11,776
To promote and support breast

861
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,568
It's so weird.

862
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,336
The CDC will be

863
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:17,920
Be saying I sent there an evil globalist Behemoth and they want to kill everyone

864
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,200
So weird almost

865
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,992
Everything Alex says doesn't mean any

866
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,552
If they didn't say

867
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,112
And if what they did say actually confirmed

868
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:29,184
The opposite like I shouldn't trust with Alex's

869
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:34,048
Also just for fun the top seven states in terms of their score on the m

870
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,096
Pimc scale

871
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,376
The maternity practice isn't

872
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:38,656
Christian Care

873
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,680
They're all blue

874
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:43,776
Stop California New Hampshire Massachusetts

875
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:47,616
Walking Rhode Island knocking it out of the park with the score 95

876
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,896
Take me home

877
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,944
Swear if Alex

878
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,712
News

879
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,504
Like he actually do it

880
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,904
He would have a complete different angle is like how dare these blue States come and tell me how to raise my kids my breast for

881
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,792
I believe in capitalism and I support the formula industry

882
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:09,376
I want more C-sections because the bottom line is suffering

883
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:15,776
Mike Lindell has a my formula he's putting out

884
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:21,664
The point is nothing Alex

885
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:24,480
Complete to be saying at the globalist

886
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:28,576
The man and the government they want a breakdown the relation

887
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:33,184
Humans have with each other they don't want you to breastfeed I want to make you a dumb

888
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,720
Oh that's just based on nothing

889
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,792
So this this was my thought was pretty funny

890
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,328
More more

891
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,888
Information

892
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,448
We should talk about the spirituality and God and

893
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,240
How to get out of the trench in

894
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,264
Ways to break

895
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,288
Conditioning

896
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,872
What whether you're old or young or black

897
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:52,640
Wife

898
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,943
Are male or female or where you live

899
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,479
Real thing is

900
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,575
It's a growing process and I'm not perfect either

901
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,647
Respond to bash liberals it's fun to get mad at a minute

902
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:06,975
Stupid they are but that's a reflection on us about that

903
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,279
Wow

904
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,631
Other than conscious demons

905
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,399
A funeral Gates

906
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,215
Very top of but mostly people

907
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,775
Are scared to belong to something

908
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:28,991
And I know deep down that it's a fraud so they're shared

909
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,807
11 nice way in

910
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,855
You know try to get people

911
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,391
Our side that way

912
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,487
Because I've had the big Brash approach that's been successful a lot of people

913
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:43,327
Dodge related on my heart

914
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,863
We need to just get back

915
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,399
Really want to be bullying

916
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:49,215
We'll evaluate Humanity really caring about everybody

917
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,751
Realizing that

918
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,799
Love is the answer

919
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:56,383
Love Is The Answer quotes Alex I swear to God

920
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,663
I swear to God

921
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,711
I'm throwing baseballs at everybody

922

55 G

923
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,807
That's insane you know what I

924
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,367
Here's the other thing that I just that just occurred to

925
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,183
So the people who Alex

926
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,743
The people who follow this far right

927
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,535
Specifically

928
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,559
Like

929
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:15,839
Do they realize

930
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,119
How close

931
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:18,399
These people would

932
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,191
C C-section to abortion

933
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,727
Like very quickly

934
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,263
Like if they got rid of abortion

935
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,103
They're going to have to pick something else

936
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,151
Unnatural and Unholy

937
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,967
And it's going to eventually get to women

938
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:33,247
There you go

939
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,295
Yeah probably

940
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:40,927
To put that together and be like a natural birth is what it should be and you should always try and save the child's life and not the mothers

941
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,463
0 *

942
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,255
Yeah yeah

943
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,279
Loves the answer

944
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:49,631
Also I just got to say that if Alex thinks

945
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,655
New Direction

946
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,935
Temperature should be

947
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,983
Not covering the news and talking

948
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,799
Think about rambly pseudo-spiritual

949
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:01,407
Great idea

950
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:07,039
What he saying is he wants to lower the

951
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,367
I can't stop

952
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,159
I welcome that

953
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:15,743
The pretense is annoying and it's very annoying

954
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:18,303
So Alex doesn't like Rim Desiree

955
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:19,583
Now

956
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,863
Bright cuz he did before

957
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,631
Right

958
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,423
But he still like hydroxychloroquine

959
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,959
Still kind of like Cybermen

960
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:25,983
Sure

961
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,543
He's another one Eli

962
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,567
Likes now

963
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,103
This rendezevere

964
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:35,455
That we've been seeing getting pushed by

965
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,527
Has less than 8% efficacy

966
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:41,087
They cost a bunch of money they made money off that didn't help people

967
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,463
Regeneron

968
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,023
Create a bunch of Clone white blood cells for mice

969
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,679
Prisoners or something their blood

970
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,751
No side effects

971
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:01,311
Cleans everything out

972
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:02,591
No shorts

973
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,359
Turn stop

974
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:07,455
Change your body it's in something in

975
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,807
And then you urinate and defecate

976
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:18,207
Is piss out the cloned cells

977
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,231
Okay

978
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:23,583
Does snake sound like something Alex would be again

979
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,543
F****** Christ I would never put

980
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,591
Play Shannon that the FDA has approved

981
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,383
Now

982
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:39,967
These rats themselves you just piss him out this amount

983
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,735
Just passed them out

984
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,807
It's really funny that Alex is promoting the use of regeneron

985
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:48,927
Complaints about the covid vaccine for these people is that it wasn't FDA-approved

986
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:49,695
Although that's

987
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,975
No longer true for Pfizer

988
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:54,047
Something like that

989
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:58,399
Which is also not FDA-approved I mean none of his s*** is FDA-approved

990
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,167
Cuz it doesn't have to

991
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,959
Bright but that's not the case we

992
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,495
Emergency

993
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,775
To use authorization

994
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:07,103
And it does seem like fwiw there are some indications that getting

995
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,407
Four injections of this cocktail of antibodies

996
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,431
Can be effective

997
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,223
And helping reduce a person's risk

998
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,247
Hospitalization

999
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:17,855
Hey I don't want to get a vaccine they're going to stab me with something that I don't understand

1000
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:22,463
Did you stand before times you know it's

1001
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:25,023
Yeah if there are some indications that it could be effect

1002
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:27,839
But it is not a good pandemic control strategy

1003
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:35,007
It's only useful for people who already have covid and it's effective only early on in a case so that could be a tough win

1004
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,287
Window to hit for most people

1005
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:37,823
Stop being sad

1006
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,615
If you go to their own website to the

1007
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,407
Regeneron website you can see

1008
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:45,247
That it does have some side effects that Alex maybe should be concerned about

1009
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:48,319
Serious Adverse Events reported in 1.6

1010
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:51,391
6% of patients in the 2400m group

1011
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:55,999
These included quote pneumonia hypo or hyperglycemia nausea and vomiting

1012
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,815
Point out this

1013
00:46:59,071 --> 00:46:59,839
Can't be used

1014
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,375
Conclude that the regeneron

1015
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,143
Treatment

1016
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,935
Actually cause those side effects

1017
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,959
Alex

1018
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:07,007
That's how I would report this let you would

1019
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,287
Say damn

1020
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,567
There are short-term

1021
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:12,383
Side effects of associated people who were in The Trials choy

1022
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,151
Bye

1023
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:16,479
Pennywise the only reason the people like Alex are promoting this now is because

1024
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,527
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is open

1025
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:23,391
Attempting to put a bandaid on the covid problem in his state

1026
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:29,023
Of course this is really dicey because we're generon is part-owned by the hedge fund Citadel

1027
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,047
And their CEO

1028
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:33,375
Kenneth Griffin is donated over 10 million dollars to do

1029
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,399
Who campaigns

1030
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,447
In 2018 and 2022

1031
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:40,799
Well the drug cocktail itself may be promising this whole thing has a very

1032
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:43,103
Strong smell of corruption duet

1033
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,895
It's a little bit worrying

1034
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,431
Is f****** Banana Republic

1035
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,199
Chet right there

1036
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,479
That's straight-up like

1037
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,551
Anybody is anybody watching

1038
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:54,367
I think the argument that

1039
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,415
I saw that the Santa's had was

1040
00:47:56,927 --> 00:48:01,023
That there were two possible antibody related treatment right

1041
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:04,351
One was Eli Lilly one was this regeneron

1042
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:06,399
And the regeneron showed more ethic

1043
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,935
Perkasie in relation

1044
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:10,239
The Delta variant and that's why you chose to go with it

1045
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:13,823
But maybe a hundred percent proof sure very well could be

1046
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,615
And brightest in itself could

1047
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:18,943
I have as much promise as it appears to write

1048
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,223
Zach said

1049
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:20,991
Haha

1050
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:23,551
The circumstances surrounding the sale make it

1051
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,831
Really f****** dice

1052
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,135
Well and there's the fact that he's

1053
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,927
Still profiting off of

1054
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:29,951
The death

1055
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,719
So people in it

1056
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:35,583
Also as you pointed at Alex

1057
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:41,727
Trump in the right-wing chorus were all excited about better than doing any of that other stuff

1058
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,007
Blah

1059
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:47,103
Get ready for him to come over genron for a little while

1060
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,151
I hate it whenever it doesn't go well

1061
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,199
And then probably will see

1062
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,223
A lot of those

1063
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,247
Rogan types

1064
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,271
Also

1065
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:57,855
Probably promoting a pretty hard

1066
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,159
I can't believe they do this s***

1067
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:07,327
You know he's not going to advertise my pillow for free why are you doing what are you doing advertising regeneron you should get a cut

1068
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:13,727
Give promo code promo code for Toronto

1069
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:14,495
Serious about make

1070
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,263
Money get out

1071
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,055
You got a Hustle

1072
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:23,199
Alex loves his talking loves is going off air

1073
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,479
Is Tac

1074
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,247
He's like a f******

1075
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:29,087
He's a genius Sister George Jetson baby I love technology

1076
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,671
Eminem liability protection

1077
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,207
An image transparent

1078
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,023
Glass

1079
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,583
End

1080
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,167
Authorized

1081
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:45,471
Regeneron

1082
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,823
For no profit and it doing that

1083
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:52,127
This is a bunch of nonsense

1084
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:54,175
The company owned by kenfucky

1085
00:49:54,431 --> 00:50:00,575
Griffin is a non-profit

1086
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,367
Million dollar investment

1087
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,647
In general

1088
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:10,047
But also that the cocktail that regeneron has is not any more than any covid vaccine that Alex

1089
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,327
So that point is

1090
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:15,935
Second blade the whole issue of liability protection is not to protect the

1091
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,959
Necessarily

1092
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:18,239
It's protect consumers

1093
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:19,519
The entire system

1094
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:23,871
Paying people who could have been hurt by vaccines to set up to make it easier for people to get settled

1095
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:27,199
Never be able to reach the burden of proof

1096
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,735
Required in an actual Court

1097
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:32,831
Companies that produce vaccines are also protected because if they weren't

1098
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:36,927
No one would ever take on the risk of developing treatments that can save Millions

1099
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:37,695
The Flies

1100
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,231
It's a collective good

1101
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,767
So the state takes on that burden

1102
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:42,559
Next total

1103
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,607
The word liability protect

1104
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:47,423
Feel like a slam dunk with Alex but they're really not

1105
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:50,751
Thirdly Alex says things have to be transparent

1106
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:53,311
And what's the definition of transparent

1107
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:56,383
It seems like there's a giant conflict of interest involved in

1108
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,151
Florida's

1109
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:58,175
Stop operating

1110
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:00,735
That is large-scale Virginia

1111
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:01,759
Screen Prince parents

1112
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:05,087
I don't know what this glass

1113
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:09,183
Do you mean physically try thinking means physically transparent and opaque things

1114
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:11,487
I mean he would like his phone but it can't

1115
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,255
See through it

1116
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,279
It's not boats

1117
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:14,815
CC

1118
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,119
Point of

1119
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:17,887
Treatment

1120
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:19,167
They're charging

1121
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,703
Consumers for regeneron shots

1122
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,263
That doesn't mean the company isn't making a profit

1123
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,543
But one thing

1124
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,847
In late 2020 they received at 4

1125
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,175
50 million-dollar contract for the federal government to produce

1126
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:34,271
And in January 2021 the federal government

1127
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:39,135
Bought all the companies supply for a price estimated at 2.6 billion dollars

1128
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,927
Sometimes you just

1129
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:44,255
See this corruption in your really like man

1130
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:48,607
We're just not doing s*** our way we're just not going to do it

1131
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:50,655
I mean so it's just not going to get done

1132
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:53,215
We're just going to live like that also if you're keeping

1133
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,775
Score these Governors like DeSantis

1134
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,919
Is the federal government do Alex hate so much and is full of demons

1135
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:04,223
That is paying for this to be able to

1136
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:10,623
Have people get at the point of because if you're smart you're not going to pay for it

1137
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,415
Make the government pay for it

1138
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,463
That's why your smart if you don't pay

1139
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,231
Taxes

1140
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:17,791
And keep all that money for yourself it makes

1141
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:20,607
Fix that makes total sense

1142
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,143
This is all just such

1143
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,935
Bulshit

1144
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:26,495
Jetson baby hello technology

1145
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:28,031
If it's these three things

1146
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:28,799
Let me know

1147
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,871
Can call before you tell me your George

1148
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:38,527
Instead of accurately discussing a story that he decided to cover on his show he doesn't prepare at all and he just chooses to make up

1149
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,551
Details instead

1150
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:43,135
Regeneron is supplying the rejection that cost out of the goodness

1151
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:43,903
So their hearts

1152
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:44,671
Same

1153
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:47,231
Test your might as well just give me a

1154
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:49,279
Yeah if you're a conspiracy theorist

1155
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:50,815
That listen to Alex

1156
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:51,583
Text Jones

1157
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:55,935
Even Alex saying that a corporation would do something for no prob

1158
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:56,959
Would have to

1159
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:57,727
Temeku razor

1160
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:58,495
Tears up a little

1161
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:00,287
But like it's a little silly

1162
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,567
You're going to go with these

1163
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,591
Billionaires

1164
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:08,223
Are not trying to make money off of this supposed to believe that every billionaire is it a secret

1165
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,527
Design to make money off of my desk

1166
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:17,695
Who's the theme that develops got over the show and that is this like they're trying to take away these these human elements

1167
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,463
Of Our Lives

1168
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,231
Like a breast

1169
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,255
Speeding that day

1170
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,863
Sure

1171
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,399
Here's the deal guys

1172
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,007
Biological system

1173
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:34,591
Mothers can't get milk to babies

1174
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,151
Doesn't work

1175
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:39,199
We've got to put you in a bubble and control your life

1176
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:41,503
Mobile.

1177
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,783
Don't talk to your neighbors

1178
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:45,087
This is really happening this is the pod people

1179
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,135
They're trying to make us the bald people

1180
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:54,303
Do you want to fight tyranny you say you want to fund the second American Revolution

1181
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,071
Got cut off

1182
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,863
Got caught up at break there

1183
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,935
Yeah that was passionless

1184
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,215
Yeah that was not

1185
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,775
Heartfelt like a

1186
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:07,103
His emotions were

1187
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,407
Felt like he was replaced by

1188
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,431
By subway

1189
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:12,479
He comes back from break and he wants to

1190
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:13,759
Explain why everything

1191
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:14,783
Is going all topsy

1192
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:15,807
Teeter B

1193
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,087
The world is in

1194
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,623
The state of Chaos

1195
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,927
Writer Isaac

1196
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,463
He knows what he's talkin

1197
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,487
Do you think so

1198
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,255
Michelle

1199
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,631
A lot of this is because

1200
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,935
The top Rothschilds have died

1201
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,983
Top Rockefellers have died

1202
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,311
I know a lot of people that know

1203
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,847
The top people

1204
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:44,223
And they are just involved torturing and murdering people in Devil worshiping

1205
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:46,015
Eating bats

1206
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:49,599
Shopping channels off and torturing themselves

1207
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,303
I don't know why you're laughing

1208
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,839
Some very serious

1209
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,887
People eating

1210
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,167
Is Ativan

1211
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,447
This is deadly

1212
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:10,335
For one thing if he's Loveless or eating large amounts

1213
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:12,639
The poop you would expect for a lot of them

1214
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:14,175
Constantly being a state of Heaven

1215
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,455
Food poisoning

1216
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:20,063
Norovirus rotavirus and hepatitis A can all be transmitted through oral fecal meme

1217
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:23,903
And that's not even taking into account the tons of bacteria and parasites you risk exposing

1218
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:30,047
Yourself to better make sure they got clean ship moves back

1219
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:36,447
Exactly it ruins the fun

1220
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:39,007
Brother hamburger

1221
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,543
Fresh organic

1222
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,079
Farm-to-table

1223
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:48,735
You know one of the big reasons that there are signs and every restaurant bathroom that have employees have to wash their hands before returning to work is because

1224
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:51,295
Gulfeagle contamination can lead to outbreaks of

1225
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,831
Nicolai or shigella

1226
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:57,695
I'm no doctor but you got to assume your risk would be much higher if you're eating poo by the vet

1227
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:03,327
Yeah you know it's super weird how you can identify all of our oligarchs by how they died of

1228
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,607
Poisoning every

1229
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,631
F****** day

1230
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:08,191
Alex doesn't say these things for shock value

1231
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:11,263
Play kind of suspicion that he's teasing his audio

1232
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:17,663
Like yeah I can get you to believe this s*** let's see how far I can go

1233
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,687
Showboat

1234
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:23,551
Look-at-me showboating propaganda

Dribbling between my legs how about that

00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,439
You impressed by that I don't

1239
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,231
So now that Alex has sold you on the van

How to poop

1241
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,535
He also wants you to know that the global

1242
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,559
Don't want you to look at

1243
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:36,095
Sunsets on Ybor

1244
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,655
My mother I told the story 20 years ago

1245
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,959
Just last year

1246
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,239
Another said

1247
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:43,775
You look at

1248
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:44,799
At the sunset

1249
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:49,663
The water and the waves on the beach and you know it's beautiful

1250
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:53,247
And you know it's good and you commune with it and you spiritually connect

1251
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:55,551
Through God's creation to God

1252
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,343
That is a form of worship

1253
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:00,927
Electromagnetically and spiritually to God

1254
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,719
God made us

1255
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:04,767
Experience this with him

1256
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,327

Sunset

1261
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,799
Statistically if you look

1262
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:21,151
In the morning and at night when it's low on the horizon that's not bad for your eyes

1263
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:23,455
The massively boost

Horizon

1268
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,839
Something in your brain

1269
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:44,959
They're trying to take away

00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,239
Because these are Satanist

1271
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:49,055
Uggs go

About WhatsApp

1279
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,935
Don't go outside.

1280
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,727
Don't go outside dark dusk

1281
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,495
Start alarm

1282
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:23,103
Don't you dare look at the Sun during a transitional phase when it's

1283
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,895
It's you know that the Liberals are

1284

1287
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:46,143
If you stare at the Sun for a half hour you're going to blow your eyes out

1288
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,167
Tell me what

1289
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:51,775
Right now this is the demons trying to get me to not look

1290
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:52,543
Sunset

1291
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,335
Because that's how I connect with God

1292
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:56,127
Alex look at the sunset

1293
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:58,175
Directly into the sun

1294
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:01,503
For as long as you possibly can enjoy a sunset

1295
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:02,527
Sunrises

1296
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,807
The more power to him

1297
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,111
That's it

1298
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:08,671
I don't have another qualifier

1299
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:14,559
So I found this really fun because this again is another thing that's harder than that same train of like trying to take away the

1300
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:15,327
Human thing

1301
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,607
Like that

1302
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,631
Speeding at

1303
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:23,263
Sunset people by slapping

1304
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:31,967
What are they going to do about the northern lights are they are the Aurora Borealis still okay

1305
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:38,367
Don't look at the Aurora Borealis the Elder gods don't do that

1306
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:41,951
Alex says he needs we need to take action

1307
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,999
Collective action about sunsets

1308
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:50,911
You know I want to do a human ritual with our listeners

1309
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:54,239
Human ritual

1310
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:01,919
And tomorrow night and you are the sun might not be clear the sky

1311
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:03,967
2

1312
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,015
Only

1313
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,647
To join me in

1314
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,487
Jay-Z at God's incredible creation again

1315
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:17,279
Gives us life and a celebration of life

1316
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,559
And I thank God

1317
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,863
The meaning of spinach

1318
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:27,263
They're telling us don't go look at the sunset don't look at the sunrise

1319
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,055
I would like to

1320
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,127
Pledge

1321
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,431

And in love and any good energy in the world

1326
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,375
To get people courage to stand up and

This show is f****** weird

1328
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:58,495
I agree I think what we need

1329
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,263
Good deal

1330
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,287
As a society

1331
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:02,591
Is get rid of all of our

1332
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:06,431
All of our TV shows all of our government

1333
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:07,711
And all as a

1334
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:09,503
The country focus on creating a

1335
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:11,039
Truman Show situation

1336
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:12,575
Text Jones

1337
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:14,367
Where we all just do this weird s***

1338
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,903
All of us

1339
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:17,439
But he's insane

1340
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:20,511
And we're just humoring a bit because I do want her

1341
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,791
Him to walk outside

1342
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:22,559
Some Nights

1343
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:24,863
And just be the entirety of America

1344
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,655
Staring up at the sunlight with him

1345
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,679
Beautiful

1346
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:34,079
I was going the other way with this I was I was thinking we would put him in as all of us

1347
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:36,895
Truly tell him not to look at the subject

1348
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:43,295
No. We all live out his negative fantasies as opposed to his positive

1349
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:46,367
I want I want to live in a world where what Alex says make

1350
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,135
Make sense

1351
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:49,183
He has to like nothing

1352
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,487
It's like it's like him hitting a

1353
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:52,511
Wallet

1354
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:53,791
60 miles an hour

1355
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:56,863
Whenever all of a sudden everybody believes everything he says

1356
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,399
This is true what will happen

1357
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:00,447
Interesting because you would have to

1358
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,983
To start complaining about something else

1359
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:04,287
Fascinating to find out

1360
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,823

1361
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,847

Breastfeeding away

1374

Famously

1375
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:53,183
Very poetically said

1376
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:54,207
Mama titties

1378
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,839
Cool life Falcone

1379
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:05,983
I think it's a little bit mad about this taking away of his Humanity

1380
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:09,311
Take our lives our bodies over

1381
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:13,407
What do you want us to do

1382
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:20,063
The good guys

1383
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:24,415
I don't want power and don't want violence our kids up in our lives up

1384
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:27,231
My father's brother's up to make this go away

1385
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:28,511
No it makes this

1386
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:29,791

Videos of Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama's party

1390
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:56,671
It looks like a bunch of trash and a bunch of unhappy garbage are losers

1391
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,975
I didn't want to go anyway

1392
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:03,839
Also in terms of the blue cities being full of feces

1393
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,887
Preseason that's lunch

1394
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:17,663
It's like those those regions in the Appalachians where they all eat raw meat all the time

1395
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:18,431
Do you like

1396
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:19,711
You people

1397
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,735

01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:22,527
Stop

1400

01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,023
Yeah I was worried

1405
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:36,351
Pretty convinced that

1406
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:38,143
Anyway the Democrat

1407
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:39,935
Everybody on the left

1408
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:41,727
It's all just Satanism now

1409
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:47,871
Undercover

1410
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,151
They talked about how much they lost

1411
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:51,711
Then there really

1412
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:53,503
It's a bunch of really soft

1413
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,039
Weird nerds

1414
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,879
No Satan rules the plan

1415
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:00,927
I just want some petty power

1416
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,743
We also make jokes about all that doesn't exist

1417
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:05,279
Charlie Staton ism

1418
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:09,631
That's how they suck everybody into a true control of the island after the

1419
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:14,239
Porsche rally baby

1420
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:15,263
I love Satan

1421
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,335
Then they're just demonic

1422
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:20,895
Rabid dogs are some

1423
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:24,991
This is what they don't love men they don't like women

1424
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:29,599
Special judge

1425
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:32,415
Super super ultra viral

1426
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:34,207
Videos up on

Satanist

1435
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,879
Quite jarring

1436
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,183
Doctor gas

1437
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:08,511
Yes and Alex has been presenting him as somebody

1438
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:09,535
Who's the doctor

1439
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,303
That's

1440
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,071
What he says

1441
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,119
I mean you did name him

1442
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,399
Doctor

1443
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:17,727
You would not be

1444
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:22,079
Wrong to assume that maybe this is a medical doctor because

1445
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,103
Assuming that

1446
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:25,151
And now you're concerning me

1447
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:27,967
In my assumption you would have assumed that because of

1448
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:29,503
It's about like medical issues

1449
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:31,551
You would have an idea

1450
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,575
Talkin to ask

1451
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:34,367
God's School Board

1452
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,951
You kind of think that and I think Alex probably thought the

1453
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:38,975
Yeah

1454
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:40,255
He's wrong

1455
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,791
Ono and maybe he learned

1456
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:46,399
Producer

1457
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,727
I went to that High School

1458
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,007
And I was there

1459
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:54,079
I'm a well-known PhD in education

01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:00,479

Bushes for a living

1466
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,703
We're all humans

1467
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:23,007
Chewing on and speak out

And that this PhD had of like

1474
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,119
Oh

1475
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:52,447
I realize now that they're going to think of a doctor from Fox

1476
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:53,471
Yeah

1477
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,239
That's not good

1478
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:56,799
I don't want to misrepresent myself I would like

1479
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:59,359
Give you an opportunity to bail on this interview

1480
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:03,199
That's what he was saying to the producer

1481
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:09,599
I know why this is happening I didn't intend for it I'm not going to play along with that and that

1482
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,671
Education

1483
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,207
Mitzi from the city of ox

1484
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,999
Oxford

1485
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:18,559
Now this guy in his video that went

1486
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:20,607
Mega Uber viral

1487
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,655
You don't sound a little bit on him

1488
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:32,639
Snapping your RNA

1489
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,735
Anymore

1490
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:42,879
Now here's what's going to happen in the future very quick

1491
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:50,047
15 seconds

1492
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:11,295
Alright so we need to be alarmist about this because this is a big Loveless moment everything he says you can.

1493
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:15,135
This is a really tough Waze me to find out that I I and you

1494
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:17,439
Yeah and almost everybody I know we're no longer human

1495
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:20,511
I mean I think a real

1496
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:22,815
Quick question to that would just be like a

1497
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,095
What is a human

1498
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,631
When you're stupid piece of s***

1499
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:32,287
Give me a definition of my quote-unquote RNA gets broken in half

1500
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:38,943
Give me a real explanation of why a full

1501
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:44,575
You are a human if and only if your are and are not broken

1502
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:50,975
I like it it's like a game like you don't

1503
01:09:55,071 --> 01:10:01,215
So we don't have to treat you or I guess the flip side of the argument is that everything has human rights

1504
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:05,567
I guess this is going to be a dangerous road for this doctor of Education

1505
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:07,359
Doesn't want to have that conversation

1506
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,639
That's fine cuz I don't either

1507
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:10,175
Have you ever considered

1508
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:11,199
That if

1509
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:17,599
The definition of humanity definition of humanity is more a social thing that we've all agreed upon

1510
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:20,927
More people have broken RNA than have not broken our an egg

1511
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,719
All the sudden we are the humans

1512
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:25,023
And you're the not human how do you feel about that

1513
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:27,327
Do you see how your logic might make you a fuk

1514
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,095
Moron

1515
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:31,423
Have you considered that for one second sir I don't know

1516
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:37,055
So you going to be coming in here in a minute before breaking news

1517
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:43,967
Welcome back I'm your host Alex Jones massive news has broken since we got our guest on let me message

1518
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,783
We're going to take on to get back to the huge

1519
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,831
Information he was just

1520
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:50,623
Laying out

1521
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:54,463
Bourbon on Salazar

1522
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:01,119
Member Israel Australia are The Cutting Edge what's coming or not

1523
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:04,447
Is realtor Grant Green passport

1524
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,751
Why

1525
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:08,799
Restaurants

1526
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:11,615
Israel

1527
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:12,383
Only

1528
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:19,295
At worst you got to take

1529
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,231
Unbelievable

1530
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:30,303
The green passports in Israel were rolled out in February

1531
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:31,583
Now it's been a little while

1532
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:32,351
How'd they do it

1533
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:38,751
It's just a convenient way for businesses to check out a person's exclamation status if they want to require vaccinations to enter their premises

1534
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:44,383
Israeli Health Minister Yulia eidelstein was quoted back in February the Jerusalem Post

1535
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:47,711
Whoever chooses not to be vaccinated has his right

1536
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:51,295
There'll also be no personal sanctions against someone who is not back

1537
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:55,135
It should be understood that getting vaccinated is a great privilege

1538
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:56,159
That has been given to us

1539
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:58,207
Something that many countries in the world has not attained

1540
01:11:59,231 --> 01:11:59,999
The article continues

1541
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:03,071
The minister added that there will be some areas that will be over

1542
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:05,631
Open to everyone even for citizens who have not been vaccine

1543
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:08,191
And the possibility of these areas will be

1544
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:12,031
Depending on the rate of immunization of the entire population

1545
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:19,199
So now currently the the conversation is for these things are already out they will apply to people that boosters

1546
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:23,295
Story is not

1547
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:28,415

01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:32,767
Forehead has started requiring White

1550
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,303
That

1551
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:35,583
You have to use

1552
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:36,351
And you have to

1553
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:37,375
Tain

1554
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:40,447
In order to move in a car from one place to another

1555
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,983
Can you believe that you have to

1556
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:42,751
To get a

1557
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:49,151
Driver's license can only go places with these cards I mean it's bananas

1558
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:51,199

01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:56,319
Special move as fast as you want to drive

1560
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,855

01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:00,927
Martial law Banning state

1562

Gone mad

1563
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:10,399
I think I may have even misspoke a little bit doctor he's on the line

1564
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,959
Just getting into this news

1565
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:15,519
Announces he has to get into before

1566
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:18,591
We we really dive in with Sean

1567
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:21,407
And that is

1568
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:23,199
We got to get into dumbass gate

1569
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:24,991
Will you do

1570
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:27,295
Did Alex call Trump a dumbass

1571
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:28,831
Everybody saying

1572
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:31,647
Call President Trump

1573
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:33,439
A dumbass do I said

1574
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:45,983
Just showed you to spend a days at Pfizer says it's 139

1575
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:51,103
Visors

1576
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:53,151
But don't worry he's got new ones

1577
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:57,247
I just said days before he said that

1578
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:00,063
On Friday

1579
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:04,415
Prophet said it looks like a scam by Pfizer with these boosters

1580
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:07,231
Trust that you're smart

1581
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:10,047
Yeah I stand by that

1582
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:12,095
Okay so if I'm hearing Alex correct

1583
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:14,399
Call Trump a dumbass

1584
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:17,215
Apparently with Alex medbio comments was that

1585
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:19,007
He doesn't think the Trump is a dumbass

1586
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:20,287
That's right and then he must know what

1587
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,055
He's doing

1588
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:24,895
Sure which is recommending people get a vaccine that he presumably knows is a scam

1589
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:28,223
I guess I was a dumbass as much as he called him and Evil

1590
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:30,271
Fraud is trying to kill his followers

1591
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:36,927
That's even better that is what you would rather somebody hear you say other than dogs I want a dumbass that's

1592
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:37,951
Insulting things

1593
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,487
You say what you should call them

1594
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:40,511
Is a mouth

1595
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:45,119
Please for the enemy that you have been fighting against your entire career and feel like a complete

1596
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:49,727
Sell out in a piece of s***

1597
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:52,031
Tivoli killing the people who put him in power

1598
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:56,127
Here's the clip that's been going around I'll let you judge for yourself

1599
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:57,919
What Alex's meaning

1600
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:58,687
To say

1601
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:02,015
Decided to call Shadow dumbass gate

1602
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:05,599
Medical doctors on a play for you on this when we come back

1603
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:07,903
President-trump

1604
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:09,695
I believe it's a good person

1605
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:17,119
And who I really care about is why I want to see a lot of the Republicans elected the midterms and who I would love to see him run again

1606
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:22,239
Cuz he came out last week on Fox and Friends

1607
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:24,031
I really am suspicious of this boost

1608
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:26,847
Four shots in this supposedly work so well why did The Butcher Shop

1609
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:28,383
Because you got lied to Trump

1610
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:30,687
Advocacy

1611
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,223
We knew it wouldn't work

1612
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:34,527
. it's a fraud it'll create mutants

1613
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:35,551
You got Trump

1614
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:37,087
You got signed on to a fraud

1615
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:38,367
Restart the economy

1616
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:40,671
I understand why you did it you believe in science

1617
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:42,207
These are Bad actors sir

1618
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:49,887
Real quick I just have to break here because

1619
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:52,447
If Alex do anything about delivery in m

1620
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:53,983
He would have repeated sir

1621
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,287
Yep it was begging to be put up

1622
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,823

01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:00,127
Yep

1624
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:01,151
You know like that yet

1625
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:02,943
The right tire how you do it

1626
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:05,503

01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,551
Now they got you signed up

1628
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:12,671
And you are seeing and come downstairs

1629
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:19,327
Seeing it snaps her fingers

1630
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:22,143
Tim suckers snaps his fingers and Trump

1631
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:24,959
Quick steel and hops

1632
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,823
There Trump in the Alabama yesterday

1633
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:34,687
Where you got to do what you have to do

1634
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:38,527
I recommend

You got your freedom

1637
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:48,767
If it doesn't work

1638
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:50,047
You'll be the first to know

1639
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:51,071
Okay

1640
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:56,191
But it is working

1641
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:57,983
BS

1642
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,775
Trump that's a lie you're not stupid

1643
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:04,383
Just two weeks ago they said it was 65% then 40%

1644
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:06,431
Someone ever put out by about 50 shots

1645
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:07,455
37%

1646
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:10,527
Cuz he's going to take it doesn't work

1647
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:13,599
Pappadeaux

1648
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:15,647
Shame on you Trump

1649
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:16,927
Seriously

1650
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:18,719
Hey

1651
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:20,255
Disable yourself

1652
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:23,071
That's okay

1653
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,607
And you'll be like you

1654
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:25,631
My God

1655
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:27,935
Maybe you're not that bright maybe Trump Taxi

1656
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:28,703
Dumbass

1657
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:36,895
If I were in charge of deciding how to cover this story I would lean much more heavily into how Alex is very clearly saying that

1658
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:39,967
Trump knows that the vaccines are a secret plot to kill everyone

1659
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:41,759
And that he's recommending them to his audio

1660
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:43,807
Know what defensive is that

1661
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:44,831
Dumbass

1662
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:48,927
Write the headline here isn't that Alex speculated the Trump is a dumbass

1663
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:52,767
Evil

1664
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:58,143
The Alex Trump will-they-won't-they storyline sent the election really isn't doing anything for me

1665
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:00,191
When you get right down to it really

1666
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:01,471
It doesn't really matter

1667
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:02,239
The Alex either

1668
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:03,775
He doesn't like Trump

1669
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:05,055
That's not a problem

1670
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,591
Because he probably never did

1671
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:08,127
Trump has a useful tool

1672
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:08,895
For people like out

1673
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:11,455
Is an impressionable malleable chaotic

1674
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:14,527
Idiot who they could use to take over some of the levers of power

1675
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:15,551
In this country

1676
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:17,855
If I was in the press and I decided even

1677
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:18,879
Touch this clip

1678
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:23,487
What angle would be would be that Alex is turning on Trump

1679
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:28,351
Scooby-Doo play up this idea that Alex is saying the Trump is either stupid or evil

1680
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:29,119
And not

1681
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,655
Good

1682
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:32,191
There's only two WAP

1683
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:36,799
Covering the story as Alex called Trump a dumbass misses the point a little bit and just

1684
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:39,615
Makes me think that the reporting doesn't have much awareness

1685
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:42,943
Of how often Alex says mean things about Trump when he's mad at

1686
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:44,223
Like it's it's

1687
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:45,759
Not novel

1688
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:48,319
But I think there's maybe some ground you could

1689
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,855
You could gain by

1690
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:51,647
Bye-bye

1691
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:54,207
Really positioning this we're like okay

1692
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,511
The bass is really crack

1693
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:58,303
Right right

1694
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:00,863
You have a foundational issue

1695
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:02,655
That the leader of the cult

1696
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:05,215
Is unwilling to go along with

1697
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:07,007
Which is telling everyone not

1698
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:08,031
To get back some

1699
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:08,799
Yeah

1700
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:10,847
And I think that you could probably

1701
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:11,871
Exploit that wedge

1702
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:12,639
Pretty hard

1703
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:13,663
No it's a it's a

1704
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,431
Perfect

1705
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:20,063
Like it's such a great teachable example of something that happens in human history all the

1706
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:21,599
Which is that

1707
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:23,135
The leader of the

1708
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:26,975
The group is the leader and they will go along with whatever the leader says

1709
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:28,767
As long as they tell them what they want to hear

1710
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:33,119
And if you tell them what they want to hear guess what you can add

1711
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,655
Whatever the f*** you want

1712
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:36,447
Dove Court yeah

1713
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:42,847
You tell them what they want to hear and then you can destroy their lives because whatever you want

1714
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:46,943
Whatever you want as long as it doesn't violate one of the other things

1715
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:47,711
That they need to

1716
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:52,575
And then in this situation you would think that Trump would look at that and go oh

1717
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:53,855
I was just

1718
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:54,623
Able to

1719
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:58,463
Bought them I was not actually leaving the group and run the group

1720
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:03,071
Will do anything if anybody tells us what we want to hear

1721
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:07,423
Everybody should learn from that and be like maybe we're both stupid on both sides here

1722
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:13,055
And this is a negative feedback loop that is repeated itself throughout history

1723
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,592
I think the negative Craven

1724
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:17,152
But manipulative jerk

1725
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:19,712
We learned something from this and that is that

1726
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:25,856
Alright you can control this Cult of Personality there's a limit

1727
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:31,488
Yeah really knuckle up and say whatever they want

1728
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:36,096
So maybe the next person will just be like that

1729
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:38,400
F*** it don't care don't give a s***

1730
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:39,680
Cuz that would retain

1731
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:40,960
The control over

1732
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,776
Whatever whatever amount of

1733
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,312
Influence you have

1734
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:49,664
Yeah there's two lessons I guess there's a good lesson don't do this again and then there's the

1735
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,432
The bad lesson

1736
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:51,968
Do it again the butt

1737
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:54,528
Never ever ever ever ever

1738
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,088
Not once

1739
01:20:57,344 --> 01:21:00,416
Yep so talk to this doctor

1740
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:02,976
PhD

1741
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:07,072
So he he talks a little bit about his going to this

1742
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:08,096
School Board

1743
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:08,864
Meeting in

1744
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,400
Yellow bunch of dumb s*** at them

1745
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:12,448
Becoming the

1746
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:15,520
The favored media Outlet of

1747
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:17,312
Weirdos now

1748
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:19,872
Because they are going to be on TV

1749
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:24,224
Maybe a lot of them have had their social media accounts

1750
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,528
Yeah so now they can videos

1751
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:28,832
Taking of them yelling at people

1752
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:30,112
At 2

1753
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:32,160
Public meetings

1754
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:33,184
Yep

1755
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,488
Now this is a new art form

1756
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:40,096
School boards are the new reality TV show

1757
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:42,400
Good way to get attention if you're really weird

1758
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:44,960
And so I went when we

1759
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:46,752
Get to any like actual points

1760
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:48,544
Sean wants to bring up

1761
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:52,384
Because of bad handle on some

1762
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,152
Decisions

1763
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:55,456
That have to do with covid regulations

1764
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,528
An Indiana University is another example

1765
01:21:58,784 --> 01:21:59,552
Over the summer

1766
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,088
Before summer

1767
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:06,464
They said everybody who works here and everybody who comes here has to be jabbed end of story

1768
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:12,096
Countless students and parents started to sue Indiana University

1769
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:15,424
Involved

1770
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:20,032
The judge sided with Indiana University and said they get to do what they want

1771
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:25,664
I could have that wrong but I think that's right it is to how that ended up settling out so

1772
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,456
Everybody who attends now

1773
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:33,856
Understand how this case went with Indiana University at all

1774
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:38,464
What happened was that 8 students at IU which is not a countless number

1775
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:44,352
They sued the school because they announced the vaccine mandate that applies only to the fall 2021 semester

1776
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:49,984
Zoe this is mandated the school offers many options for folks who can't or don't want to

1777
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:50,752
I get back Senaida

1778
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:53,312
They offer medical and religious exemption

1779
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:56,128
They'll let students take a semester off without penalty

1780
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,664
And they provide online option

1781
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:58,944
For completing classes

1782
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:02,528
These students have asked the court to enter a preliminary

1783
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,808
Action to stop the mandate

1784
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:05,088
The primary

1785
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:06,368
Syria that would be used

1786
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:09,696
Give that injunction is whether or not there is quote

1787
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:13,536
A strong showing that they will likely succeed on the merits of their claim

1788
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:16,608
That they will sustained irreparable harm

1789
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:21,984
And that the balance of harms and the public interest favor such a remedy

1790
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:28,896
The US District Court released a 101-page opinion explaining how they did not feel this case brought before them status

1791
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:32,224
Injunction was

1792
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:36,064
If you read the filing all but one of the Apes 2

1793
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,600
Either have a religious

1794
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:40,416
Exemption to the Mandate or would qualify

1795
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:46,816
But haven't even applied for washu or who hasn't replied

1796
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:47,584
Maybe she would

1797
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:50,144
My point is that this is kind of a farce

1798
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:56,032
The fact that seven of the eight students suing the university over a policy that is so Taylor to them

1799
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:59,104
Qualify for it not to affect them

1800
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:03,712
Is the very definition of right-wing victimhood mentality

1801
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:05,504
Problem I don't have

1802
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,576
My other point is that Sean Brooks has

1803
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:09,344
Annoyed

1804
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,392
Idea what this case was actually about because

1805
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:12,416
The details don't matter

1806
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:15,232
What's important is the Optics of victimhood that he's able

1807
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:16,256
Go to present using

1808
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:17,536
This case as a prop

1809
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:21,376
When you're trying to have a serious conversation about issues that matter

1810
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:25,728
It's generally not a great idea to bring up an example of a court case that you have such a week

1811
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:27,008
Grass pollen that you have to

1812
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,104
Admit on are that you might have it wrong while use that as a defense

1813
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,384
Answer why you're right don't do that

1814
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:33,408
That's a bad luck

1815
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:37,248
Alex is bringing up Amy Coney Barrett because after this injunction

1816
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:39,552
The students

1817
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:42,112
Pull up Mike Lindell and take things to the Supreme Court

1818
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:46,976
Has assigned to the seventh circuit currently which includes Indiana so on paper

1819
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:50,048
It was her who rejected the request two-stepping

1820
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:51,328
And overrule the district

1821
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:53,376
Court is not the relevant judge in the

1822
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:58,752
She was foodie right-wing media decided to get really mad at though since she was a trump appointee

1823
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:00,800
The presumption was that you would be up for any

1824
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:07,200
Why aren't you a rubber-stamp doing whatever and I thought you'd be up to be real weird

1825
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:09,760
Point Isabel of appointed you

1826
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:12,576
Was that you didn't know what you were doing

1827
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:14,880
And you do the dumb s*** we say

1828
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:19,232
How dare you act like you have any experience that was the deal

1829
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:21,280
I mean I am I get it

1830
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:26,400
Like I would be offended if I was on their team I wouldn't get I wouldn't understand it cuz

1831
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:28,448
Cuz when you get down to it right

1832
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:29,472
Okay

1833
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:30,752
She doesn't get to act like

1834
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,568
She's acting like she's on the Supreme Court

1835
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,360
Because she should be on the Supreme Court

1836
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:37,152
And she is not there

1837
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:38,944
Because she should be on the Supreme Court

1838
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,992
She should not be anywhere near the Supreme Court

1839
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:41,760
She's there

1840
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:42,784
To do this dump

1841
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:45,600
If I were them I would be furious

1842
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:48,672
How dare you act like you know what you're doing

1843
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:50,976
Let me text you probably does know what

1844
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:52,000
She's doing tuna

1845
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:54,560
Next

1846
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,888
Probably maybe not on the Supreme

1847
01:25:58,144 --> 01:26:01,984
Baby a little baby batting a little bit outside of

1848
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,824
What punching out of the weight class I believe Izzy

1849
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:09,408
Is a sheep part of the deal and if she doesn't get that she's wrong

1850
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,480
Like I understand I'm also pretty grateful that you

1851
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:13,248
She's wrong

1852
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:17,856
In the real world this is a great this is great news

1853
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:18,624
Scalp

1854
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:20,672
Who's listening to this Sean fella

1855
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:22,720
And I got a weird vibe on him

1856
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:25,536
You just made the hair on the back of my neck stand up

1857
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:27,328
Yeah you really did he was

1858
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,864
Freaking me out Hellboy

1859
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,680
Part of it was just like you see me

1860
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:32,704
Educational system

1861
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:37,312
Education you will get mad

1862
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:40,384
Mad in a different way than other people

1863
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:46,784
Tell your partner's a teacher and we've talked a lot of times about Consumer Cellular

1864
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:51,648
Absolutely passionate with it

1865
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:53,696
Public school systems that often

1866
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:55,488
Make things better

1867
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:57,280
I didn't get that

1868
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:59,584
From healthy that sounds kind of where I was

1869
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,632
I got an angry vibe from him

1870
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:04,448
This clip kind of made me laugh a lot

1871
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:06,240
We've always known

1872
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:08,800
Did the Rockefellers in the carnegies have had every

1873
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:09,568
Nothing to do with

1874
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:11,616
Xbox system

1875
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:13,152
No different in higher ed

1876
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:14,432
The exact same

1877
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,992
Control

1878
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,320
They control the minds of those individuals that don't see

1879
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:21,344
Think for themselves

1880
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:23,136
And again when I was in college

1881
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:27,232
Or the ones that I went to the bookstore to buy

1882
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:31,840
They were not the ones that the university said will you need to read this and you need to read that

1883
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:33,888
I look at this $300 text

1884
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:35,424
And say no

1885
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,448
I'm not reading that

1886
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:40,544
Glance through it I'd write a paper for the class and then that be

1887
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:43,616
Bookstores existed

1888
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,152
Goodbye

1889
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:46,688
234 bus

1890
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:50,528
History events psychology sociology

1891
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:55,136
Anatomy physiology and I would put all of this together and I read on my own time

1892
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:56,928
People have to self-educate

1893
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,232
So I understand that some people are

1894
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:00,256
Just too much of wreaths

1895
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:06,144
Thinkers for this kind of thing but the reason the classes have textbooks is because their teaching a specific thing

1896
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:09,216
But the teacher presumably is a much better awareness of them the student

1897
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:13,568
Typically the teacher will know about the subject ahead of time and the required text

1898
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:16,128
4 best

1899
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:17,152
Enabling

1900
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:18,688
Students get the handle on the material

1901
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:20,224
That's usually how this works

1902
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,528
I hate like the idea of Defending

1903
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:24,576
Pieces

1904
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:26,368
On education

1905
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:32,256
Informal question we ask this if everybody it's not even affect anything

1906
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:34,560
Did you ever read any of the books when you were in school

1907
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:37,120
No I read Robinson Caruso

1908
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:38,656
Surprised that discount goodbye

1909
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:41,216
I agree that there's problems

1910
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:45,056
The textbook industry particularly as it relates to Heather essentially an instrument

1911
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:45,824
The price gouging

1912
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:46,592
Colleges

1913
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:49,152
Expressing here really is

1914
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:52,224
Just that he's a blowhard and he's an authority

1915
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:55,296
I kind of guy whose streak has gone a little bit off the rail

1916
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:58,112
When I was in college off in the required text

1917
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:59,392
Four courses wouldn't be text

1918
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:00,416
Per se

1919
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:06,816
The class could be a novel in academic writing or possibly like a collection of photocopy newspaper articles from the Earth

1920
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:07,584
Early

1921
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,632
Book The Professor wrote

1922
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:13,216
Themselves sometimes yeah although I always a little suspicious

1923
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:18,080
Just about that that was a little bit like to come on by yourself dealer

1924
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:21,152
Only trying to sell his own s*** to the school that sucks

1925
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:23,456
But maybe there was good

1926
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:24,480
Oh now he's mad

1927
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:29,600
Also my dad's a professor and I've spent my entire life surrounded by Academia

1928
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:31,648
Never once in my life encounter to Professor

1929
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:34,208
Or teacher who is discouraged reading

1930
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:36,256
Parts on the syllabus

1931
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:40,608
Typically people in Academia love talking about their subject

1932
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,656
Cuz they're really worse than it and

1933
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:44,448
You know if you want to read a book that run

1934
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:47,520
Counter to their take on the subject they know a lot about

1935
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:49,312
They're going to be excited

1936
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:52,640
Discuss that book with you and explain to you why it misses

1937
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:57,760
X Y or Z point

1938
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:59,040
Already suggest

1939
01:29:59,296 --> 01:29:59,808
That you've spent

1940
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:03,904
Clearly a decade of your life focused only on this one kind of

1941
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:10,304
Subject of course you better want to f****** talk about it's your favorite academics might be

1942
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:13,632
Powermadd psychopath that are bent on making the big bucks and work

1943
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:14,656
Open the minds of the youth

1944
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:16,192
But they're nerds for

1945
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:18,752
Yeah before I would believe anything

1946
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:22,336
If you told me that they weren't interested in what they were talking about your ad say

1947
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:23,616
Ultimately

1948
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:25,920
I love this conception of like

1949
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:27,456
You know they they they

1950
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:28,480
Give you all these

1951
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:30,784
These are the indoctrinate you if you're not afraid

1952
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:31,552
Thinkery

1953
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:33,088
What in the textbooks

1954
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:35,648
Did the non freethinkers a remember

1955
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:38,464
Like what was it exactly

1956
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,256
From like history textbooks

1957
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,792
Science and math

1958
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:42,816
Victory was

1959
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:47,936
Retained by making it sound like I'm mad at a problem

1960
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:48,704
That doesn't exist

1961
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:54,336
Kind of now an end I will say that being mad at a problem that doesn't exist as a thing that

1962
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:55,872
I'm mad at

1963
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:56,896
A problem that doesn't

1964
01:30:58,176 --> 01:31:01,760
If you're the sort of person who so narcissistic and Oppositional Defiant that youth

1965
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:04,320
I think you can create a better syllabus than a professional

1966
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:05,600
A field of x

1967
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:06,368
40 East

1968
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:08,160
But maybe formal education isn't

1969
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:09,696
I'm at school

1970
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:10,720
That's totally fine

1971
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:15,584
People can be self-taught I believe that and I've got no disrespect for that it has degree

1972
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:21,216
Just that it's a lot harder for external observers to know exactly how well a person has or has not taught them

1973
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:25,568
Degrees are generally helpful because they did note that you learned a subject

1974
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:27,616
From someone who understands that subject

1975
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:29,920
And they were able to help you understand it

1976
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:31,200
There's no way to can

1977
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:33,760
For the same kind of thing with self-education

1978
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:35,296
That's why it's a little bit more

1979
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:36,320
It is

1980
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:41,184
Also it's so funny that this dude has such a weird bone to pick about education win

1981
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:42,720
He himself kind of

1982
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:44,256
Intentionally misrepresented

1983
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:45,024
His credentials

1984
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:47,328
In the video himself at the school board meeting

1985
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:48,352
That went viral

1986
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:51,424
You barely does have a Ph.D but himself to this

1987
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:52,448
Quote

1988
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:53,728
Dr. Sean Brooks

1989
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:55,264
PhD Oxford

1990
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:58,080
I have 48 Publications including 23 books

1991
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:04,480
Anatomy and physiology for approximately 21 years

1992
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,672
Book

1993
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:14,464
Like I said you didn't go to

1994
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:17,024
Oxford he's from Oxford Ohio

1995
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,328
A f****** is degrees from Walden University

1996
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:20,096
Justin online

1997
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:23,680
However there's more going on here than I would like

1998
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:25,728
There may be a reason that Sean is

1999
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:26,496
Is mad at the public

2000
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:27,264
Look school system

2001
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,544
But he's not disclosing

2002
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:29,824
Will does his pH

2003
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,616
If you give him any access to

2004
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:33,152
Teaching positions

2005
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:39,552
According to heavy they were able to track down a person with a PhD named Sean McCullough Brooks

2006
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:41,088
Oxford Ohio

2007
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:43,904
They were able to find a teacher discipline case from

2008
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:46,464
Florida that was against a person with the same name

2009
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:50,816
Which resulted in a reprimand and probation after Brooks didn't confess

2010
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:56,192
Didn't he was innocent but also agreed not to contest the accusations

2011
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:59,264
I'm not going to get too deep into this because it feels really f***** up but

2012
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,080
The issue that I was behind this disciplinary action

2013
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:04,896
Had to do with him posting videos of students discussing

2014
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:06,688
Really personal issues

2015
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:08,480
On a public website without the student

2016
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:09,248
Parent's permission

2017
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:11,040
Some of the stuff

2018
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:12,064
Involves like

2019
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,344
Pretty personal stuff

2020
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:14,880
Just

2021
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:15,648
Creeps me out

2022
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:17,440
I was concerned that this

2023
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:21,024
But possibly not the same dude who's here on Alex's show but

2024
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,816
First of all Shawn McCullough bruxism

2025
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:24,352
Pretty specific name

2026
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:25,376
Specific

2027
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:27,936
The documents for the teacher misconduct case

2028
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:31,520
Included 2015 letter of reprimand that's address to Shawn Brooks

2029
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:33,824
Whose address is in Oxford Ohio

2030
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:40,480
Any idea for Alex the screen is guest in the future so it doesn't end up in this kind of situation

2031
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:44,320
Where G7 devout for this guy just cuz his video went viral

2032
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:46,112
If you're talking to somebody about Heather

2033
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:47,392
The school system is evil

2034
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:48,160
Kind of

2035
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:50,208
Into the conversation to let your listeners know

2036
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:52,768
But they may have a big old chip on their shoulder

2037
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,304
Informing their positions

2038
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:59,168
It it might have to do with them being real weirdo so they were teachers

2039
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:03,776
It's not personal it's about protecting the

2040
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:14,528
Don't you understand that the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds won't let me post weird videos

2041
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:15,296
Yes

2042
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:18,368
Also what a weird thing whatever like

2043
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:21,696
Textbooks at-large held hostage by f***

2044
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:22,720
Texas Bowl

2045
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:24,000
You know what I'm saying like

2046
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,536
You're really going to come after 2

2047
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:26,816
Textbooks whenever a half

2048
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:29,120
Half of them just because Texas doesn't want to admit it

2049
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:31,424
Say that slaves came here on a lark

2050
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:32,960
Like what are you f******

2051
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:33,728
Talking about

2052
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:39,872
And there are very real issues

2053
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,408
What a dick

2054
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:44,736
So I feel like these kinds of disclosures are important

2055
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:46,272
Because they allow the audio

2056
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:47,808
Chance to assess the information that's

2057
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:48,832
To them

2058
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:51,136
In a responsible light because it is very relevant

2059
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:52,160
So

2060
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:53,952
You have things like this

2061
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:55,232
You can't you can't do this

2062
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:01,888
Institutions

2063
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:05,728
I've been writing about your speaking up

2064
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:11,616
He's complaining that he's been shut out of higher education

2065
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:12,384
And

2066
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,944
Maybe it has something to do with this disciplinary

2067
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,248
Stuff that he has

2068
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:20,064
Maybe his response to that just

2069
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:20,832
Plenary action

2070
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:23,648
I don't know it it's

2071
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:25,184
It seems like you can't

2072
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:29,024
You can't have someone be like I've been shut out of higher education

2073
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:30,048
Because

2074
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:32,864
My my ideas are to verboten or whatever

2075
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:35,936
And then you defended without knowing anything about the case

2076
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:36,960
Ripe

2077
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:37,728
Just it's

2078
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:41,312
It's not respectful to the individuality of the audio

2079
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:45,152
Information

2080
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:46,688
Nope

2081
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,760
So Alex

2082
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:52,064
You know he's covered on this episode

2083
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,344
Bill Maher

2084
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:58,208
And now he saw something else recovered on this episode

2085
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,232
3 people

2086
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:00,768
Talking about things

2087
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,328
But they know absolutely nothing about

2088
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:06,656
But have the expertise of being good at something

2089
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:09,472
Completely different and with no relation to that

2090
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:17,664
Alex decides he's going to cover something you saw on Tik-Tok

2091
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:18,432
Tik Tok video

2092
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:20,736
Somebody sent me a bunch of weird stuff.

2093
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:26,368
Brian Williams who says he was shot down the helicopter

2094
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:31,744
Nobody was shot at Noel driver got shot at it's a lie

2095
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:34,304
Brian Williams

2096
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:37,632
That's not true he didn't say that his helicopter was shot down

2097
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:43,008
That was shot at

2098
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:47,616
Alex is lying about the LIE

2099
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:52,992
A convicted pedofile run your preschool

2100
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:56,064
Adios equivalent

2101
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,856
He brings up Sandy Hook

2102
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:00,160
All we talk about Sandy Hook

2103
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,208
15 *

2104
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,512
7/8 years ago the internet questions

2105
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:11,680
Set the mass shooting

2106
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:13,472
Was Smollett

2107
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,544
What is your name

2108
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:19,360
Did they fake babies in incubators to start the Iraq War

2109
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:22,432
Did you get John Cena

2110
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:23,968
Show footage of the Knob Creek

2111
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:25,760
Machine gun shoot

2112
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,368
People blowing up villages in Syria

2113
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:32,928
Question tag

2114
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:35,232
Free speech

2115
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:36,768
Not on purpose

2116
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,304
Unlike Brian Williams

2117
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:44,704
No but you have said that you have prophetic dreams

2118
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:49,056
Sears Automotive things are equally embarrassed

2119
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:55,456
He's had a paper a lot of abortions he slept with over hundreds of women by the time I'm 17

2120
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:58,272
Yeah yeah he's made a lot of claims that maybe I wouldn't

2121
01:37:58,528 --> 01:37:59,040
Want to

2122
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,344
Yeah

2123
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:05,696
Even if all of those things

2124
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:08,000
Accurate

2125
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:10,304
Babies in incubators jussie Smollett

2126
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,072
Sure all of it

2127
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:12,096
Even if everything

2128
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:14,400
It still doesn't excuse his behavior at the lights

2129
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:17,472
Said he has literally nothing to do with what he

2130
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:20,288
Yeah

2131
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:22,080
I guess he's just laying out f*** that one up

2132
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:24,640
Which is actually an evolution in his position

2133
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:26,688
I mean it's about as close to just

2134
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:27,712
Straight up saying

2135
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:30,016
I am sorry for being wrong

2136
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:31,296
As I think we forgot

2137
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:32,832
From him

2138
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:38,720
There is still application they're still trying to deflect

2139
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:40,256
It is a little bit more like

2140
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:44,864
I did that bad I mean to do it a lot I only talked about a few times

2141
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:49,472
Dip my toe in there I only did all this stuff you know what there's other things that

2142
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:51,776
But sometimes I did f*** I only paid

2143
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:55,616
4/2 of damper dondi's flight to hold a newton

2144
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:58,432
Dutch on it is all good

2145
01:38:58,688 --> 01:38:59,712
When's in buddy cowboy

2146
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:01,760
This is great here we go

2147
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:03,808
It's always there when Alex plays this

2148
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:07,904
The studio

2149
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:09,440
Is

2150
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:10,208
So

2151
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:10,976
Good

2152
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:11,744
Okay

2153
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:13,024
Soen

2154
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,048
Is going to say

2155
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:14,816
Hey man

2156
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:16,864
Listening to that Brian Williams clip

2157
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:17,632
I heard six

2158
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:18,400
Lies

2159
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:20,448
Alex makes

2160
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:21,472
Huge mistake

2161
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:22,240
He's like

2162
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:23,264
What are they

2163
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,544
No

2164
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,568
I think I counted just

2165
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:26,592
5 or 6

2166
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:27,616
Layton

2167
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:28,384
Lies

2168
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:29,664
Brian Williams

2169
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:31,200
Live

2170
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:32,480
Can you imagine

2171
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:38,880
Sometimes the crew will sit there and and you know you'll go on a great ran or something wrong

2172
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:44,000
Imagine the crew behind Brian Williams like wild

2173
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:48,096
Nobody's business to imagine approved

2174
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:48,864
Could do that

2175
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:51,168
Why the whole world

2176
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:54,240
I don't even mean

2177
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:57,056
Everything he said pretty much was a complete lie

2178
01:39:58,336 --> 01:39:58,848
Oops

2179
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:00,640
Shouldn't shouldn't attack again

2180
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:02,176
Specific

2181
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:07,808
Hey come on man you're ruining the scene the scene as we just make s*** up what are you having

2182
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:10,624
The game we were playing in

2183
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,696
Imagine if we were able to get away with that

2184
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:16,000
Course I didn't know what lies

2185
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:20,864
It's just a general feeling of things to tell me what's up with the lies where

2186
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:23,168
Listening

2187
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:23,936
Everything

2188
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:26,496
That's all I everything is alive

2189
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:27,520
Go to antibiotic

2190
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:32,384
Just want to know how jail was

2191
01:40:32,896 --> 01:40:34,688
Minoan

2192
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:36,736
You were giving some rules not

2193
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:38,016
To talk with other

2194
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:42,368
What happened I don't know how they do that when you were talk show hosts

2195
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:44,416
Talk show host

2196
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:47,744
Body cameras on video

2197
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,048
Usher weird about

2198
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:52,352
What happened on January 6th killing our

2199
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:53,632
Story straight hair

2200
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:56,960
But I want to know how jail went yesterday and

2201
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:03,616
Honestly Alex keep saying to like everything is on body Cam and that's actually evidence

2202
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:04,896
Against

2203
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:05,664
Cuz

2204
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:06,688
The problem was

2205
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:07,712
He was

2206
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:09,504
Breaking his is

2207
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:10,784
Prior agreement

2208
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:13,088
Is that his deferred prosecution

2209
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:15,392
I mean maybe he's just saying that like

2210
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:20,000
We know there's a guaranteed guilty verdict so we don't really need to even talk about the case because

2211
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:21,792
Cuz he did that s*** it's all our body

2212
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:24,608
That could be an interpretation

2213
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:27,168
This is all

2214
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:29,216
This is 100%

2215
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:32,544
We just before we recorded this

2216
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:33,568
I'm not sure if it will

2217
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:35,360
When it'll be out

2218
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:40,480
Guest appearance on opening arguments

2219
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:42,016
Case of the nature of idiots

2220
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:43,808
Not a big charge

2221
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,088
Even if Owen word

2222
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:51,488
He found guilty community service it'll be something minor in a fight

2223
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:53,536
Fine it's not a big deal

2224
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:58,656
But Owens trying to raise a quarter of a million dollars for the dreidel.

2225
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:01,216
Obviously you're trying to raise a quarter million dollars for

2226
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,056
If we find it we are fighting it

2227
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:07,872
You did not break in the capital using physical Force

2228
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:09,408
He's been charged

2229
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:12,224
Urine present when I can let that happen

2230
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:15,552
Dollar Tree Legal defense fund

2231
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:18,112
Great want to get under 50000

2232
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:28,864
An open-and-shut and now you've been charged based on a lie

2233
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:31,168
You should know you don't want to do them

2234
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:39,872
Well and we may look into other lawsuits going forward when when some of the smoke starts to clear but yeah

2235
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:41,920
We have an executive order here

2236
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:43,456
Governor Abbott

2237
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:46,784
It says you cannot mandate masks in any public building

2238
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:49,600
And when I was in the Federal Building yesterday

2239
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:51,904
I couldn't go in without putting a mask on

2240
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,184
He was being

2241
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:56,000
Arraigned and processed yet where I'm asking you

2242
01:42:56,512 --> 01:42:57,280
This is the realest

2243
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:59,840
I thought it was cuz they were showing Eric

2244
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:01,376
Adults movie in the courtroom

2245
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:02,912
That would be offensive

2246
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:07,008
Tia Alex is lying was charged

2247
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:08,288
Because of the

2248
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:10,080
Of a Huffington Post article

2249
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:11,872
Is charged

2250
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:15,456
Actually I think that might be Alex

2251
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:21,856
Maligning The Huffington Post

2252
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:28,256
Anything to do with Owen making that deferred prosecution agreement

2253
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:30,048
To do community service The Huffington Post

2254
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:30,816
It would show up in

2255
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:31,840
Slapping and break

2256
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:33,120
His foot so we couldn't do any

2257
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:40,544
Screw the human personification of The Huffington Post Arianna Huffington

2258
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:41,312
Bushes

2259
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:45,920
Blow dart in Des Moines with sleep.

2260
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:55,136
Anyway

2261
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:57,440
Is our last pipe and it's just to show how like

2262
01:43:58,208 --> 01:43:59,232
Tough Alex's

2263
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:00,768
3 strong

2264
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:02,304
That's what I think of

2265
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:05,632
Fivefold from the three years ago in Blue City

2266
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:09,472
I'm a tough guy

2267
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:11,776
I will not go downtown now

2268
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:14,080
Unless I have to add a meeting and I bring a bodyguard

2269
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:16,128
It is literally

2270
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:17,920
Like a lunatic asylum.

2271
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:18,944
That's amazing

2272
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:20,224
Soto

2273
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:22,272
Fivefold increase

2274
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:24,576
Crime in blue cities is amazing first of all

2275
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:25,856
Sure

2276
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:27,904
I don't know where that's at, probably like him

2277
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:28,928
To substantiate that

2278
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:29,696
Second

2279
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:32,000
I've been to Austin my parents live

2280
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:35,072
Fairly close to downtown Austin

2281
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:37,376
Only safe place

2282
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:40,448
Like a safe or unsafe or whatever but like

2283
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:43,776
Is the idea of needing a bodyguard to go downtown

2284
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:44,800
Is absurd

2285
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:48,896
Except for the fact that Alex has a celebrity

2286
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:49,920
If your

2287
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:52,480
I don't know somebody who's just like

2288
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:54,784
Who's who plays

2289
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:55,552
Superman

2290
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:57,344
Henry Cavill

2291
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:03,744
He needs a bodyguard

2292
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:09,376
20 year old be Millennials until you know how the rise and fall of beam came with

2293
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:10,656
Can you do nothing

2294
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:11,424
Pavel

2295
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:12,448
Needs a bodyguard

2296
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:17,312
Not because any place may or may not be safe because he's a celebrity and people

2297
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:19,104
What a bum rush

2298
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:19,872
Right

2299
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:22,432
When I went to see a

2300
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:23,456
Cavaliers

2301
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:24,480
Lakers game

2302
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:25,760
When I was like

2303
01:45:26,016 --> 01:45:28,320
15mm game

2304
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:29,600
Aqua shooting

2305
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:30,368
Free throws

2306
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:36,256
Pregame

2307
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:37,280
Of course

2308
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:39,584
It's because he's a fan

2309
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:43,168
Atmos not because Austin is such an

2310
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:43,936
Unsafe play

2311
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:45,984
And even then you don't

2312
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:46,752
I mean like

2313
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:48,288
If you need a bodyguard

2314
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,336
Bodyguard

2315
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:53,408
Then you probably earned that

2316
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:56,736
You know I'm saying like Henry Cavill may have a

2317
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:59,296
What would be more like a bouncer of just like

2318
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:03,648
Hey man I know there's just so many people that want to get up to him at the same time

2319
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:05,696
We just need an orderly line

2320
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:07,488
But if you need somebody who's got a

2321
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:08,256
Gun

2322
01:46:08,512 --> 01:46:11,072
And it's just like hey man if anybody comes at you I'm going to shoot them

2323
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:12,608
That's because you're an ass

2324
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:15,936
The Alex has a team on the roof

2325
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:17,216
He's got ninjas

2326
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:24,384
If you're if you're if you're a politician walking around with a f******

2327
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:27,456
Bulletproof vest on it probably

2328
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:28,480
Because you have it coming

2329
01:46:29,248 --> 01:46:31,040
Or at least you've done something to earn

2330
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:33,088
I don't know

2331
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,416
Bite my feeling is just that it's

2332
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:37,696
It's a little silly

2333
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:40,000
Sorry we come to the end of this and

2334
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:40,768
I think

2335
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:44,352
Owen is a political prisoner who's able to make

2336
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:45,376
Tons of money

2337
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:47,424
Misdemeanor

2338
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:48,448
Nonsense

2339
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:49,984
Unreal

2340
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:52,544
Misdemeanor Budd Lake

2341
01:46:53,312 --> 01:46:54,080
In trouble

2342
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:54,848
Tons of money

2343
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:57,152
Quarter of a million

2344
01:46:57,408 --> 01:46:58,688
Sense of what it means to be a freedom

2345
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:00,736
You know it's really important

2346
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:02,016
He's doing the big work

2347
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:05,344
What meanwhile

2348
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,112
Alex

2349
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:08,928
Is back in studio anchoring this s***

2350
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:12,000
The real serious work of talking about

2351
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:15,072
Belmar Belmar

2352
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:17,632
Talking to a weirdo about education

2353
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:21,728
Yeah cuz we had a viral video I was just very cool it's why you got to get him out there

2354
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:23,008
And then

2355
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:25,568
Bickering about whether or not he thinks

2356
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:28,640
Dumbass in whether or not the media covered it correctly

2357
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:31,200
Who was in that meeting

2358
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:32,224
Everything is pointless

2359
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:35,296
That meeting there had to have been a meeting

2360
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:36,064
Where

2361
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,600
After Shroyer

2362
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:41,440
Turn himself in and probably be on Sunday before Schroeder tour

2363
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:42,720
Before Shroyer turned

2364
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:44,768
And it's Alex

2365
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:45,792
